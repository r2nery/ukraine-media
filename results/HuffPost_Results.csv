Timothy Griffin, who had been fighting with the International Legion of Defense of Ukraine, was “part in the counteroffensive on the eastern front with his unit and was killed in action,” the organization said, according to CNN. The legion said it has notified Griffin’s family and will return his body to the U.S. Griffin is at least the sixth American killed in Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s invasion. The International Legion of Defense of Ukraine enlists volunteers from around the world who have combat experience, know how to use weapons and are able to join the fight immediately, according to its website. Last month, Dane Partridge, an ex-U.S. Army infantryman who had volunteered in the Ukrainian military, was killed after being attacked in Luhansk. The State Department has urged Americans to avoid traveling to Ukraine because of the war. “U.S. citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately if it is safe to do so using any commercial or other privately available ground transportation options,” a State Department spokesperson told NBC News. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, made a surprise visit to Kyiv, where she told CNN the U.S. will continue to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia. “Our support is unwavering, and we will continue to be unified until Ukraine wins this war and Russia takes their troops out of Ukraine,” Thomas-Greenfield said. In the latest phase of the war, Russia has been attacking Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, leaving millions without power in an effort to put pressure on everyday Ukrainians. State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Monday took questions from reporters on whether the Biden administration is encouraging peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. Price said that is up to Ukraine, and the U.S. along with its international partners has continued to support the country “so that when that negotiating table develops, Ukraine will be in the strongest possible position.” Price added that Russia would have to show good faith and stop attacking civilian infrastructure. “It is neither our place for us to pressure the Ukrainians, nor would we need to do such a thing,” Price told reporters. “They have every incentive. It is the Russians that are sending a very different signal.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,3

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on Thursday vowed to nix American funding for Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s invasion if the GOP retakes Congress in next week’s midterm elections. “The only border they care about is Ukraine, not America’s southern border,” Greene said of Democrats at a rally in Iowa. “Under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine. Our country comes first. They don’t care about our border or our people.” Greene’s pledge was met with cheers from the audience. ""Under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine"" -- Marjorie Taylor Greene  Outgoing Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) slammed Greene’s comment as being “exactly” what Russian President Vladimir Putin wants. “If we’d had Republicans like this in the 1980s, we would have lost the Cold War,” Cheney wrote on Twitter. This is exactly what Putin wants. If we’d had Republicans like this in the 1980s, we would have lost the Cold War.  The GOP is currently split over whether to continue financially assisting Ukraine against the invasion, which Putin launched in February. The U.S. has so far donated more than $67 billion to the Ukrainian cause. But this week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suggested U.S. pursestrings for the defense will be significantly tightened if his party wins control of the House and Senate. “I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,” McCarthy said. “They just won’t do it.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,20

Russia called a meeting of the U.N. Security Council with a previously debunked claim that the U.S. is sponsoring Ukraine labs developing illegal “military biological” warfare, according to The Associated Press. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield declared the meeting “a colossal waste of time.” “I am glad this council has the chance to see Russia’s disinformation campaign for what it is — an attempt to distract from the atrocities Russian forces are carrying out in Ukraine and a desperate tactic to justify an unjustifiable war,” Thomas-Greenfield said. Russia’s assertions have been disputed by both Ukrainian and U.S. officials, as well as by independent scientists. Russia has been advocating for a Security Council investigation into its allegations. “Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “The United States does not have a biological weapons program. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States.” Ukraine does operate biological labs and some have received U.S. funding under a program to lessen the possibility of deadly outbreaks, according to AP. Their activity is neither illegal nor secret, and the U.S. plays no part in operating them. Thomas-Greenfield added Ukraine has no incentive to use deadly pathogens because of the risk to itself. “Such species, even if they could be weaponized, would pose as much a threat to the European continent and to Ukraine itself as they would to any other country,” she said. Barbara Woodward, the U.K. ambassador to the U.N., supported Thomas-Greenfield, referencing Russia’s false claim that Ukraine was preparing to detonate a “dirty bomb,” to spread radiological waste. “How much more of this nonsense do we have to endure?” Woodward asked. U.S., U.K. and French officials have warned that Russia may be using the false dirty bomb allegation as an excuse to intensify the conflict, according to The New York Times. President Joe Biden has dismissed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claim this week that he won’t use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. “If he has no intention, why does he keep talking about it?” Biden asked during an interview with NewsNation. “He’s been very dangerous in how he’s approached this.” ""If he has no intention, why does he keep talking about it?""

DC Marijuana Justice activists displayed a 51-foot inflatable joint with the messages “Free Griner and the Russians from Putin” and “Free 420 Prisoners” during a “smoke out” protest that began at 4:20 p.m., according to People. “We feel compelled to protest the Russian Federation and President Putin, who’s clearly using an American citizen as a pawn in his war against Ukraine,” Adam Eidinger, co-founder of DC Marijuana Justice, told The Washington Post. “It’s time for the public to rise up and defend Brittney Griner,” Eidinger continued. “If we’re going to fight for prisoners to be released in the United States, we need to fight for them to be released everywhere, internationally.” Griner, a Phoenix Mercury player, has been detained in Russia since February, when police discovered cannabis oil in her luggage.

His remarks came hours after a Moscow court upheld Griner’s sentence, which Russian authorities handed down in August. “So far, we have not been meeting with much positive response, but we’re not stopping,” Biden promised. The two-time Olympic gold medalist, who was on her way to play with the Russian Premier League during the WNBA offseason, was first detained at a Russian airport in February after authorities found cartridges containing less than a gram of hashish oil in her luggage. Griner was detained amid high tensions between Russia and the U.S., which has strongly opposed the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine and sanctioned Russia for its actions there. Russia took Griner into custody one week before launching its invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration has faced immense pressure to bring home Griner, whose supporters say she is being used as a political pawn amid Russia’s diplomatic friction with the U.S. In July, Biden approved a potential prisoner exchange to bring the basketball star and other prisoners home, but negotiations fell through when Russia demanded that the trade include a convicted Russian assassin. Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, said earlier this month she was hopeful a prisoner exchange would work out before Tuesday’s hearing so her wife could avoid being sent to a labor camp. “My brain can’t even fathom it,” she told “CBS Mornings,” adding: “I don’t know if she has anything left in her tank to continue to wake up every day and be in a place where she has no one.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,0
2022-10-25,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ukraine-progressives-letter-jayapal_n_63581668e4b03e8038e3db40,How A Progressive Bid To Shape Ukraine Policy Imploded,"A group of progressive lawmakers withdrew a high-profile letter intended to influence President Joe Biden’s Ukraine policy on Tuesday, just a day after it was sent to the White House. The story behind the letter, which 30 House Democrats signed, is one of mismanagement by leadership, an alleged staff error and a failure to appreciate the sensitivities of discussing a brutal ongoing war. Multiple legislators were so surprised by the letter’s release — and the ensuing criticism — that they publicly rejected the document and said it was supposed to be sent much earlier under different circumstances. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) ultimately agreed with them. In a statement Tuesday, she blamed her employees for releasing the letter and retracted it. “The letter was drafted several months ago but, unfortunately, was released by staff without vetting. As chair of the Caucus, I accept responsibility for this,” Jayapal said. “Every war ends with diplomacy, and this one will too, after Ukrainian victory. The letter sent yesterday, although restating that basic principle, has been conflated with GOP opposition to support for the Ukrainians’ just defense of their national sovereignty. As such, it is a distraction at this time, and we withdraw the letter.” Jayapal had personally approved the letter’s publication on Monday, a source familiar with the situation told Politico. The timeline of the kerfuffle reflects how the left is still struggling to offer an effective message on foreign policy despite its years-long focus on reforming America’s approach to global affairs and progressives’ success in shaping some major national security debates. On Monday afternoon, The Washington Post published the letter that the group sent Biden. Led by Jayapal, they asked the president to “pair the military and economic support the United States has provided to Ukraine with a proactive diplomatic push, redoubling efforts to seek a realistic framework for a ceasefire.” The letter faced immediate backlash online, as fellow legislators, analysts and liberal commentators accused the progressives of being naive at best, or worse, willing to reward Russian President Vladimir Putin for his vicious invasion of Ukraine. By Monday evening, Jayapal clarified, saying the letter did not propose a change in American support for Ukraine and the progressives did not seek to break with the Biden administration’s policy. “We are united as Democrats,” Jayapal wrote. But her colleagues suggested otherwise. Moderate Democrat Rep. Jake Auchincloss (Mass.) accused the progressives of offering “an olive branch to a war criminal who’s losing his war.” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who frequently champions a less hawkish U.S. posture internationally, warned of “moral and strategic peril in sitting down with Putin too early.” Speaking to Politico, an anonymous member of House Democratic leadership said: “That bone-headed letter just put Dems in the same league as [Republican leader Rep.] Kevin McCarthy, who said ... Ukraine funding could be in jeopardy.” By Tuesday, letter signatories Reps. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) had all posted tweets questioning the timing of the letter’s release — with Jacobs saying she “wouldn’t sign it today.” To understand how the progressive gambit imploded, HuffPost spoke with five sources familiar with the letter and Ukraine policy discussions among Democrats and reviewed a previous draft of the message. The overall picture: Thanks to a messy process and a misreading of the broader conversation about the war, a relatively anodyne statement became a firebomb that divided the caucus and could threaten leadership ambitions for Jayapal and other signatories. The timing of the letter’s development and release was odd. Jayapal’s team circulated the message to lawmakers in the summer when Russian forces seemed to have the upper hand in Ukraine. “We urge President Biden to seek a rapid end to the conflict as a chief priority, all while continuing to respect Ukraine’s sovereign decisions,” read a pitch email seen by HuffPost. The message directed members of Congress and their staff to seek further information about the plan from Keane Bhatt, the policy director for the Congressional Progressive Caucus. (Bhatt declined to comment for this story.) Lawmakers began signing on as early as June 30, Jacobs tweeted. A number of progressives signed in July because of concern over Putin’s nuclear threats, according to Pocan. A House Democratic aide whose boss signed the message on July 20 said they expected the letter would be released soon afterward. “It was supposed to go out Aug. 1. My guess is they just held it open trying to get as many people,” the aide told HuffPost. Come September, Jayapal’s office was still trying to secure more signatures, with discussions continuing late into the month, according to a source. Jayapal’s team kept the letter largely the same, according to HuffPost’s review of the earlier and final drafts, only adding a condemnation of Russia’s claim to annex Ukrainian territory. By the time the letter came out, Ukrainian troops had reclaimed territory in several strategic areas in the eastern part of the country. Meanwhile, Russia appeared to be growing desperate, resorting to missile attacks on major civilian areas designed to knock out power and water systems and starve Ukrainians. Several signatories said on Tuesday they weren’t given a heads up on when the letter would be released. Jayapal’s team did not appear to expect a backlash, the aide told HuffPost, saying that had they done so, they would likely have given signatories talking points to rebut potential attacks. “We had no idea it came out until the maelstrom on Twitter,” the aide added. One Democratic source familiar with the letter said the organizers had waited to get about 30 members on board and “didn’t consider election timing.” Coming two weeks before the vote, the letter was especially alarming for Democrats in Republican-leaning districts who fear being seen as too dovish, a senior House Democrat told CNN. A striking element of the controversy is that most of the actual letter is not particularly striking. It promotes the U.S.’s overall position that Ukraine deserves support, that Russia has behaved horrifically and that ending the war is vital to protect Ukrainians, prevent escalation and ease the global economic shock it has produced. Instead of highlighting that reality, some Democrats quickly accepted and echoed criticisms of the message, equating it to Republicans’ growing skepticism towards Ukraine and sympathy for Putin’s war narrative. McCarthy, who will be the speaker of the House come January if Republicans capture the chamber in next month’s midterm elections, last week said his colleagues are wary of giving “a blank check to Ukraine.” For months, conservatives like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and GOP Senate hopeful J.D. Vance have loudly questioned Washington’s backing of Kyiv. Right-wing commentators Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens have argued that Russia invaded its neighbor to defend itself. The progressives’ message squarely blamed Putin for the war and subsequent human suffering and did not suggest ending U.S. aid to Ukraine. It also noted: “It is not America’s place to pressure Ukraine’s government regarding sovereign decisions.” In withdrawing the letter on Tuesday, Jayapal said: “Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican Leader McCarthy… The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance that Democrats, who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of the military, strategic, and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people, are somehow aligned with Republicans who seek to pull the plug on American support for President Zelensky and the Ukrainian forces.” Democrats could have tried to nip that perception in the bud — and upheld a clear progressive position on Ukraine, defying fringe activists who call the party pro-war and pundits who cast liberals as soft. “The framing around the letter from The Washington Post and the subsequent discussion on Twitter frame the letter as progressives calling for appeasement and giving in to Putin and Russia, but if you actually read the letter, it doesn’t do that,” the House Democratic aide argued. “People don’t seem to think that you can hold both positions of arming Ukraine and supporting their sovereignty and pushing for a diplomatic offramp.” Given the reflexively hawkish nature of Washington’s national security discourse, progressives always face an uphill battle in championing diplomacy. This time, in making a major statement on the most significant issue in global politics, they were unprepared — and the setback has likely damaged their credibility and unity in a lasting way.

McCarthy, speaking to Punchbowl News, acknowledged the significance of the conflict, but said Americans are dealing with economic problems at home and can’t afford to prioritize helping Ukraine. “I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,” McCarthy said. “They just won’t do it.” The U.S. has spent vast sums to help Ukraine resist Russia’s invasion. The Department of Defense on Friday announced an additional $725 million package to Ukraine. Congress last month granted $12.3 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine. That is on top of the $54 billion the U.S. sent to the country in previous packages, according to The New York Times. Only 10 House Republicans voted to support the bill. McCarthy in the past has blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin, comparing him to brutal dictators like Adolf Hitler, according to Punchbowl’s Jake Sherman. But a strong faction of House Republicans support an “America First” agenda backed by former President Donald Trump. Last month, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) told Politico the GOP would demand a breakdown of how any additional U.S. aid will be used in Ukraine if his party wins control of the House. He condemned fellow Republicans for using “defense as an excuse to spend all manners of money.” “Count me against throwing more money at Ukraine without having a serious conversation about guns and butter, a serious conversation about why we’re spending it and how it’s in our national security interest,” Roy said. Meanwhile, Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) told Axios his constituents say the Ukraine war feels like a distant issue. “When people are seeing a 13% increase in grocery prices; energy, utility bills doubling ... if you’re a border community and you’re being overrun by migrants and fentanyl, Ukraine is the furthest thing from your mind,” Armstrong said. In the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has continued to express support for Ukraine. But some GOP Senate nominees in the midterm elections have signaled they do not share McConnell’s resolve. J.D. Vance, the Trump-endorsed nominee in Ohio, said there needs to be an end to “the money spigot to Ukraine eventually.” “We cannot fund a long-term military conflict that I think ultimately has diminishing returns for our own country,” Vance told the ABC affiliate in Toledo last month, according to The Washington Post. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) on Tuesday said a Republican majority doesn’t mean the U.S. will abandon Ukraine, but he told Bloomberg the GOP would be cautious. “I think he’s just saying we’re not going to write a blank check without oversight and accountability, which my committee will be providing,” McCaul said. The White House responded to McCarthy’s comments by saying the administration was committed to working with Congress to assist Ukraine “as long as it takes.” “We’re going to closely monitor these discussions,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “I don’t want to get ahead of what Congress might look like next year. I don’t want to go into hypotheticals.” Republicans are favored to win the House, according to polling aggregation site Five Thirty Eight, while Democrats hold a slight advantage in holding control of the Senate.",3.9034690218861834,5.218109300081786,-1.3146402781956028,11

But as temperatures drop heading into winter, the risk of a radiation accident is rising, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company told HuffPost on Tuesday. As fighting intensified last month, operators powered down the last of the plant’s six reactors lest another electrical outage jeopardize the cooling systems needed to keep the scorching-hot radioactive material from melting down even when the reactor is idle. “It was the safest nuclear power plant in Ukraine, and now it is the most dangerous nuclear power plant in the whole world,” said Petro Kotin, president of Ukrainian state-owned nuclear plant operator Energoatom. He spent most of his career working at Zaporizhzhia. But Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-owned nuclear plant operator, wants to restart at least one of the reactors. A Russian bombing blitz over the last week destroyed 30% of Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure, spurring widespread blackouts. And the neighboring towns where Zaporizhzhia’s workers live have no other source of warmth in the winter besides a district heating system hooked up to the power plant. Restarting a reactor is also a matter of safety at the plant. There’s a limited amount of diesel to run the generators that provide the last-resort power to keep the plant’s cooling system running — running heaters to keep the storage tanks containing refueling water would only drain the supply sooner. “Even before we de-occupy the plant, because of the decrease in temperature, we need just to start this one unit to supply steam for heating purposes of the plant itself,” Kotin said dressed in dark green military fatigues as he spoke to HuffPost for 80 minutes over Microsoft Teams from his office in Kyiv, roughly 400 miles northwest of Zaporizhzhia. Then there are the fish. Zaporizhzhia collects water for its cooling system from an outdoor pond, which operators stocked with an imported fish species to eat algae that could otherwise gum up the reactor turbines. A running reactor expels warm water into the pond, keeping temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit at all times — and, by extension, keeping the Egyptian fish alive. With no reactors running, water temperatures would eventually drop below 50 degrees, Kotin said. “All the fish will be killed by this cold temperature,” said Kotin. After that, the plant would have up to 2,000 tons of dead fish to deal with. “It’s getting cold,” Kotin said. “And some problems arise there, with the functionality of the plant, with the fish that help keep the pond good, and with the condition of people living in the neighboring town, where the heat is all generated by the plant.” Four high-voltage cables link Zaporizhzhia to the Ukrainian grid, while another low-voltage backup line runs to a nearby coal-fired power plant. Artillery fire repeatedly severed those connections as Ukrainians and Russians blamed each other for indiscriminate shelling, disrupting the plant’s operations at least 15 times since the occupation began in March. But on Aug. 25, the station was cut off from outside power sources for the first time, forcing its operators to rely on Zaporizhzhia’s 20 diesel generators to keep electricity flowing to the cooling systems. After more than three hours without electricity, Kotin said, a partial meltdown akin to what happened in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011 would likely begin. Engineers restored the low-voltage line in less than a day and eventually reconnected the plant to the grid. But bombardments have destroyed substations and power lines at least twice more since then, according to Kotin. Meanwhile, he said, the coal plant no longer has fuel. And Russian artillery destroyed one of the lines connecting Zaporizhzhia to Ukraine’s grid as recently as Monday, leaving the plant dependent on the diesel generators. The facility typically only stores enough diesel to run the generators for 10 days. To preserve fuel, plant operators started running no more than seven generators at a time, which could conserve enough fuel to keep the power on for up to 17 days, Kotin said. Russian and Ukrainian officials allowed shipments of diesel fuel last week that could give Zaporizhzhia another two full days of generator use. But Kotin saw the rare moment of cooperation as a sign the Russians were “prepared to continue this practice” of cutting the plant off from the power grid. It’s part of what Ukrainian officials say is a strategy to steal Zaporizhzhia permanently, a power plant worth $30 billion and whose eponymous home province Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed into Russia late last month. The Ukrainian government believes Russian plans to cut Zaporizhzhia off from the Ukrainian grid and connect the plant to the power system in Crimea, the Ukrainian province Russia conquered in 2014. But doing so would require building huge towers and power lines running over the very Crimean bridge that exploded earlier this month, George Moore, scientist-in-residence at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, told Grid. Plus, Russians would need a small army of new nuclear engineers and scientists to run the facility. “They don’t have the people to operate that plant,” Moore told the news website, warning it would take thousands of workers to restaff the facility. This month, Russian officials threatened to fire Energoatom employees who don’t sign new contracts to work for Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned nuclear operator. Losing their jobs would likely make the workers eligible for the Russian military draft. Senior employees at the plant, meanwhile, have faced kidnappings, beatings, and alleged torture, and at least two workers have been killed by Russian forces. “It’s getting cold. And some problems arise there, with the functionality of the plant, with the fish that help keep the pond good, and with the condition of people living in the neighboring town, where the heat is all generated by the plant.” An International Atomic Energy Agency team arrived in late August at Zaporizhzhia to monitor the situation. Since then, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog has been negotiating to create a demilitarized zone around the plant. So far, the Russians have refused to pull back as they stepped up targeted strikes in recent weeks on vital civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. Instead, Russians have stationed 50 military vehicles and at least 500 troops at the facility, Kotin said, including a contingent of Chechen soldiers loyal to Chechnya’s regional strongman, Ramzan Kadyrov. A close adviser to Putin, Kadyrov has publicly encouraged the Kremlin to use a small-scale tactical atomic weapon against Ukraine. The threats of the first wartime nuclear attack since 1945 and the worst atomic power plant accident since Fukushima have, ironically, come at just the moment when nuclear energy looks poised to reverse decades of decline and make a comeback. Fission reactors produce 24/7 bounties of electricity like fossil fuels, without climate-changing emissions or reliance on constantly-supplied pipelines. Since Russia cut off gas exports to Ukraine’s allies, countries like the Netherlands and Sweden have vowed to build new reactors. Japan and the U.S. are looking to restart shuttered plants, and even anti-nuclear Germany is postponing plans to close its last three generating stations. Energoatom is hoping to build as many as nine new reactors in the years ahead, ideally, with American or European technology, Kotin said. In July, Ukraine began the process to license U.S. nuclear giant Westinghouse’s AP-1000 reactors, the large-scale machines set to debut soon at Georgia’s Plant Vogtle after years of delays and billion-dollar cost overruns. The U.S., Kotin said, needs to get past the problems with constructing the first major AP-1000 project and build more reactors. But he admitted that the fate of a global nuclear power resurgence might rest in the hands of Zaporizhzhia’s Ukrainian engineers. “The renaissance of civilian nuclear power would not survive this additional disaster, which could happen at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” Kotin said. “So we need to do everything just to bring Zaporizhzhia to a safe stage and to make all the measures which are required for the safe operation of the plant.”",5.263593738911114,5.754366535297938,-0.4907727963868238,5

Hill told Politico in an interview published Monday that Putin has chosen Musk in a well-worn playbook of using prominent businesspeople to communicate his demands to a wider audience. “Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they’re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin,” Hill told Politico. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, earlier this month shared suggestions for ending the war with his followers on Twitter, earning the condemnation of Ukrainian officials. His proposal included redoing “elections” in the four Ukraine regions Putin annexed “under U.N. supervision,” referring to the sham referendums the Kremlin organized in these regions. Musk also suggested formally declaring Crimea, which Putin illegally annexed in 2014, part of Russia. Hill, currently a senior foreign policy fellow on the United States and Europe at the Washington-based Brookings think tank, said Musk made similar suggestions during “The Weekend” festival in Aspen, Colorado, last month. Hill also pointed to Musk’s proposal to guarantee the water supply of Crimea, which Ukrainian officials curtailed after the annexation by blocking water from Ukraine’s Dnipro River to the peninsula, as a sign of his communications with the Russian leader. “It’s unlikely Elon Musk knows about this himself,” Hill said. “The reference to water is so specific that this clearly is a message from Putin.” Ian Bremmer, founder of the prominent political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group, reported Musk told him Putin was “prepared to negotiate” with Ukraine if some of his terms were met. Musk has denied he spoke to Putin. Bremmer is sticking with his account. Hill said by using Musk as a messenger, Putin “is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process” to advance his goals. “He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up,” Hill said. “All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia.” Hill said Putin’s selection of Musk as a messenger is “fascinating” in part because the world’s richest person has been supporting Ukraine through SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet service, which has been used by the Ukrainian military.

Both lawyers spent time with Griner in a Moscow pre-trial detention facility on Tuesday, according to CNN. Griner is waiting for her appeal to be heard by a Moscow region court next Tuesday. The two-time Olympic gold medalist was given a nine-year sentence in a Russian prison on Aug. 4 for reportedly carrying cannabis in vape containers while entering a Moscow airport in February. In July, Biden administration officials offered Russia a “substantial proposal” to get Griner and another jailed American, Paul Whelan, back to the U.S. According to the Associated Press, a potential prisoner swap for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer, may have been part of the proposal. No swap has been officially confirmed. In an Oct. 5 interview with “CBS Mornings” host Gayle King, Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, said she feels as if her wife is a “hostage” in Russia. “It’s like a movie for me,” Cherelle explained. “I’m like, ‘In no world did I ever think, you know, our president and a foreign nation president would be sitting down having to discuss the freedom of my wife.’ And so to me, as much as everybody’s telling me a different definition of what B.G. is, it feels to me as if she’s a hostage.” She also spoke about Griner’s release on Tuesday in a video released by wearebg.org, a site dedicated to providing resources to bring her home safely. “I’ve felt every moment of the grueling seven months without her,” Cherelle said in the video. “I want to thank President Biden for the administration’s efforts to secure her release.” Cherelle continued: “As my family and I continue on this journey, I’d like to thank our friends, leaders and supporters who continue to stand with us and advocate for Brittney’s swift and safe return. Let’s share a unified commitment to bringing all Americans home to their families and loved ones.”",5.609746778266398,7.149639628138055,-1.5398928498716566,0

Ukraine’s infrastructure has been heavily damaged by Russian attacks and the country’s civilians and military have come to rely on SpaceX’s internet terminals and constellation of Starlink satellites to communicate, according to the Wall Street Journal. Musk said it was “unreasonable” for his company to continue providing the system without help. “SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households,” Musk wrote on Twitter. SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households. This is unreasonable. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice prime minister and minister of digital transformation, on Wednesday called Starlink “an essential part of critical infrastructure.” He said the system helped restore connections after Russian missiles damaged energy and communications infrastructure. Over 100 cruise missiles attacked 🇺🇦 energy and communications infrastructure. But with Starlink we quickly restored the connection in critical areas. Starlink continues to be an essential part of critical infrastructure. CNN on Thursday reported that SpaceX told the Pentagon in September that the company would cut off the service unless the military provided funds for it. SpaceX reportedly told the Pentagon the service would cost $120 million for the rest of this year, and nearly $400 million for the next 12 months, according to CNN. Musk has said SpaceX has spent about $80 million so far to deploy and maintain Starlink in Ukraine. The billionaire also said his company is losing about $20 million per month to operate the system and defend it against intensifying cyberattacks. In addition to terminals, we have to create, launch, maintain & replenish satellites & ground stations & pay telcos for access to Internet via gateways. We’ve also had to defend against cyberattacks & jamming, which are getting harder.Burn is approaching ~$20M/month. Musk’s company reportedly has already been getting outside help for Starlink in Ukraine. CNN said SpaceX told the Pentagon that over 80% of the 20,000 Starlink terminals in Ukraine have been funded by others, including the U.S. government and Poland. Musk has previously referenced his Starlink expenses in Ukraine as evidence of his support for the country against Russia’s invasion. The billionaire was condemned by Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as international leaders, for sharing polls on Twitter asking followers to weigh in on his suggestions for achieving “Ukraine-Russia peace.” The provisions he listed included re-doing “elections” in the four Ukraine regions Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed after holding sham referendums, and also declaring Crimea, the territory Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, formally part of Russia. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany tweeted at Musk to “fuck off.” “We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk replied to a follower, referencing CNN’s reporting about his company’s letters to the Pentagon. We’re just following his recommendation 🤷‍♂️ Earlier this week, Musk denied a report by Ian Bremmer, the founder of the political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group, that he spoke with Putin about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Bremmer doubled down on his account, writing: “I’ve long admired musk as a unique and world-changing entrepreneur, which i’ve said publicly. he’s not a geopolitics expert.” You can read the full CNN report here.",3.934092754333282,4.805461239609859,-0.8713684852765771,23

During an interview Wednesday on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” Stephanopoulos looked back on an interview he did with Trump in Colorado during the 2016 campaign. “We started to talk, and I asked him a question about ― remember this gold star mother, the Muslim woman whose son was killed ― and he attacked her,” he said. “And he just went after her. And I was, like, I guess the interview’s over. He just ended his campaign.” “But we kept on going,” he said, “and I started to ask him about his relationship with Vladimir Putin, which he never gave a straight answer to.” “So I asked him about three or four times just, you know, just tell us what the relationship was. And I was just asking factual questions.” He said Trump ended the interview, walked out the door and called over a producer. “And I could hear the yelling in the hallway,” Stephanopoulos said, recalling that Trump then sent his communications director, Hope Hicks, back into the interview room to “get me and walk me into the hall.” “And then he started yelling at me, going on and on and on and on and on. Because I asked him about Vladimir Putin. Which should have been the biggest tell in the world back in 2016,” he said. Trump’s behavior in that interview ― lashing out at a journalist for asking questions that he didn’t want to answer ― was indicative of many future exchanges to come. Trump continued to berate, insult and undermine the press throughout his presidency, particularly when he was asked difficult questions. Trump also continued to show deference to Putin and other dictators throughout his presidency and afterward. Multiple investigations found that Russia worked to help Trump’s campaign and hurt his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Several top Trump advisers were convicted of felonies in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman reported on Stephanopoulos’ interview incident in her new book. According to her reporting, Trump screamed expletives at ABC producer John Santucci, complaining that Stephanopoulos asked “eight fucking follow-ups” about Russia. “It’s like asking me if I beat my wife,” Trump reportedly shouted. “You ask me once, I say ‘fuck no,’ and we move on. You don’t then ask if I hit her with a fucking baseball bat or a fucking golf club! That was bullshit and you better fucking fix it in the edit.’”",5.099931038646029,4.582170685680826,0.5177603529652028,10

The report, which every administration is required to present to Congress and was delayed due to the Ukraine war, deals with two central challenges: competitions between major world powers and dangers that every country is facing, Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, told reporters. “This decisive decade is critical both for defining the terms of competition, particularly with the PRC [People’s Republic of China], and for getting ahead of massive challenges that if we lose the time in this decade, we will not be able to keep pace with most notably the climate crisis, but other challenges as well,” Sullivan said. Biden said Russia and China “pose different challenges.” He singled out China as “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge,” adding that Beijing has used technology and its power to influence global institutions to be more open to its authoritarian regime. China “is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order, and increasingly the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it,” Biden explained. At the same time, Russia is trying undermine world peace, most recently with its invasion of neighboring Ukraine, Biden said. “Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown,” Biden said. Biden also mentioned Russian President Vladimir Putin’s efforts to divide Americans at home, in part by “brazenly” interfering in U.S. politics. Biden warned Russia is likely to rely more heavily on nuclear weapons as its military falters in Ukraine, and said the U.S. is determined to deter that threat. He didn’t elaborate. “The United States will not allow Russia, or any power, to achieve its objectives through using, or threatening to use, nuclear weapons,” he said. In a recent interview with CNN, Biden said it would be “irresponsible” for him to explain how the U.S. would respond if Russia used a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The president repeated his commitment to democracy worldwide and vowed to defend against the threat of authoritarianism. “Autocrats are working overtime to undermine democracy and export a model of governance marked by repression at home and coercion abroad,” Biden said. “These competitors mistakenly believe democracy is weaker than autocracy because they fail to understand that a nation’s power springs from its people.” Sullivan made clear that the U.S. doesn’t see “the world solely through the prism of strategic competition.” “We are not seeking to have competition tip over into confrontation or a new Cold War,” Sullivan said. “And we are not engaging each country as simply a proxy battleground. We’re going to engage countries on their own terms and pursue an affirmative agenda to advance common interests and to promote stability and prosperity.”",3.9929883639991153,2.8326284893101707,1.1603598746889445,15

In a CNN interview broadcast Tuesday evening, Biden defended a controversial trip to Saudi Arabia over the summer, during which he was photographed fist-bumping Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He said the trip wasn’t about oil, but instead about U.S. diplomacy and leadership in the Middle East. Still, Biden said he was exploring options to hit back at the Saudis for the OPEC+ decision when the House and Senate return from recess following the midterms. OPEC+ is a group of oil-producing countries including Russia that are aligned with the OPEC cartel, which is effectively led by Saudi Arabia. “There’s going to be some consequences for what they’ve done with Russia,” Biden said, though he declined to get into specifics about the action he is considering. “There will be consequences,” he repeated. The cut in supply is expected to boost oil prices, which will help Putin continue funding his war in Ukraine, and also test the strength of Europe’s support for Ukraine ahead of a projected economic squeeze on the continent this winter. The move would also increase gas prices in the U.S. ahead of the midterm elections in November. Senate Democrats have been calling for a tough response. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accused the Saudis of underwriting “Putin’s war through the OPEC+ cartel,” adding that the U.S. should freeze arms sales and minimize security cooperation with the kingdom. “There simply is no room to play both sides of this conflict ― either you support the rest of the free world in trying to stop a war criminal from violently wiping off an entire country off of the map, or you support him,” Menendez said in a statement Monday. “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia chose the latter in a terrible decision driven by economic self-interest.” Last week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, “We are looking at all the legislative tools to best deal with this appalling and deeply cynical action,” including the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels bill, which would rewrite the law to allow for antitrust lawsuits against OPEC+ members and national oil companies, according to Reuters. John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications, told CNN’s “New Day” on Tuesday that Biden agrees the U.S.-Saudi Arabia relationship is one “that we need to continue to reevaluate.” “He’s willing to work with Congress to think through what that relationship ought to like going forward,” Kirby said, adding that the president intends “to have those conversations right away.” White House's John Kirby tells @brikeilarcnn ""the timeline is now"" for working with Congress to re-evaluate the US-Saudi relationship.

The subject matter was space,” the Tesla and SpaceX leader, who is the richest person in the world, tweeted when asked if the alleged conversation about Ukraine really happened. The rumored conversation between Musk and Putin was first reported in a newsletter from Ian Bremmer, who founded the prominent political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group. Bremmer wrote that Musk told him Putin was “prepared to negotiate” about the conflict in Ukraine so long as certain terms were meant: that Crimea would remain under Russian control, Ukraine would enter into a permanent neutrality agreement, and that it would accept Russia’s annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in eastern Ukraine. Bremmer didn’t back down from his report after Musk contradicted him, tweeting: “elon musk told me he had spoken with putin and the kremlin directly about ukraine. he also told me what the kremlin’s red lines were.” In two subsequent tweets, Bremmer wrote: “i have been writing my weekly newsletter on geopolitics for 24 yrs. i write honestly without fear or favor and this week’s update was no different,” and “i’ve long admired musk as a unique and world-changing entrepreneur, which i’ve said publicly. he’s not a geopolitics expert.” Last week, Musk tweeted out his proposals for ending the war in Ukraine ― and they were very similar to what Brenner said Musk told him Putin wanted. Ukrainian leaders were not taken with Musk’s ideas. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany tweeted at Musk to “fuck off,” and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a poll on Twitter asking his followers whether they preferred Musk as a Ukraine supporter or Russia supporter.",3.7118167091209933,4.164260987120492,-0.4524442779994984,23

Hugo Bachega was reporting from central Kyiv on the escalating conflict after a bridge connecting the annexed area of Crimea to Russia was blown up on Saturday. The Kremlin has blamed the attack on Ukraine. “So the fear is that this could trigger a very strong Russian response. We saw yesterday that a residential area of the city of Zaporizhzhia, a major city in the south of the country, very close to the front lines was hit,” Bachega said, before he was distracted by the sound of an airborne missile. He ducked out of view of the camera as an explosion was heard. The BBC threw it back to the studio, where the anchor said Bachega had taken cover “for obvious reasons.” Within the hour, Bachega delivered another report, noting that the airstrike had hit close to his hotel in the city center. “We understand that several explosions have happened here in the capital, and we had an update from the emergency services saying that several people have been killed and wounded,” he reported. He later posted on Instagram that he was safe, but was having a “busy and depressing day” reporting from a parking lot, ostensibly underground to shelter from airstrikes.

Mike Mullen, the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Sunday said Russian President Vladimir Putin is “a cornered animal” and urged the Biden administration to work to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. The Kerch Bridge, which links Russia to Crimea, was heavily damaged over the weekend in what Putin called “a terrorist attack” carried out by Ukrainian special services, according to The Associated Press. “I think he’s more and more dangerous,” Mullen told ABC’s “This Week” of Putin. Hours after Mullen spoke, Moscow struck central Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, killing at least eight people and injuring many more, in what appears to be retaliation for the bridge attack, according to AP. Putin, in an address confirming the strikes on Ukraine, warned: “If attempts to carry out terrorist attacks on our territory continue, the measures taken by Russia will be tough and in their scale will correspond to the level of threats posed to the Russian Federation. No one should have any doubt about it,” according to The New York Times. Mullen said Putin’s nuclear threats should be taken seriously. He also assessed the challenge for the Russian president in using tactical nuclear weapons. “The winds all blow back onto Russia, so he would have to, in a way, contaminate his own country,” Mullen explained. “He could pick a symbolic target. He could pick Zelenskyy’s hometown, for instance, as a target, as opposed to having a big impact on the battlefield that would badly hurt the Ukrainian Army, which has fought so well.” Mullen also criticized President Joe Biden for saying last week that the risk of nuclear “Armageddon” hasn’t been this high since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. “President Biden’s language — we’re about at the top of the language scale, if you will,” Mullen said. “And I think we need to back off that a little bit and do everything we possibly can to try to get to the table to resolve this thing.” Adm. Mike Mullen tells @MarthaRaddatz he is “a little concerned about the language” Pres. Biden is using to describe nuclear threats from Putin.""I think we need to back off that a little bit and do everything we possibly can to try to get to the table.”  Mike Pompeo, former President Donald Trump’s secretary of state, called Biden’s remarks “reckless” and “a terrible risk to the American people,” in an interview on “Fox News Sunday.” John Kirby, the White House National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, defended Biden, explaining that the president’s comments were not based on fresh intelligence about Putin’s thinking. “What the president was reflecting was that the stakes are high right now, given what’s going on on the battlefield in Ukraine and given the very irresponsible and reckless comments made by Vladimir Putin in just the last few days,” Kirby told ABC’s “This Week.” Asked how Putin could save face and end the war, Mullen said it would likely have to involve the four Ukraine regions — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — that Russia annexed after staged referendums that have been widely condemned by Ukrainian officials and the West. “I suspect it’s in the east, if you will, with those four provinces or some combination of them with respect to how it all ends,” Mullen said. He also urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to find a way for Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to get to the negotiating table. “As is typical in any war, it has got to end and usually there are negotiations associated with that,” Mullen said. “The sooner the better as far as I’m concerned.” It’s up to Secretary of State Blinken and other diplomats “to figure out a way to get both Zelenskyy and Putin to the table,” former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Adm.

The decision is good news for Russian President Vladimir Putin given that higher prices of oil could help him fund his war in Ukraine. It could also challenge Europe’s united support for Ukraine as the continent faces a projected economic squeeze this winter. “What Saudi Arabia did to help Putin continue to wage his despicable, vicious war against Ukraine will long be remembered by Americans,” Schumer wrote on Twitter. “We are looking at all the legislative tools to best deal with this appalling and deeply cynical action, including the NOPEC bill.” What Saudi Arabia did to help Putin continue to wage his despicable, vicious war against Ukraine will long be remembered by Americans.

There’s still an enormous amount of damage and destruction that Russia can do; they can punish,” he said. For instance, Russia has stepped up its use of Iranian-made suicide drones in Ukraine, according to The Associated Press. “But at the end of the day, they cannot reverse the situation on the battlefield, which is going to see Ukraine taking back the territory that Russia has taken since Feb. 24, and perhaps taking back everything that Russia has taken from them since 2014,” Petraeus added. Putin illegally annexed the Crimea in 2014. Putin has also explicitly said he plans to use every available tool at his disposal to protect the four annexed territories, which has widely been seen as a warning that he’s prepared to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. U.S. officials have said they see no practical signs that that is the case at the moment but added we shouldn’t underestimate Putin. “I think you have to take this very seriously,” Petraeus told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble. He went on to say, “there’s no question about the capabilities that Russia has,” adding that a tactical nuclear weapon doesn’t change the fact that “Ukraine has a vastly bigger and better and more capable force.” Still, he cautioned there would be widespread destruction and a “radiation of a location on that battlefield.” The retired Army general also pointed to another thing Ukraine has going for itself: the willingness to fight for its independence. Ukrainians are “fighting for their survival,” Petraeus said. “The Russians aren’t sure what they’re fighting for.” Putin on Wednesday signed into law the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia into Russia as Ukraine continues to make gains in the east and south, according to AP.

In a preview clip of a full-length interview with “CBS Mornings” host Gayle King, Cherelle said she never thought two world leaders would have to meet to discuss the “freedom of my wife.” “It’s like a movie for me,” Cherelle explained. “I’m like, ‘In no world did I ever think, you know, our president and a foreign nation president would be sitting down having to discuss the freedom of my wife.’ And so to me, as much as everybody’s telling me a different definition of what B.G. is, it feels to me as if she’s a hostage.” The two-time Olympic gold medalist was sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison on Aug. 4 for allegedly carrying cannabis in vape containers while entering a Moscow airport in February. Her lawyers appealed the Russian court’s decision on Aug. 15, and now, the Moscow region court will hear the appeal on Oct. 15, according to The Associated Press. There have been long-standing talks about a prisoner swap that would bring Griner and former U.S. marine Paul Whelan to the U.S. in exchange for a Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout, but no further confirmation has been established. Cherelle has been in contact with President Joe Biden and the White House for months hoping that Biden would bring Brittney home swiftly. After a meeting with Biden in the Oval Office in September, she thanked him and his administration for “its efforts to secure my wife’s release” in a post on Instagram. “It was an honor to speak with him directly about the Brittney we know and love,” Cherelle wrote in the caption. “I’ve felt every minute of the grueling seven months without her. I look forward to the day my wife is back home.” She also thanked “friends, leaders and supporters who continue to stand with us and advocate for Brittney’s swift and safe return” before adding: “Let’s share a unified commitment to bringing all Americans home to their families and loved ones.

Marina Ovsyannikova, who was an editor at the Channel One station where she staged her internationally recognized protest, issued the update on Telegram, a chat app Russians have used to share information about the war in Ukraine after government crackdowns on other social media platforms. “I consider myself completely innocent, and since our state refuses to comply with its own laws, starting from September 30, 2022, I refuse to comply with the preventive measure in the form of house arrest and release myself from it,” Ovsyannikova declared in her post, written in Russian. In a video posted to the app, Ovsyannikova gestured toward her ankle bracelet and called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to wear one as punishment for committing war crimes. The Kremlin has kept her under house arrest since August for staging a series of protests, including the one in which she held up a sign during the live broadcast reading: “Stop the war. Don’t believe the propaganda. They are lying to you.” Ovsyannikova could face more than a decade in prison. It’s unclear how she escaped, and her new location remains undisclosed. Her former husband Igor Ovsyannikov, who works for the pro-Kremlin RT network, told the station last weekend that he’d alerted government authorities that she and their 11-year-old daughter had gone missing and he did not know where they were. Ovsyannikov did not appear for a Wednesday morning court appearance, her lawyer, Dmitry Zakhvatov, told Reuters. If the government finds her, she’ll be taken into custody immediately, he said, adding “we hope, however, that this will not happen.”",5.369162557018431,4.755670969254322,0.6134915877641083,23

Musk suggested redoing “elections” in the four Ukraine regions Putin annexed “under U.N. supervision,” adding that Russia would then exit the territories “if that is will of the people.” The so-called elections Musk referred to have been described as “sham” referendums the Kremlin held in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, and have been widely condemned by Ukrainian officials and the West. Musk’s proposal also stated that Crimea, the Ukraine territory that Putin illegally annexed in 2014, become “formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Kruschchev’s mistake.)” Former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev “gifted” the Crimea Peninsula to Ukraine in 1954, according to NPR. Years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. signed the Budapest Memorandum in 1994 agreeing “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine” and “to refrain from the threat or use of force” against it, according to The Brookings Institution, a think tank based in Washington, D.C. Putin defied that agreement when he went ahead with Crimea’s annexation. The remaining elements of Musk’s proposal included guaranteeing water supply to Crimea, which Ukrainian officials curtailed after the annexation by blocking water from Ukraine’s Dnipro River to the peninsula. The water supply seems to have been restored following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. Finally, Musk proposed Ukraine maintain its neutrality, which could be implied as pushing for the country to abandon its application to be a member of the NATO military alliance. Ukraine fast-tracked its membership bid Friday and has already earned the backing of some members of the alliance. Ukraine-Russia Peace:- Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.- Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).- Water supply to Crimea assured.- Ukraine remains neutral. “This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end — just a question of how many die before then,” Musk added. He continued: “Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war.” Putin has stepped up his warnings in recent weeks, vowing to protect the four annexed regions by “all available means,” which was interpreted as a threat of using nuclear weapons. U.S. officials have stressed that while Putin’s nuclear threats are unlikely to materialize for the moment, they should be taken seriously. Following criticism of his earlier poll, Musk went on to release a further survey, asking his followers whether “the people who live in the Donbas & Crimea should decide whether they’re part of Russia or Ukraine.” Let’s try this then: the will of the people who live in the Donbas & Crimea should decide whether they’re part of Russia or Ukraine Musk’s tweets prompted the response of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who posted a poll of his own: “Which @elonmusk do you like more?” with two possible answers: “one who supports Ukraine” or “one who supports Russia.” Which @elonmusk do you like more? To which Musk responded that he backs Ukraine, but is “convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world.” Apart from Zelenskyy, Musk earned the scorn of other world leaders, including the Lithuanian president. “Dear @elonmusk, when someone tries to steal the wheels of your Tesla, it doesn’t make them legal owner of the car or of the wheels. Even though they claim both voted in favor of it. Just saying,” Gitanas Nausėda wrote on Twitter. Dear @elonmusk, when someone tries to steal the wheels of your Tesla, it doesn't make them legal owner of the car or of the wheels. Even though they claim both voted in favor of it. Just saying. Andrij Melnyk, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, also had stark words for the billionaire’s first Ukraine-Russia poll. “Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,” Melnyk wrote on Twitter. Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk Musk also said his company SpaceX has spent about $80 million to operate Starlink — a satellite constellation that delivers internet access — in Ukraine, which has also been used in the field to keep Ukrainian forces connected, according to The Wall Street Journal. SpaceX’s out of pocket cost to enable & support Starlink in Ukraine is ~$80M so far. Our support for Russia is $0. Obviously, we are pro Ukraine.Trying to retake Crimea will cause massive death, probably fail & risk nuclear war. This would be terrible for Ukraine & Earth. Kyiv Post, a Ukrainian news organization, recognized Musk’s contribution through Starlink, before adding that it would “be so very wonderful if you were to carry out votes on things that you know about.” “We don’t carry out votes on apartheid and Nelson Mandela,” it said. Elon, you’re a cool guy and thanks for the Starlink but it’d be so very wonderful if you were to carry out votes on things that you know about. We don’t carry out votes on apartheid and Nelson Mandela. Musk is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Twitter that will determine whether he has to carry through with his initial bid to buy the company for $44 billion.",4.322346226696952,3.413845448119425,0.9085007785775274,15

Putin on Friday vowed to use “all available means” to protect the four Ukraine regions he annexed — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — following referendums Moscow held in those territories. The votes have been denounced as a “sham” by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and condemned by the West. Putin’s statement has been interpreted as a threat over the use of nuclear weapons. Austin told CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” he has in the past spoken to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, and warned him against going in that direction, but the decision will ultimately be made by Putin himself. “I do think he heard my message, but to be clear, the guy who makes that decision — I mean, it’s one man. There are no checks on Mr. Putin,” Austin said. “Just as he made the irresponsible decision to invade Ukraine, he could make another decision. But I don’t see anything right now that would lead me to believe that he has made such a decision.” Last month, Putin had issued a similar warning, saying he wasn’t bluffing about doing anything in his power to protect Russia. “What we have to do is take it very seriously, watch for signs of actual preparations,” CIA Director William Burns told CBS Evening News last week. Austin also spoke on the progress of Ukraine’s counteroffensive, which appears to be weakening Russia’s position in the battlefield, and in part the trigger for Putin’s decision to move ahead with the annexations. “What we’re seeing now is a kind of change in the battlefield dynamics,” Austin told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria. “They’ve done very, very well in the Kharkiv area and moved to take advantage of opportunities. The fight in the — the Kherson region’s going a bit slower, but they’re making progress.” Putin also called up to 300,000 reservists to join his country’s forces in Ukraine. That order has been met with challenges, with Russians in some regions reportedly getting drafted despite their failure to meet the eligibility criteria. Over the weekend, Ukraine retook control of the city of Lyman in the east, and continued moving into the Luhansk region, CNN reported, citing pro-Russian officials. Meanwhile, Ukraine has fast-tracked its application to join the NATO military alliance.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy applied on Friday for the country to get fast-tracked NATO membership in response to Russia annexing four regions in violation of international law. Ukraine and the West have denounced as a sham Russian President Vladimir Putin’s referendums to annex the regions ― his latest move in the months-long war. A country needs approval from all 30 members to join NATO, and Ukraine has received mixed responses in the past from the alliance due to its geographic proximity to Russia. Being at war complicates the country’s request to join the military alliance. The nine NATO countries that voiced support for Ukraine’s membership are the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. All of the countries are in Central and Eastern Europe, and could face Russian aggression next if it isn’t stopped in Ukraine. Together with the Presidents of 🇱🇻🇪🇪🇵🇱🇸🇰🇷🇴🇨🇿🇲🇪🇲🇰, we:- Support Ukraine's sovereignty& territorial integrity- Support 🇺🇦 in its defense against Russia's invasion- Firmly stand behind 🇺🇦 future #NATO membership- Call for accountability of war criminals.  “We reiterate our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We do not recognize and will never recognize Russian attempts to annex any Ukrainian territory,” the statement said. “We firmly stand behind the 2008 Bucharest NATO Summit decision concerning Ukraine’s future membership.” At the 2008 summit, NATO members welcomed Ukraine and Georgia’s desires to join the alliance, but declined to provide a clear timeline for the countries’ path to membership. The letter on Sunday also did not provide such a timeline, though Zelenskyy thanked the countries for publicly supporting Ukraine becoming a member. Finland and Sweden officially applied to join NATO on a fast-track in May out of security concerns following Russia’s invasion. Most member countries have already ratified their applications, and the two nations are on track to join the alliance. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Friday that the U.S. has long supported an open-door policy for NATO, but that the application process for Ukraine “should be taken up at a different time.” “Right now, our view is that the best way for us to support Ukraine is through practical, on-the-ground support in Ukraine,” Sullivan said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg gave a similar response on Sunday, telling Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Ukraine has the right to choose what kind of security arrangements it wants to be part of, but that “any decision on membership has to be taken by consensus.” After the annexation, the U.S. sanctioned over 1,000 people and firms connected to Russia’s invasion, including its Central Bank governor and families of National Security Council members. Sullivan said that sanctions have been a “critical element” to the White House’s strategy against Putin’s regime because of the “economic pressure that we are placing on Russia, and the denial of their ability to gather what they need to be able to regenerate their war machine.”",4.28895487665772,3.868988744052936,0.4199661326047841,15

A new indictment accused the aluminum tycoon of paying two women, Olga Shriki and Natalia Mikhaylovna Bardakova, for personal services in the U.S. between 2018 and 2020. Deripaska has faced sanctions since 2018 for what the Treasury Department called “the Russian government’s ongoing and increasingly malign activities,” referring to the annexation of Crimea and other world events. In or around 2019, Shriki allegedly helped Deripaska sell a $3 million music studio in Burbank, California, according to The New York Times. Both Shriki and Bardakova are accused of helping his girlfriend, Ekaterina Voronina, enter the U.S. to deliver his child in 2020. “Additionally ... Deripaska routinely had Shriki and Bardakova purchase various products in the United States for Deripaska’s personal use and as gifts for others on his behalf,” the indictment said. The indictment also alleged that Voronina tried to enter the U.S. again this year but failed. She is charged with making false statements to the Department of Homeland Security in June when claiming that her parents, and not Deripaska, had paid for the airfare. Shriki and Bardakova are further accused of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from Deripaska to arrange care and housing for Voronina and her baby. Shriki allegedly destroyed evidence regarding this investigation, while Bardakova is charged with lying to U.S. government officers. Deripaska had made a comfortable living for himself in the U.S., despite his “cozy ties with the Kremlin” and “wealth acquired through ties to a corrupt regime,” said Andrew Adams, the head of the Justice Department’s KleptoCapture task force. “Deripaska did all he could to lead a life in a stable, free, democratic society ― even if that meant lying and evading U.S. sanctions,” Adams told ABC News. Deripaska, Bardakova and Voronina, who are Russian nationals, have yet to be arrested, The New York Times reported, adding that they are considered fugitives. Shriki, a U.S. citizen, was arrested in New Jersey on Thursday. The billionaire has faced scrutiny from the U.S. government for years. In 2021, the FBI searched Deripaska’s New York and Washington properties as it looked into possible sanctions violations. In 2020, he was accused of laundering money for Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the Financial Times. He was also referenced in special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s inquiry into potential Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, though he was never charged. A 2019 report from Mueller claimed that Paul Manafort, a presidential campaign chairman for Donald Trump in 2016, had offered Deripaska data related to campaign briefings and polling. New York prosecutors said this week that they intend to seize Deripaska’s assets in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village and Washington’s Embassy Row neighborhoods for forfeiture. On Friday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a new round of sanctions against more than 1,000 people and firms connected to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",5.316284354123005,5.5604412493063355,-0.2441568951833304,23

Trump, said Haberman, railed at ABC News producer John Santucci that the Russia and Putin questions were “bullshit.” “Eight fucking follow-ups — are you fucking kidding me?” Trump reportedly snarled before launching into this analogy about domestic violence: It’s like asking me if I beat my wife. You ask me once, I say ‘Fuck no,’ and we move on. You don’t then ask if I hit her with a fucking baseball bat or a fucking golf club.

The future president reportedly fired back: “Are you fucking kidding me? Eighteen fucking follow-ups — how many different ways do I have to say I don’t know the guy?” As president, Trump lavished Putin with praise, took his word over that of U.S. intelligence agencies and tried to extort Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into smearing his likely 2020 election rival Joe Biden.",5.08492594219435,5.187960623032945,-0.10303468083859446,1

Even media outlets typically in favor of Russia’s invasion have cast doubt on how the “partial mobilization” orders have been carried out. Rybar, a pro-war blog, wrote on Telegram it knew of several men who had been drafted despite health issues or limited training experience, according to The New York Times. Meanwhile, thousands of Russians have fled the country, and many others have taken to the streets to protest Putin’s plans. The Russian president’s escalation apparently was triggered by Ukraine’s successful counteroffensives. The Institute for the Study of War, a policy research organization based in Washington, said the addition of inexperienced men to Russia’s military is “unlikely” to change the dynamic of the conflict. “Mobilized men with a day or two of training are unlikely to meaningfully reinforce Russian positions affected by Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south and east,” the institute said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday admitted “errors” had been made in executing Putin’s troop call-up. “These cases of noncompliance with the required criteria are being eliminated,” Peskov said, according to the Times. “And we hope that the rate of elimination will increase and all errors will be corrected.” Burns told CBS Evening News that manpower is far from the only trouble facing the Russian military. “Even if he’s able to mobilize 300,000 troops, it’s not as if throwing people like cannon fodder toward the front, many of whom are not going to be well trained, many of whom are not going to have the kind of equipment that they need or the logistical support that they need as well,” Burns told CBS’ Norah O’Donnell on Monday. Burns continued: “His military has a lot of other problems; manpower is only one of them.” In an exclusive interview, CIA Director Bill Burns told @norahodonnell that U.S. intelligence is evaluating Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats and that the rhetoric he and other senior Russian leaders are using is reckless.  Last week, Putin said he wasn’t bluffing about using every means available to support Russia, according to The Associated Press. The statement was interpreted as a warning that he is prepared to use nuclear weapons. Burns said U.S. intelligence agencies had no “practical evidence” that Putin is taking steps to act on his nuclear threat, but said we should not ignore his warnings. “What we have to do is take it very seriously, watch for signs of actual preparations,” Burns said. Burns added policymakers should also “communicate very directly the severe consequences that would flow from any use of nuclear weapons.” National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. has already done so. “Russia understands very well what the United States would do in response to the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine because we have spelled it out for them, Sullivan told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “Russia will make its decisions, but it will do so fully understanding that the United States will respond decisively.”",2.871522292251548,3.107337875237348,-0.2358155829858002,15

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week” about Russian civilians’ protests against Putin’s mobilization of about 300,000 reservists and sham annexation referendums in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. “What you see inside Russia right now, this call-up of troops, the sham referenda that they’re trying to run in the occupied territories ― these are definitely not signs of strength or confidence,” Sullivan said on Sunday. “Quite the opposite: They’re signs that Russia and Putin are struggling badly. “It will be the Russian people, ultimately who make the determination about how Russia proceeds and the extent to which that there is resistance pushback to what Vladimir Putin has tried to do, calling up these hundreds of thousands of young men,” he continued. National security adviser Jake Sullivan tells @GStephanopoulos that Putin calling up troops and holding ""shame"" referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine are signs that ""Russia and Putin are struggling badly.”  Sullivan also said that the U.S. has warned Moscow there would be “catastrophic consequences” if Russia used a nuclear weapon in its war against Ukraine, telling Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Russia is very aware of what the U.S. would do in response to nuclear weapon use. The White House is taking the threat seriously, according to Sullivan, who added that this is not the first time Putin has made a nuclear threat in the current conflict. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Budget and Armed Services Committee, said on Saturday that he believes Putin is dangerous because “he has his back against the wall,” but that his threat of nuclear weapon use is “a big bluff.” “The use of nuclear weapons, Ali, would pose massive fallout risks to Russian citizens,” Kaine told Ali Velshi on MSNBC. “Using nuclear weapons anywhere … is not just going to invite a coordinated international response that will be overwhelmingly catastrophic for Russia, but the use of nuclear weapons also poses fallout risks in Russia.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine — convened in March and staffed by international legal experts — reported the disturbing findings Friday in Geneva, describing a long list of appalling abuses and atrocities by Russian forces. “Based on the evidence gathered by the commission, it has concluded that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine,” Erik Mose, a Norwegian judge and chairman of the three-member commission, said in a statement to the U.N. Human Rights Council. ""War crimes have been committed in Ukraine.""-- Independent International Commission of Inquiry tells @un_hrc. Among the most disturbing crimes the commission has documented involve cases in which children were “raped, tortured and unlawfully confined,” according to the findings. The age of “victims of sexual and gendered-based violence ranged from 4 to 82 years,” Mose said in a statement. In some cases ”relatives were forced to witness the crimes,” Mose noted in his statement. Children were also killed and wounded in “indiscriminate attacks” on civilians by Russian forces using explosive weapons, the investigation found. Commission members “were struck by a large number of executions and other violations by Russian forces, and the Commission received consistent accounts of torture and ill-treatment,” Mose noted in his statement. The commission is continuing to investigate executions in 16 towns and settlements, and has “credible allegations regarding many more cases of executions, which we are documenting further,” Mose added. Many of the examined bodies showed evidence of “prior detention of the victims, as well as visible signs of executions ... such as hands tied behind backs, gunshot wounds to the head, and slit throats,” the commission found. The findings have been consistent with reports of war crimes from other international human rights groups, Western governments and Ukrainian authorities. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine earlier this year documented illegal killings — including summary executions of civilians — in more than 30 settlements in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions by Russian armed forces while they controlled these areas in late February and March. The Independent International Commission headed by Mose also investigated atrocities in the same areas. Investigators visited 27 towns and settlements and interviewed more than 150 victims and witnesses, according to the report. They also inspected “sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture,” as well as remnants of weapons, said Mose.",6.691242986782445,5.295735957038283,1.395507029744162,2

Carlson, in a segment about the war between Russia and Ukraine on Thursday, called the U.S. response to the invasion “classic mission creep,” in which the country extends the military’s stay for a purpose that’ll hurt America in the long term. He later played a clip of former Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg telling Fox News host John Roberts that the U.S. should stay “all in” and noted that the nation hasn’t given Ukrainians weapons, such as an attack cruise missile, that can reach all of Crimea. “It really can put the Russians at threat, but we haven’t done that. And I think we should put them at threat,” said Kellogg, who served from 1967 to 2003. “Until [Vladimir Putin] really believes that we’re seriously going after him, he’s going to continue to make these threats.” Carlson, in response to Kellogg’s take, said anyone who had a hand in the last five wars that hurt the U.S. long-term “should probably bow out of the conversation about the latest war,” The reason for not listening to Kellogg about aiding Ukraine would be “for the same reason that you wouldn’t, say, take financial advice from someone who had gone bankrupt or go to marriage counseling with some who’s been mmm ... divorced three times because they’ve demonstrably failed in their so-called area of expertise.” Carlson’s blow adds to a history of the Fox News host defending Russia and Putin, peddling a Russian conspiracy theory and dropping pro-Russia talking points on his show since the start of the invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

The GOP’s video, “The Preamble to the Commitment to America,” opens with a narrator highlighting aspects of what it means to be an American. “We celebrate the rich heritage of the American story and the vibrancy of the American Dream,” the voice says, over footage of a drilling rig at sunrise. But this video snippet, an apparent nod to America’s natural resources, wasn’t even filmed in America. It’s stock footage created by Serg Grbanoff, a filmmaker based in Russia. Grbanoff told HuffPost that he filmed this scene in Russia’s Volgograd region. Here’s a screenshot of the image in the House Republican leaders’ video, versus an original shot on Shutterstock’s website: It’s not the only instance where Grbanoff’s work appears in the GOP’s video celebrating America. In another scene, a boy is seen smiling and running in a field with a toy airplane. The words “Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” appear on the screen, a reference to the Declaration of Independence. This clip was also created by Grbanoff, and also filmed in the Volgograd region of Russia. Here’s a screenshot of the image in the GOP’s video versus an original shot on Shutterstock’s website: At another point in the video, Republicans take a shot at Democrats on the economy. “Democrats have led America off track,” the narrator says. The words “Crippling inflation and rampant crime” appear on the screen, over a shot of a woman walking through a grocery store. But this is footage from a European grocery store. If you look closely at the screenshot, you can see a tag hanging on one of the store shelves that says “AKCIA,” a Slovak word meaning “action.” Informally, “AKCIA” is used to designate sales in Slovakian stores. House Republicans almost certainly used imagery from Ukraine in their video about America, too. The video includes a clip of a farmer carrying a bag on his shoulder in a field of corn, as the words “And the vibrancy of the American Dream” appear on the screen. This is also stock footage sourced from a Shutterstock contributor, DedovStock. The man featured in the clip works for DedovStock, and has a page of his work on its website. His page features shots of him in Ukraine and the Carpathian Mountains, which stretch through Ukraine and parts of Eastern Europe.

Russian news outlet Izvestia reported that Anatoly Gerashchenko “fell from a great height” down numerous flights of stairs inside the Moscow Aviation Institute’s headquarters, according to The Daily Beast. The institute’s press office described his death as “the result of an accident.” Gerashchenko, who led the organization from 2007 to 2015, was serving as an adviser to the institute’s current rector when he died, according to state-controlled outlet RIA Novosti. He spent 45 years rising through the ranks there and was honored with government awards, such as the Merit to the Fatherland medal. While the Moscow Aviation Institute might sound like a flight school, the university conducts research in fields with potential military applications, from avionics and aerospace to drones and artificial intelligence, according to Insider. It has ties with the country’s Ministry of Defense. The institute called Gerashchenko’s death a “colossal loss” and said it would establish an internal commission to investigate. That panel would include members of multiple government bodies and the university itself, it said. Gerashchenko is the latest in a series of high-profile Russians to die this year under unexpected circumstances. Ravil Maganov, who chaired Russia’s second-largest oil company, Lukoil, reportedly leaped to his death from the sixth floor of a hospital earlier this month. Billionaire Alexander Subbotin, a former manager at Lukoil, was found dead in May of an apparent heart attack in the home of a shaman, according to Newsweek. Meanwhile, local news reported that Leonid Shulman — an executive at the country’s third-largest bank, Gazprombank — hanged himself in his cottage in January, according to Reuters. The next month, former Gazprombank executive Alexander Tyulyakov was also found hanged, the New York Post said. Vladislav Avayev, a former vice president at the bank, was found shot to death in April next to the bodies of his wife and daughter.

General Assembly on Wednesday, speaking remotely. He continued: “The crime was committed against the values that make you and me a community of the United Nations. And Ukraine demands punishment for trying to steal our territory.” Zelenskyy called for Russia to be stripped of the veto power it enjoys as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. “So long as the aggressor is a party to decision-making in the international organizations, he must be isolated from them — at least until aggression lasts,” Zelenskyy said. “Reject the right to vote. Deprive delegation rights.” Other countries with veto power include the U.S., China, France and the U.K. President Joe Biden, who also addressed the U.N. General Assembly Wednesday, accused Russia of “shamelessly” breaching the “core tenets of the United Nations Charter.” “Let us speak plainly: A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor and attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map,” Biden said. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called up 300,000 reservists to fight in Ukraine after a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region. Large swaths of Russians tried to flee the country following Putin’s announcement, and over 1,300 people were arrested in anti-war demonstrations on Wednesday, The Guardian reported, citing a protest monitoring group. Russia also announced what it called referendums in occupied parts of Ukraine to ask residents whether they want to join Russia — a plan that runs afoul of Ukrainian and international law, according to The Washington Post. Zelenskyy said this shows Russia has no real intent to engage in negotiations to end the war. “They talk about the talks, but announce military mobilization, he said. “They talk about the talks but announce pseudo referendums in the occupied territories of Ukraine.” He continued: “But Russia will not be able to stop the course of history. Mankind and the international law are stronger than one terrorist state. Russia will be forced to end this war.” Biden referred to evidence that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine. The most recent example is the mass grave found near the city of Izyum, which Ukrainian forces recaptured in their counteroffensive. “This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine’s right to exist as a people,” Biden said. “Wherever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe — that should make your blood run cold.” Zelenskyy made reference to Izyum, as well as the atrocities in Bucha, where Ukrainian forces found bodies with signs of rape and torture, according to The Associated Press. “Ask, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration,” Zelenskyy said. “What was done to them so that they want to do this to others?” Ukraine accused Russia of “nuclear terrorism” after it said a Russian missile struck near a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Monday. “Russian radiation blackmailing is something that should concern each and every one of you, because none of you will find a vaccine against radiation sickness,” Zelenskyy warned.

Putin also announced plans to hold referendums to annex Russian-occupied regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, and accused the West of engaging in “nuclear blackmail.” The reservist announcement has led to Russians rushing to book one-way flights out of the country while they still could. “The world should see these outrageous acts for what they are. Putin claimed he had to act because Russia was threatened – but no one threatened Russia, and no one other than Russia sought conflict,” Biden said, adding that Ukraine now faces taxes on schools, railway stations, hospitals, and attacks on centers of Ukrainian history and culture. Biden also mentioned the latest evidence of Russia’s war crimes: a mass grave discovered earlier this month in the recently liberated northeastern Ukrainian city of Izyum. Investigators found over 440 men, women and children at the grave, their bodies showing signs of torture. Ukrainian authorities said they also found evidence of “torture chambers” in the Kharkiv region that Russia had occupied. “This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine’s right to exist as a people,” Biden told the U.N. “Wherever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe – that should make your blood run cold. “Because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for.” In his remarks, Biden announced that the United States would provide $2.9 billion to support strengthening global food security, which he said is at risk due to the climate crisis, the pandemic and the consequences of Russia’s invasion. According to the president, about 193 million people around the world experience acute food insecurity – an increase of 40 million from last year. “Russia, in the meantime, is pumping out lies trying to pin the blame for the food crisis on the sanctions imposed by many in the world for the aggression against Ukraine,” Biden said. “So let me be perfectly clear about something: Our sanctions explicitly allow Russia the ability to export food and fertilizer, no limitation. It’s Russia’s war that’s worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it.”",3.644973403502829,3.791085806933466,-0.14611240343063692,3

Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Huynh were released alongside eight other prisoners of war, including citizens from the U.K., Morocco, Sweden and Croatia. Drueke, a former Army staff sergeant who served in Iraq, and Huynh, a former Marine, were captured near the Ukrainian border city of Kharkiv in June. The pair had traveled from Alabama to fight against invading Russian forces. The Saudi Foreign Ministry said that the prisoner swap was brokered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The country added that it’s also working to repatriate all the POWs. It’s unclear who was released to Russia as part of the deal. Dianna Shaw, Drueke’s aunt, told The Washington Post on Wednesday that his mother had spoken to him for about 10 minutes after his release. “He sounded clearheaded, with clear speech,” Shaw told the paper. “He sounded like himself.” The prisoner exchange came at a pivotal moment in the Kremlin’s invasion.

Russian space agency Roscosmos announced his death on Monday without disclosing the cause or location. “His research helped prove that the human body is ready for flights not only to near-Earth orbit, but also to deep space,” Roscosmos wrote in a Telegram post. “We express our deepest condolences to the relatives and friends of Valery Vladimirovich.” He was born Valery Ivanovich Korshunov on April 27, 1942, but changed his name after being adopted in 1957, according to the New Mexico Museum of Space History. Polyakov began as a physician and joined the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow in 1971, according to CNN. After undergoing spaceflight training to demonstrate he could administer assistance to fellow astronauts in orbit and passing his exams in 1972, Polyakov became one of the first doctor-cosmonaut trainees in history. He earned his Candidate of Medical Sciences degree in 1976. Polyakov’s first lengthy space mission in 1988 lasted eight months, and he became deputy director of the institute he once joined as a young man upon returning back to Earth. It was his second and final mission, however, that made history. Now a specialist in the nascent field of space medicine, Polyakov volunteered to prove human beings could withstand microgravity and reach Mars, according to Wired. His flight to dock with Russia’s Mir space station launched on Jan. 8, 1994 — and Polyakov didn’t return until March 22, 1995. Polyakov orbited Earth 7,075 times and traveled around 187 million miles during those 14 months — during which millions of people back on Earth had marveled at the launch of the Netscape Navigator internet browser, the opening of the English Channel Tunnel and O.J. Simpson’s high-speed police chase. According to “The Story of Manned Space Stations” by Philip Baker, American astronaut Norman Thagard said Polyakov returned to Earth “big and strong” and looked “like he could wrestle a bear.” Polyakov exercised during his mission and refused assistance upon landing, opting to walk on his own. “When his capsule landed in Kazakhstan he walked from it to a nearby chair, a tremendous achievement,” wrote Baker. “He also stole a cigarette from a friend nearby, but could hardly be blamed for that. He sipped a small brandy and inwardly celebrated his mission.” While NASA astronauts Scott Kelly and Mark Vande Hei respectively spent 340 and 355 consecutive days in space and Peggy Whitson spent 665 cumulative days in space, the consecutive 437-day stay accomplished by Valery Polyakov remains unprecedented. “His record still stands today,” wrote Baker, “and it is unlikely to be broken until man ventures to Mars.”",4.379863788460866,4.4350344574945835,-0.0551706690337177,8

For others, it’s the fear that Ukraine may become an economic basket case, even if it wins the war. Or that the world may forget the country’s plight altogether. Ukrainans, their friends and those simply curious about the country that’s fought Russia to standstill gathered on a sun-splashed weekend at St. Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral in suburban Washington for the region’s biggest annual Ukrainian cultural festival. Amid women wearing garlands in their hair, men wearing vyshyvanka — white shirts with intricately patterned embroidery down the front — and accompanied by traditional and pop Ukrainian music, the war was never far from people’s minds. What in past years had been a chance to showcase the culture and drink some beers from the home country had taken on a different, somewhat deeper meaning. “This year is particularly beautiful and sad at the same time,” said the church pastor, the Rev. Volodymr Steliac, as he formally opened the festival Saturday. “We have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity.” The festival opened on Day 206 of the invasion and came amid good news for Ukraine: a surprise counteroffensive in the northeast that in a few days cleared Russians from towns and villages they had fought weeks to take earlier in the war. But the victory came with a price. In the strategic town of Izium, mass graves were found, similar to those seen in the capital Kyiv’s suburb of Bucha when the war began. “We have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity.” Oksana Sukhina, who was staffing the booth of the U.S. Ukraine Foundation, where she is project director, said she wanted to see what the impact of the latest reports of atrocities will be on Europe. In the past, she said, some people suspected Ukrainians have exaggerated the cruelty of the Russians with reports of horrific claims like rape as a weapon of war and the theft of household goods then shipped to Russia. “Then you see Bucha, you see now Izyum. And we have yet to see Kherson and Mariupol and other places,” Sukhina said. Sukhina, 50, immigrated to the U.S. from Kyiv in 2020. Warned by former colleagues in the State Department about the likelihood of invasion, her parents arrived in Washington only days before the war. But as the prospect of Kyiv’s being captured receded, they went back, as did one of her daughters. They joined a 23-year-old son who left his IT job in Chicago in March to help deliver food and medical supplies in Kyiv. Sukhina said she tried to convince him to stay, but could not forbid him to leave because she had participated in pro-democracy protests in 2004 and 2014. “I’m proud of them. They are trying to do whatever they can. And this is what makes us win,” she said. Steliac said the church was open 24-7 when the war began. He was only getting two or three hours of sleep a night as volunteers dropped off humanitarian aid, organized it and shipped it to Ukraine. In one 48-hour period, he said, two of those young volunteers lost their fathers back in Ukraine. “The war is not there alone; the war is here as well,” Steliac said. Even though the process of gathering and sending aid has become more routine, even keeping in touch with family back home, he said, can be painful. “What was traumatic was that they were communicating with their relatives and they said, ‘Oh, a bomb fell just a couple of neighborhoods over’ and then they tried to connect again and the phone connection doesn’t go through,” Steliac said. “You think of the worst.” Alex Naumovych, a 36-year old mortgage loan officer from Ternopil in the western part of Ukraine, said he’s had calls interrupted by the air raid sirens, although now he said the alarms are likely to be ignored. Ternopil, a city of about 250,000, has no military targets, but he said his parents still hear the sirens daily. Ukraine tracks incoming missiles and activates local warning systems based on where they could potentially land, so even residents of cities not targeted are warned. “I’m worried that, sooner or later, one of those missiles may hit my city, like my parents’ place,” Naumovych said. Naumovych arrived in the U.S. almost 11 years ago. He had about $440 to his name then, he said, and started a landscaping business he sold years later for more than $1 million. “I’m worried that, sooner or later, one of those missiles may hit my city, like my parents’ place.” “I love this country. Like you can come with $400 and six, seven years later you can be a millionaire,” he said. One of his big worries for Ukraine now is its economy, with so many people out of work because of the war and inflation projected to hit 30%. “The economy is in bad shape,” Naumovych said. “A lot of people left Ukraine and I’m not sure they’re coming back” The parents of software engineer Serhiy Vorobiov, 43, are near the war’s front line in Zaporizhzhya, a Russian-speaking region that includes Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Russia has captured the plant and Ukrainians and others fear they will use it for blackmail. But Vorobiov said his parents, only 25 miles from the front lines in the city of Zaporizhzhya, still think everything is relatively safe. He said he chats with them with about the same frequency as before the war. “Maybe because there is no very high emergency at this point. I know it’s not to my defense, but that’s how it is,” he said. Vorobiov, his wife Oksana, 33, and their three young children, Yaromyr, Myroslava and Oksana, have lived in the U.S. since 2020. He said the war has reinforced his belief in getting rid of any Russian influence on their upbringing. “I always dreamed of it, I just didn’t want to be very tough in that. But now I have all the rights and I want to use it,” Vorobiov said. “I want them to forget [the] Russian language. We are from [the] Russian-speaking part of Ukraine, but now we are fixing it, as much as we can. Forget Russian, forget we were ever together, [forget] Soviet Union. I’m happy they don’t know what Soviet Union is.” But in her remarks to open the festivities, Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, advised focusing on the present, not the past. “Please be joyful today,” she counseled. She said Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the Russians want Ukrainians to “sit down and cry” at the devastation. “This is what Russians want us to do. And we will not give it to them.”",3.2415534517756144,3.5205485716671183,-0.27899511989150394,3

According to the latest MoD intelligence update, Kremlin-linked private military company the Wagner Group is carrying out the prison recruitment drive. They said the scheme was first launched in July, but has now been “reinvigorated” as Moscow continues to suffer major losses in the war. Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 16 September 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  The MoD said: “Prisoners have been offered commutation of their sentences as well as cash incentives. “This has been reinvigorated, with recently posted video highly likely showing Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin making a recruitment pitch to prisoners. In the video, Prigozhin emphasises that he is only seeking ‘fighters for assault units.’” In a further sign of Russia’s need to get more troops to the frontline, the MoD said Moscow’s military academies “are shortening training courses and bringing cadets graduation dates forwards.” “This is almost certainly so cadets can be deployed to support the Ukraine operation,” they said. “The impact of Russia’s manpower challenge has become increasingly severe. “The acceleration of officer cadets’ training, and Wagner’s demand for assault troops suggests that two of the most critical shortages within the military manning crisis are probably combat infantry and junior commanders.”",4.014548814248468,4.214765273811762,-0.20021645956329337,15

Ivan Pechorin, the managing director of the Corporation for the Development of the Far East and the Arctic, is the ninth Russian businessperson to die by suicide or in mysterious circumstances since January, and is among six deaths affiliated with the country’s energy sector, according to CNN. Pechorin reportedly fell off his boat close to Russky Island near Cape Ignatiev, the British Metro newspaper reported, citing Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda. “Ivan’s death is an irreparable loss for friends and colleagues, a great loss for the corporation. We offer our sincere condolences to family and friends,” the company said in a statement, according to the English translation. Pechorin attended the Eastern Economic Forum headlined by Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, where he was listed as a panelist and moderator for two discussions around strengthening aviation accessibility and airport infrastructure in the Far East and Arctic. Pechorin’s company was tasked with developing the Arctic, a vast source of gas and oil for Russia, according to British newspaper Mirror. Pechorin’s boss, CEO Igor Nosov, 43, died suddenly in February after a stroke, Mirror reported. Another Russian executive, Ravil Maganov, who chaired Russia’s second-largest oil company Lukoil, died after falling out a window at Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow earlier this month, The Guardian reported, citing the Interfax news agency. Lukoil said Maganov died “following a severe illness.” Lukoil previously criticized Putin’s war in Ukraine, and in March called for an end to the conflict. “We strongly support a lasting ceasefire and a settlement of problems through serious negotiations and diplomacy,” the company’s board said in a statement a week after Putin invaded Ukraine. Former Lukoil executive Alexander Subbotin was found dead at the house of a shaman in May, Newsweek reported, citing Russian local media. Other Russian executives who have died in recent months include Sergey Protosenya, who worked for Russian energy company Novatek; Vladislav Avaev, the former vice president of bank Gazprombank; and Alexander Tyulyakov, Gazprom’s deputy general director of the Unified Settlement Center for Corporate Security, according to Newsweek. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president visited the recaptured city of Izyum on Wednesday as his country’s counteroffensive in northeastern Ukraine continues routing Russian troops, according to The Associated Press.

Will It Threaten Atomic Energy’s Revival?,"In the early 2000s, with the threat of climate change coming into focus, the declining nuclear power industry, with its capacity to generate huge volumes of emission-free electricity, looked to be on the cusp of a revival. Then the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima atomic generating station in Japan stoked old fears that nuclear energy could never be safe enough. Japan mothballed its reactors. Germany fast-tracked shutting down its whole fleet. The U.S. gave up on its nuclear ambitions, abandoning its Yucca Mountain waste-disposal project and permanently closing dozens of safe but financially uncompetitive reactors. A decade later, soaring emissions, failing power grids and buckling renewable-energy supply chains are already setting the groundwork for a new nuclear power renaissance. Once Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine and gas markets became a key battleground in the global conflict, even anti-nuclear stalwarts started embracing atomic power. In a matter of weeks, Japan ordered its old plants reopened and new reactors built, Germany opened the door to keeping its remaining facilities running and California lawmakers voted to save the state’s last nuclear station. Now, though, battles raging around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southeastern Ukraine risk triggering the first major radiation accident since Fukushima, unleashing chaos in a war zone where Russia has already threatened to use atomic weapons. At present, crews have kept Europe’s largest nuclear station running even as shells explode around its six reactors. On Sunday, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-owned nuclear operator, said it has powered down the plant’s last operating reactor, reducing the risk of any kind of accident. But the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, warned Friday that the situation was “unsustainable” and “becoming increasingly precarious” after shelling in a neighboring town destroyed electrical infrastructure that the plant depends on as a backup to keep its cooling systems running. “This is completely unacceptable,” IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said in a video statement. “It cannot stand.” If the worst happens, would a disaster at Europe’s largest nuclear plant prove a setback for an industry whose nascent comeback could make quitting fossil fuels much easier? There is no obvious answer, in part because the scale of any radiation leak resulting from something as unpredictable as artillery combat is impossible to predict. An accident would almost certainly temper demand for nuclear power in some places; citing just the potential for a disaster, Greenpeace urged the European Union to disqualify reactors from green energy funding. But experts in the industry say that what happens in Ukraine is unlikely to derail most countries’ newfound atomic ambitions. “I don’t see one incident that I can imagine that is going to turn back the tide or flip the coin on nuclear,” said Craig Piercy, chief executive of the nonprofit American Nuclear Society. “A military-driven destruction of something is not going to sour people. Frankly, I feel like the support is building and it’s durable.” Attitudes toward nuclear energy vary by country. In Finland, where reactors generate a huge chunk of the country’s electricity, support for atomic energy is exceptionally high. In the United States, separate surveys over the past year from the pollsters Ipsos, Gallup and the Pew Research Center show Americans are split on fission. In Germany, where the government has pursued one of the world’s most aggressive nuclear phaseouts, a major national poll in August found that only 15% of Germans supported the current plan, suggesting a major divide between the country and its leaders. But the relationship between public opinion and the past nuclear accidents isn’t as direct as it may seem. After each of the world’s three major nuclear power disasters ― the 1979 partial meltdown at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe and the earthquake and tsunami at Fukushima ― it took three years for public support for atomic energy to drop, according to an analysis of polling data released last year. While politicians in Germany and South Korea moved swiftly to shutter nuclear plants after the most recent accident in Japan, a study by Ann Bisconti, a longtime nuclear industry consultant whose surveys have tracked public opinion on atomic energy for decades, found that support for nuclear energy dropped well after the disasters as a result of shifting politics around energy, namely that the demand for new reactors decreased because the global supply of fossil fuels increased. “What happened was the need for nuclear energy was the driver of public attitudes, not the accidents,” Bisconti said. “If there’s a strong need, I think the same may be true now.” Over the past seven decades, atom-splitting reactors have safely generated stupendous sums of electricity in more than 30 countries ― with few exceptions. Just four people died from radiation in three of the four worst accidents in the history of nuclear energy. But the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown, about 500 miles north of the Zaporizhzhia plant, irradiated a vast area and caused a spike of thousands of cases of thyroid cancer, making the stakes of a full-scale nuclear disaster easy for anyone with an HBO subscription to visualize. Experts caution that a repeat of the Soviet-era disaster is nearly impossible and that artillery hitting other industrial facilities, such as chemical plants, could do as much if not more damage. The reactors at the so-called ZNPP are differently designed machines altogether, devoid of the features that doomed Chernobyl. Unlike Chernobyl’s “fundamentally unstable” reactors, virtually all modern reactors, including those at ZNPP, are “designed to operate in a stable state,” according to Jaakko Leppänen, a researcher and expert in reactor safety in Finland, which generates much of its electricity from fission. “This means that the energy-producing chain reaction is a self-regulating process that does not require external control or special adjustment measures to maintain it,” Leppänen wrote in a recent blog post, translated from Finnish using Google software. “The power of the reactor cannot start increasing without reason. Even in the event of a disturbance, the chain reaction breaks off by itself when the temperature rises high enough.” Shutting down a nuclear reactor is no simple task. The reactor fuel continues to produce residual heat that requires active cooling systems, which usually circulate cold water. If the electricity powering those systems fails ― as happened in Fukushima, when the tsunami destroyed backup generators ― “the result can be overheating and melting of the fuel,” Leppänen said. “These backup systems are in a way also the institution’s weak point,” Leppänen wrote. “Damage to a single device or system does not on its own endanger the cooling of the reactor, but if the plant is deliberately destroyed, the risk is the simultaneous loss of all electrical systems.” Even then, the ZNPP reactors have something Chernobyl lacked: a thick concrete dome enclosure over the reactors themselves. After five years, spent fuel, which remains dangerously radioactive for thousands of years, is moved outside the dome to air-cooled storage systems called dry casks. Long-cooled fuel produces less heat, and many of its most dangerous radionuclides, such as iodine-131, have already had time to disappear through radioactive decay, Leppänen wrote. But a direct missile strike could cause radiation to leak into waterways. The Russians and Ukrainians blame each other for continuing the shelling. Tea Törmänen, a pro-nuclear environmental advocate in Finland, said that “it’s not in anyone’s interest to damage the plants.” “To the Russians, it’s an asset, so destroying them wouldn’t make sense, and it’d mostly harm the soldiers in the area,” she said. A Russian attempt to permanently annex the facility could be another potential threat. For now, the plant depends on power systems Ukraine controls to safely operate. In an Aug. 25 interview with the U.S. government-funded Voice of America news service, an anonymous engineer at the ZNPP accused the Russians of wanting “to arrange a small accident and stop ZNPP for a short time, then supply us with electricity from Crimea and automatically switch the nuclear power plant to the Russian energy system.” Calling that a “very dangerous plan,” the engineer said the “Russians have not touched the management of the nuclear power plant, although I think it will happen soon. The pressure is getting stronger.” Last week, shelling in the neighboring city of Enerhodar, where much of the ZNPP’s staff and their families live, destroyed the electrical infrastructure and caused a total blackout, which left the plant reliant on the lone reactor that had been running until Sunday. But the IAEA said “operating a reactor at low power is not a sustainable solution for a longer period because it could over time damage key equipment of the nuclear power plant, such as electricity-producing turbines and pumps.” While a backup power line to the Ukrainian grid was eventually restored on Sunday, the uncertain connection means the plant will depend on its 20 diesel generators to keep systems running if there’s another blackout. “We are trying to keep this unit running as much as possible, but eventually it will have to be shut down and then the station will switch to diesel generators,” Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom, told The Associated Press on Thursday, adding that such generators are “the station’s last defense before a radiation accident.” A controlled nuclear accident at ZNPP would be unlikely to upend the nuclear industry’s revival plans, said Najmedin Meshkati, a University of Southern California nuclear engineering expert who studied the Fukushima catastrophe. After years of struggling to build large-scale reactors on time and on budget, the U.S. and other countries are banking on the commercialization of small modular reactors, scaled-down fission machines that can be manufactured to be safer and less expensive. The novelty of the technology could offer an industry dogged by bad perceptions a chance to rebrand. Recalling a conversation with the late Hungarian chemist George Olah, Meshkati quoted the Nobel laureate as saying, “You guys in the nuclear industry, you’re not as smart as doctors.” Asked why, Olah told him: “MRI technology used to be called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. But the medical industry dropped the nuclear part from the name. It’s just MRI.” That, Meshkati said, represented “exactly the transformation that will happen in public relations” once the small modular reactor industry takes off. Nuclear safety regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere are currently assessing various so-called SMR applications. Industry analysts generally suggest the sector could become viable in the early 2030s. But humans tend to “overreact to extreme risks and underestimate slower-moving, less dramatic risks,” said Rich Sorkin, chief executive of Jupiter Intelligence, a U.S.-based consultancy that models climate risk. “It’s not a surprise that there’s a phrase ‘If it bleeds, it leads,’” he said. “There’s no question that a nuclear disaster is at the top of things that people would be focused on from a distance.” The pinch of soaring energy prices and the high probability of rationing fuel across Europe this winter are more likely to “top everyone’s priorities right now,” Törmänen said. Anyway, she said, radiation is hardly the only potential disaster from warfare. “There are many other chemical plants that are very dangerous if there’s a war, but nobody’s talking about ending the production of many chemicals that are very dangerous,” Törmänen said. “It seems like a ridiculous idea that we plan our energy system in all countries based on what we would do if there’s a war in our country.” Bisconti, the nuclear industry consultant, said an accident may still prove a setback for nuclear energy in countries like Germany. “But what countries decide to do versus public opinion are not necessarily the same thing,” she said.",4.751562440147037,4.617395617149223,0.13416682299781346,5

Milley Says Russia Has Failed To Meet Strategic Objectives But War Isn't Over,"Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley said Thursday that Russia has failed to meet its strategic objectives in the first six months of President Vladimir Putin’s brutal campaign against Ukraine. Speaking alongside Defense Secretary Austin Lloyd in Germany following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, the top general said the Ukrainian people have shown “superior tactical proficiency” and “a superior will to fight.” “The war is not over, but so far, the Russian strategic objectives have been defeated,” Milley said. Milley added that the U.S. and other allies have helped supply Ukraine with the weapons systems it needs to defend itself, noting the detrimental effect this has had on Russia’s ability to continue fighting. “Russian lines of communication and supply channels are severely strained,” Milley said. He continued: “They’re having great difficulty resupplying their forces and replacing their combat losses.” But Russia on Thursday disputed that Western weapons have helped Ukraine make progress, according to The Associated Press. “The Russian army consistently, with minimal risk for its soldiers and civilians is destroying not only the old weaponry of Soviet models, which the Eastern European countries are discharging, but also the modern NATO weapons,” said Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations. Milley also provided a rundown of the war, pointing to Russia’s early strategic failures after it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. “They didn’t seize the capital, they didn’t topple the government, they didn’t get to the Dnipro River, and they didn’t seize Odesa,” Milley said, using the Ukrainian name for the Dnieper River. That forced Russian forces to pivot in mid-April and focus instead on seizing the Donbas and holding Odesa at risk, Milley explained. These efforts have also been unsuccessful, he said. “They have only crossed the Dnipro River in the south, in the vicinity of Kherson,” Milley said, adding that at the start of this month the Ukrainians launched their own counteroffensive in the south. Austin on Friday told reporters that Ukraine has recently made progress in this operation. “We see success in Kherson now. We see some success in Kharkiv, and so that is very, very encouraging,” Austin said, according to Reuters. The U.S. officials, though, were keen to emphasize that the conflict is far from over. “Russia’s a big country. They have very serious ambitions with respect to Ukraine. So sustainment of Ukraine to continue their fight for their survival will be necessary,” Milley said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the Ukrainian capital Kyiv as the U.S. released a package of over $2 billion in military support to Ukraine and 18 neighboring countries threatened by Russian aggression, in addition to the $675 million Austin announced just for Ukraine, the AP reported.",3.5811351793078234,5.231490600870933,-1.65035542156311,3

State-owned news outlet Tass quoted sources that said he fell from a sixth-floor hospital window in Moscow. Tass later added that Maganov took his own life by jumping, according to the BBC. Lukoil omitted any mention of a fall in its news release and said Maganov’s death at the Central Clinical Hospital resulted from underlying health issues he suffered. “We deeply regret to announce that Ravil Maganov, Chairman of PJSC LUKOIL Board of Directors, passed away following a severe illness,” Lukoil wrote. “Ravil Maganov immensely contributed to the development of not only the Company, but of the entire Russian oil and gas sector.” Russian news outlet RIA Novosti reported that the hospital confirmed Maganov’s death and that authorities were investigating the matter. Tass cited an unnamed law enforcement official claiming Maganov had been hospitalized for a heart attack and was on antidepressants when he died, according to Bloomberg. Maganov joined Lukoil in 1993 and became chairman in 2020. His company notably condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and wrote in a February letter to shareholders that Lukoil supports “the immediate cessation of the armed conflict,” according to the Daily Beast. The 67-year-old joins a substantial roster of Russian bankers and oil and gas executives who have died under suspicious circumstances this year. Lukoil’s billionaire ex-manager Alexander Subbotin was found dead of an apparent heart attack in the home of a shaman in Mytishchi in May, according to Newsweek. Tass reported that voodoo rituals occurred at the home and that Subbotin was intoxicated when he died. Leonid Shulman — an executive at Russia’s third-largest bank, Gazprombank — was found dead at his Leningrad cottage in January of an apparent suicide, according to the New York Post.

Yes, after the end of the Cold War, the former Russian leader chose to sell hot pizza as a way to raise money for a research foundation, according to a 1997 CNN article. “I’m in the process of creating a library and a perestroika archive, and this project requires certain funds,” Gorbachev said at the time. “Perestroika (restructuring) gave impetus to Russia and to the whole world. It is very important that everything that happened be preserved in these two centers.” While Gorbachev didn’t confirm how much he was paid, sources claimed he was reportedly paid nearly $1 million to do the advertisement, according to The New York Times. The commercial, which shows him dining at a Pizza Hut with his granddaughter Anastasia, debuted all over the world. However, in Russia Gorbachev was still unpopular at the time and the ad was not aired despite it being filmed in Moscow, The New York Times reported. Negotiations between Pizza Hut and Gorbachev took a bit of time because while he was willing to take the dough for the ad, he said “nyet” to eating the pizza on camera, according to reports. Hence, the casting of his granddaughter, who willingly chowed down on a slice to appease Pizza Hut executives, according to a 2019 deep dive into the commercial by Foreign Policy. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, initially feared doing commercials would harm his reputation. But he ended up also doing a 2007 magazine ad for Louis Vuitton where he’s sitting in a car next to remaining parts of the Berlin Wall. HuffPost reached out to Pizza Hut for comment, but no one immediately responded. Many Twitter users, on the other hand, had tons of saucy comments about Gorbachev’s Pizza Hut past. My generation knew Communism was dead when we saw Gorbachev in a Pizza Hut commercial. Last few decades must have been awfully lonely and strange for Gorbachev.

Fogel was on his way back to Russia to teach at the Anglo-American School in Moscow. In June, he was sentenced to 14 years in a maximum-security Russian penal colony. “The United States cannot stand by as Mr. Fogel wastes away in a Russian hard labor camp,” the senators wrote in a letter to Blinken. The letter was first reported by CNN. The lawmakers added that the punishment doesn’t fit the crime, explaining medical marijuana was recommended to Fogel as a treatment for chronic pain. “Though Mr. Fogel did violate Russian law by bringing 17 grams of marijuana to the country, his sentence is grossly disproportionate to similar cases,” the letter reads. “As Russian lawyers have pointed out, the most common sentence in similar cases is five years of probation. Drug traffickers who have committed much worse offenses have received shorter sentences.” The nine senators include: Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.); Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Steve Daines (R-Mont), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Shelly Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Tim Kaine (D-Va.). The bipartisan group argued Fogel was being “used as a political pawn” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding the educator qualifies for the “wrongfully detained” classification by meeting six of the 11 criteria, including “being detained substantially because he is a U.S. citizen.” The senators also referred to the efforts the White House has made to secure the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was sentenced to nine years in prison on drug possession charges after she was arrested for carrying cannabis oil in vape containers in her suitcase at a Moscow airport in February. Her lawyers appealed her sentence on Aug. 15. Blinken offered Russia a prisoner exchange deal to trade Griner and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan for Russian drug dealer Viktor Bout. Both Griner and Whelan have been designated as “wrongfully detained.” Earlier this month, Russian news agency TASS reported talks were underway. “Fogel’s case warrants the same degree of political attention and diplomatic intervention,” the senators said. Last month, John Kirby, the national security council coordinator for strategic communications at the White House, did not directly answer a question on why Fogel was not part of the proposed deal. “We’re focused on all Americans who are held hostage and wrongfully detained around the world. What we’re talking about with this particular proposal is for those two individuals,” Kirby said, referring to Griner and Whelan. “That doesn’t mean that we’re not also working in real-time on other Americans who are unjustly detained around the world,” he continued. Fogel’s niece Kelly Leguineche told CBS News their family was not given a clear answer by the State Department as to why Fogel hasn’t been designated as “wrongfully detained,” or why he was not part of the exchange deal. “It’s devastating because it feels like this was our last opportunity to save his life, and we just couldn’t get the momentum we needed for it to matter to them,” Leguineche said. Fogel was teaching in Russia for the past nine years and previously worked in other countries around the world including Malaysia, Mexico, Colombia,Oman and Venezuela.",6.174321995247798,2.8777124120532815,3.2966095831945164,0

The actor, who became a special representative for Russia’s foreign ministry in 2018, toured the ruins of Olenivka prison in Donetsk, Ukraine, on Tuesday for state-controlled media outlet TVZvezda, according to Insider. Footage showed Seagal repeating Russian propaganda talking points at the Russian-occupied site. The Kremlin has alleged Ukraine destroyed the prison with HIMARS rockets provided by the United States. Ukraine has said Russian shelling destroyed the site and called the attack a war crime. “This is where HIMARS hit, 50 people were killed, another 70 were injured,” Seagal said. “It definitely looks like a rocket. If you look at the burning and other details, of course, it’s not a bomb. Not to mention the fact that Russia really has a lot of artifacts from HIMARS.” Military experts said there’s no evidence supporting the claim that U.S. rockets caused the destruction, according to The Washington Post. Seagal also called the dead Olenivka prisoners “Nazis” and alleged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself destroyed the facility to kill one of the inmates, according to New York Post. The “Glimmer Man” actor, who developed a friendship with Putin after obtaining Russian citizenship in 2016, has no expertise in rocketry or forensics. He’s recording his visits to sites like Olenivka for an upcoming documentary. Seagal, whose official title is special representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was given access to the prison even before the International Red Cross Committee, according to The Moscow Times. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said the U.N. had been promised Russia and Ukraine would cooperate in the investigation of Olenivka.",4.561906530250442,4.494429329868377,0.06747720038206495,17

Now, GOP lawmakers and conservative commentators are up in arms about the FBI raid on Trump’s home in Florida on Monday, accusing Biden of personally directing the Department of Justice to go after his political opponents. The White House repeatedly denied that Biden had any involvement or knowledge of the search on Tuesday. “The president was not briefed, did not ― was not aware of it. No. No one at the White House was given a heads up. No, that did not happen,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jeane-Pierre said. “The Justice Department conducts investigations independently, and we leave any law enforcement matters to them. It would not be appropriate for us to comment on any ongoing investigations,” Jeane-Pierre added. But Republicans are pointing the finger at Biden anyway, claiming without evidence that he ordered an apparent search for classified documents Trump allegedly took after leaving office. The National Archives said earlier this year that it had obtained 15 boxes of presidential records that Trump had failed to turn over at the end of his term, contrary to the Presidential Records Act, which states that a president’s papers belong to the public. “Biden is playing with fire by using a document dispute to get the [Department of Justice] to persecute a likely future election opponent,” tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). “Because one day what goes around is going to come around.” Rubio went on to add, “Using government power to persecute political opponents is something we have seen many times from third-world Marxist dictatorships.” Rubio wasn’t the only Republican with something to say on the matter, Rep. Fred Keller (R-Pa.) also jumped in to share his two cents. “Biden is weaponizing the DOJ against his political opponents,” Keller tweeted on Monday. “If they can do this to the former president of the United States, imagine what they can do to you.” Many of these same Republicans voted against Trump’s impeachment after he held up delivery of U.S. military aid to Ukraine in July 2019, while demanding Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announce an investigation into Biden ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The aid was released after the scheme became public. Democrats claimed Trump had abused the power of his office by asking a “favor” of Zelensky, while Republicans echoed Trump in saying that it was a “perfect” conversation. GOP lawmakers aren’t the only ones crying foul over the raid on Mar-A-Lago, Trump’s estate in Florida. Gov. Ron Desantis (R-Fla) also issued a statement decrying the search, calling it “another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves.” DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential contender, is no stranger to using the power of his office to go after his opponents. As governor, he has cracked down on LGBTQ rights and moved to punish Disney for protesting his state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law. Last week, DeSantis suspended a state attorney who signed a pledge that would not prosecute people under the state’s newly enacted abortion law. Republican grievances about the recent FBI probe into Trump gloss over the way they cheered in the past over the FBI’s investigation into former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over mishandling classified information. “It’s like overnight all the Republicans who talked for six years nonstop about the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton just magically erased it from their memory so they could create this new fictional world in which only Republicans get investigated by the FBI,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) tweeted Tuesday.",4.545887158841573,4.861656717567242,-0.3157695587256688,11

He added that Russian citizens should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy,” noting the whole country should face consequences for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “They’ll understand then,” he continued. Zelenskyy told the Post restricting Russian travelers for a year coupled with a ban on Russian energy would be a stronger deterrent to Putin’s continuing war, calling current sanctions “weak.” While Europe and the U.S. have already closed their airspace to Russia, they have not prohibited Russian citizens from entering their countries. Some European countries are already heeding Ukraine’s calls for tighter restrictions. “It’s not right that at the same time as Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists,” Finland’s Prime Minister Sanna Marin told Yle. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas also tweeted in support of the proposal. “Stop issuing tourist visas to Russians,” Kallas wrote. “Visiting [Europe] is a privilege, not a human right.” The U.S. on Monday said it would send Ukraine $1 billion in military equipment, including rockets, according to The Associated Press.

Bill Richardson told ABC’s “This Week” he believes Griner will be released alongside former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan in a two-for-two prisoner swap with Russia. “I’m optimistic,” Richardson said. “I think she’s going to be freed. I think she has the right strategy of contrition, a good legal team. There’s going to be a prisoner swap, though. And I think it will be two-for-two involving Paul Whelan. We can’t forget him. He’s an American Marine wrongfully detained, too.” Basketball star Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan should hopefully be released from Russia as part of a ""two-for-two"" prisoner swap, former U.S. Amb. to the U.N. Bill Richardson tells @GStephanopoulos. ""My view is optimistic.”  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month the U.S. made a “substantial offer” to Russia in exchange for Griner and Whelan in a surprise announcement. The offer reportedly involved exchanging the two Americans for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. On Friday, Lavrov told reporters Russia was prepared to discuss the prisoner exchange deal, but warned the U.S. against making public statements about negotiations. “If the Americans again try to engage in public diplomacy and make loud statements about their intention to take certain steps, it’s their business, I would even say their problem,” Lavrov said, according to The Associated Press. “The Americans often have trouble observing agreements on calm and professional work.” Richardson, who told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos he serves as a “catalyst” for the negotiations between the U.S. and Russia by holding talks with each side, said he would have taken a different approach to communicate the offer. Richardson and Lavrov served as U.N. ambassadors around the same time. “I wouldn’t have gone public as much as they did on the Bout for Griner and Whelan,” Richardson said. “But it was done. Sometimes when negotiations are not working, you want to throw a little bit of a bomb, and I think that’s what they did.” Richardson declined to get drawn into questions over why another American detainee in Russia, educator Marc Fogel, is not part of the swap negotiations, saying “all of these that are wrongfully detained need to come home.” The former ambassador also addressed claims that prisoner exchange deals could backfire in encouraging more U.S. adversaries to detain Americans. He said there is no data to support this argument. “As unpleasant as [prisoner exchanges] are, we have to bring American hostages home, especially those wrongfully detained, especially those that have served in our military,” Richardson said. Former U.S. Amb. to the U.N. Bill Richardson tells @GStephanopoulos that prisoner exchanges are “unpleasant” but necessary.“We have to bring American hostages home, especially those wrongfully detained, especially those that have served in our military.” ",4.459876514980679,3.7765750232472173,0.6833014917334617,0

Russian prosecutors asked the judge for a nine-and-a-half-year sentence for the Phoenix Mercury player; she faced up to 10 years. Any sentence, however, would be thrown out if American and Russian authorities struck a deal on a prisoner swap. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed last week that the U.S. had put forth a “substantial offer,” reportedly suggesting that Griner and another American prisoner, former Marine Paul Whelan, be exchanged for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Griner pleaded guilty to charges of drug possession, but said in court Thursday that she had made an honest mistake and apologized for bringing “embarrassment” on her Russian teammates. “I want to also apologize to my parents, my siblings, the Phoenix Mercury organization back at home, the amazing women of the WNBA, and my amazing spouse back at home,” she added. Griner has been married to her wife, Cherelle Griner, since 2019. “I know everybody keeps talking about ‘political pawn’ and politics, but I hope that that is far from this courtroom,” she said, according to multiple outlets. “I want to say again that I had no intent of breaking Russian laws. I had no intent. I did not conspire or plan to commit this crime.” President Joe Biden said the sentence was “one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney.” “It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates,” Biden said in a statement. “My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible.” Arms dealer Bout, who sold off large quantities of weapons after the fall of the Soviet Union, is currently around halfway through a 25-year sentence for allegedly taking part in a conspiracy to kill Americans. He was eventually captured in a sting operation in Thailand in 2008. Griner was arrested in February while going through customs at Sheremetyevo Airport, outside of Moscow, for allegedly carrying 0.702 grams of hashish oil, a product that contains cannabis, in two vape cartridges. Days later, Russia invaded Ukraine. Griner’s arrest was announced in early March, prompting concerns that her detention was largely political, and Blinken later declared her a wrongful detainee. The two-time Olympic gold medalist had been playing for Russia’s UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA off-season periodically since 2014, as women’s basketball players are often better paid overseas than in the U.S. In a handwritten letter to Biden that was also released in part to media outlets in early July, Griner said that she was “terrified” she might never see the outside of a Russian prison. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Biden read the letter and American officials were “going to use every tool that we possibly can” to bring Griner home.",2.6096756438427944,4.963761771645389,-2.354086127802595,0
2022-08-04,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/josh-hawley-nato-finland-sweden_n_62ebd5e8e4b0c5501617f929,Josh Hawley Was The Only Senator Who Voted Against NATO Expansion,"WASHINGTON ― The Senate overwhelmingly voted to add Finland and Sweden into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on Tuesday, a historic move aimed at countering Russia’s aggression in Europe. Only one senator, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), opposed the ratification. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), meanwhile, voted “present.” Hawley, a potential 2024 presidential contender, argued that Finland and Sweden would have trouble spending on their own defense, putting the onus on the U.S. to get even more involved in the region. He said the U.S. should focus instead on countering China, and that it wouldn’t be able to do both. “Our foreign policy should be about protecting the United States, our freedoms, our people [and] our way of life,” Hawley said in a floor speech. “Expanding NATO, I believe, would not do that.” NATO was founded after World War II to create a pact of mutual defense among member nations in the event of Soviet aggression. NATO member countries are treaty-bound to defend any member in the event of an armed attack. Hawley, who led the effort to overturn the 2020 electoral results in Congress that gave rise to the Jan. 6 insurrection, called for adopting a “nationalist” foreign policy. He later went on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show to make his case. Carlson was an early critic of U.S. efforts to counter Russia, amplifying the Kremlin’s talking points as it launched its brutal invasion of Ukraine. Nearly every one of Hawley’s GOP colleagues disagreed with his rationale. “Both countries already participate in NATO and American-led missions,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday. “Finland already meets NATO’s 2% spending target, and Sweden is making significant investments in modernizing its military.” “If any senator finds a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish them good luck,” McConnell added. NATO members have pledged to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense, a target that some nations have met and others haven’t yet. Sweden is in the latter group, though it has said it will meet the goal. Hawley has said the target should be higher. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) appeared to accuse Hawley of hypocrisy ― albeit without naming him ― for opposing Finland and Sweden joining NATO while voting in favor of North Macedonia joining the alliance in 2019. “It would be strange indeed for any senator who voted to allow Montenegro or North Macedonia into NATO to turn around and deny membership to Finland and Sweden,” Cotton said. “I would love to hear the defense of such a curious vote.” The Arkansas Republican is another official who seems to be laying the groundwork for a presidential bid in 2024, making several trips to the early nominating state of Iowa this year. Hawley told HuffPost on Thursday that he doesn’t think Finland and Sweden joining NATO would be at all comparable to North Macedonia and Montenegro doing so. “Their entrance to NATO presents no strategic implications for the United States in terms of our posture, our military forces in Europe,” Hawley said. “Finland and Sweden present huge, huge strategic implications for the United States. Finland has an 830-mile border with Russia. Sweden already wants increased U.S. naval presence in the Baltic Sea.” Hawley also questioned whether Finland will maintain its current military spending, and argued that adding the two countries to NATO would ultimately burden the U.S. Cotton, on the other hand, said that adding Finland and Sweden to NATO would make it easier, not harder, for the U.S. and its allies to defend themselves from Russia. “Aside from their military strength and economic power, Finland and Sweden also allow us to turn the Baltic into a NATO lake, bottle up Russia’s Baltic Fleet, cut off its isolated military base at Kaliningrad, and expose Russia itself to much greater risk in the event of a conflict,” he said. Finland and Sweden’s entry into NATO is not yet a done deal. All NATO parliaments must ratify new members, and Turkey has threatened to block their accession. But the overwhelming Senate vote on Tuesday sent an unmistakable message of bipartisan unity in support of Europe, with ambassadors from Finland and Sweden watching the proceedings from the public gallery above the Senate floor. “We are at an unparalleled moment in history,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said. “Since Vladimir Putin’s cruel, unjustified invasion of Ukraine, people all over the world have been waking up out of a two-year plague, out of a slumber, to realize just how fragile our democracy is.” “We realized it here in this building when, not so long along, insurrectionists invaded this Chamber,” Klobuchar said, referring to the events of Jan. 6, 2021. Hawley played a starring role that day — raising his fist to the Donald Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol and then, after the attack, voting against certification of Trump’s 2020 election loss. “We didn’t just sit back and say, ‘Well, there goes our democracy,’” Klobuchar said. “We stood up. We stood up, Democrats and Republicans, in this very chamber.”",4.583707772711292,5.07988854084669,-0.4961807681353978,11

The Treasury Department said it is sanctioning, among others, Olympic gold medalist Alina Maratovna Kabaeva, a former state Duma member and head of a pro-Kremlin media empire. She has a “close relationship to Putin,” Treasury said. Treasury’s list also includes Putin ally Andrey Grigoryevich Guryev, who served in the Russian government and owns a leading chemical company, as well as his yacht Alfa Nero, which Treasury said has “reportedly shut off its location tracking hardware in order to avoid seizure.” The sanctions extend to Guryev’s son, Andrey Andreevich Guryev. Viktor Filippovich Rashnikov, the owner of one of the world’s biggest steel companies who Treasury said provides a big source of revenue for the Kremlin, is also subject to sanctions, as is Natalya Valeryevna Popova, the deputy director of a Russian technology company. “As innocent people suffer from Russia’s illegal war of aggression, Putin’s allies have enriched themselves and funded opulent lifestyles,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. We “will use every tool at our disposal to make sure that Russian elites and the Kremlin’s enablers are held accountable for their complicity in a war that has cost countless lives,” Yellen added. The State Department on Tuesday also announced further sanctions on 24 Russian defense and technology-related entities. “Russia has systematically focused on exploiting high-technology research and innovations to advance Moscow’s war-fighting capabilities – the same defense capabilities that Russia’s military is using in its vicious attacks hitting Ukraine’s population centers and resulting in the deaths of civilians, including children,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Blinken singled out three Russian oligarchs: Dmitry Aleksandrovich Pumpyanskiy, Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko and Alexander Anatolevich Ponomarenko. The State Department has also issued visa restrictions on 893 Russian Federation officials and 31 foreign government officials who have supported Russia’s annexation of Crimea. “The United States will not waver in its support for the brave people of Ukraine and will continue to promote accountability for President Putin and his cronies whose actions have caused so much suffering and destruction in Ukraine,” he said. Daniel Fried, a former coordinator for U.S. sanctions policy in Barack Obama’s administration, commended U.S. efforts to punish Putin but said they were not enough. He told The New York Times a global price ceiling on the purchase price of Russian oil, which G-7 leaders discussed in June, would be a stronger measure. “They need to deliver — it’s been a month,” Fried said. “They need something effective to eat into Putin’s income. This package is good, but the need requires even more.”",4.443865182890103,4.372357723653091,0.07150745923701152,23

Trump claimed on the Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show that Griner entered Russia “loaded up with drugs.” In fact she had .7 grams (.024 ounces) of cannabis oil, which is legal in her home state of Arizona and in many other states in America. Russian media, which reported the amount, said officials considered it “significant.” Griner, who said she had a doctor’s note for the cannabis oil, explained in a Russian court when she pleaded guilty early this month that she had forgotten that it was in her bag and brought it into the country inadvertently. The athlete was arrested as Russian officials were railing against Western sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine. Griner faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of transporting drugs. Trump criticized reports that the U.S. is considering trading notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, being held in an American prison, to secure the release of Griner and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence in Russia on what U.S. officials call baseless espionage charges. Griner “knew you don’t go in there loaded up with drugs, and she admitted it,” Trump said. “I assume she admitted it without too much force because it is what it is, and it certainly doesn’t seem like a very good trade, does it?” he added. Bout is “absolutely one of the worst in the world, and he’s gonna be given his freedom because a potentially spoiled person goes into Russia loaded up with drugs.” Griner “went in there loaded up with drugs into a hostile territory where they’re very vigilant about drugs,” Trump complained. “They don’t like drugs. And she got caught.” He added: “Now we’re supposed to get her out — and she makes, you know, a lot of money. We’re supposed to get her out for an absolute killer and one of the biggest arms dealers in the world. Killed many Americans. Killed many people, and he’s going to get a free card,” Trump added. Trump called WNBA star Brittney Griner, “spoiled,” and implied he wouldn’t have made the deal to get her out of prison in Russia.  Critics accused Trump of singling out Griner for criticism because she’s Black, gay and a woman. He also has a long history of standing up for Russia, even against American interests, and frequently touts his great friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. When Putin launched the invasion into Ukraine earlier this year, the former president called it “genius.” Trump openly asked for Russia’s help in 2016 to hack into rival Hillary Clinton’s emails, and then used material stolen by Russian spies to attack Clinton in the final stretch of the election.

Here's What No One Is Telling You About The War.,"People ask me how I’m doing in exile. Well, let’s see ― my city is being bombed, my country’s future is under threat from a superpower, the father of my children is at war, and I’m a thousand miles from home in a country where I don’t speak the language, have no job, and can only watch my savings dwindle to zero while I try to provide for my two boys, my mother and our dog. Then there’s the guilt for abandoning the fight, when a big part of me would like to be in Donbas killing every Russian soldier I can find. Until late February, I was an independent, self-supporting woman ― a journalist and the main breadwinner for my family. When the bombs started to fall near our apartment in Kyiv, I had a terrible decision to make: stay and fight, or take my family away from the bombs. With no one else to ensure their safety, I chose the latter. First we went to Lviv ― spending long hours in a packed van to get there ― to stay with an online gaming acquaintance from “Clash of Clans” who I’d never met in person. When the bombs started falling there, too, we spent hours in the basement, and then joined the refugee flow heading west, which meant several more days of traveling with all of us and the dog. As a journalist, I’ve covered refugee camps. Now, along the way, I found myself living in one. In my former life, I gave to charities (I still do, whenever I can). On the road, I was accepting the charity of strangers: food, transport, a night in a hotel when we were on the verge of collapse. Our destination was a small town in central Italy, where I knew exactly one person ― another member of our Clan. I’m not one to shrink from a challenge. Once we finally arrived, I got the kids into school, settled my mother in our borrowed house, and found some part-time jobs: kitchen work at a pizzeria, then at a steakhouse, later as a maid in a hotel packed with Ukrainian refugees. (That will be a whole chapter in my book someday!) On top of all that, I discovered that millions of Ukrainian refugee women like me are the target of online ridicule from some of our fellow citizens who think we left the country because we’re “lazy” and “cowardly,” and that we did it for the aid money. The money? One recent morning, I traveled 300 kilometers (186 miles) to arrive at the Ukrainian Consulate at 8:00 a.m. Even though it wouldn’t open for another two hours, there were 25 women in front of me, most with kids, hoping to qualify for 300 Euros ($316) per month for each adult and half that for each child ― and only for a maximum of three months. I was so thankful for that money, but it didn’t last long. A woman in line said to me, “Every day is Friday the 13th here.” One person tried to guilt me on social media by writing, “I know someone who brought her four kids to a friend in Western Ukraine and came back to Kyiv to work for victory.” Please tell me, where do I find such friends? And if I did, could I stand to leave my boys with them for the long term? Exile is particularly hard on the children ― anger, tears, acting out. If at all possible, they need at least one parent with them. There’s nothing I’d rather do than go home, if only I could do so and still take care of my family. I salute those who are able to stay, and I work to help them in any way I can. But my reasons for leaving, like those of any refugee, are enough. We don’t have to justify our decisions to anyone, particularly people who put in earbuds to tune out politics and listened to Russian rap for the past eight years while some of us worked to raise the alarm about the simmering conflict. We know who really cares about us. They’re the people who write, as five of my friends did one recent day when bombs fell on Kyiv: “It’s too dangerous. Stay where you are.” Still, many of the refugees I meet are mired in despair, sadness and depression, which seem to be the only socially acceptable emotions for them to feel or express. God forbid anyone should post a photo of themselves on the beach or at a football match. Such a person would have to be a heartless traitor! But succumbing to that view is a crime in two ways: It doesn’t make our lives easier, and it won’t help win the war. Instead, I don’t let my emotions stop me from doing everything I can to contribute to the war effort, and I encourage others to do the same. It’s hard to be productive or creative when you’re depressed, so I fight it. I share, tweet and retweet constantly. I speak to my foreign friends about Ukraine, about our courage and all the best of our nation. I use social media to spread the truth about Ukraine, because Russia never stops spouting its lies. When I can, I use my contacts to facilitate the shipment of ammo, flak jackets and medicine to our brave fighters. And I try not to feel guilty about those moments when I can enjoy life ― when I can laugh with my kids, sample the local food, and yes, even go to the beach. When I was a journalist traveling in Donbas and Crimea from 2014 through 2021, my colleagues and I had a motto: “Enjoy life whenever you can.” We would go out for dinners and vodka, and laugh while the bombs fell, because we knew the next one could fall on us. Here in exile, we are safe from the bombs. But the weight of the war is on us, along with worry about our children’s future and fear for our friends and family left behind. And the guilt is here, too, in spite of my efforts to shed it. All of that will slowly kill your spirit, as surely as a bomb will kill your body. We Ukrainians have had enough sadness and despair to last the rest of our lives, and there’s likely more to come. In the meantime, we must all do our part, and respect and love each other for it. And, to our foreign friends: We are no longer in the headlines every day, but please do not forget us. We need all of you ― not just your governments ― to do everything you can to help us secure our democracy and protect the West from Russia’s aggression. (Two organizations that are doing excellent work and could use more support are the Women Veterans Foundation and Come Back Alive.) So, how am I doing? On the bright side, I learned to make pizza.

Burns on Wednesday dismissed suggestions that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in poor physical condition, calling him “entirely too healthy.” “There are lots of rumors about President Putin’s health and as far as we can tell, he’s entirely too healthy,” Burns told NBC’s Andrea Mitchell in an interview in Colorado as part of the Aspen Security Forum. “It’s not a formal intelligence judgment,” Burns added.

Assertions to the contrary are “nothing but hoaxes,” Peskov added. Putin’s reality-defying statements, disappearances from public view or even slight stumbles in public often set off speculation about his health. Burns explained Putin’s style of decision-making. “His views have hardened, in my experience over the years, but he’s got his own way of looking at reality,” Burns said. “And as we, you know, could see in the first stages of this war, it was based on some profoundly flawed assumptions and some real illusions, especially about Ukraine and the will to resist in Ukraine, which he’s helped to create in many ways by aggression now over a period of at least the eight years since 2014.” Putin this week visited Iran in only his second international trip the Ukraine invasion. The Russian leader earned the support of Tehran, according to The Associated Press. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said Russia would have faced an attack by NATO if it hadn’t attacked Ukraine — a claim that echoes a Putin pretext to justify the invasion. Asked if Iran’s missile and drone system should be a concern to the U.S. and its allies, Burns said it’s “certainly an increasingly significant threat.” “They have the biggest arsenal of missiles of anyone in the Middle East right now,” Burns said. “And you know, it’s a mark of the development of their armed drone system that you have the Russians now trying to acquire some as well.” The White House said earlier this month that Russians have visited an airfield in Iran twice looking at drones to use in their war against Ukraine, according to AP.",3.6117058179465893,4.8002201366360895,-1.1885143186895002,15

Griner, a star of the Phoenix Mercury, has been detained in Russia on drug charges since February, after vape cannisters with cannabis oil were allegedly found in her luggage at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport. She pleaded guilty last week. Players on both teams wore jerseys with the number 42 throughout the second half of the All-Star contest at Chicago’s Wintrust Arena. The Phoenix Mercury logo and Griner’s name also appeared on the uniforms. Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, was seated courtside during the display. Several players hugged her. Every player in the #WNBAAllStar Game came out to start the second half in Brittney Griner's No. 42 jersey.  “We are not going to stop until everyone understands how serious this really is,” A’ja Wilson, a Las Vegas Aces forward and captain of one of the All-Star teams, said. Griner, who has played seven All-Star games in her career, has been designated by the U.S. State Department as wrongfully detained in Russia. She pleaded guilty on Thursday to drug possession and smuggling, but said she had no intention of committing a crime, telling the Moscow court she packed in a hurry and included the canisters by accident. She could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of large-scale transportation of drugs. She had been returning to Russia to play in the Russian League, where she plays in the WNBA off-season.",5.641449886183313,3.4364945095176616,2.2049553766656516,0

Michael Flynn to recoup a portion of hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments he received from Russia and Turkey before he became Donald Trump’s national security adviser in 2017, The Washington Post reported Friday. The Army is seeking nearly $40,000 from Flynn after he was cited by the Defense Department inspector general for failing to disclose lucrative speaking engagements and other business arrangements with foreign entities, according to the Post. Investigators determined that Flynn received nearly $450,000 from Turkish and Russian interests in 2015, including for an appearance in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, while failing to seek government approval beforehand, as required. He was also paid to appear at an October 2015 conference sponsored by Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, “an entity that appears to be controlled by the Russian government,” according to a memo early last year by Sean O’Donnell, the acting Defense Department inspector general, the Post reported. The Emoluments Clause of the Constitution prohibits retired military personnel from receiving money from foreign governments without prior authorization. Flynn could not be reached for comment. Flynn left the Trump administration within weeks over his connections to Russia amid the investigation into Kremlin interference into the 2016 presidential election.

Elizabeth Whelan retweeted a screenshot of the readout of Biden’s call with Cherelle Griner, the wife of the WNBA star, adding that she was “crushed” the Whelan family still has not received a call from the president. Whelan was arrested in Moscow in 2018 and was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges, according to The Associated Press. “Still looking for that press release saying @POTUS has spoken to anyone in OUR family about #PaulWhelan, wrongfully detained in #Russia for 3.5 years,” Whelan tweeted. “I am crushed. If he wants to talk about securing Paul’s release, he needs to be talking to the Whelans! What are we to think?!” Whelan continued. Speaking to CNN’s “The Lead” Wednesday afternoon, Whelan explained she did not “begrudge the Griner family and their supporters.” “I think our concern is, you know, why the outreach to some families and not others. There are 55-plus families who would like to have that same degree of attention,” Whelan said. Paul Whelan's sister wants families of detained Americans to see a more even-handed outreach from the Biden administration. @elizabethwhelan talks with @EricaRHill following a Biden & Harris phone call with Brittney Griner’s wife  Whelan added that her brother has written to Biden, as well as Donald Trump when he was president, and members of Congress multiple times. “I was astonished this morning to hear about this call and it did make me wonder: Should we be pushing for a meeting with the president? Is that what it’s going to take to bring my brother home? What I would really like to see is a functioning process that didn’t require that,” Whelan continued. David Whelan echoed his sister, telling CNN’s “New Day” Thursday he was pleased to hear of the call to Griner but lamented the administration’s “inconsistency.” “I was thrilled that President Biden and Vice President Harris took the time to speak with Ms. Griner,” Whelan said. “I think that the frustration to the extent that it is out there is directed towards the inconsistency of how the U.S. government interacts with wrongful detainees’ families,” Whelan added.

Griner, a 31-year-old two-time Olympic gold medalist and center for the Phoenix Mercury, was arrested in February when she traveled to Russia and authorities claimed they found cannabis oil in her luggage. On July 4, she wrote an impassioned letter to Biden asking him not to “forget about me,” and expressing fears that she “might be here forever.” Brittney Griner’s wife Cherelle says it is “very disheartening” that she still has not heard back from the White House — after Brittney penned a handwritten letter to Pres. Biden from a Russian prison pleading for help.  Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, told CBS News that the letter to Biden was the latest effort to get the president’s attention about the Olympian’s detention. Though the White House confirmed to The Associated Press that Biden received the letter, Cherelle Griner said the lack of response from the president has been “very disheartening.” “It kills me every time that, you know, when I have to write her and she’s asking, ‘Have you met with [the White House] yet?’ And I have to say no,” Cherelle told the outlet Tuesday. “I’m sure she is like, ‘I’m going to write him and ask now because my family has tried to no avail, so I’m going to do it myself.’” In her letter, Griner said she has been “terrified” as she sits alone in a Russian prison cell. “As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey, or any accomplishments, I’m terrified I might be here forever,” she wrote to Biden. Cherelle Griner said her wife’s words should be taken seriously. “She is probably the strongest person that I know, so she doesn’t say words like that lightly,” Cherelle told CBS News. “That means she truly is terrified that she may never see us again.

It hurts thinking about how I usually celebrate this day because freedom means something completely different to me this year.” Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a center for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained in February after Russian authorities said they found cannabis oil in her luggage while returning to the country to play for her Russian team. Her trial began last week, and she faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. NEW: A letter from Brittney Griner was sent to the White House today, making a direct appeal to President Biden for her freedom. Representatives shared the following excerpts:  The White House confirmed to The Associated Press that it had received Griner’s letter, adding the U.S. believed Russia was “wrongfully detaining” her. The entirety of the letter is being kept private. “President Biden has been clear about the need to see all U.S. nationals who are held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad released, including Brittney Griner,” Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, told the AP. “The U.S. government continues to work aggressively – using every available means – to bring her home.” The outlet added fewer than 1% of defendants in Russian criminal cases are acquitted, and those acquittals can be overturned. Legal experts told The New York Times she is likely to be found guilty, and her supporters have urged the White House to arrange a prisoner swap with the Kremlin. The U.S. and Russia did so in April, exchanging Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine held on assault charges, with a Russian pilot sentenced to 20 years in prison in the U.S. for drug trafficking. “I realize you are dealing with so much, but please don’t forget about me and the other American detainees,” Griner wrote to Biden. “Please do all you can to bring us home.” Vanessa Nygaard, the coach of the Mercury, addressed the letter Monday during a pre-game news conference. “It made me cry, you know, just hearing her words talking about her father being a Vietnam vet, her new perspective on freedom, her wanting to be with her family and her teammates, her not knowing if she’ll ever be free again,” Nygaard said, The Guardian reported.",2.5182338482559103,6.921873044052632,-4.403639195796722,0

When asked if it is time for President Joe Biden to push the two sides to the table as the war drags on, Kirby told “Fox News Sunday” the U.S. is committed to helping Ukraine fight Russia’s invasion. “It’s time for the United States to continue to support Ukraine, and that’s what we’re doing,” Kirby said. Kirby said the goal is to help Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his country prevail in the war so they are in a strong position to negotiate when that time comes. Kirby added Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no interest in peace talks, pointing to the latest airstrikes in Kyiv. While G7 leaders were meeting in Europe on June 26, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said Russian airstrikes hit at least two residential buildings, killing at least one person, according to The Associated Press. Last week, Russia reportedly struck a shopping mall in Kremenchuk, Ukraine killing at least 20 people, while Russian missiles in Odesa killed at least 19 people Friday. “President Zelenskyy, he gets to determine how victory is decided and when and on what terms,” Kirby said. “And [what] we’re going to do is continue to make sure that can succeed on the battlefield so that he can succeed at the table. But even President Zelenskyy will tell you that the time is not now for those discussions.” The former Pentagon spokesman noted U.S. alone has spent over $7 billion to support the Ukrainians since the beginning of the war in February. “We don’t want to see Ukraine defeated by Russia and that’s why we are continuing to rush aid and assistance,” Kirby said. Meanwhile, on Monday Russia scored a victory in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk after Ukrainians withdrew their forces from the area on Sunday, according to The Associated Press. “Russia’s focus will now almost certainly switch to capturing Donetsk Oblast, a large portion of which remain under the control of Ukrainian forces,” tweeted the British Ministry of Defense.

More than a million Ukrainians forcibly relocated to Russia since the war in Ukraine started, including more than 180,000 children. An 11-year-old Ukrainian boy, raped as his mother was tied to a chair and forced to watch. The mounting allegations against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have been described as war crimes or even crimes against humanity. But human rights groups and others are debating if they amount to genocide, at least as defined in international law. Declaring Ukrainians to be the victims of a genocide may not have huge practical implications, but the historic weight of the word, with its overtones of the Holocaust, the killing fields of Cambodia and the breakup of Yugoslavia, may matter more. War crimes and crimes against humanity are deplored, but genocide by its nature implies the need for more forceful, immediate action. And though President Joe Biden has said he thinks it’s genocide, that concern over the obligations the label would impose may be why there’s wariness on Capitol Hill to follow suit. Rep Steny Hoyer (Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House and a former chair of the human rights-focused U.S. Helsinki Commission, said he was not sure if the word “genocide” was applicable because he thought of it in terms of ethnic groups. “The way I think about genocide is Hitler getting rid of the Jews or, frankly, to some degree, what we did with Indians or what Christians did to the Muslims because they were Muslims in the Crusades,” he said. Though that perception is widely shared, it’s actually not the definition under international law. “People confuse genocide with mass murder and mass atrocities,” said Azeem Ibrahim, director of special initiatives for the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, pointing to the definition in a 1948 international treaty. “The number of people being killed is not relevant to what the Genocide Convention actually says. What is relevant is the intent of the parties to eliminate a group in whole or in part using all the various means at their disposal,” he said. If that intent exists, genocide can include: The accusations against Russia certainly check off many of those boxes. Aside from the above incidents cited in a report by New Lines and the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, Russia has been accused of indiscriminately bombing civilian targets, including apartment buildings and malls; blocking the transport of and stealing Ukrainian grain exports; and bombing health care facilities, including a maternity hospital in Mariupol. In April, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, denied Russian troops had committed atrocities. Russia has also claimed that conditions in the eastern part of Ukraine it had seized were akin to genocide for Russian-speaking people before it invaded. Still, the report by New Lines and the Wallenberg Centre said Russia was guilty of “incitement to commit genocide” and a “pattern of atrocities” from which an intent to destroy the Ukrainian people could be inferred. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, said it is observing and documenting what’s happening in Ukraine. Rachel Denber, the group’s deputy director for Europe and Central Asia, said it was documenting “grave breaches” of international law and “heinous acts of murder, torture, inhuman conditions of detention.” “I think it’s really important to focus on the evidence that we are documenting and what it is that our findings are so far because they’re really quite serious. The crime of genocide has a very specific threshold for intent, and while evidence of intent may become apparent, for now the most effective thing we can do is to continue to do our documentation of the conduct of the Russian forces,” she said. But even some old foreign policy hands on Capitol Hill are reluctant to go as far as the human rights community may be headed. “I don’t put this in the same category as the Holocaust,” said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee since 1997. “I guess if you looked at the whole of Ukraine together, you could add up a lot of atrocities that might add up to [genocide].” Sherman, who supports aiding Ukraine, said the cost of justice has to be weighed against the costs to the U.S., the costs to the Ukrainians fighting and the risk of a nuclear war. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a staunch Ukraine supporter, also demurred when asked if he thought Russia had crossed the line. “I’m in favor of helping Ukraine and giving them what they need to beat the Russians,” he said. “If you could walk the streets of Irpin and Hostomel, like I did, and listen to the stories that those people told about what the Russian soldiers did — this is a genocide. The world needs to recognize it as such.” The State Department, which has recognized three instances of genocide since 2021 — the treatment of Muslim Uyghurs in China, the Rohingya in Burma and the Armenians in Turkey in 1915 — also has yet to follow Biden’s lead to add Ukraine to that list. “We are aware of the New Lines Institute report. We are deeply concerned by the report’s findings and by what we are seeing, particularly with respect to the apparent gratuitousness of violence by members of Russia’s forces,” a State Department spokesperson told HuffPost. “That is why we are working with allies and partners to gather, review and preserve evidence of atrocities and make it available to the appropriate bodies to hold those responsible to account.” In the Senate, though, two members of the Foreign Relations Committee have no doubts. “There is no question that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is a genocide,” Sen. Jim Risch (Idaho), the top Republican on the panel, told HuffPost. “If you could walk the streets of Irpin and Hostomel, like I did, and listen to the stories that those people told about what the Russian soldiers did ― this is a genocide. The world needs to recognize it as such,” he said. “I think they’ve passed the international definition of genocide,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.). “I thought they passed that a while ago. Transporting people, in some cases unaccompanied children, into Russia with clear intentions of removing them from their culture, that’s genocide.” Under the Genocide Convention, countries are required to take measures to prevent and punish genocide. The U.S., which has signed on to the treaty, has provided assistance to Ukraine to investigate and document “war crimes and other atrocities” in addition to imposing punishing economic sanctions and providing weapons and training to Ukraine. “The ‘prevent’ comes first. The entire purpose of the convention, its primary purpose, is to prevent genocide from happening.” Risch said the United States is already doing a lot, but not enough. “I personally would do more,” he said, declining to elaborate. Risch said he thinks the wariness to call what is happening genocide may stem from unfamiliarity with the definition. “The Holocaust is the Holocaust. This, like many genocides, has its own marks and should be judged in that regard,” he said. Ibrahim, from New Lines, said the focus should not be on whether the definition has been met because the mere risk of genocide, which has been documented in their report, was enough to trigger the genocide treaty’s obligations. The question, he said, was whether the 150-plus countries that signed the Genocide Convention would live up to their obligations. “This is important because what’s happened too often in our lifetimes is whether something is a genocide or not becomes an academic exercise after the fact,” he said. “The ‘prevent’ comes first. The entire purpose of the convention, its primary purpose, is to prevent genocide from happening.”",5.0286345406114075,4.151759741104218,0.8768747995071893,2

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia attacked the mall on Monday while over 1,000 people were inside. The attack killed at least 18 people, while 36 remain missing, according to Human Rights Watch. Russia’s defense ministry denied the attack was meant to target civilians, according to Reuters. “In Kremenchuk, Russian forces struck a weapons depot storing arms received from the United States and Europe with high-precision air-based weapons,” the ministry said in a daily statement Tuesday on the state of the war. The Russians also disputed Zelenskyy’s statement that the mall was crowded. “The detonation of stored ammunition for Western weapons caused a fire in a non-functioning shopping centre located next to the depot,” the statement continues. CCTV footage, cited by The Guardian, showed there were two missiles fired in the area within minutes of each other. The first hit the shopping mall, while the second struck a nearby factory, the one Russia claims was used to store weapons. Human Rights Watch said it conducted two in-site investigations at the factory in question and did not uncover any evidence to support Russia’s claims that the facility was used to store military equipment provided by the West. “It’s a place for making road equipment, machines for road construction,” Svitlana Rybalko, from the regional State Emergency Service, told the BBC. “There’s also a greenhouse nearby where workers grow cucumbers.” The BBC reported that the factory is about 300 meters away from the shopping center, separated by a wall and rail tracks. This shows that Russia’s claims that “secondary explosions” are responsible for a fire inside the mall are “unlikely,” the BBC wrote. Witnesses have also cast doubt on Russia’s allegation that the mall was not in operation. The BBC labeled the claim as “false” after talking to several staff and shoppers, including a woman living in a village nearby who regularly visits the area for shopping and said the mall has been “constantly open.” The woman showed the BBC video shot inside the mall two days before the attack, with shoppers walking around and stores open for business. Human Rights Watch said it spoke to 15 people, including local officials and some of those injured in the attack, who confirmed the center was open to the public. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, on Monday presented another allegation ― which contradicts the defense ministry’s statement on Tuesday ― claiming the attack was staged. “Looks like we are dealing with a new #Bucha-style #Ukrainian provocation,” Polyanskiy tweeted. Russia previously claimed that photos and videos of atrocities committed by its soldiers in Bucha, Ukraine, were fake. Looks like we are dealing with a new #Bucha-style #Ukrainian provocation. One should wait for what our Ministry of Defence will say, but there are too many striking discrepancies already. Exactly what Kiev regime needs to keep focus of attention on #Ukraine before #NATOSummit In another Twitter message, reported by the BBC, Polyanskiy said his tweet did not contradict Russia’s Ministry of Defense. Polanskiy added reports of the attack “will be used by Ukraine to attract as much attention as possible through promoting [a] false version of what happened.” Reports of the incident have garnered the attention of world leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday called the attack “a new war crime.” “Russia cannot and should not win,” Macron said at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, according to The Associated Press. Zelenskyy also addressed the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday saying Russia is a “terrorist state,” committing “daily terrorist acts.” “We need to act urgently to do everything to make Russia stop the killing spree,” Zelenskyy said.",5.313833790315435,4.251242944068621,1.062590846246814,17
2022-06-23,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ukraine-european-union-candidate_n_62b1fc19e4b06594c1dc2906,Ukraine Is Now Officially A Candidate For The European Union,"European leaders gave Ukraine the status of a European Union candidate at a summit on Thursday in a key sign of ongoing support for Ukrainian resistance against Russian invaders and confidence in Ukraine’s future. The president of the European Council, former Belgian prime minister Charles Michel, announced the news on Twitter. “A historic moment,” Michel wrote. “Our future is together.” The council — which comprises the heads of state of all EU member countries — additionally approved candidate status for Moldova, which also worries about Russian ambition regarding its territory. Neither country will immediately join the 27-country bloc: European officials want both countries to improve their judicial systems and tackle systematic corruption to meet EU standards before beginning membership negotiations, which are unlikely to start any time soon. But gaining candidate status is likely to boost Ukrainian morale amid tough fighting in the country’s east, and analysts say the move should help Ukrainian activists secure difficult domestic reforms. Ukraine applied to join the EU days after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of the country in February. Top Ukrainians, including President Volodymr Zelenskyy, and their international supporters have spent months promoting the idea of membership for Kyiv ― and won broad European agreement in an extremely short time considering the difficulty of securing unanimous support from EU members. The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, recommended candidacy status for Ukraine last week, and even EU states close to Russia, such as Hungary, have not sought to block the plan. Though Putin has cited Ukraine’s ties to the West as a concern that helped drive his decision to invade, he has said he does not have a problem with seeing the country as an EU member. Still, Zelenskyy has warned of possible Russian retaliation to the move, like an uptick in assaults on Ukrainian targets. The EU has a mutual defense clause, but most governments see it as far weaker than the joint defense agreement in the NATO military alliance, which also includes the United States and former E.U. member Britain. That’s a key reason why European Union members Sweden and Finland reacted to Russia’s incursion into Ukraine by rushing to join NATO. Moving toward EU membership could be a major boon for Ukraine. Symbolically, it would demonstrate Kyiv’s independence from Russia, where Putin and his allies have repeatedly questioned whether Ukrainians should be acknowledged as separate from Russians. And economically, drawing closer to the EU would likely make Ukraine more attractive to international investors, while eventual membership could come with major development grants from the union. “Sincerely commend EU leaders’ decision... it’s a unique and historical moment,” Zelenksyy wrote on Twitter after the news broke. Several other countries, including Turkey and Serbia, are also EU candidates, yet their membership processes are largely frozen. European solidarity with Ukraine ― and horror at Russian brutality during the war ― makes Kyiv’s bid seem more likely to succeed in the years ahead. And for now, the stamp of approval from the heads of state of EU members could also help address the growing war-weariness among some Europeans, showing that assistance to Ukrainians extends beyond weapon shipments. The EU has separately imposed several rounds of unprecedented sanctions on Moscow to try to pressure Putin to halt his assault, including a ban on most imports of oil from Russia.",4.338164135574735,4.612819686309623,-0.274655550734888,25

Photographer Stanislav Senyk told Reuters he wanted to document the “very important story” of roughly 40 students graduating from schools in Chernihiv in northern Ukraine after witnessing the horrors of the war there. “I saw the children who were there and it was like some kind of surrealism going on,” Senyk said. “I realized that I could write a very important story at that moment, about schoolchildren who were graduating and who had witnessed the war, and because of that their graduation, their prom, their everything, just cracked,” he said. “It was very important to capture that memory.” Photographer Stanislav Senyk has used the destruction in the eastern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv as a sobering backdrop for an album of graduating high school students, amid the ongoing conflict with Russia  One of the photos features a group of students huddled atop a tank.

The men missing are Alexander John-Robert Drueke, a 39-year-old from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, who served as a U.S. Army staff sergeant, and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, a 27-year-old from Hartselle, Alabama, who served as a Marine. Their families said they last heard from them on June 8. Joy Black, Huynh’s fiance, told CNN the families have no information on what happened or the two men’s whereabouts. “We don’t want to make assumptions about what might have happened at this time,” Black said. “Obviously they’re looking at several scenarios. And one of them is that they might have been captured. But we don’t have absolute confirmation of that at this time.” Drueke’s family said in a statement that the two men disappeared when their unit was met with “heavy fire” on June 9 in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine. Subsequent searches for them did not yield any results. “This could mean they are in hiding or it could mean they have been captured,” said Drueke’s mother, Bunny Drueke, according to The New York Times. The State Department said Wednesday that officials “are aware of unconfirmed reports of two U.S. citizens captured in Ukraine,” according to CNN. “We are closely monitoring the situation and are in contact with Ukrainian authorities,” the spokesperson continued. “Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.” If the men were captured by the Russians, they would be the first U.S. prisoners of war in this conflict. John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said at a White House briefing Wednesday that he was unable to confirm the reports. “If it’s true, we’ll do everything we can to get them safely back home,” Kirby told reporters. Kirby said Americans should not be traveling to Ukraine at this time. “If you feel passionate about supporting Ukraine, there’s any number of other ways to do that that are safer and just as effective,” Kirby said. “Ukraine is not the place for Americans to be traveling.” Bunny Drueke and Black did a joint interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper Wednesday evening. Drueke spoke about her son’s motivation for going to Ukraine. “He is one of the most loyal Americans you would ever hope to meet and he was proud to serve his country,” Drueke said. “He said, ‘Mom, I really need to go and help fight in Ukraine because if Putin is not stopped there, he is not going to be satisfied, he will become emboldened and eventually Americans will be threatened.’” Black said she is proud of her fiance. “He’s just so strong and he has such a big heart,” Black said. “He didn’t go there for selfish reasons or anything. He really had this gnawing at his heart and this big burden on him to go and serve the people however he can.” “I know it’s not a great situation, but I’m still very proud of him and I just want to see him back safely,” Black said. Two Americans who were fighting alongside Ukrainian forces north of Kharkiv have been missing since June 9th. CNN’s @andersoncooper has more on the efforts to find them.  The State Department announced Wednesday the U.S. is sending an additional $1 billion to Ukraine for military assistance. This brings the total amount the U.S. has contributed since Russia invaded the country on Feb. 24 to $5.6 billion. President Joe Biden said he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Wednesday the U.S. will also provide $225 million in humanitarian assistance for Ukrainians. “I reaffirmed my commitment that the United States will stand by Ukraine as it defends its democracy and support its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression,” Biden said.",3.501423378740977,4.217499251563218,-0.7160758728222412,18

But we are very focused on this. We are determined to bring her home.” Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who is lesbian and plays basketball in Russia during the WNBA offseason, was detained at a Moscow airport in February after local authorities claimed she was carrying vape cartridges containing cannabis oil. They accused her of “smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance,” an offense punishable in Russia by up to 10 years in prison. Last month, the State Department reclassified Griner’s status as “wrongfully detained,” meaning the United States will work more aggressively to secure her release. Russian officials on Tuesday extended Griner’s detention for the third time. That means she will remain in Russian custody through at least July 2. During Wednesday’s roundtable, Blinken said he has spoken to Griner’s partner and his team has spoken “extensively” to Griner’s lawyers, advocates and teammates about the situation. Beyond that, he wouldn’t give details about the status of talks with Russian officials. “Just know this is a matter of intense focus for us,” he said. When asked why it took two months for the State Department to classify Griner as “wrongfully detained,” Blinken said there’s a formal process the department has to go through, and a set of specific criteria for meeting that definition. Those criteria include whether someone is being detained as a political pawn, whether someone is being held simply because he or she is an American, and whether due process is being afforded. Blinken said the department weighs all criteria before concluding if someone has been wrongfully detained overseas. “We have to follow the letter of the law,” he said. “This is a situation that we have in a multiplicity of countries. The first thing is to make a determination about whether any individual is being unjustly detained ... And that’s what we did in the case of Brittney Griner.”",7.118001996821685,6.4792052454352715,0.6387967513864137,0

In February, Griner was detained at a Moscow airport after allegedly carrying marijuana vape cartridges in her luggage. She was in Russia playing for UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason. On Sunday, the Los Angeles Lakers superstar posted a message on Twitter calling for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to get Griner home “swiftly and safely.” The legendary ball player also called on athletes to band together and take action regarding Griner’s detainment. “We need to come together and help do whatever we possibly can to bring BG home quickly and safely!! Our voice as athletes is stronger together,” James said in a tweet pleading for support. “As a decorated Olympian and member of an elite global sport community, BG’s detention must be resolved out of respect for the sanctity of all sport and for all Americans traveling internationally,” James wrote on Twitter.

Russian authorities charged Griner with smuggling “narcotic drugs.” She could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Last month, Griner’s lawyer said the Phoenix Mercury star’s pretrial detention was extended by one month. The U.S. Department of State also determined last month that the WNBA athlete was “wrongfully detained” when she was arrested in February. The classification means that the U.S. will push harder for Griner’s return home, even as her legal case continues to unfold overseas, The Associated Press reported. James is one of the latest NBA stars to join the chorus of voices calling for Griner’s release.

In a Monday evening tweet, European Council president Charles Michel announced the deal and said it would hit Moscow’s “war machine.” “Maximum pressure on Russia to end the war,” Michel continued. The deal is a huge step for the EU’s 27 economies ― for which Russia is a major source of energy ― and a big boost for the Ukrainians. The policy will cut off around 70% of Russian oil immediately by halting tankers, and officials say it will eventually cease over 90% of Russian oil sales. Though the plan exempts oil transfers by pipelines for now, European diplomats say that trade could also ultimately be stopped. #Unity Agreement to ban export of Russian oil to the EU. This immediately covers more than 2/3 of oil imports from Russia, cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine. Maximum pressure on Russia to end the war. #EUCO More than a quarter of the EU’s imported oil came from Russia last year. Ukraine’s government and prominent international commentators have blasted Europe for continuing to pay Russia for oil and gas even after the war began in late February ― specifically criticizing Germany, the EU’s biggest economy. A third of Berlin’s oil comes from Russia, and experts in the country say that cutting off that supply, along with Russian gas, could cause severe economic pain for Germans. Germany began signaling in late April that it was open to an oil ban. But Hungary ― whose government has a close relationship with Russia and is a major Russian oil importer via pipeline — aggressively resisted the policy as EU negotiations intensified. European leaders struggled to finally craft an agreement that would satisfy Hungary, spurring fears that the bloc was becoming less supportive of Ukraine’s resistance. Top EU figures finally reached a compromise after a summit in Brussels on May 30. European nations had earlier decided to stop importing coal from Russia, and has instituted five previous sets of unprecedented sanctions on Russian government officials and institutions like major banks. The U.S. and Britain have already barred imports of Russian oil. Global oil exports earn Moscow hundreds of millions of dollars each day. That revenue provides a major share of Putin’s total budget for undertakings like his assault on Ukraine. Russia also earns billions by pumping gas to Europe. In April, Putin shut off gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria in response to their support for Ukraine, leading to anxiety in Europe about the continent’s dependence on Russian energy supplies.

What Does That Mean For Ukraine War?,"The Kremlin has fired several senior officials managing its invasion of Ukraine, yet another sign that the Russian war effort is significantly faltering. In its latest Twitter update, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) claimed that Moscow’s centralized command is only going to come under more pressure as it tries to re-establish control behind the scenes. The MoD explained that Russia “has fired senior commanders who are considered to have performed poorly during the opening stages of its invasion of Ukraine.” Lieutenant General Serhiy Kisel, who commanded the elite 1st Guards Tank Army, has been suspended after he was unable to capture Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv. Ukrainian resistance “appear to have won the battle of Kharkiv” according to the U.S. think tank Institute for the Study of War, after Russian units were unable to hold their lines around the city. Russia has been bombarding the city since the war began three months ago, but the troops were not able to even encircle Kharkiv and were subsequently expelled. The commander behind Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, Vice Admiral Igor Osipov, is also likely to have been suspended after the cruiser Moskva sank in April. It was Russia’s flagship Black Sea missile cruiser which was struck down by two Ukrainian missiles, a huge symbolic and military blow to the Kremlin at a time when it was already losing morale. The U.K. officials also think that Russian chief of the General Staff Valeriy Gerasimov is still in post, “but it is unclear whether he retains the confidence of President Putin.” Without a clear command system, the Russian forces – already said to be disorganized and lacking supplies – are unlikely to secure any victories in Ukraine any time soon. As the MoD summarized: “A culture of cover-ups and scape-goating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system. “Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia’s operational set-backs. “This will likely place further strain on Russia’s centralized model of command and control, as officers increasingly seek to defer key decisions to their superiors. “It will be difficult for Russia to regain the initiative under these conditions.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 19 May 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  There seems to be a major problem with top military officials within the Russian forces right now. Ukraine’s ministry of defense claimed earlier this month that U.S. intelligence has helped it to find and kill 12 Russian generals since the war began. Neither Russia nor the U.S. have confirmed this number, although the U.S. National Security Council later claimed that it was providing “battlefield intelligence” to Ukraine, and did not have intent “to kill Russian generals.” While the details of this claim remain unclear, this is just one of many signs that central control is falling apart in Russia. President Vladimir Putin is also said to have taken over the day-to-day management of the war, despite such tasks typically falling to more junior commanders. “We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision-making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier,” a Western military source said, according to the Guardian. Yohann Michel, defence and military research analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the i newspaper: “If you’re trying to be both general and captain, you are usually doing neither and you are creating uncertainty at every level of the chain of command.” He added: “The Russian armed forces don’t need to have this level of micro-management from the top who have problems of their own.” Russia’s war effort is going so badly even a retired colonel broke rank on state TV and admitted: “Sometimes information is being spread about some sort of psychological breakdown in Ukraine’s Armed Forces, suggesting some sort of a breakthrough is imminent. “None of this has a basis in reality.”",4.275545071459336,5.280312443356777,-1.004767371897441,22

Bush, you think you’d just steer clear of giving any speech about one man launching a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion,” wrote former Michigan congressman Justin Amash. “This should be admissible as evidence at The Hague,” said writer Daniel Denvir.

The BBC interview was arranged through Denis Seleznev, a blogger who backs pro-Russian separatists. Speaking from a separatist part of her native Donbas region, where she has since relocated, the 29-year-old woman who used to work as a beauty influencer described how her life changed overnight. “We had a quiet and simple life,” Vyshermirsky said. “And then, of course, things were turned upside down.” She described the dramatic scene at the maternity hospital after it was bombed on May 9, with patients and staff staying in the basement for 15 minutes before they were evacuated. She was one of the last to leave, she told the BBC’s “War on Truth” podcast, because she was not as badly injured as some others. She became subject to online abuse following a Russian campaign to discredit the photos of her as fake. The claims that she used makeup to paint her bruises started on a pro-Russian Telegram channel. The claims later spread to mainstream Russian media. “It was really offensive to hear that, because I actually lived through it all,” she said. Still, she does not blame the Russians, but instead The Associated Press journalists who took the photos, claiming they did not speak to enough people impacted by the attack and allowed readers to get “the impression that it was all staged.” AP didn’t immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment. This is not the first time Russia has used such tactics to undermine photos and news reports documenting the reality of its war on Ukraine. Russian state TV channels suggested photos and video depicting the atrocities in Bucha were fake. Some Russian media claimed Ukraine staged war crimes to gain world sympathy. Ukraine’s deputy defense minister said more than 260 fighters were evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol on Monday. The country continues to evacuate those remaining, saying they had “completed their mission,” AP reported.

The State Department has made the basketball star’s release its top priority, Blinken told Cherelle Griner, assuring her that the department is working on the case nonstop and that she should reach out if she’s not receiving the information she needs. CNN and NBC News first reported on the conversation, which a senior State Department official confirmed to HuffPost. On Tuesday, Cherelle Griner posted a black-and-white video on Instagram from one of her wife’s games, with a caption saying, “Game Day!” The video shows Brittney Griner jogging off the basketball court to give her wife a kiss. A post shared by 𝐂𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐄𝐋𝐋𝐄 𝐓. 𝐆𝐑𝐈𝐍𝐄𝐑 (@cherelletgriner) Blinken’s conversation with Cherelle Griner came just a day after a Russian court ruled to extend Brittney Griner’s pretrial detention until at least June. A consular officer from the State Department was able to speak to the WNBA player on the sidelines of her Friday hearing, according to department spokesperson Ned Price. On Monday, however, U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan said that the country had denied the U.S. Embassy permission to visit Brittney Griner for the third time in a month. “This is unacceptable. We call on @mfa_russia to provide timely consular access, in line with Russia’s intl & bilateral obligations,” Sullivan said in a tweet posted by the embassy. #AMBSullivan: For the third time in a month, Russian authorities have denied an Embassy visit to detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner.

Russian authorities arrested the basketball player in February on drug smuggling charges after she was allegedly found carrying cannabis-derived vape cartridges in her luggage in Moscow. The two-time Olympic gold medalist has played for a Russian basketball team for years during the WNBA off-season. Price said last week that Griner is “doing as well as can be expected under what can only be described as exceedingly difficult circumstances,” and said the State Department is “working very closely” on her case in addition to fellow detained American Paul Whelan. Trevor Reed, an American who was also detained in Russia, was released last month in a prisoner swap. “Our message across the board for Americans who are detained in Russia is that we expect, consistent with the Vienna Convention, to have regular and consistent access to Americans who are detained, including those Americans who are in pretrial detention,” Price said.",7.960753209299511,7.139032508510195,0.8217207007893155,0

The security package isn’t expected to pass until later this week because a single Republican senator, Rand Paul of Kentucky, is objecting to a quick vote on the measure. Paul has demanded the legislation give an inspector general authority to oversee spending, which he called unprecedented and fiscally unsound. But Democrats said that would require a re-vote in the House and burn precious time given Russia’s daily bombing of Ukrainian cities that is causing horrifying scenes of death and devastation. In his floor speech earlier Monday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) slammed Paul’s efforts to delay passage of the bill as “totally unacceptable,” saying that it “only serves to strengthen Putin’s hand in the long run.” Oleksandra Ustinova, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, lamented that the delay would cost lives in a message posted on Twitter: When you tell your 3-week old baby that her Mom’s work for the last week that we had to spend apart to help the country was blocked by one single man in the US SenateThese political games and and a delay cost hundreds of lives of Ukrainian soldiers #UkraineWar  Ten other Republican senators joined Paul in voting against the motion to advance the security package on Monday; many of these senators made supportive statements about Ukraine’s plight following Russia’s invasion: Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.)John Boozman (Ark.)Mike Braun (Ind.)Mike Crapo (Idaho)Bill Hagerty (Tenn.)Josh Hawley (Mo.)Mike Lee (Utah)Roger Marshall (Kan.)Tommy Tuberville (Ala.) The list of lawmakers hindering aid to Ukraine has been steadily rising over the past month. Last week, 57 Republicans voted against the Ukraine assistance bill in the House. Two months ago, only three GOP House members voted against a separate security package. Supporters of former President Donald Trump and right-wing pundits, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have ramped up rhetoric against U.S. support for Ukraine aid. Trump also called into question the spending measure last week, linking it to the shortage of baby formula that has been attributed to a safety recall and supply chain issues. “The Democrats are sending another $40 billion to Ukraine, yet America’s parents are struggling to even feed their children,” Trump said in a statement released by his super PAC. Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) argued that spending $40 billion on Ukraine is “not in America’s interests,” adding on Twitter that it “allows Europe to freeload, neglects priorities at home (the border), allows Europe to freeload, short changes critical interests abroad and comes w/ no meaningful oversight.” But Sen. Rick Scott (Fla.), a deficit hawk and, like Hawley, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, voted in support of the bill. The top Trump ally called Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “a threat to our national security and the security of our democratic allies.” He added: “America must always protect our interests and support democracy over tyranny.” Monday’s vote to advance the Ukraine package came on the heels of a trip to Kyiv by Senate Republican leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.). After meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, McConnell told reporters he assured him “that support for Ukraine and this war against the Russians is bipartisan,” including from “an overwhelming majority of Republicans.” McConnell also addressed the opposition to Ukraine aid from the Trump wing of his party in a statement released after the trip. “Ukraine is not asking anybody else to fight their fight,” he said. “They only ask for the tools they need for self-defense.” “America’s support for Ukraine’s self-defense is not mere philanthropy,” he added. “Defending the principle of sovereignty, promoting stability in Europe, and imposing costs on Russia’s naked aggression have a direct and vital bearing on America’s national security and vital interests.”",5.175418127647814,4.3990404288947955,0.7763776987530182,11

Madison Cawthorn’s tweet evoking veterans backfired. The North Carolina Republican appeared to criticize House approval of $40 billion in aid for Ukraine with this post on Wednesday: Imagine if we spent $40 Billion on veterans. In response, he received a series of searing reminders of his own votes against bills that assist former U.S. military service members. “DON’T EVEN pretend you care about Veterans,” responded VoteVets, a progressive PAC promoting Democratic military veterans for Congress. Other critics remembered Cawthorn’s misleading campaign ads that sought to spin his rejection by the U.S. Naval Academy. In March, Cawthorn voted against a bill to provide $20 billion per year to veterans exposed to toxins during their service Fact #1: The U.S. spends hundreds of billions of dollars a year on the VA.Fact #2: Cawthorn is a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and he really ought to be aware of Fact #1. Imagine if @RepCawthorn, @GOPLeader McCarthy and 172 other House Republicans hadn't voted against the #HonoringOurPACT Act earlier this year. But no, House Republicans don't think health care for veterans sick & dying from burn pit exposure is worth it. Imagine if we had a Congressman who, being a member of the VA committee, didn't vote no for helping veterans with their debts simply because the book had too many pages to read. We currently spend $340 billion a year on veterans, you ignorant jackass.You also vote against veterans' benefits every chance you get, so kindly fuck off and stop using our service members as political pawns.  You vote against Veterans EVERY CHANCE YOU GET. You even voted against expanding care for those exposed to burn pits. DON'T EVEN pretend you care about Veterans. The annual VA budget is nearly $300 billion. You'd know that if you were remotely competent. Cawthorn voted against a major toxic exposure package which is arguably the most significant boost to veteran healthcare since the creation of the VA itself. Imagine if Cawthorn could remember back just 6 weeks ago when Republicans were demanding the U.S. send assistance to Ukraine? playing his last card. ""Things aren't going great for me. Time to turn things around and tweet something random about veterans"" More America first messaging. Republicans have repeatedly voted against helping veterans. Dear @RepCawthorn: Unlike you, I’m a veteran and didn’t lie about getting accepted to the Naval Academy. Wanted to let you know Democrats increased funding to veterans last year to $270 billion.

Why Is It Considering Membership?,"Sweden is still weighing up the prospect of NATO membership while its neighbor Finland has already announced it is firmly in favour of joining in the face of Russia’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine and its ongoing military aggression. Joining the U.S.-led military alliance would mark a radical break in the policy of both northeast European countries, underlining once again how Vladimir Putin’s aggression has reshaped the post-Cold War order. On Wednesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson toured both countries and formalized bilateral security agreements during a whirlwind 24 hours. Johnson said his government would give the countries “whatever is requested” as part of the new pact. Here are some of the issues that have led to the Nordic rethink about entering the 30-nation alliance. The military alliance goes by the acronym of NATO. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was formed in 1949 to prevent a resurgence of nationalism and militarism in Europe after two world wars, and to deter the Soviet Union’s expansion. Its membership has swelled to 30 member nations, and over the 1990s and 2000s its enlargement stretched further east to include the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. They agree to mutual defense — military action — in response to an enemy attack. The principle goes: “An attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies.” This is Article 5 of the NATO constitution. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, which is the main reason why the Western support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy has fallen short of putting their troops on the ground. Ukraine’s admission to NATO has been a stated goal going back to its constitution in 2002, but Ukraine’s president has accepted his country can’t join at present. NATO’s enlargement has been Putin’s biggest publicly stated grievance with the West during the build-up up to war, claiming the eastward expansion and potentially sweeping up the largest other former Soviet republic breaks promises. Adding Sweden and Finland is likely to trigger Putin’s ire too. Moscow has warned it could deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad — sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania — if they do. NATO has been adamant it will not accept limits on the nations that it admits and has always maintained an “open door policy.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed Finland and Sweden to the verge of applying for NATO membership, a move that would end staunch military neutrality for the two European nations. Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, announced on Thursday that they’re in favor of applying for NATO membership. In a joint statement, the country’s President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin pointed out that “NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security.” They added that they would apply “without delay” in the next few days, although a few steps remain before the country can become an official part of the alliance. Neighboring Sweden is expected to announce its decision in the coming days. Any applications will usher in a tense wait during the months it takes to be ratified by all NATO members, though the alliance and the White House have said they were confident any security concerns could be addressed in the interim. Both countries have been nonaligned militarily since World War II, but have been edging toward their current position in response to an increasingly belligerent Russia. Finland and Sweden switched from formal neutrality to military nonalignment in 1995 when they joined the European Union, and both have drawn closer to NATO in recent years, exchanging intelligence and participating in alliance exercises. Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917 and fought two wars against it during World War II, where it lost some territory to Moscow. Finland signed an Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Russia in 1948, cementing a degree of economic and political dependency and isolating it militarily from western Europe. The strict policy of neutrality is referred to as “Finlandization.” The end of the Cold War, bringing a break-up of the Soviet Union, allowed Finland to step out of Russia’s shadow as the threat from Moscow diminished. It has relied on its own military deterrence and friendly relations with Moscow to keep the peace. But with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, perceptions of relations with Russia as “friendly” have been undermined. BREAKING: UK Prime Minister @BorisJohnson says Russia's invasion of Ukraine marks the ""end of the post Cold War"" period. It has ""sadly opened a new chapter"". Opinion polls show support for membership in Finland is high, with people mindful of the long land border it shares with Russia. Support in parliament for an application is also broad. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years and post-war foreign policy has focused on supporting democracy internationally, multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament. It ran down its military after the Cold War, cutting defense spending of up to 4% of its GDP to about 1% during the 1990s and early 2000s. Despite Putin’s offensive, many on the left in Sweden remain suspicious of the U.S. security agenda and NATO, which ultimately relies on the deterrence provided by America’s nuclear arsenal. Polls show a substantial majority of Swedes back joining NATO, with support running just above 60% in the latest poll, and there is a majority in parliament in support of an application. Finland has a NATO “option,” a kind of a plan of action that mandates applying if the security situation deteriorates, while Sweden’s parliament will present a new security policy review on Friday, though the latter is not expected to contain an explicit recommendation concerning NATO. Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats have called a parliamentary debate over NATO for Monday. Should the party as expected back joining, the government could call a vote about sending through an application, but it is not formally required to.",5.47173271541613,4.101047054968707,1.370685660447423,15

I’m confident that Putin believed he could break up NATO, that he believed he could break the European Union,” Biden said at a Monday night fundraiser for the Democratic Party. But now that those goals seem elusive, Biden said, he worries that the “very calculating” Putin is unsure of what to do. Despite expectations that Putin might declare victory in Ukraine or expand the war on May 9, a national holiday in Russia for the Soviet role in World War II, the Russian leader has offered few details about his plans for the ongoing offensive. Meanwhile, Biden is ramping up U.S. support for the Ukrainian resistance, including by expediting shipments of military aid through legislation he signed on Monday. Russian and Ukrainian officials say they are maintaining a channel of dialogue but that an agreement seems unlikely any time soon. The two sides have not met face to face since March. In the weeks since, Ukraine’s anger has grown as officials and journalists have found evidence of apparent Russian war crimes against Ukrainians and as Moscow has tried to consolidate its control over Ukrainian territory where its troops remain, like the city of Kherson. Experts believe Putin seeks a major triumph in Ukraine that he can trumpet at home — not least because of U.S.-led efforts to weaken his economy that are threatening ordinary Russians’ standard of living. International pressure and opposition to the campaign in Ukraine have already driven Russians to flee their own country. In his May 9 address, Putin did not even utter the word “Ukraine.” But he defended the invasion as “forced, timely and the only correct decision.”",3.9009204053638267,3.2122874360108113,0.6886329693530153,3

Ukraine’s Jewish Population Knows Better.,"In a corner of the Choral Synagogue in the western Ukrainian town of Drohobych, there’s a stark display of pictures detailing the bloody and tragedy-strewn history of the area’s Jewish community. One is especially horrifying: a black-and-white image of the corpses of four Jewish children killed by Nazis during World War II. “If you take a close look, there are parallels with right now,” said Leonid Golberg, a 66-year-old member of the local Jewish Board, pointing to the image. “Russia is now doing the same things in Ukraine.” Golberg is a senior member of the small, 40-member Jewish community of Drohobych, a town nestled in the rolling hills of Ukraine that grow into the Carpathian Mountains just a few miles further west. The town used to have a far larger Jewish population. More than 12,000 Jews — 40% of the town’s population — were killed in mass shootings, by starvation in the Nazi-established ghetto, or transported to the Bełżec extermination camp, just one small part of the systematic genocide of Jews during the Holocaust. In Drohobych, only 400 Jewish people survived the war. The people of Drohobych know about Nazis. Which makes it all the more appalling that Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed his invasion of Ukraine was meant to “de-Nazify” the country — a statement he reiterated on Monday. On Monday, Putin delivered a speech at the annual Victory Day Parade on Moscow’s Red Square. During those remarks, Putin said a “clash with the neo-Nazis, the Banderites, backed by the United States and their junior partners, was inevitable.” Putin also told Russians they were “fighting for the Motherland, for its future, so that no one forgets the lessons of the Second World War, so that there is no place in the world for executioners, punishers and Nazis.” The claims may gain traction in the increasingly insular Russia, where the flow of information and news is becoming more restricted by the day. But nowhere remembers the lessons of the Second World War better than the town of Drohobych, the history of which lays bare the hypocrisy and deceit of Putin’s claims. Far from learning the “lessons of the Second World War,” Golberg says Russia is repeating history, only on a wider scale. And, in an attempt to justify it, Putin is invoking claims about Jews that “the whole civilized world said was a red line crossed.” “In the same way that Nazis killed 6 million Jews during World War II, they are destroying Ukraine as a state,” Golberg said. “They already killed over 300 children, they’re killing thousands of civilians and have destroyed whole cities.” Golberg’s voice was raspy from a recent bout of COVID-19 and the half-hourly cigarette breaks he took as he showed HuffPost around the synagogue. One of the photos on display is from 1939. It shows a Soviet officer shaking hands with a Nazi officer after the two sides met after their successful invasion and partition of Poland, a result of the secret pact Josef Stalin entered into with Adolf Hitler shortly before the outbreak of World War II. A sign behind the two men reads “Drohobych,” pointing in the direction of the town just a few kilometers down the road from where they stand. Ukraine’s geography blessed it with lands so fertile it’s known “the breadbasket of Europe,” but cursed it to repeatedly being at the mercy of larger and more powerful neighbors to both its east and west as they battled for power and influence in Europe. Nazi Germany captured Drohobych in 1941 and decimated the town’s Jewish population. Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sparked outrage by claiming Hitler had Jewish blood and that Jews were complicit in their own genocide, adding: “For a long time now, we’ve been hearing the wise Jewish people say that the biggest anti-Semites are the Jews themselves.” Despite Putin reportedly offering an apology for Lavrov’s remarks, Golberg remained incensed. “Lavrov said what he said because it’s actually them that are the thieves and the criminals,” Golberg said. “What they’re doing here is not only genocide, it can be called Ukrainicide.” After the Nazis were defeated, Drohobych and Ukraine fell under the Soviet sphere. The town’s Jewish community continued to be persecuted and the Choral Synagogue was appropriated by the authorities and used as a warehouse, falling into disrepair for decades. Drohobych’s Jewish population is small, but proud. A huge renovation project starting in 2014 restored the Choral Synagogue to its former glory. It forms one part of a trinity of notable holy buildings in Drohobych, alongside the Eastern Orthodox St. George’s Church and the Catholic Church of Saint Bartholomew — a nod to the town’s multicultural heritage. Golberg was baffled by the idea that the country in which he lives and practices freely as a Jew has been invaded by an army claiming to be fighting Nazism. “They’re saying there are Nazis in Ukraine, but let’s look at the facts,” said Golberg. He noted the diversity of the Ukrainian army. “Jews serving in the battalions of the Ukrainian army and Ukrainian territorial defense were celebrating Passover last month.

Russian President Vladimir Putin would have been massively emboldened and “would have probably just driven right into Ukraine himself,” said Hill, an expert on Russian affairs, in an interview with Bloomberg’s Emma Barnett released Friday. Had former Vice President Mike Pence not blocked Trump’s plan to overturn the 2020 election result, Putin “would have seen the United States as completely finished from a leadership perspective because we would be no different from any other country in the world that had just had a coup,” explained Hill. But the attack by Trump supporters on the U.S. Capitol was still “a particular moment” that helped inspire the Russian leader to order the military invasion of Ukraine, agreed Hill. Other motivating factors for the war, which is now in its 73rd day, were Putin’s increased isolation due to the coronavirus pandemic and his belief the West had become “weak and distracted,” she said. Hill served as an intelligence analyst under former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama before joining the NSC under Trump, about whom she testified during his first impeachment. Last month, she said the U.S. Capitol violence was Trump’s shot at “pulling a Putin.” “In the course of his presidency, indeed, Trump would come more to resemble Putin in political practice and predilection than he resembled any of his recent American presidential predecessors,” Hill told The New York Times magazine.

But Gordon Sondland hopes history might be kinder to him than that description. “You had to have been there,” Sondland told The Washington Post in an interview published Friday. “None of us are perfect.” “My own mistake was probably buying into the whole Giuliani narrative and allowing a nongovernmental actor to interfere in a very ambiguous way with U.S. foreign policy,” he told the Post. Sondland — the latest official coming out with a book — became entangled in what he would later testify at Trump’s impeachment hearing was a “quid pro quo” pressure scheme by the then-president. A phone call and meeting in Washington with Trump avidly sought by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would not be arranged ― nor would weapons approved by Congress be delivered ― until Zelenskyy committed to launching an investigation into Hunter Biden in a scheme to undermine Joe Biden. Sondland’s frank testimony about the arrangement dealt a blow to Trump at his impeachment hearing. The hotelier and major Trump contributor (Sondland gave $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee) was way out of his depth with absolutely no experience in foreign policy when the pressure campaign against Ukraine was rolled out. He was a “poster child of why donor-ambassadors aren’t a great idea,” Max Bergmann, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Post. “I really regret that the Ukrainians were placed in that predicament,” Sondland testified in 2019, “but I do not regret doing what I could to try to break the logjam and to solve the problem” to bring Ukraine and the U.S. together. He told the Post that he feared Ukraine was in a vulnerable place, “and now we’re proven correct,” he added.

American officials first told NBC News Ukraine asked the American military if it could identify a ship sailing in the Black Sea near Odesa. The U.S. identified the warship as the Moskva before Ukrainian forces launched two missiles on April 13 that began a fire, ultimately causing the ship to sink. This ship carried a crew of about 510 people. It’s unclear whether there were casualties. The Washington Post and The New York Times confirmed the reports, adding American officials had “no prior awareness” that Ukraine planned to strike the ship. The Post added that without the U.S. support, Ukraine would have had difficulties using its small stockpile of Neptune missiles to target the Moskva. U.S. officials have stressed in recent days that Ukraine has its own intelligence gathering abilities, and not all strikes have been conducted with American support. Ukraine had already found the Moskva on its own, they added. The sharing of U.S. intelligence is part of an ongoing, classified effort by the White House to aid Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion. The Times reported Wednesday the U.S. had provided real-time battlefield intelligence to the Ukrainians that helped the country target and kill up to 12 Russian generals since the war began in February, a startling figure. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby confirmed to the Times Wednesday that the U.S. has provided “Ukraine with information and intelligence that they can use to defend themselves.” He added that Ukraine has its “own intelligence capabilities to track and target Russian naval vessels, as they did in this case.” The Biden administration has worked to keep the full scope of its support secret, fearful that any open effort could provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin further. The Kremlin has continually warned the U.S. and other Western nations to stop arming Ukraine, saying there could be “unpredictable consequences” and making references to its nuclear arsenal. The loss of the Moskva, named after Russia’s capital, was an embarrassing moment for the Kremlin as it failed to quickly capture Ukraine and Kyiv. The Times noted the sinking was the most significant naval loss for any navy in the world in four decades. Russia denied an attack caused the Moskva to sink, instead saying an onboard fire sparked exploding munitions. Russia has since regrouped and launched a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has upped U.S. military and economic support to Kyiv, asking Congress for an additional $33 billion this month to help Ukraine fend off Russia.",3.627712044951126,3.606088024755953,0.021624020195173177,3

According to The New York Times, senior American officials said the U.S. had provided real-time battlefield intel to the Ukrainians, including the location of Russia’s mobile military headquarters. Ukraine then used that knowledge, as well as its own intelligence, to conduct artillery strikes and attacks to kill Russian officers. To date, Ukraine said it has killed around 12 Russian generals during the war. The Times added that not all of the airstrikes have relied on American intelligence; Ukraine has its own intelligence-collecting methods. The paper’s sources did not reveal how the U.S. obtained its intelligence and would not specify how many generals may have been killed due to the sharing of that information. The effort is part of a classified push to help Ukraine defend itself, and the Biden administration has been working to keep the full scope of its support secret, the Times reported. The White House fears any open effort to share intelligence could provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has warned the U.S. to stop arming Ukraine, saying there could be “unpredictable consequences” for doing so. Western nations have continued to penalize Russia for the invasion. Earlier this week, the European Union’s top official called on the bloc to ban Russian oil imports and unveiled new sanctions against the country’s biggest bank and media broadcasters.

This classification means that the U.S. will work more aggressively to secure Griner’s release, even as her legal case continues to play out overseas, The Associated Press reported citing two U.S. officials. A State Department spokesperson confirmed the reclassification to HuffPost but declined to go into detail on the reason for the change, which was first reported by ESPN on Tuesday. The spokesperson noted that all cases involving a U.S. national being detained abroad are reviewed to determine if they are “unlawful” or “wrongful” and that for privacy or operational reasons, not all wrongful detention determinations are made public. The president of the WNBA players union, Nneka Ogwumike, reacted to the news of the determination and expressed hope that it will lead to Griner’s swift return to the U.S. “It has been 75 days that our friend, teammate, sister, Brittney Griner, has been wrongfully detained in Russia. It is time for her to come home,” she tweeted. The Phoenix Mercury center was detained after the Russian Federal Customs Service said its officials found vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. The drug charges could carry up to 10 years in prison. Griner was returning to Russia to resume playing in the Russian League, where she plays in the WNBA off-season. Late last month, U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed, who was detained in Russia back in 2019 after being accused of assaulting an officer, was released as part of a prison swap. Another American who continues to be unjustly retained in Russia according to U.S. officials is Paul Whelan. Whelan was charged with espionage by Russian intelligence officials after visiting Moscow in 2018 for a friend’s wedding and in 2020 sentenced to 16 years in prison. Whelan’s brother, David Whelan, said in a statement to reporters on Monday that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reassured his family that the White House remains focused on securing his release. “It is important that, as more and more Americans are arbitrarily detained, the White House move more deliberately and quickly to solve these cases.

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s report in 2019 determined that “The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in a sweeping and systematic fashion” through social media manipulation to disparage Clinton and a hacking effort to obtain emails from her campaign. “Democrats have convinced themselves Russia stole the presidency which rightfully belonged to Hillary Clinton,” Carlson said. “..

Jamie Raskin Flames Putin 'Cheerleader' Marjorie Taylor Greene,"Directly calling out his Republican colleague Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) scorched Vladimir Putin’s “cheerleaders” in Congress and urged Americans to stand on the “right side of history.” Raskin, a member of the House committee investigating the 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, lashed “the very distinguished gentlelady from Georgia” for her comments last month on a radio program in which she blamed Ukraine for being invaded by Russia because it “just kept poking the bear.” “We have members of Congress who are cheerleaders for Vladimir Putin, and are voices of nothing but defeatism, fatalism and pessimism for democracy in Europe,” Raskin said, “and so they try to distract us with a lot of phony rhetoric about other issues.” He then referenced Greene’s claim that NATO was supporting neo-Nazis in Ukraine, the Kremlin’s own justification for its invasion. “My friends, we have to decide which side we’re on,” he continued. Raskin said Americans during World War II did not watch Nazis march down the street in Europe and say there were “very fine people on both sides,” a reference to former President Donald Trump’s comments about the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2019. “They did not start cheerleading for Mussolini and Hitler and Franco,” he added. “And yet we have people here who go out and speak on the side of Vladimir Putin.” Why are some of our colleagues repeating Putin’s propaganda justifying his bloody war against the people of Ukraine? Why are they promoting appeasement, defeatism and pessimism?Strong democracies stand up for strong democracies.  Raskin and Rep.

Here’s Why.,"McDonald’s is in a pickle. The fast-food titan announced last month that it would temporarily close its nearly 850 locations in Russia due the country’s invasion of Ukraine. McDonald’s also pulled the plug on its restaurants in Ukraine, which cost the chain $127 million last quarter, according to CNN. Last month, McDonald’s said in a statement that it would continue to pay full salaries to all Ukrainian and Russian employees. The company also donated $5 million to its Employee Assistance Fund. Maintaining staff costs, alongside payments for leases and supplies, cost the company $27 million. The other whopping $100 million deficit stemmed from food and other unused items that now must be nixed. “Results included ... $100 million of costs for inventory in the company’s supply chain that likely will be disposed of due to restaurants being temporarily closed,” the fast-food powerhouse said in a statement. Keeping a spirit of optimism for the company’s recovery, CFO Kevin Ozan said: ​​“We expect this to be temporary and we certainly don’t take this decision lightly, but for us this is about doing what we think is the right thing to do, both for the global business and for our people locally.” At this time no further updates have been issued on the company’s plans for its locations in Ukraine and Russia. “As we move forward, McDonald’s will continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required. At this juncture, it’s impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia.”",5.190796342187819,5.268701426057016,-0.07790508386919726,27

The ’’Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act,” introduced by Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), was passed 417-8. The measure is symbolic, since it wouldn’t force Biden to do anything. “It is hard to imagine giving Russia’s wealth back to Putin while Ukraine lies in ruin and Ukrainians are burying their dead,” Malinowski said in a statement. The bill encourages the president to confiscate assets worth over $2 million from individuals with ties to Putin who have been sanctioned by the U.S. in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Funds from sales of seized assets should be spent helping Ukrainians, including reconstructing their country, humanitarian aid and technological support “to ensure the free flow of information to the Ukrainian people in Ukraine, including items to counter internet censorship by Russian authorities.” The bill says some of the money also should go to “democracy and human rights programming and monitoring” for Russians. “It is long past time that Putin’s cronies, who have amassed wealth on the backs of the Russian people, pay for their complicit role in Putin’s crimes against humanity,” Wilson said. Earlier this month, U.S. authorities made their first seizure of an asset belonging to a Putin-friendly oligarch — the Tango, a 255-foot yacht in the port of Palma de Mallorca worth over $90 million. “It will not be the last,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said of the yacht owned by Ukraine-born billionaire Viktor Vekselberg. The American Civil Liberties Union had warned that an earlier version of the bill would have been unconstitutional because it wouldn’t have allowed challenges by individuals whose assets were taken. A court ruling against the measure could have scored Russia a propaganda win, The Washington Post reported. The bill was amended in response to the concerns. The version passed by the House calls on Biden to create a working group under Secretary of State Antony Blinken to finalize “constitutional mechanisms” required to seize and liquidate assets.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Deadline: White House,” Brennan told anchor Nicolle Wallace that Putin is “clearly reacting to ongoing developments” in Ukraine, “many of which have been setbacks to Russia,” he said. Putin has “been adapting on the military battlefield in Ukraine by consolidating and repositioning forces along the east and the south” because of “the pummeling” his forces have received, Brennan said. The Russian leader also is “reacting to the strength of NATO support and particularly the ongoing supply of weapons and ammunition to the Ukrainian forces,” he continued. Brennan envisioned Putin putting more pressure on other neighboring countries, such as Poland and Bulgaria, where he’s cut off natural gas deliveries. Putin “realizes that his initial game plan has just completely collapsed and therefore he has to adapt and react,” said Brennan, who led the CIA from 2013 to 2017. “It’s going to be a combination of saber-rattling and rhetorical flourishes, he’s trying to again threaten the West,” he added. “But also taking these types of steps to try to appeal to those sympathizers in Europe and also the United States, unfortunately, as a way to again split the NATO alliance and to weaken the resolve and the determination of NATO to continue to support Ukraine.” Watch the interview here: ""[Putin] realizes that his initial game plan has just completely collapsed and therefore he has to adapt and react, and so it's going to be a combination of saber rattling and rhetorical flourishes to threaten the West"" - @JohnBrennan w/ @NicolleDWallace ",4.415706072868137,3.8441169590419437,0.5715891138261937,15

In his latest address, Zelenskyy said the first 10 soldiers have “received the status of suspects” for engaging in what a growing number of leaders are calling war crimes in the Kyiv suburb. The soldiers are from the 64th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Ground Forces, according to the president. “Their surnames are known. It is established what they did. We know all the details about them and their actions,” Zelenskyy said. “And we will find everyone – just as we will find all the other Russian thugs who killed and tortured Ukrainians, who tormented our people, who destroyed houses and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. “None of these bastards will avoid responsibility,” he continued. “However, some of them may not survive until trial and fair punishment. But for one reason only – this Russian brigade was relocated to the Kharkiv region. There, they will get retribution from our military.” Zelensky on Biden’s request for $33 billion for Ukraine: “This is a very important step by the United States. And I am grateful to the American people and personally to President Biden for it. I hope that the Congress will quickly support this request for help to our state.”  Russian forces withdrew from Bucha after at least a month of occupation, leaving behind massive bloodshed. Civilians’ bodies were left on the streets, some charred and some bound by hands and legs. Many of the victims were shot execution-style, particularly men. Pets were also killed and left on the street. Ukraine experienced similar horrors in other towns, like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Irpin. But the documentation of the terror and death in Bucha shocked the world into coming to terms with the level of violence Russia has perpetrated against civilians. Key players in the United Nations Security Council came together on Wednesday to encourage investigations into the atrocities. The informal meeting included the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, the chair of the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry, Ukraine’s top prosecutor, and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova has opened over 8,000 investigations into alleged violations of the laws and customs of war, saying “Russia’s actions amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes” and that the pattern “resembles the crime of genocide.” France’s deputy U.N. ambassador and a co-sponsor of the meeting, Nathalie Broadhurst, said the images of the atrocities in Bucha and other places in Ukraine after Russian forces withdrew “are unbearable” and may amount to war crimes. The U.S. has already concluded that Russia committed war crimes in Ukraine. Russia has denied responsibility for any atrocities, repeatedly claiming that its soldiers are simply rooting out neo-Nazis in the smaller country. “The investigation into the crimes committed by the Russian military against our people is underway,” Zelenskyy said. “Ukraine’s position is absolutely clear – every Russian criminal must be and will be brought to justice. Whoever they are and wherever they hide, we will find them all and make them bear responsibility.”",3.9084386887597353,3.263448865123234,0.6449898236365015,2

The fun-loving feline was separated from his owner, Larysa Frisby, for several months during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a release from the Humane Society of the United States. The ordeal began in February, at the start of the invasion, when Frisby was away from her home in Ukraine visiting family in Arkansas. During that time, her cat was staying with her cousin in Odesa. Frisby’s cousin kept Persik safe before managing to evacuate him out of Ukraine with a friend fleeing to Warsaw, Poland. Looking to reunite with Persik, which means “Peach” in Ukrainian, Frisby then reached out to Humane Society International for help. As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues, HSI has been working in Poland, Romania, Germany and Italy to help pet owners who are fleeing the war. Kelly Donithan, the director of animal disaster response at HSI, was working in Poland and learned more about Persik’s circumstances.

The huge bronze statue was 26 feet tall, and showed a Ukrainian and a Russian worker on a plinth, holding a Soviet order of friendship. It was a symbolic gift from the Soviet Union to commemorate the reunification of Ukraine with Russia, but it had become increasingly controversial over the years as tensions between the countries grew. The monument stood right under the titanium “People’s Friendship Arch,” which is still standing. The rainbow-shaped structure stretches up to 164 feet, and was built in 1982 to honor the 60th anniversary of the Soviet Union. Explaining why he had taken the decision to remove the bronze statue, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said: “We now see what this ‘friendship’ is – destruction of Ukrainian cities... killing tens of thousands of peaceful people. “I am convinced such a monument has an entirely different meaning now.” “This place had a name, the place of friendship between Russia and Ukraine,” he added. “It’s no friendship anymore.” He also pointed out to the BBC that “Russia destroyed the normal lives of millions of Ukrainians and destroyed the peace in Europe” through its two-month unprovoked attack on the neighboring nation. The head of the Russian worker was removed first and fell to the ground to cheers from the crowd. The entire statue was then lifted by a crane and lowered to the ground, as 100 people shouted slogans such as “glory to Ukraine,” according to Reuters news agency. One of the designers of the statue, Serhiy Myrhorodsky, said: “Russia invaded Ukraine... Can we be friends with Russia? What do you think? “This is our worst enemy, that is why the monument to Russian-Ukrainian friendship doesn’t make sense any more.” One member of the public called Diana told Reuters: “We should not have any relations with the nation of aggressors... no friendship, no relations, nothing.” More than 5 million people have fled from Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February. First, the head, then the rest of the statue that symbolised friendship between #Ukraine and #Russia. The Kyiv authorities decided to take it down after two months of full-scale war. The monument’s architect told us he wants the monument to Ukraine there instead.  The metal arch over the statue was altered in 2014 when Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. A crack was painted onto it by activists, to symbolise how Russia’s aggression had fractured their relationship. Kyiv has since decided to rename the rainbow-shaped arch and paint it in the colours of the Ukrainian flag. The Kyiv City Council also told a Ukrainian newspaper it was going to change the names of streets linked to Russia and its close ally Belarus. The capital city itself is now widely known as Kyiv, rather than Kiev, because the latter was based on a historical Russian derivation, although Ukraine first implemented this change after it went independent in 1991.",2.773154114864394,2.884005159768671,-0.110851044904277,3

State Department spokesperson Ned Price said members of the U.S. embassy team had begun making day trips to Lviv, a significant diplomatic move after the agency withdrew most of its staff in February and closed the embassy in Kyiv. The officials were relocated to neighboring Poland, but the Biden administration has long said it hoped to resume operations within Ukraine in a show of diplomatic support. “Today’s travel was a first step ahead of more regular travel in the immediate future, and, as we’ve said, we’re accelerating preparations to resume Embassy Kyiv operations just as soon as possible,” Price said in a media briefing. He added that the U.S. would continue “to facilitate our support to the government and people of Ukraine as they bravely defend their country.” The announcement came just days after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. The pair stressed that the White House would continued to move “heaven and earth” to help defend against the Kremlin’s ongoing invasion. President Putin sought to take away Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. He failed. Ukraine is sovereign and independent and will remain so for far longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene. We will support them for as long as it takes to succeed.  “We’re all here because of Ukraine’s courage, because of the innocent civilians who have been killed and because of the suffering that your people still endure,” Austin said Tuesday during a meeting with defense officials from dozens of NATO and non-NATO countries in Germany. “Your country has been ravaged, your hospitals have been bombed, your citizens have been executed, your children have been traumatized. But Ukraine has done a magnificent job at defending its sovereignty against Russia’s unprovoked invasion.” Zelenskyy has called on President Joe Biden to deepen security guaranties and provide more weapons and other armaments to help Ukraine defend itself. Blinken said after his meeting with the Ukrainian leader that he believed Russia was “failing” in its effort to capture the country, saying he believed Zelenskyy and his people could succeed if they had the “right equipment” and the “right support.” “The bottom line is this: We don’t know how the rest of this war will unfold, but we do know that a sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene,” Blinken said after his visit.",3.053143401049372,2.313943164715724,0.7392002363336481,3

Secretary-General António Guterres’ diplomatic efforts to bring an end to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bloody war in Ukraine have been met with skepticism from Ukrainian officials. Guterres announced on Saturday he’ll visit Russia and Ukraine this week to meet separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Next week, I will meet with President Vladimir Putin in Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine.We need urgent steps to save lives, end the human suffering and bring about peace in Ukraine. Zelenskyy questioned the purpose of Guterres’ trip to Moscow. “Why? To hand over signals from Russia? What should we look for?” Zelenskyy said following the U.N. leader’s announcement, according to The Associated Press. Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of Zelenskyy’s office, told NBC’s “Meet The Press” Sunday that the U.N. chief is “not really” authorized to speak on behalf of Ukraine. “This is not good idea to travel to Moscow,” Zhovkva said. “We did not understand his intention to travel to Moscow and to talk to President Putin.” TODAY ON #MTP: Igor Zhovkva, President Zelenskyy’s top diplomatic adviser, says the UN Secretary General is ""not really"" authorized to speak for Ukraine in meetings with President Putin. ""We do not understand his intention to travel to Moscow and to talk to President Putin.""  Zhokva expressed doubt that talks led by Guterres would be constructive. He also called on the U.N. to provide more humanitarian support for Ukraine. “Any peace talks are good if they end with the result,” Zhokva said. Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine’s prime minister, said that despite multiple efforts to engage Russia in meaningful peace talks, it appears the Kremlin is uninterested. “I think the Russian Federation and Putin are not interested in this negotiation,” Shmyhal said. “They are interested in other things. They are interested in genocide of Ukrainians.” Ukrainian Prime Minister Shmyhal is “not sure” U.N. Sec. Gen. Guterres' expected meeting with Russian President Putin this week will result in a diplomatic breakthrough. He thinks the Russian Federation is more interested in the ""genocide of Ukrainians.""  Last week, Guterres called for a four-day humanitarian cease-fire ahead of Orthodox Easter. “Stop the bloodshed and destruction,” Guterres told reporters on Tuesday. “Open a window for dialogue and peace. Keep faith with the meaning and the message of Easter.” I am calling for an Orthodox Holy Week humanitarian pause to the war in Ukraine. I urge all parties – and all champions of peace around the world -- to join my Easter appeal. Save lives. Stop the bloodshed and destruction. Open a window for dialogue and peace.  Guterres’ proposal went unheeded, as Russian missiles killed five people in Ukraine’s Odessa over the weekend. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Blinken said that despite Russia’s efforts to strip Ukraine of its independence, Ukraine is pulling through. “We’re seeing that when it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding,” Blinken said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says “Russia is failing” in its war aims, while “Ukraine is succeeding.”He visited Kyiv with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin  The U.S. officials also pledged an additional $300 million in foreign military financing and said the U.S. had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said.

Brink currently serves as the U.S. ambassador to Slovakia. The 25-year veteran diplomat was previously a senior adviser and deputy assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, focusing on Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. The nomination, which will still need to go through the Senate confirmation process, is a signal from the U.S. to Ukraine that it recognizes the nation’s sovereignty and seeks to maintain a diplomatic relationship. In a secret visit to Kyiv on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin informed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the nomination, as well as the news that the U.S. will reopen its embassy in Kyiv. Brink would be the first official U.S. ambassador to Ukraine since 2019 when former President Donald Trump recalled Marie Yovanovitch, also a career diplomat who gained widespread attention for testifying in Trump’s first impeachment trial — where the then-president was accused of withholding military aid to Ukraine for his own political purposes. Since Yovanovitch’s ousting, Kristina Kvien had temporarily served in place of an ambassador. Pleased @POTUS nominated Bridget Brink to fill the critical role of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. Especially amid Russia’s war waged in Ukraine & w/ democracies across the globe watching, this Ambassador is essential to coordinate assistance & help our partners defend themselves. “The administration made important progress today in safeguarding our national security and strengthening our diplomatic corps by nominating Bridget Brink to serve as Ambassador to Ukraine. Particularly as Russian forces bear down in communities across Ukraine with horrifying violence, having an Ambassador placed is essential to coordinate key military and humanitarian assistance and help our partners defend themselves,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said in a statement. Shaheen chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, and is a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. She’s also a member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, and last week led a bipartisan congressional delegation to the Balkans to show continued U.S. support for its Eastern European allies. “Brink will play a critical role in this pivotal moment to hold Russia accountable and empower Ukraine to defend itself as we coordinate a united response with our European allies. I look forward to her nomination being swiftly considered and confirmed by this Senate.”",3.795412215113112,4.62575850766824,-0.8303462925551282,18

But instead of comedian Chris Rock receiving the sharp end of the actor’s palm, it’s Russian President Vladimir Putin who is being knocked sideways by the “Ali” star in the latest artistic show of solidarity with Ukraine. “Keep Ukraine out your fucking mouth!!!” Smith is depicted as saying in the piece, a reworking of the actor’s comment to Rock’s joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. Todd Goodman, a California-based ESL teacher and fine artist whose street art moniker is 1GoodHombre, painted the piece in the mural-filled Fame Yard parking lot on Melrose Avenue with Ukrainian artists Liza Onatsko, Alex Pilkevych, Sergey Podgurskiy and George Zhyvotovskyi. The space is curated by street artist Corie Mattie, who went viral during the coronavirus pandemic with her LA Hope Dealer project. The anti-Putin mural was finished Sunday. Goodman wanted to use the scandal surrounding Smith’s slap “to draw attention to this obviously more important subject of war, and the humanitarian crisis facing Ukrainians,” he told HuffPost on Saturday. “Given the proximity to Hollywood, I wanted to use this moment, this town, this ridiculous situation, to draw attention to the war, with the hopes of not only raising awareness but also to raise money for humanitarian aid,” he explained, noting how a QR code next to the mural directs people to GlobalGiving’s Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund. “If people could only learn to channel their emotions through creative expression, through art, through language, instead of resorting to violence to achieve their goals, the world would be a much better place,” the artist added. “Make art, not war. My paintings, like a comedian’s words are not violence, they could never hurt another person, only maybe a person’s feelings, and we have ways of dealing with hurt feelings that do not require violence.” Goodman first took his art from the canvas to the streets in 2020 after becoming angered by the police killing of George Floyd and tensions surrounding the then-upcoming presidential election. “As the city of LA was quickly boarded up, COVID keeping people off the streets, there was a nearly infinite amount of space and freedom to cover the city in street art,” he recalled. “I had a lot of shit to say, and there was plenty of time and space to say it.” A post shared by 1GoodHombre (@1goodhombre) The 1GoodHombre alter ego is a Spanish play on his surname and a direct response to Donald Trump’s disgusting “bad hombres” criticism of Mexican immigrants. “I was thoroughly insulted by that, as a human being, but also as the husband of a Spanish-speaking immigrant,” he said. “To counter that kind of hate or evil in the world, I hope that this moniker inspires people to understand that all it takes is one good hombre, one good person to stand up against evil, against hate, to create a better world, and any one of us can choose to be that person every single day.” Goodman’s true identity remained unknown until last month when he “decided to come out into the light in support of Ukraine,” he told HuffPost, for an Associated Press article about pro-Ukraine street art and his portrayal of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, including this one of him touting machine guns with the message “Fuck Putin.” A post shared by 1GoodHombre (@1goodhombre) Now? He just hopes the new mural provides “a moment of catharsis for the people of Ukraine or anyone who is hurting or feeling victimized by Putin’s invasion.” “I’ve had that feeling of catharsis once in my life, where a piece of art just cleansed my soul, as a Jew watching Tarantino’s ‘Inglourious Basterds,’” he said. “God, after all those years of hearing stories from family members who were survivors, watching documentaries on the Holocaust and ‘Schindler’s List,’ finally, we were strong, we were fighting back, we were kicking the shit out of Nazis.” “I’ve never had that feeling before until that moment, and it was absolutely fucking glorious!” he remembered. “That is the feeling that I want to inspire in people: ‘No, fuck that guy, we’re not gonna take this shit lying down! No! You will not oppress us!’”",4.436536782731427,4.7131103150892075,-0.2765735323577809,28

Moldova, which moved last month to join the European Union, summoned Moscow’s ambassador on Friday to express “deep concern” over the general’s chilling remarks. Russia has revealed its true goal as brazen “imperialism,” Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.

The new plan, called Uniting for Ukraine, will allow U.S. citizens and groups to financially sponsor people fleeing Ukraine to come to the U.S. The goal is to admit 100,000 of about 5 million people who have fled since Russia invaded their country in February. U.S. officials said the program is also intended to deter Ukrainians from traveling to Mexico to attempt to enter the U.S. via the southern border. Around 15,000 undocumented Ukrainians have arrived during the last three months, mostly at the U.S.-Mexico border, senior administration officials told reporters on Thursday. The application process for the new program will be “fairly quick” — about a week for clear-cut applications, The Washington Post reported, citing a senior administration official. While immigration and refugee advocates applauded the goal of the program, past efforts to expand refugee admission to the U.S. suggest it won’t be so simple to bring in 100,000 Ukrainians. “The administration is saying they expect these cases to be decided within a week — I think that’s very ambitious,” said Theresa Cardinal Brown, Bipartisan Policy Center’s managing director of immigration and cross-border policy. “I hope they’re right, but I’m currently skeptical.” The streamlined process, set to launch on April 25, will rely on a humanitarian parole program, a tool mostly used for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. It allows certain Ukrainians who have sponsors in the U.S. to enter and stay for two years without having to seek a visa or go through backlogged refugee procedures. Humanitarian parole has been previously used in crisis circumstances to resettle Vietnamese in 1975 and Iraqi Kurds in 1996. More recently, it was used to relocate and resettle tens of thousands of Afghans in the wake of the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban’s takeover of the country. Afghan refugee resettlement was supposed to be accelerated, too — but it hasn’t turned out that way. In September, the Biden administration introduced humanitarian parole as a tool for speeding up the relocation of at-risk Afghans who were left behind by the U.S. pullout. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has struggled to keep up with a surge in applications that is 20 times larger than the total number of applications it receives in a typical year, Al Jazeera reported. The process has stalled after almost seven months. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told Al Jazeera in February that of more than 40,000 Afghan humanitarian parole applications filed since July 2021, it had denied 930 and conditionally approved just 160. The overwhelming majority have yet to be processed, and the agency offered no timeline for their completion. The refugee resettlement process as a whole was significantly damaged by the Trump administration, which attempted to slash U.S. efforts to welcome people fleeing other countries. Biden announced a goal of admitting 125,000 refugees this fiscal year, but the U.S. is nowhere near doing so. Only 8,758 refugees have been admitted in the first six months of the current fiscal year, according to State Department figures. Prioritizing applications from Ukraine could put unprocessed cases at the bottom of the pile. “It’s not like there is excess capacity in the U.S. government, sitting around doing nothing that can now be applied to process these new applications,” Brown said. “Everybody is fully occupied processing the existing applications. And we know we have backlogs.” The Ukrainian program does have some unique aspects. Unlike Afghan evacuees who have been paroled into the United States without sponsors and were resettled through resettlement agencies, the new program requires Ukrainians to have an individual or group in the United States that’s willing to sponsor their arrival. Sponsorship is intended “to provide the initial financial and other support that will help Ukrainians integrate and regain their footing here in the United States,” said Nazanin Ash, CEO of Welcome.US, a refugee group encouraging Americans to sponsor Ukrainians refugees. “We have far more capacity as a nation,” Ash said. “And we are tapping into the goodwill of a much broader range of American institutions and American people.” A YouGov poll conducted for Welcome.US shows that 72% of Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and independents, support the United States welcoming Ukrainians fleeing the war. About 90 million American adults are already taking part in helping Ukrainian refugees settle in the U.S., or would like to, the survey found. But the government’s ability to process applications quickly could be an issue, Ash said. Once sponsorship is approved, Ukrainians will receive travel authorization to the United States and will be considered for parole only after they undergo vaccinations and other public health requirements, pass rigorous biometric and biographic screening, and are vetted in security checks. “I am concerned that that is going to be a potential constraint on people fleeing Ukraine being able to find safety quickly,” Ash added. Even after arrival in the U.S., Ukrainians are likely to face even more backlogs in the immigration system. While parole allows for temporary lawful presence, it does not confer immigration status and does not provide a path to lawful permanent residence. Once here, however, refugees could apply for asylum. “What’s going to happen when that temporary status expires?” Melanie Nezer, senior vice president at HIAS, a refugee resettlement organization, told The Washington Post. “There is a concern that this would just add to the undocumented population here if Congress doesn’t act.” Ukrainians will be eligible for work authorization once paroled through this process, but that could take months, Brown said. Meanwhile, refugee organizations want similar protections for other refugees from around the world who have fled violence and persecution, including those who have left their homes in Cameroon, Ethiopia, and Mauritania, as well as tens of thousands more Afghan allies who were left in their country. Ash said she hopes the U.S. can replicate quicker processing for other refugees, too. “The U.S. government recognized that we needed a rapid mechanism for people to be able to come to safety,” Ash said. “These are really important innovations that now we need to standardize, replicate, and recognize for all refugee populations.”",4.309037661481082,4.148585314793898,0.1604523466871841,5

He rejected a U.S. offer to be evacuated at the start of the invasion, despite reports of a Russian bounty on his head.

Carlson’s history of pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine rhetoric dates back years.

The testimonies coming from Ukrainians include gang rapes, assaults taking place at gunpoint, rapes committed in front of victims’ children, as well as torture and mutilation. There have been several reports of Ukrainian women who were raped and then murdered by Russian forces. One Ukrainian woman described on camera how multiple Russian fighters raped her after they rolled into her village with tanks. Another reported that two Russian soldiers murdered her husband on their front lawn and then repeatedly raped her in her basement with her 4-year-old son sobbing in a room down the hall. A group of 15 Ukrainian soldiers, all women, had their heads shaved and were forced to undress and squat for hours while in Russian detention. A dead Ukrainian woman was found in a cellar, shot in the head and naked except for a fur coat, with a used condom and condom wrappers around her. In one of the most abhorrent testimonies, 25 girls and women, ranging from 14 to 24 years old, were locked in a basement and gang-raped repeatedly in Bucha, a city near the capital of Kyiv. Nine of the victims are now pregnant. “Russian soldiers told them they would rape them to the point where they wouldn’t want sexual contact with any man, to prevent them from having Ukrainian children,” said Ukraine’s ombudsman for human rights Lyudmyla Denisova. World leaders have condemned Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, for the atrocities in Ukraine. President Joe Biden recently called Putin a war criminal, describing the actions of the Russian military as “major war crimes.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month that the horrors in Bucha were “not the random act of a rogue unit” but a “deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded for the world to act in a powerful speech to the United Nations Security Council earlier this month. “Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them,” he said after visiting Bucha, which has seen some of the most horrific violence. “Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It’s not there. Where is the peace?” Rape has been used as a weapon of war for thousands of years, but it’s not found in every conflict, according to Dara Kay Cohen, a professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and author of “Rape During Civil War.” For the past decade, Cohen’s work has focused on international relations, civil war and the dynamics of gender and violence in conflicts. The Russia-Ukraine war, however, seems to be ripe for the abuse of sexual violence, Cohen told HuffPost. Ukrainian men ages 18 to 60 were not allowed to leave the country because they will likely be drafted to fight, so the majority of people fleeing the country are women with children and unaccompanied minors. On the other side, about a quarter of the Russian military is made up of conscripts and there have been many reports that a large number of Russian soldiers don’t believe in the cause they’re fighting for. All of this could lead to a perfect storm of sexual violence in conflict. HuffPost spoke with Cohen about how sexual violence is weaponized in conflicts and why armed groups sometimes commit these types of crimes — and what this means in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. (This interview was edited for brevity and clarity.) How is sexual violence weaponized in conflict zones? There are a huge number of ways that rape is used in wartime. Feminist scholars have argued for a long time about the ways that rape can be used as a form of torture, as a form of humiliation, as a signal that the men of one group can humiliate the men of an enemy group with the message that they can’t protect their women from this terrible violence. It’s been used as a tool of genocide, it’s been used in the context of ethnic wars and non-ethnic wars. But one important point is that rape in wartime is not ubiquitous — it does not happen in every conflict. Even within the context of the same conflict, some armed groups commit sexual violence and other groups do not. One of the keys to understanding why rape happens in wartime is really focusing [on the armed groups themselves] rather than on the region of the world, the country, the level of democracy, etc. All those things might be contributing factors, but what I’ve argued in my research is that the most important part is understanding the armed group that’s committing the sexual violence. What are some indicators that lead you to believe one armed group will commit a higher level of sexual violence than another? One red flag is to look at recent history with these very same military forces. We know … that Russian forces and Russian-backed groups in recent years have committed sexual violence in places like Chechnya, Crimea and in eastern Ukraine. There is a history, a recent history, of this type of violence committed with these same groups. Another red flag is about the composition of the armed groups themselves, the fact that there is conscription. Scholars of civilian victimization and wartime atrocities have found that armed groups that have committed substantial resources to political education use restraint when interacting with civilian populations. Put simply, fighters who know what they’re fighting for or fighters who believe in the cause tend to not abuse civilians to the same extent. We know in Ukraine right now, some Russian fighters have no idea what they’re fighting for and may not believe in the cause very strongly. One of the areas of concern for me and some of my colleagues has been because of what we know about the composition of the Russian forces. Not only are there conscripts, but there also are reports of forced recruitment — literal kidnapping. In other contexts, we have observed those conditions to cause an uptick in sexual violence. Armed groups that recruit their fighters through force are more likely to commit sexual violence. There are also foreign fighters joining the fight in the Ukrainian conflict. That’s another correlate with increased atrocities including increased reports of sexual violence. When there are foreign fighters introduced into someone else’s war, we might expect that these groups suffer from low cohesion. And sexual violence is one consequence of that. “Fighters who believe in the cause tend to not abuse civilians to the same extent. We know in Ukraine right now, some Russian fighters have no idea what they’re fighting for and may not believe in the cause very strongly.” So sexual violence can be a sort of bonding mechanism for fighters in an armed group with low cohesion? That’s correct. There’s a pretty large uptick in reports of multiple perpetrator rape or gang rape, specifically, in the context of wartime. Gang rape is a relatively rare form of sexual violence in peacetime, even in places where rape is quite common. Something like 70% to 80% of reported rape in conflict zones can be gang rape. One of the key factors I found in my research is looking at the function of gang rape, the purpose of gang rape from the perspective of the perpetrating group. I found that gang rape helps armed groups that suffer from low cohesion to essentially overcome that problem. It’s a way of signaling virility and masculinity, which can create social bonds between members of armed groups — particularly members of armed groups that have been forcibly recruited. That sounds relevant to our conversation about the war in Ukraine since about a quarter of the Russian army is made up of conscripts and there have been reports of foreign fighters joining the fight on both sides. There’s a couple of important factors to keep in mind. One is that the people who commit multiple perpetrator rape are, I guess for lack of a better word, more normal or less pathological than people who tend to commit rapes on their own. Many of the contexts I have studied, such as civil wars, these are just ordinary people. These are not criminals. These are not people with a thirst for violence in any way. They’re farmers, they’re students, they’re regular people that have been scooped up by armed groups and beaten and forced to join. It is those same ordinary people who go on to commit these acts of mass rape. There’s a set of studies authored by [Joseph] Vandello on this concept called “precarious manhood.” Vandello and his colleagues argued that if masculinity is threatened, then one way of recovering from the blow of that threat is to perform a physical act, often a violent physical act. In my book, I argue that the act of being forcibly recruited is a major blow to one’s masculinity and one way of recovering that is to perform the ultimate act of physical, hyper-masculine violence: an act of sexualized violence. There have been reports of Russian soldiers using sexual violence as a tool of genocide in Ukraine. Can you talk to me about that? There is evidence that sexual violence has occurred during genocide, although it doesn’t occur during all genocides. We have some examples where sexual contact with the enemy other during a genocide is completely prohibited. It’s not that sexual violence did not occur during the Holocaust, but there were not reports of mass rape or anything close to the levels we knew to happen in other genocides like Rwanda or Bosnia. In the case of the Holocaust, there was a pollution taboo between Jews and Nazis. And, actually, that pollution taboo may have protected folks from being sexually violated. One working hypothesis one of my colleagues [Yale professor] Elisabeth Wood proposed is that rape is actually more likely to occur during a genocide when there was a great deal of intermarriage before the genocide: when there’s close cultural ties between the groups, which seems to be the case in Ukraine and Russia. In the context of genocide, scholars often study what was said to victims and survivors to try to understand the motivations for rape. One of the most concerning reports I believe came out of Bucha where a group of women were [reportedly] held in a basement and raped repeatedly. There were 25 women and girls, and now nine are pregnant. Reports have suggested that the perpetrators told those women things like, “You’ll be raped until no Ukrainian man will want you” or “You’ll be raped so much that we’ll erase the next generation.” That was the implicit — if not explicit — message. Those are all very concerning signs of the genocidal use of sexual violence during conflict. When we discuss rape in wartime, often we only discuss women as victims. Are the majority of victims of sexual violence in conflict zones women? Are there victims of other genders in these situations? That’s a really important question. We know from reports that the majority of victims of sexual violence across conflict contexts are women and girls, but that does not mean that men and boys aren’t also victims of sexual violence. For a long time, scholars approached research on sexual violence assuming that perpetrators are men and victims are women. So, if you wanted to study the question of sexual violence and conflict, you needed to go talk to women. Period. Over time, as we have learned more about how diverse the pools of perpetrators and the pools of victims and survivors are, we’ve gotten much better at asking questions. On a global scale, there are surprisingly large numbers of men and boys who are victimized by sexual violence in contexts of conflict. Really folks of all genders, although there’s diminishingly small evidence because we have a very incomplete evidence base when it comes to LGBTQ+ folks as victims of sexual violence. In some contexts, sexual violence is even more highly stigmatized for men and boys, particularly if the perpetrators are also men. In some contexts, homosexuality is illegal or punishable by death. So, the ability to come forward and report those crimes is really restricted. It’s also the case that in some contexts, rape might be culturally defined as an act of violence that can only happen to women, so even if a man experiences rape it’s not defined as an act of rape. What do we know about what happens to victims in the aftermath of conflict? We know that surviving sexual violence in a conflict is traumatizing. It can have devastating consequences on survivors’ psychological health, on their relationships with their family members, on their relationships with their communities. It can be a terrible and terrifying form of violence to survive. We also know that often it’s not the only thing that a survivor has experienced in conflict. There is a danger in ... assuming it’s the worst thing ... that can happen to a woman in wartime, because that ends up reifying these very patriarchal ideas about women’s sexual purity. It might be the worst thing on the individual level, but we shouldn’t always assume it’s the worst thing. There’s a real concern about creating a hierarchy of harms, as it’s called, and treating sexual violence like it is the ultimate harm that one can suffer. Although women are disproportionately represented among victims of sexual violence, it’s not the case that all women experience sexual violence during conflict, even during mass rape wars. It’s still a relatively rare form of violence compared to forced displacement and other forms of violence that are likely to be much more widespread during conflict. Need help?

Biden, speaking at the White House following a meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, said his administration’s decision is designed to directly support the people of Ukraine and “hold Putin accountable for his brutal and bloody war.” “We’re in a critical window now of time where [Russia’s] going to set the stage for the next phase of this war and the U.S. and our allies and partners are moving as fast as possible to continue to provide Ukraine with ... the equipment that they need, their forces need, to defend their nation,” he said. This fresh military aid package, which follows a separate $800 million one Biden signed last week, is designed to support Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, which has faced unrelenting attacks from Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. It will include heavy artillery weapons, dozens of howitzers, 144,000 rounds of ammunition and tactical drones, he said. The separate economic aid, meanwhile, will help keep localities running. “This is money the government can use to support their economy, to support communities that have been devastated by the Russian onslaught, and pay the brave workers that continue to provide essential services to the people of Ukraine,” he said. Congress last month approved $13.6 billion for military and humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, which Biden said Thursday is “almost exhausted.” He said he would be sending a supplemental budget request to Congress next week to ensure Ukraine continues to receive assistance. He did not say how much he may be requesting. Biden said the U.S. is also banning all Russian affiliated ships from U.S. ports, following similar steps taken in the European Union and the U.K. “That means no ship, no ship that sails under the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by a Russian interest will be allowed to dock in a United States port or access our shores. None. None,” he said. This will ensure Russia will no longer receive the benefits of an international economic system that “they so enjoyed in the past,” he said.",3.353544085605165,3.176907694077551,0.17663639152761412,3

With a “significant part of the entire Russian army” now deployed in the region, according to Zelenskyy, here’s what you need to know about what could be a turning point in the conflict. On February 24, Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine. Tanks and soldiers streamed across the border, in scenes more reminiscent of World War II than the remote cyber warfare that modern conflict was supposed to be dominated by. Russia’s invasion has damaged or destroyed up to 30% of Ukraine’s infrastructure at a cost of $100 billion, Ukrainian officials have said, as the United Nations revealed the civilian death toll has now surpassed 2,000. About 4 million Ukrainians have fled the country. But Russia’s swift march to victory did not materialize. Driven back by Ukrainian resistance in the north, Moscow has refocused its ground offensive in the two eastern provinces known as the Donbas, while launching long-distance strikes at other targets including the capital, Kyiv. The Donbas is Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland in the east, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for the past eight years and have declared two independent republics that have been recognised by Russia. In recent weeks, the Kremlin declared the capture of the Donbas its main goal of the war after its attempt to storm Kyiv failed. After withdrawing from the capital, it began regrouping and reinforcing its ground troops in the east for what could be a climactic battle. On Monday, Ukraine military generals said Russian forces were increasing assaults in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions — both of which are part of the Donbas — as well as in the area of Zaporizhzhia. They also said Russia was sending reinforcements to the Crimean peninsula — seized from Ukraine in 2014 — and to the Rostov-on-Don area, which borders Ukraine. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak called it “the second phase of the war” and assured Ukrainians that their forces could hold off the offensive. “Believe in our army, it is very strong,” he said. The Associated Press reported a senior U.S. defense official saying there are now 76 Russian combat units in eastern and southern Ukraine, up from 65 last week. That could translate to around 50,000 to 60,000 troops. ⚡️Foreign minister: Battle of Donbas will be similar to World War II.“This will not be a local operation based on what we see from Russia’s preparations,” Dmytro Kuleba said, adding that he expects large-scale operations involving thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft. Russia’s stuttering campaign means control of eastern Ukraine has taken added significance, and may prompt the fiercest fighting yet. Russia needs some kind of “win”— recognizing Russia’s claims in the Donbas and Crimea has also been the central plank of Vladamir Putin’s demands at failed peace talks — and following the sinking of its Black Sea lead ship, Putin will not be contemplating further embarrassment. The new offensive in the east came as a Russian missile attack killed seven people in Lviv, the first civilian victims in the western city about 40 miles from Poland. It was one of a multitude of other targets across Ukraine in what appeared to be an intensified bid to grind down the country’s defenses. Lviv has seen only sporadic attacks during almost two months of war and has become a haven for civilians fleeing the fighting elsewhere. Now President Zelensky, in a new public address, says Russia has begun the battle for the Donbas and concentrated a large part of its army there for an all-out offensive in eastern Ukraine.  In other developments, Ukrainian troops remained holed up at a mammoth steel mill in Mariupol, the last known pocket of resistance in the devastated southern port city. The capture of Mariupol, where Ukraine estimates 21,000 people have been killed, is seen as key, and not just because it would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean peninsula. General Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British Army, told Sky News that Russia is waging a “softening-up” campaign ahead of the Donbas offensive. The U.S. defense official said that if Russian forces succeed in taking full control of Mariupol, that could free up nearly a dozen combat units for use elsewhere in the Donbas. Given the changing dynamics of the war, Ukraine is calling for an increasing supply of Western weapons. Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the aid to include heavy artillery ahead of the wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. military expects to start training Ukrainians on using howitzer artillery in coming days, with the training taking place outside Ukraine.

Chris Coons (D-Del.) suggested the U.S. may need to step up its military support for Ukraine if Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates further and repeats the horrific tactics used in the 11-year-old war in Syria. “I deeply worry that what’s going to happen next is that we will see Ukraine turn into Syria. The American people cannot turn away from this tragedy in Ukraine. I think the history of the 21st century turns on how fiercely we defend freedom in Ukraine and that Putin will only stop when we stop him,” Coons said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” when asked if he supported direct U.S. military involvement in Ukraine. Last week, Coons said U.S. policymakers need to set clear guidelines about the use of military force ― including the sending of troops ― if Russia uses chemical weapons or if some sort of accident leads to the death of U.S. service members in the region. “We are in a very dangerous moment where it is important that, in a bipartisan and measured way, we in Congress and the administration come to a common position about when we are willing to go the next step and to send not just arms but troops to the aid in defense of Ukraine,” the senator, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said during a discussion hosted by the University of Michigan. He added: “If the answer is never then we are inviting another level of escalation in brutality by Putin.” President Joe Biden has repeatedly ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine, a move that could risk opening a wider war between two nuclear powers: the U.S. and Russia. The idea of sending troops to directly aid Ukraine is also broadly unpopular on Capitol Hill; even some of the staunchest war hawks on the Republican side of the aisle are opposed to it. Coons sought to clarify his remarks on Monday, tweeting that he was “not calling for U.S. troops to go into the war in Ukraine.” The senator said the global community “must be willing to take more forceful steps, from broadened sanctions to sending more advanced weapons to being prepared to respond if he escalates further in his war crimes against Ukraine.” Biden hasn’t shied away from describing the horrors in Ukraine as a “genocide” or calling Putin a “war criminal.” The president also approved another $800 million of weapons systems and other security assistance to Ukraine, on top of billions of dollars in aid already approved by Congress. Top lawmakers have suggested Congress will need to pass another security assistance package as Russia regroups and prepares a new offensive in eastern Ukraine. As the war in Ukraine, which began at the end of February, turns to a new phase, journalists and Ukrainian authorities have reported horrific scenes in towns and villages left by fleeing Russian troops, including mass graves, executions, torture, rape and looting involving Ukrainian civilians. “The most terrible war crimes we’ve seen since the end of World War II are being committed,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a televised speech to the United Nations General Assembly earlier this month, later arguing that “Russia wants to turn Ukraine into silent slaves.”",2.901139682619721,2.9973433367176625,-0.09620365409794163,3

They just killed people, not soldiers. People. They just shot people in the streets,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper of the numerous atrocities seen throughout the country since the start of Russia’s invasion, while highlighting the slaughter of people in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, in particular. “These were not soldiers; they were civilians. They bound their hands; they forced children to watch as they raped their mothers; then they threw them in a well or in mass graves. Children, adults, the elderly. And we have substantial evidence that points to this being a genocide, audio and video where they talk about just how much they hate us,” he said in an interview that aired in full Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr @ZelenskyyUa tells CNN's @jaketapper that his country has ""substantial evidence"" that Russia is committing genocide. #CNNSOTU  Video and satellite images taken in Bucha in recent weeks show bodies lining the streets while Russia’s military was in control of the region, rebutting Russia’s claim that the bodies had been placed there after its military left. Some of the bodies were seen with their hands bound behind their backs and gunshot wounds to the head. Zelenskyy, a father of two, expressed particular heartbreak over a recent video circulating that shows a mother finding her child’s body down a well in the village of Buzova near Kyiv. He called the video “the most horrifying thing I have seen in my life.” “I can’t watch it as a father, only because all you want after this is revenge and to kill. I have to watch it as the president of a state where a lot of people have died and lost their loved ones,” he said. “And there are millions of people who want to live. All of us want to fight. But we all have to do our best for this war not to be endless. The longer it is, the more we would lose.” He further shared his belief that the violence could escalate beyond Ukraine’s borders, stressing that Russia could use chemical or nuclear weapons and the rest of the world should “be ready.” “For them, life of the people is nothing,” he said. President Joe Biden on Tuesday also said he believes the killings in Ukraine are genocide but that he will “let the lawyers decide, internationally, whether or not it qualifies.” French President Emmanuel Macron, who has engaged in diplomatic discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of the war, has meanwhile stopped short of using such a label, saying an “escalation of words” won’t bring peace. Zelenskyy said he has addressed Macron directly about that opinion and has invited the French leader, as well as Biden, to visit Ukraine to see the death and destruction firsthand. “He’ll come and see, and I am sure he will understand,” Zelenskyy said of Macron. Genocide is a crime recognized under international law as an act that intends “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,” according to the Genocide Convention, which was ratified by the U.S. in 1988. The U.S. has recognized genocide only eight times since the Holocaust, with the government most recently in March accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against its minority Rohingya population. That recognition came nearly five years after the peak of the violence and follows similar recognitions by other countries, including Canada, France and Turkey.",2.7245171904767713,4.005831543438542,-1.2813143529617705,2

The city of Mariupol has gained international attention in part due to the vast documentation of its nonstop destruction at the hands of the Russian military. The shell of a city appeared on the brink of falling to the Russians on Sunday after Ukrainian defenders did not submit to Moscow’s midday deadline for their surrender, but Shmyhal maintained that the city still belongs to Ukraine. “No, [the] city still has not fallen. There is still our military forces, our soldiers, so they will fight to the end. As for now, they still are in Mariupol,” he told George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week.” “But there is [a] huge humanitarian catastrophe because there is more than 100 civilians which are suffering for more than 40 days of this humanitarian crisis … in this besieged city,” he continued. “And they have no water, no food, no heat, no electricity. And we ask all of our partners to support and help to stop this humanitarian catastrophe in Mariupol.” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal tells @GStephanopoulos that the city of Mariupol has not yet fallen to Russian forces because Ukrainian soldiers “will fight till the end.” “But there is a huge humanitarian catastrophe.”  Mariupol has been under relentless attack by Russian forces that pounded most of the buildings and, according to Ukraine, killed at least 21,000 people. Russian military fired a lethal airstrike at a maternity hospital in the first couple of weeks of the invasion, and about 300 Ukrainians were reported killed in a theater where civilians, including children, were taking shelter. The city was home to about 450,000 before Russia invaded. An estimated 100,000 now remain, according to The Associated Press. The Russian military claims that about 2,500 Ukrainian fighters are holding out at a steel plant in the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol. That claim could not be independently verified. This is “what the Russian Federation did, deliberately did. And deliberately continues to destroy cities. Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday in a virtual address, adding that the situation in the port city remains as “severe as possible” and that the devastation is “just inhuman.” Capturing Mariupol would be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s biggest victory in Ukraine after two months of costly fighting, major military deaths and forced withdrawal from some cities, as well as a worsening economy in Russia from increasing Western sanctions. The nuclear superpower also recently faced the humiliating loss of the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet to what Ukraine claimed was a missile attack. Russia’s potential seizure of Mariupol would allow Putin to secure a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula — which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014 — and deprive the smaller country of a major port. The seizure would also allow more Russian troops to be available for the offensive on the east. Shmyhal said Sunday that Ukraine will try to stop the war “in any way,” including diplomatically when possible. But if Russians refuse to negotiate in good faith, “we will fight to the end, absolutely.” “We will not surrender. We won’t leave our country, our families, our land,” he continued. “So we will fight absolutely to the end, to win in this war.”",2.1498535086566375,2.4708735598731955,-0.32102005121655797,3

And deliberately continues to destroy cities. Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol,” Zelenskyy said in a virtual address. He pointed to the horrifying tragedy to again plead for the international community to give Ukraine “all necessary heavy weapons” and planes “immediately” to defend itself against the brutal invading forces. “I want to be heard right now: There has not been a single day since the blockade of Mariupol that we have not sought a solution — military or diplomatic, anything to save people. But finding this solution is extremely difficult. So far, there is no 100% valid option,” Zelenskyy said. Russia’s defense ministry claimed on Saturday that beyond a small Ukrainian group of fighters still left, Russian forces had “completely cleared” ​​Mariupol. Pavlo Kyrylenko, military governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region, told CNN in an interview Friday that Mariupol “has been wiped off the face of the earth by the Russian Federation” but that Ukrainian troops are holding the area.

Ukraine officials reported — and a Pentagon source confirmed — that the Russian navy’s Black Sea fleet flagship sank Thursday after at least two Ukrainian Neptune missiles struck it. Russia acknowledged a fire on board but did not admit the ship had been hit. Kremlin officials said the Moskva sank in stormy seas as it was being hauled to a port after it was evacuated. The once-mighty warship will now make a “worthy” dive site, quipped Reznikov, who’s an ocean diver. “Will definitely visit the wreck after our victory in the war,” he added in a tweet that featured a photo of him on a dive. A ""flagship"" russian warship is a worthy diving site. We have one more diving spot in the Black Sea now. Will definitely visit the wreck after our victory in the war.BTW, I already have 300 scuba dives  The loss of the Moskva is both a real and a devastating symbolic loss for Russia. It’s also one that holds particular significance for Ukrainians. During the first days of the war, it was reportedly officers on the Moskva who ordered Ukrainian soldiers stationed on Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender. Instead, they replied via radio: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” It was initially believed all the Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the confrontation. Some did die, but others were captured by Russia, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told journalists last month. Those captured — including the soldier who actually transmitted the message to the warship — were released as part of a prisoner swap, and all were honored in Ukraine as heroes. After the showdown, Ukraine quickly issued a new stamp highlighting the soldiers’ defiant response that featured an image of one of them flipping off the warship. #Ukraine Roman Hrybov, the Ukrainian soldier, who said the now-famous ""Russian warship, go fuck yourself"" phrase when asked to surrender, returned home.

Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper in Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv on Friday, Zelenskyy warned that “countries have to be worried” about the potential use of tactical nuclear and chemical weapons. “Not only me, all of the world, all of the countries have to be worried, because it can be not real information, but it can be truth,” Zelenskyy, who spoke in English, told Tapper during their sit-down interview. “Chemical weapons ... they could do it,” Zelenskyy added. “For them, the life of the people is nothing.” The invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces entered its 50th day this week, and Zelenskyy praised the resolve of Ukrainians in an address to the nation, pointing out that Russia had planned to take Kyiv within a matter of days. That hasn’t happened, but Russia’s military has continued its brutal assault and shelling of civilian cities, killing over 5,000 civilians in the city of Mariupol alone, according to its mayor. Russia has also suffered cataclysmic losses, including the deaths of more than 15,000 soldiers, according to NATO estimates from late March. And the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet was destroyed this week after it was targeted by Ukrainian missiles. Last month, CNN’s Christiane Amanpour asked Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov if Putin was considering using nuclear weapons in his assault on Ukraine. “President Putin said that if anybody tries to stop him, very bad things will happen,” Amanpour said. “And I want to know whether you are convinced or confident that your boss will not use that option.” Peskov didn’t rule it out. “Well, we have a concept of domestic security, and, well, it’s public,” Peskov responded. “You can read all the reasons for nuclear arms to be used. So, if it is an existential threat for our country, then [nuclear weapons] can be used, in accordance with our concept.”",2.95961909163981,2.958710964931285,0.0009081267085249145,15

Ilya Ponomarev, a Putin critic from Siberia who served in Russia’s State Duma from 2007 to 2016, spoke to CNN’s Jake Tapper about how he ended up fighting with Ukrainian forces in Kyiv. He has lived in the Ukrainian capital since 2016. “What else could I do under those circumstances?” he said. “When Putin’s forces were advancing, we needed to defend the country. We needed to defend the capital.” Ponomarev was the only lawmaker to vote against Russia’s annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014. The vote passed 445-1. Former member of Russian Parliament Ilya Ponomarev talks to CNN's @jaketapper about why he is fighting on the front lines with Ukrainian forces.  Ponomarev said he’s been warned that he is on a Russian hit list, but that hasn’t stopped him from wanting to fight. He believes Putin is losing the war, though the president may try to claim an “imaginary victory,” he added. “The reality is that he is losing the war. And I think that the Ukrainian army and the Ukrainian people would not stop before Ukraine certainly will be free,” he said. “And I believe it will.” He said what Ukraine needs most now is clear skies. Many Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have called for enforcement of a no-fly zone over the country to try to repel airstrikes that have targeted both the military and civilians. Western powers have resisted implementing one over concerns it could provoke open conflict with Russia, with the potential to evolve into a nuclear war. During his time in office, Ponomarev ran afoul of his colleagues and the Kremlin by speaking out against government corruption. In 2012, he led antigovernment street protests that rattled Moscow before Putin’s return to the presidency.

Almost as well as I know you, Sean,” Trump told his close confidante, Fox News host Sean Hannity, as the network aired graphic images of dead bodies and the damage left by Russian troops in Ukraine. “I will tell you, we talked about it, we talked about it a lot, he did want Ukraine, but I said, ‘You’re not going into Ukraine,’” Trump continued. “He would never, ever have gone into Ukraine.” Minutes earlier, Hannity had prompted Trump to denounce Putin. “I asked you the last time you were on, whether you think that this is evil in our time,” Hannity said. “Do you believe this is evil in our time?” Trump did not answer the question; instead ,he ranted about NATO. “Don’t forget, I rebuilt NATO,” Trump falsely claimed. Trump also called what was happening in Ukraine a “genocide,” joining President Joe Biden in characterizing Russia’s atrocities as such. Trump: I knew Putin very well. Almost as well as I know you Sean.  Last month, Hannity tried twice to get Trump to condemn Putin during an on-air interview, to no avail. Trump also faced backlash after initially praising what he called the authoritarian leader’s “genius” strategy for invading Ukraine. He has repeatedly insisted that Putin would not have dared invade Ukraine if he was still president. Hannity and Trump’s eldest sons have offered their own commentary on the former president’s relationship to Putin. Hannity said Trump’s praise of the Russian president was “taken out of context.” Donald Trump Jr. claimed his dad’s affection for dictators was an act in order to “play these guys.” And Eric Trump lauded his father’s “great relationship” with Putin and claimed that if he was still running the country, he would have simply called Putin and said, “Vladimir, don’t even think about” invading Ukraine.

Ilhan Omar: Accountability For Russia Means Abandoning U.S. ‘Hypocrisy’,"Mounting evidence of widespread Russian atrocities in Ukraine is spurring the Biden administration and lawmakers from both parties to demand justice at a global level — specifically, at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Now Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) is challenging them to boost that prospect by making the U.S. a member of the court and repealing a George W. Bush-era law that requires the U.S. to block the court from investigating Americans. “We’ve engaged in a process for a long time of delegitimizing these international institutions that essentially call for accountability, and I think it is really disturbing that we now think they are powerful enough … to hold Russia accountable. It’s easy for people to see the hypocrisy in those two statements when we’ve said previously that we don’t believe in the ability of the court to [be] unbiased,” Omar said on Wednesday. The congresswoman spoke with HuffPost to discuss a new plan to introduce a package of legislation in the House of Representatives on Thursday that would set the U.S. on a course to join the court. She shared previously unreported aspects of the package: revoking the 2002 measure known as the Hague Invasion Act and enshrining the position of the State Department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice, a team that the Trump administration considering shutting down. “It’s really important for us not to have a law on the books that says in many ways it is OK for everyone to be prosecuted” but not Americans, Omar told HuffPost. “Think about just how much more powerful of a statement it would be if we didn’t just call for accountability for war crimes in Ukraine in holding Russians accountable for the possible war crimes they have committed but if we actually had skin in the game.” Progressives like Omar see developing a loud, nuanced position on Ukraine as critical to expanding their influence over national security policy and reforming the U.S.’s approach to global affairs. Conservatives and the Pentagon have argued for years that if the U.S. joined the court, American officials would face unfair and politically motivated investigations. But every Republican in the Senate recently voted for legislation recommending the court as a venue for probing Russia’s abuses, and House Republicans are supporting a bill urging the court to prosecute Putin if any harm befalls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, Biden administration officials are discussing how to support the court’s work on the Ukraine war, according to The New York Times, and former senator Chris Dodd and former White House lawyer John Bellinger say it is possible for the U.S. to do so despite domestic laws limiting the court’s reach. Echoing the discussion about greater international accountability, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said on Tuesday that she backs a proposal to call U.N. General Assembly sessions after a member of the U.N. Security Council uses their veto power over U.N. actions. That step could make it harder for Russia to use the veto to shield itself — but also increase scrutiny of America’s vetoes. “Everybody is coming around to recognizing that these bodies that uphold international law are an important part of international accountability,” Omar told HuffPost. “If we all agree with that statement then we have to re-assume the mantle of leadership and give full backing and legitimacy to the court.” Noting that President Bill Clinton made a limited effort to join the court before President George W. Bush launched a foreign policy largely rejecting any degree of global governance, Omar said she sees the U.S. failure to participate as an abandonment of America’s historic role in efforts like prosecuting Nazi atrocities at Nuremberg. And it places the U.S. in a small, awkward club: Russia is one of the minority of other nations that does not work with the court. Omar criticized a separate 1999 law that prevents taxpayer dollars from being spent on helping the court. Noting that former President Donald Trump placed sanctions on court officials and their family members when the court began to consider alleged American excesses in Afghanistan, the congresswoman said the U.S. has to “remedy that harm.” Her effort may attract some surprising support. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told the Times that he sees the court as “the only venue” for investigating Putin and he would “look at the laws on the books and see if they need to be changed to make sure these investigations can be supported, either financially or to provide any intelligence or manpower.” Given reservations among Republicans and more moderate Democrats including President Joe Biden, any tweaks to the regulations could ultimately be minimal. Omar said she will seek support “far and wide,” including inside the Biden administration, and reminded her colleagues that their counterparts could take either a positive or a worrying message from the U.S.’s debate over the court. She pressed Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the court at a hearing last year, and he responded that America had its own mechanisms for justice. “Many people around the world can say that if they want,” the congresswoman told HuffPost. “True justice is blind and if we are to say we are the people who respect law and order, we can’t create exemptions where our people aren’t subjected to the rule of law and order.”",5.028330674027803,4.550234261857391,0.47809641217041143,25

We cannot rest now.” The aid package includes radars, drones, armored vehicles, body armor and ammunition, according to a Pentagon statement later in the day. Six weeks into its attack on Ukraine, Moscow is now focused on capturing two regions in the east of the country, Luhansk and Donetsk, Ukrainian officials and military analysts say. Fresh U.S. shipments could help Ukrainian troops stop Russia from capturing strategic towns and supply routes. “This will be a knife fight. This could be very bloody and very ugly,” a senior American defense official said of the next phase of the war in a briefing with reporters last week. In preparation, the U.S. also recently allocated $100 million in anti-tank Javelin systems for Ukraine. Biden has already directed more than $2.4 billion in military support and more than $300 million in humanitarian aid to the country. Congress last month approved nearly $10 billion for such programs. American allies including Britain, Australia, Slovakia and other nations are also pumping supplies, such as air defense equipment and medical gear, to the Ukrainians. Russia’s vicious approach to the conflict ― including the apparent mass murder of everyday Ukrainians in occupied areas and repeated strikes on civilian targets ― has made Ukraine even more determined to resist. Between the evidence of atrocities and Ukraine’s battlefield prowess so far, Ukrainian activists and officials say there is a clear imperative for foreign governments to provide all the help they can. And Russian President Vladimir Putin seems set on further fighting, too. He recently appointed a new top commander for the war — one who led brutal assaults in Russia’s intervention in Syria, according to U.S. intelligence. Putin said Tuesday that he sees peace talks as dead. “Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being a Ukrainian,” Biden said on Tuesday.

We are aware of a fake video with BBC News branding suggesting Ukraine was responsible for last week’s missile attack on Kramatorsk train station. The BBC is taking action to have the video removed.

Steve Rosenberg, the BBC’s Russia Editor, interviewed the widow of a Russian soldier killed during the war, who dismissed allegations that Russian forces are responsible for war crimes in Ukraine. Later that evening, Rosenberg saw a picture of himself interviewing the woman being featured in a piece published on a Russian website. “It’s easy to guess how the recently widowed resident of Stavropol must have felt talking to journalists from a country that is an accessory to the death of her husband,” the article reads, according to a translation provided by Rosenberg, suggesting the U.K. was in part responsible for the man’s death. Russian state media sought to discredit photos and video depicting the atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine, while claiming Ukraine was behind those attacks as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin himself said Ukraine’s claims that Russian soldiers killed civilians in the city were “fake,” in a rare public appearance Tuesday. During the same news conference, Putin said Russia “had no other choice” in continuing the war to “ensure Russia’s own security” and claimed the operation was going according to plan, despite failing to capture Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Meanwhile, Russian media are banned from using the words “war” and “invasion” to describe the invasion, which Putin says is a “special military operation” to help “denazify” Ukraine. Ukraine’s president is Jewish, and a United Nations investigation found no evidence to support Putin’s claims. Last month, the last independent newspaper left in Russia was forced to suspend its operations, following a second warning by the country’s media regulator.",4.286797872281131,4.337581529180359,-0.05078365689922837,3

Prince Harry founded the games, which are a Paralympic-style multisport event for wounded service people, back in 2014. The games were originally supposed to take place in The Hague two years ago, hence the official title’s reference to 2020. They are finally set to kick off from April 16 to April 22 after being delayed and rescheduled multiple times due to the coronavirus pandemic. We are delighted to share the safe arrival of Team Ukraine ahead of their participation in the Invictus Games The Hague 2020. They have been training for this event as part of their recovery and are looking forward to being a part of the Invictus community in person once again.  For Team Ukraine, the journey to get to The Hague has been an unfathomable one as Russia’s deadly invasion of Ukraine continues and nearly 5 million Ukrainians have evacuated the country. Tragically, four members of Ukraine’s Invictus community have died in the invasions: Serhii Karajvan, Dmytro Oliynyk, Vladimir Motelchuk and Sergey Smilin. “All were Warrior Games trialists and competitors, and whilst they were not preparing for the Invictus Games The Hague 2020, they were all extremely active in the international Invictus community on the We Are Invictus platform,” the Invictus Games Foundation said on its website earlier this month. “Competing in events over the past year including the virtual London Marathon, and online Rowing championships.” At the time, it wasn’t known whether Team Ukraine would be competing virtually or in person, which is what makes Wednesday’s news so important. “This is HUGE. There has been a load of, understandable, uncertainty as to whether @invictusgamesua would make it to @InvictusGamesNL,” tweeted veteran JJ Chalmers on Wednesday. Chalmers is a friend of the Duke of Sussex and an Invictus Games medalist and will be announcing at this year’s games. “Thank you to everyone who made this possible, I can’t wait to get out there and see you guys.” As the crisis in Ukraine continues, both the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have voiced support for Ukraine, made donations to help people and media organizations on the ground, and supported organizations giving aid. “Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and all of us at Archewell stand with the people of Ukraine against this breach of international and humanitarian law and encourage the global community and its leaders to do the same,” the royals said in an announcement on their website in February. Both Harry and Meghan will be at the opening ceremonies of the games, which are set to kick off on Saturday. The games hold a special place in the couple’s story, as the two made their first public appearance together (while already secretly engaged) at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto.",5.599293273345978,4.881489471946206,0.7178038013997723,13

Ogwumike, president of the Women’s National Basketball Players Association, appeared on “Good Morning America” Tuesday to discuss the league’s efforts to bring Griner home. Griner was arrested on Feb. 17 in Russia ― a week before that country invaded Ukraine ― after officers with the Russian Federal Customs Service allegedly found vape cartridges containing hash oil in Griner’s luggage. “It’s tough ... That could have been us,” Ogwumike said of Griner, a Phoenix Mercury star and two-time Olympic gold medalist. “We’re really most concerned about her health and safety, especially her mental health. We’re hearing that in that respect, she’s OK, but we want her home.” “BG is us,” she emphasized, referring to Griner by her initials. “We are BG.” EXCLUSIVE: WNBA Players Association President @nnekaogwumike speaks to @GMA about efforts to bring Brittney Griner home from Russia. Ogwumike also explained why she’s speaking out about Griner now. “We move intentionally, and given the nature of Brittney’s situation, when it happened ― it was very important for us to be intentional about doing the best thing to ensure that we don’t compromise her coming home,” she told “GMA” anchor Robin Roberts. “A lot of that had to do with educating ourselves about the details of what was going on,” she went on. “As much as we could know. But then understanding how important it was for us to be strategic about when and how we speak about her.” Ogwumike and Roberts talked about how problems of gender inequality helped to land Griner in her current situation. “It’s disappointing that the question of it being a gender issue is top of mind now, when it comes to this type of circumstance,” she said. “The reality is, she’s over there because of a gender issue ― pay inequity.” The highest-paid player in the WNBA earns $228,000 a year, while some top NBA players make more than $1 million, according to ABC News. It’s not unheard of for WNBA players to travel overseas during the offseason to earn some extra money. “We go over there to supplement our incomes,” said Ogwumike, who herself previously played in Russia for four years, China for two years and Poland for one.",6.848161347393945,6.692170835587965,0.1559905118059799,0

Biden later doubled down on his comments in remarks to reporters, saying lawyers would decide whether Russia’s actions meet the international definition of genocide, “but it sure seems that way to me.” “Yes, I called it genocide — it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being a Ukrainian,” he added. Previously, the president had condemned the Kremlin’s attacks on Ukraine by saying Putin was a “war criminal” and should face a trial for war crimes. The United Nations defines genocide as killing or causing serious harm to a group — national, ethnic, racial or religious — with the intent to destroy the group in whole or in part. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had previously described Russia’s actions as genocide, responded to Biden’s remarks on Twitter: “Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil.” He added that Ukrainians “urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities.” Since Russia began its attack on Ukraine in late February, the U.N. has tracked nearly 2,000 deaths and over 2,500 injuries, noting the actual numbers are likely “considerably higher,” with reports of mass deaths in some areas, including Mariupol, still to be confirmed. Mariupol’s mayor said this week that over 10,000 civilians in his city have died in Russian attacks. Over 4 million Ukrainians have fled their country due to the violence. Earlier this week, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said Russia’s brutal attack “clearly is genocide.”",3.5952219462127855,2.3066901167977547,1.2885318294150307,3

He sang the song Saturday as part of the Global Citizen’s social media rally, Stand Up For Ukraine. Julian Lennon, 59, had vowed never to perform his dad’s song, which imagines an ideal world of peace and love, free of hunger and pain, created through human intention. But the “unimaginable tragedy” in Ukraine moved him to respond in the “most significant way I could,” he wrote on YouTube. “So today, for the first time ever, I publicly performed my Dad’s song, ‘Imagine,’” he added. “I had always said that the only time I would ever consider singing ‘Imagine’ would be if it was the ‘End of the World’ … Because within this song, we’re transported to a space, where love and togetherness become our reality, if but for a moment in time,” Lennon explained. “The song reflects the light at the end of the tunnel that we are all hoping for.” Lennon called on the world to support Ukraine — and all refugees. “As a result of the ongoing murderous violence, millions of innocent families, have been forced to leave the comfort of their homes, to seek asylum elsewhere,” he wrote.

Stoltenberg, in an interview published Saturday in The Telegraph, said military commanders for NATO’s 30 member countries are preparing a “reset” of the alliance that must include an increase in national defense spending in order to ward off future threats. Some members still do not meet the alliance’s guideline on defense spending. Members are instructed to allocate at least 2% of their gross domestic product to defense. “We have to ensure that we continue to be able, in a more dangerous world, to protect and defend all NATO allies,” Stoltenberg said. The secretary-general described NATO’s previous presence along the border ― prior to the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February ― as a mere “tripwire” that was more symbolic of the alliance’s unity than anything. It was not designed to repel an invasion. “Regardless of when, how, the war in Ukraine ends, the war has already had long-term consequences for our security,” he said. “NATO needs to adapt to that new reality. And that’s exactly what we are doing.” Stoltenberg said NATO will adopt a new Strategic Concept document in June at the 2022 Madrid Summit. This formal strategy document will not only outline NATO’s defense efforts against Russia, but for the first time is expected to mention China as a growing threat. “I expect China to be an important part. Because the rise of China, the shifting global balance of power, has direct consequences for NATO,” Stoltenberg told The Telegraph. “It is also of concern that we see that Russia and China are working more and more closely together. This is something that matters for our security.”",5.536218437175151,3.3222829721561173,2.2139354650190337,15

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said Sunday that Russia’s brutal attacks on Ukraine constitute genocide, a term the White House has so far avoided using when talking about the war. Cheney appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union,” where she spoke with host Jake Tapper about the mass killing of Ukrainian civilians since Russia invaded the neighboring country. “I think this clearly is genocide. I think that you asked exactly the right questions,” she told Tapper. “I think that Europe needs to understand and grapple with the fact that you’ve got a genocidal campaign ― the first kind of horrific genocidal campaign that we have seen certainly in recent decades.” ""I think this is clearly a genocide.""CNN's @jaketapper asks Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) about a missile strike on a Ukrainian train station that left dozens dead and how she thinks European allies should respond. #CNNSOTU @CNNSotu  Article II of the United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group” ― followed by a list of actions such as “killing members of the group,” “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,” “forcibly transferring children of the group to another group,” and deliberately inflicting “conditions of life” meant to bring about the group’s physical destruction. The U.N. treaty has been criticized since its 1948 adoption, both by those who feel its definition of genocide is too narrow and others who believe the term can be applied to too many situations. As defined by the treaty, the most recent act of genocide took place in 1994 in Rwanda. The International Criminal Court, however, issued an arrest warrant for Sudan’s president in 2010 on genocide charges; the U.S. in 2016 accused the Islamic State of genocide in Iraq and Syria; Gambia submitted a case to the International Court of Justice in 2017 accusing of Myanmar of genocide against Rohingyas; and several nations formally accused China last year of genocide against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have described Russia’s attacks on civilians as a genocide ― raising comparisons to the horrors of the Holodomor, where millions of Ukrainians died of a famine engineered by the Soviet government in 1932. The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor is currently conducting an investigation on the atrocities stemming from the Russian invasion. Though White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan was comfortable saying Russia’s actions constitute war crimes, he hesitated on Sunday to describe the attacks as genocide. “Look, in my opinion, the label is less important than the fact that these acts are cruel and criminal and wrong and evil and need to be responded to decisively. And that is what we are doing,” Sullivan told Tapper. “And we’re doing that not just by supporting international investigations and gathering evidence to hold the perpetrators all the way to the highest levels accountable. We’re doing it by providing sophisticated weapons to the Ukrainians that are making a major difference on the battlefield.” Congress voted on Thursday to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and to ban oil imports, while the European Union approved an embargo on coal imports. The U.N. General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council. Sullivan pointed out that banning oil imports is harder for European countries that are much more reliant on Russian energy. The U.S. is “surging exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe” so other countries can wean off Russian oil and gas. Cheney said Sunday that European nations need to pull the plug on Russian imports if they truly support Ukraine in the war. “Europeans need to understand that they’re funding that genocidal campaign,” she told Tapper. “I understand the economic consequences to countries in Western Europe, if they were to impose the kind of oil and gas embargo that the U.S. has imposed against Russian oil and gas, but they need to do it. And we need to do everything we can to increase our own domestic production, to help make sure that we can supply them with as much as possible.” “But they need to understand that every single time, every single day that they are continuing to import Russian oil and gas,” she went on, “they’re funding Putin’s genocide in Ukraine.”",3.5782366155977794,3.1935935884522983,0.38464302714548104,2

Johnson pledged to send more defensive weapons and financial aid to the war-ravaged country in what he called “a testament of our commitment to [Zelenksyy’s] country’s struggle against Russia’s barbaric campaign.” Surprise 😉  The British government announced a new £100 million ($130 million) aid package on Friday that includes more than 800 NLAW antitank missiles, an unspecified number of Javelin antitank weapons and Starstreak air defense systems, along with body armor and other supplies. The U.K. previously pledged £350 million in military aid to Ukraine since Russia began its war around six weeks ago. Western military officials initially feared the Ukrainian capital would fall within days of Russia’s invasion. Yet while Russian forces attempted to encircle Kyiv, they did not manage to take the city, now a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Johnson’s visit came one day after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made a trip to the Ukrainian capital city to offer support and speak with Zelenskyy about bloc membership. She said a decision on whether to welcome Ukraine to the European Union would be made in “a matter of weeks,” instead of the usual yearslong timeline. “Russia will descend into economic, financial and technological decay, while Ukraine is marching towards the European future.

According to an English translation of the post, the group vowed to come after those supporting what they falsely claimed were lies about atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine. State-backed media in Russia have sought to discredit some pictures and video from Bucha showing dead civilians. Russia claims Ukrainians staged the slaughter in the Kyiv suburb.

The first round of the French presidential election takes place on Sunday, and what might have been a formality only of domestic interest is suddenly generating a much bigger buzz. This is thanks to a series of polls suggesting Marine Le Pen, the far-right’s standard bearer for more than a decade, could pull off a shock win over incumbent Emmanuel Macron. With the help of HuffPost France’s political correspondent Romain Herreros, here’s everything that you need to know about the vote to determine who runs one of Europe’s biggest economic and military powers as a war rages on the continent. France’s presidential election is to be held in two rounds on April 10 and 24. Polls have for weeks consistently pointed to Macron leading the first round ahead of Le Pen, with both qualifying for a run-off. It would mean a replay of the 2017 election that Macron won comfortably (66% to 34%). But this time around it’s set to be much closer. According to some polls, Le Pen has narrowed the gap enough for victory to be within the margin of error. There are 12 official candidates. Outside Macron and Le Pen, the names to note in an election where radical positions set the tone are far right-writer-turned-candidate Éric Zemmour and veteran left-winger Jean-Luc Mélenchon. While it’s unlikely either will make the final cut, the second choice of their voters could be crucial in a narrow run-off. A Le Pen win would send shockwaves around the world, not least given the West’s united front against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Having someone who has shown pro-Vladamir Putin sympathies deal with the fallout would be less than ideal. And make no mistake of France’s importance: Brexit compounded its status as the European Union’s main military power and, with Angela Merkel’s exit as German chancellor, Macron has taken a more prominent role in Europe. The 53-year-old leader of the National Rally, a movement long known for anti-Semitism, Nazi nostalgia and anti-immigrant bigotry, is running for the third time. The “Le Pen” name is notorious in France thanks to her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the firebrand leader of what the same party when it was the National Front. Since her 2017 defeat, Le Pen has worked to soften her image – stressing her love of cats among other things – and changed the party name. She has strived to appear as a potential leader rather than a radical anti-system opponent. Her campaign has focused on cost of living concerns – amid a huge increase in energy prices and growing inflation – and the candidacy of Zemmour, who is even further to the right than Le Pen, has also helped her appear more palatable to voters. Herreros says many felt another far-right candidate would split their vote, undermining Le Pen’s chance. “But, in fact, Zemmour was very hard, very radical. So Le Pen looked more soft. People are less afraid of her compared to Zemmour. When we look at the polls, we see that.” Below, poll aggregator showing how Macron’s lead over Le Pen has narrowed in recent days. See here for latest update. That explains in part why the context is not quite 2016. “The last election was just one year after Brexit and Trump’s election, so we were in a populist moment,” Herreros says of Macron’s 2017 ascent to power. “Now we have seen that Brexit was not what the British people expected, and we saw (Brazil’s populist president) Bolsonaro is a nightmare in Brazil. But Le Pen is not playing the populist role – she says she doesn’t want to leave the euro this time, that she’s not that extreme like Zimmour. ‘Trust me, I’m not evil’.” But, make no mistake, the core of her party’s programme has not changed. “She is still far-right,” Herreros explains. “She is proposing the same thing on immigration as Zemmour, but with different words. It’s just a different package.” She would end a number of welfare benefits for foreigners, stop family reunification, give preference to the French for jobs and social housing, ban the hijab in public spaces and kick unemployed foreigners out of France. The early obsession among the chattering classes was the rise of Zemmour and his fledgling Reconquest! party. A TV pundit who styles himself as a Donald Trump figure and guardian of Old France, he has proposed a Ministry of “Remigration” equipped with airplanes to expedite the expulsions of what he says are undesirable migrants. Zemmour pushes the white nationalist conspiracy theory known as the “great replacement”, which argues France and Western nations are being overrun by immigrants and other people of colour — notably Muslims. Reflecting Le Pen’s superficial changes, a batch of her officials and supporters have left for Zemmour. The only one Le Pen spared criticism was her niece, Marion Marechal, a former politician who has returned to the frontline to help Zemmour. Perhaps what worries most is the two far-right candidates together are drawing more support than the centrist president. In a scenario where Le Pen inherits around 80% of Zemmour’s votes in the second round – a not unreasonable prospect, say analysts – it puts her “close to victory”, says Herreros. For Macron, Le Pen is the candidate to beat, and his camp has worried openly about an “accidental” win for Le Pen – perhaps if moderate voters fail to turn up at the polls. The 44-year-old former investment banker, elected in 2017 with little political experience with his centrist La Republique en Marche, saw his pristine reputation dented by The Yellow Vest protests and imposing coronavirus restrictions. His election campaign has been disrupted by the war in Ukraine, with Macron delaying his pitch to the country because of France’s central role in the West’s response. While absence from the campaign trail has its own problems, wartime leadership has allowed him to be presented dealing with the big issues facing the world (see the unusual pictures of him working nights and weekends at the Elysee palace, looking tired and unshaven, in jeans and a hoodie). It may have helped with an initial poll boost, but that appears to have waned. Herreros explains Macron is popular for this stage of his presidency – higher than predecessors François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy – but he has come unstuck by two factors. “He went too late in the campaign,” says Herreros. “It was difficult for him to say ‘hey, I’m the candidate’ when Putin was invading Ukraine. If he went in January or February, it would have been easier for him. He left the space for the far-right.” He also bound himself to Le Pen, thinking France would never actually put her in power. “He always thought he would be automatically re-elected against Marine Le Pen. During his presidency he would ‘wink, wink’ to right-wing voters, some of his ministers talked in a way that could be used by Le Pen. Now people are saying you played with fire, now we have the result of what you have done.” The neck-and-neck polling doesn’t tell the whole story, say Herreros. A low turnout could kill off all the pre-election anticipation as Le Pen is relying heavily on the working class vote to come out in support. Le Pen’s party is still stinging from her party’s failure in last summer’s regional balloting, blamed on a turnout of only 33% of voters in the first round. There may also be a moment of clarity. “In France, when the far-right are close to power, people wake up,” says Herreros. “And they lose every time.” In 2015, Le Pen, who had appeared to be on the cusp of winning the northern region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie, lost out in the second round, and her aforementioned niece, thought to be one of the party’s best hopes in the regional elections, also lost in the southern Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur. “They lost,” says Herreros. “But who knows how the voters will react? Le Pen will say, ‘Macron is the system, vote for me. You’re from the left and don’t like Macron, vote for me’. It’s the same thing we saw with Brexit. Maybe people will think ... let’s try it.”",4.648541632833714,4.957888970032588,-0.309347337198874,21

The activists were gathered in Washington to meet with U.S. lawmakers and the Biden administration when they received news that a Russian rocket strike had hit the station in Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. Officials say at least 50 civilians were killed, including five children. “All we need now is to arm our army and our territorial defense units to prevent more graves in the backyards of innocent people, to prevent more collective rapes, to prevent more missiles hitting railway stations,” said Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center nonprofit. “There is no alternative but just to fight.” Hanna Hopko, a former member of Ukraine’s Parliament who now runs the International Center for Ukrainian Victory advocacy group, said the attack on civilians Friday “showed that the war against Ukraine is not a war only by [Russian President Vladimir Putin]... it demonstrates that this is according to the United Nations classification a genocide.” Ahead of a White House meeting Friday morning and after scores of meetings on Capitol Hill, the Ukrainian delegation met with reporters at the German Marshall Fund think tank to convey a strong message: They appreciate international support but believe it is still insufficient. Washington was too slow to realize that Ukraine could resist the Russian invasion launched in February, assuming that Moscow’s much larger army would triumph in a matter of days, Kaleniuk said. Instead, Ukraine’s military and everyday civilians have kept Russian troops from capturing the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and targets like the strategic port of Mariupol, preventing the Russians from consolidating their control in the areas they have captured. But Russia’s determination to hurt Ukrainians is increasingly clear and alarming, according to Maria Berlinska, another member of the group who co-founded an organization for female veterans of Ukraine’s military. Berlinska pointed to a recent shift in Russia’s narrative about the invasion in its state media: a growing emphasis on mass punishment for Ukraine that observers of Russian politics have also highlighted in recent days. “Before that, Putin emphasized, ‘Our main enemy is America … we would like to have a common state with Ukrainians,’” Berlinska said. “As of now, it is, ’We would like to kill them all, it doesn’t matter: kids or elderly, doctors or teachers, color of skin, traditional family or LGBT.” As Russia has withdrawn from some Ukrainian towns, journalists, rights groups and officials have discovered evidence that Russian forces are committing atrocities against civilians, including executions and rape. Kaleniuk said U.S. assistance to Ukraine should include added anti-missile capabilities and that Americans should realize that millions in already-approved aid are going to support countries other than Ukraine, such as Poland, and to resupply U.S. weapons stocks to replace those sent to the Ukrainians. The Ukrainian delegation wants President Joe Biden to send jets, drones that can hit medium-to-long-range targets, and more armored vehicles and ammunition. The Ukrainians also said Ukrainian forces need quick training in using the latest American weaponry rather than having to rely on Soviet-era materials. And they blasted what they described as bureaucratic delays in shipments that are inappropriate in an emergency situation. The Senate unanimously approved a bill this week allowing the Pentagon to lend or lease U.S. military equipment to Ukraine and neighboring nations. The legislation would waive requirements usually needed for that process to speed up the assistance. But the House of Representatives has not yet taken up the proposal and is now on a two-week recess. On Friday, the Biden administration and NATO ally Slovakia revealed a plan to send an air defense system to Ukraine, with Slovakia receiving a U.S. system to replace the Soviet version it’s giving Kyiv. “Now is no time for complacency,” Biden said in a statement about the move. “As the Russian military repositions for the next phase of this war, I have directed my administration to continue to spare no effort to identify and provide to the Ukrainian military the advanced weapons capabilities it needs to defend its country.” The United Kingdom is also preparing a new package of missile systems and vehicles for Ukraine, British ministers said this week. With Russia now focused on capturing much of eastern Ukraine, it could become increasingly difficult to resupply the Ukrainian forces fighting there from western Ukraine, where foreign military assistance is entering the country, Kaleniuk said. “It’s still possible” right now, Berlinska said. “And as soon as we are given serious weapons, we will win this war.”",2.57912558417183,1.698365130804105,0.8807604533677249,3
2022-04-07,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ukraine-civilian-resistance-russia_n_624e0748e4b0e44de9ca9a6d,"'Ordinary People, Extraordinary Things': Civilian Resistance Is Key To Ukraine’s Defense","Tens of thousands of Ukrainians now live under Russian control in their own country. Civilians in towns and villages from Kherson in the south to Izyum in the east are grappling with crackdowns and, evidence suggests, horrifying war crimes perpetrated by Russian soldiers. Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled areas are also doing something else: resisting. Ukraine’s military is leading the country’s effort to vanquish Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces, which invaded in late February. The U.S. and allies from Europe to the Pacific are funneling arms and sophisticated equipment to these troops. But Ukrainian civilians are stepping up, too. With little support and training, ordinary people in war-torn, occupied areas are undermining Russia, supporting their country’s counter-offensives, and fueling unity among Ukrainians and international concern for their nation. “There’s no way to over-exaggerate the extreme bravery that these ordinary citizens are demonstrating,” said Olga Onuch, an associate professor at the University of Manchester. The civilian resistance to Russia is using time-honored tactics, like daily demonstrations, and foiling occupiers’ plans to consolidate their rule by refusing to cooperate. The resistance is also developing covert, informal efforts to ease humanitarian suffering and hurt Russia’s military capabilities by gathering intelligence and training citizens in small-scale guerilla tactics. The choices of everyday people can have huge implications for a campaign like the Russian mission, which depends on controlling strategic population centers and challenging a national identity, military experts say. Russia wants the world to believe Ukrainians want its incursion; their resistance proves otherwise. Some of the most important flashpoints in the conflict in the weeks ahead are connected to occupied towns. Moscow is now focusing on eastern Ukraine, according to national security analysts and Russian leaders. Russia’s forces seek to hold Izyum, a city they captured on Friday that was once home to 40,000 people, and to conquer the nearby city of Slovyansk. If the Ukrainians can thwart that plan, they might quash Russia’s hope of cutting off Ukrainian troops in the country’s eastern regions from reinforcements and supplies. And in the south, Ukrainians are defying Russia in towns like Melitopol, Enerhodar and Kherson — areas that are integral to Russia’s attempt to limit Ukraine’s access to its coasts, seize the Ukrainian ports of Mykolaiv and Odesa and establish a land corridor between Russian territory and Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia took over in 2014. “While Ukraine’s armed forces are proving themselves capable, no resistance can succeed without an effective auxiliary [of citizens in occupied areas] and underground. The civil element will be essential in the current conflict,” Walter Haynes, a U.S. Army major, recently wrote in an essay for the blog War on the Rocks. In March, Kherson became the first large Ukrainian city to fall to Russia. Its residents immediately began protesting against their new rulers, with hundreds gathering in large groups to chant and wave Ukrainian flags. A week later, even bigger crowds demonstrated in occupied Melitopol after Russian soldiers detained the city’s mayor. ""They’re distinctly peaceful — by using the [Ukrainian] national symbols, people are trying to intervene in Putin’s narrative that they would like to be part of Russia or that they don’t have their own state,” said Olga Boichak, a lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney. “Russian media is portraying Ukraine as a failed state, a non-entity. What people are doing is directly contradicting that and showing it is not true.” Onuch said mass protests are common in Ukrainian history and that citizens know to gather in large main squares near government buildings. Their rallies usually include a diverse sample of the local population: “We can look at the images … it’s not all young people, it’s not all men,” she said. Two female journalists in Kherson are documenting developments in the city in weekly dispatches for The Guardian (which is protecting their identities), and other locals are raising the alarm about growing problems like shortages of medical supplies. Through nonviolent methods, Ukrainians hope to prove that Russian control over captured territory is not sustainable. Some who speak Russian are trying to build a rapport with Russian soldiers to humanize Ukrainians, said Marta Kepe, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation. Melitopol’s mayor, Ivan Federov, challenged the troops who detained him, saying Moscow misled them by claiming that Ukraine hosted Nazis and disrespected World War II veterans. Other Ukrainians are deploying their language skills to demoralize the Russians, telling them they will die in a foreign country or suggesting that food they find in abandoned homes has been poisoned. Consistent, public resistance in cities like Kherson makes it hard for Putin to stage dubious local elections and claim popular support for Russian meddling in Ukraine, as he has elsewhere in the country, Kepe noted. “Russia wants the world to believe Ukrainians want its incursion; their resistance proves otherwise.” Meanwhile, Russian officials are doing little to build trust or sympathy among Ukrainian civilians. In Kherson, Russians are detaining people in a secret prison and have set up roadblocks that make it impossible for civilians to even visit their loved ones’ graves, according to Elena Kostyuchenko, a respected Russian journalist who traveled to the town for the independent news outlet Novaya Gazeta. She observed Ukrainians refusing Russian aid and spoke with a local reporter who was kidnapped, beaten and interrogated about who was organizing the pro-Ukraine rallies — treatment that a contact of a local correspondent for The Guardian also experienced. (Russian authorities have since forced Novaya Gazeta to remove Kostyuchenko’s article.) Because Russia’s troops mismanaged their supply lines and became desperate for provisions, “looting became endemic” as they advanced through Ukraine, “increasing soldier-civilian contact in all kinds of disastrous ways,” Jason Lyall, a Dartmouth University professor, wrote on Twitter. “Savagery is a function of how the army was recruited, equipped, and deployed.” On April 3, Human Rights Watch released evidence that Russian forces in occupied Ukrainian areas had committed war crimes, including repeated rape, summary executions and theft. Residents of a recently occupied village in northern Ukraine also told The Washington Post a Russian commander subjected them to beatings and mock executions, attacking them in retaliation for Russian battlefield losses and massacring their livestock. Moscow seems set on “trying to achieve compliance through intimidation,” Kepe said. But Russia’s repression is backfiring, sparking more Ukrainian outrage, Kepe and other analysts believe. The nature of the resistance makes it hard for the occupying troops to wipe it out. When the Russians have targeted infrastructure like TV and radio stations in the occupied regions, Ukrainians have turned to shortwave radio, Kepe said. Much of the organizing relies on internet communications like the Telegram platform, which Russia has not been able to cut off. Volunteers quietly work to help fellow Ukrainians access electricity and inform each other of where supplies can be found. The movement is “virtually leaderless,” Boichak said, so if Russian troops try to suppress protests by targeting a few prominent individuals, others are likely to immediately replace them. Russia’s military is willing to escalate, as soldiers showed in Kherson when they used grenades and gunfire to displace rallies. Still, Ukrainians participating in the resistance take brutality as a given, Onuch said: “No one is under any illusion that this is safe.” In resisting Russia day to day, Ukrainians in occupied territories are preparing for a bigger future clash: the battle to liberate their homes. “They are starving, with no electricity, no utilities … and they are waiting for the Ukrainian armed forces. They would like to be released,” Mariia Ionova, a member of Ukraine’s Parliament, told HuffPost. Civilians have shaped the fighting in Ukraine since it began, slowing the Russian advance by tearing down or altering road signs and blocking military convoys with sandbags, crates and even their own bodies. Living under Russian occupation, regular citizens can aid Ukrainian counter-offensives by keeping communities in contact with the Kyiv government, sharing information about Russian logistics and ground conditions, and developing their own fighting and medical capabilities, according to the U.S. Army’s Haynes. (He published his essay on Ukrainian civil resistance in a personal capacity.) Civilians can also help Ukraine recapture cities by discouraging collaboration between locals and the occupying troops, Haynes continued. Scott Boston, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, told HuffPost that Russian intelligence initially failed to identify sympathetic Ukrainians in captured areas. As Ukrainians have publicized civil resistance and military victories, public collaboration with Russia is now even less likely, Boston said. When battles over occupied areas occur, civilians can use secure communications to keep fellow noncombatants safe, he added. And they can use advice from fellow civilians and Ukrainian authorities to wear down Russian troops, Boichak of the University of Sydney said: creating homemade Molotov cocktails, disarming military vehicles or using whatever they have at their disposal — the way one Ukrainian woman destroyed a Russian drone with a jar of pickled tomatoes. Boichak noted the morale-boosting impact of Ukraine’s military sharing stories of villagers gathering with shovels to dig trenches. “A lot of it is like that: this understanding that everyone is in it … not everyone needs to be at the battlefront,” she said. Ukrainians have a recent model for developing a resistance that foils Russia’s aims. In Mariupol, the port city that Putin is now pummeling, Russian-backed militias previously attempted a takeover in the spring of 2014. Activists began organizing small pro-Ukraine rallies and used social media to dispel Russian propaganda, post updates about city life and rally like-minded citizens, most of whom spoke Russian but were convinced of the importance of Ukrainian independence. “That [support] was driven by a sense of Ukrainian national identity as a civic category, not in an ethnonationalist sense” Boichak said. A month into the occupation, thousands of steelworkers joined police patrols to prevent pro-Russian fighters from establishing an alternative government. And not long afterward, Ukrainian forces reclaimed the city. Today, regaining occupied territory is a top priority for Ukraine, parliamentarian Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told HuffPost. Anastasia Radina, a fellow lawmaker, said the best way to help people demonstrating against Russia was for Kyiv to deploy advanced equipment like aircraft from other governments. As the war’s trajectory shifts, civilians are making clear that the conflict is about more than military plans — and that they are more than victims. “The tragedy of this whole thing is that the Russians miscalculate Ukrainians, the West miscalculates Ukrainians and Ukrainians are using the only tool at their disposal, which is going out on the street and showing that they are wholeheartedly against this occupation,” said Onuch, of Manchester University. “Ordinary people that do extraordinary things always take our breath away.”",2.7111062028103667,2.2706749003603526,0.44043130245001416,22

In a Twitter post shared Thursday morning, the ministry of defense explained how the Russians have shifted their lines of attack. It wrote: “Progressing offensive operations in eastern Ukraine is the main focus of Russian military forces. “Russian artillery and air strikes continue along the Donbas line of control.” The Donbas region is in eastern Ukraine, and encapsulates Donetsk and Luhansk — areas partially occupied by pro-Russian rebels since the annexation of Crimea back in 2014. This renewed focus on the east comes after troops withdrew from the Kyiv region — leading to the discovery of the Bucha massacre. The U.K. officials also pointed out that Russian forces are trying to impact Ukrainian supplies. “Russian strikes against infrastructure targets within the Ukrainian interior are likely intended to degrade the ability of the Ukrainian military to resupply and increase pressure on the Ukrainian government.” However, the intelligence suggests that actually it is the Russians who are facing supply shortages – along with a lack of morale among its dwindling workforce. The ministry of defense tweeted: “Despite refocusing forces and logistics capabilities to support operations in the Donbas, Russian forces are likely to continue facing morale issues and shortages of supplies and personnel.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 7 April 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  Russian losses are certainly high. At the end of last month, NATO estimated that up to 40,000 soldiers had been killed, wounded, captured or missing in action. This number is expected to have increased in April as Ukrainians managed to push the Russians out of various cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby went even further than the ministry of defense, and expressed his belief that the Ukrainian troops can win the war this week. He told reporters on Wednesday: “Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his objectives inside Ukraine. “He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state. “And, he’s really only taken control of a small number of population centers and even those weren’t the ones he was really going after.” He pointed out even Mariupol has not been taken – “the proof is literally in the outcomes you are seeing every day.” Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his objectives inside Ukraine. He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state.  Yet, a previous update from the Ministry of Defense, posted on Wednesday, explained that Ukrainians are still suffering, significantly, despite their various successes. For instance, Mariupol, the coastal city in the east of Ukraine, is now under siege as the Russians attempt to cut off their links to the outside world. “The humanitarian situation in the city [of Mariupol] is worsening,” officials explained. “Most of the 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. “Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender.”",2.7183279301862773,2.824723078871891,-0.10639514868561362,22

The surreal conversation between the political opposites began with the primary reason for Penn’s visit on “Hannity” ― to stir support for Ukrainians fighting against Russian invaders. Penn, who’s been traveling in and out of the conflict to shoot a documentary, has urged billionaires to provide Ukraine with fighter jets and missile defense technology. Hannity asked Penn to recall what the Oscar-winning actor had said when he first called him to learn more about his documentary. “I said that I don’t trust ya,” Penn replied. “Is there a reason you didn’t trust me?” asked Hannity, one of the prominent faces of a network that has spewed false takes on the Capitol riot, COVID-19 vaccines and efforts to educate children about racism. “Yeah, there’s a lot of reasons I don’t trust you,” Penn said, noting that there’s “so many people that don’t trust their spouse, and yet we’ve gotta get on with life.” “We all talk about how divisive things are, how divided things are here,” he continued. “But when you step into a country of such incredible unity [like Ukraine], you realize what we’ve all been missing. And I don’t think that I’ve got time to indulge my lack of trust, which becomes a petty thing.” Penn went on to share his observations about the crisis in Ukraine.

Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Tuesday warned of “protracted conflict” in Ukraine that could take years to end. “I think that NATO, the United States, Ukraine and all of the allies and partners that are supporting Ukraine are going to be involved in this for quite some time,” Milley, the top U.S. military officer, testified before the House Armed Services Committee. Milley was joined by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in their first congressional testimony since Russia attacked Ukraine in February. The hearing was meant to focus on the 2023 defense budget request, but the latest developments in Ukraine took center stage. Russia’s invasion, which has forced over 4 million people to flee their country, is threatening peace in Europe and the world, said Milley, pointing to shifting global power dynamics. “We are now facing two global powers: China and Russia, each with significant military capabilities, both who intend to fundamentally change the rules-based current global order,” he said. “We are entering a world that is becoming more unstable and the potential for significant international conflict is increasing, not decreasing.” Gen. Mark Milley: ""We are entering a world that is becoming more unstable and the potential for significant international conflict between great powers is increasing, not decreasing.""  Milley dismissed suggestions that the U.S. could have done more to prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from going through with the invasion in the first place. “Candidly, short of the commitment of U.S. military forces into Ukraine proper, I’m not sure he was deterrable,” Milley said. “This has been a long-term objective of his that goes back years.” As countries in Eastern Europe grow increasingly worried that they might be next on Putin’s target list, Milley supported the idea of establishing permanent U.S. military bases in the region. But he said forces should rotate to limit the costs associated with permanent troop deployment, including moving family and schools. He added that U.S. allies in the region, like Poland, would be willing to help pay. Austin said NATO is assessing how to increase its presence in Eastern Europe to respond to the changes in the area’s “security architecture.” “If NATO deems that it’s appropriate to change its footprint, then certainly we’ll be a part of that,” Austin said. “Our goal is to make sure we continue to reassure our allies and partners, especially those that are on the eastern flank.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday the war is entering a critical stage. “Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said during a news conference ahead of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers this week. “In the coming weeks, we expect a further Russian push in eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea.” ❝We expect a further Russian push in eastern and southern #Ukraine, to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land-bridge to occupied Crimea.

Here’s a breakdown explaining how the disturbing discovery could shift the entire conflict in a new direction. Bucha – just 16 miles away from Kyiv – was targeted by the Russian forces on their way to conquer the capital back in March. It quickly became a frontline in the conflict as the Ukrainians fought back. Russian forces then began to withdraw from the region around March 30, reportedly due to a shortage of resources, meaning journalists have been able to access the beleaguered town once again. The Associated Press released from the town showing bodies on the Bucha streets, with their hands tied behind their backs and wounds to the back of their heads. According to the news agency, at least 21 bodies were found, with at least nine of them in civilian clothing. Anatoly Fedoruk, Bucha’s mayor, said more than 300 residents in the town had been killed, while Ukrainian prosecutors allege Russian forces used the basement of one house as a torture chamber. Satellite images showed a 45ft-long mass grave in the town too. Russia was quick to deny any involvement, alleging that “all Russian unit withdrew completely from Bucha” by the end of March – suggesting the bodies were placed their strategically by the Ukrainians. Moscow has dismissed any accusations of war crimes too, and claims “Ukrainian radicals” are responsible for the massacre in Bucha as “not a single civilian” faced violent military action from Russian forces. It claimed that the images of the dead bodies were “stage managed by the Kyiv regime for the Western media”. This was soon disproved by other satellite imagery dating back to March 19, where bodies can be seen lying on the street when the town was still occupied by the Russians. Military analyst Professor Michael Clarke told Sky News that the massacre was likely due to Russian soldiers operating in “little friendship groups”. He alleged that these cliques got out of control, vengeful that Bucha residents decided to carry on with their lives as normal when Russia invaded and that’s what led to the massacre. The UN Security Council is set to meet on Tuesday to discuss war crimes potentially committed by the Russian army, according to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. War crimes are defined by the UN as a serious breach of international humanitarian law committed against civilians or “enemy combatants”. The West has already repeatedly accused Russia of committing war crimes in the last few weeks, and the International Criminal court’s prosecutor has already opened an investigation into it. The condemnation against Russia has only grown since the Bucha massacre hit the news. US President Joe Biden has now called for a war crimes trial against Putin, whom he calls a “war criminal”. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the photographs show the “unbelievable brutality of the Russian leadership and those who follow its propaganda”, while French president Emmanuel Macron said there is now “clear evidence of war crimes” in Bucha. The UN High Commissioner for human rights Michelle Bachelet also said she was “horrified” by the sight of the massacre and the photographs raised “serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law”. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described the evidence from Bucha as “genocide”. He visited Bucha for his first trip outside of Kyiv since the war began in February, and was soon struggling to hold back his emotions as he witnessed the devastation. He said civilians in these liberated regions has a been subjected to treatment “not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago”. Only on Sunday, Zelenskyy criticised how “hundreds of people killed, tortured, executed civilians”, and said the “bodies on the streets....booby-trapped area... even the bodies of the dead are booby-trapped.” He vowed: “The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who among their fellow citizens killed, who gave orders, who turned a blind eye to the murders.” Wladimir Klitschko, brother of Kyiv’s mayor, also alleged that Bucha is evidence of genocide. The brutal attack has added to claims that Russia now intends to destroy Ukraine. Previously, Moscow had alleged that it wanted to “liberate” its European neighbour from the so-called “nazification” at the top of the country’s government – even though there is no evidence of Nazis ruling in Ukraine. Instead of “liberating” Ukraine, Kremlin propaganda now makes clear it wants to destroy it. Russian state media promotes “denazified” Ukraine which will be renamed, those who resist executed or sentenced to forced labour. Ukrainian officials have pleaded for more severe sanctions against Moscow following the “rape, torture and killings” of Russian soldiers. The country’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday: “Half measures are not enough anymore. I demand from our partners, on behalf of the victims of Bucha and the people of Ukraine, to take the most severe sanctions against Russia this week.” Macron seemed to agree that the massacre meant new measures are now needed against Russia. He told the French press: “I’m in favour of a new round of sanctions and in particular on coal and gasoline. We need to act.” However, this perspective is not shared across Europe, despite the united sense of outrage at the treatment of the Ukrainians. Poland is pushing for Europe to quickly come off Russian energy, while Germany wants to gradually phase out the fuel coming from Russia over the coming months. Meanwhile, the UK has actually called for Russia to be suspended from the UN Human Rights Council over its war crimes. The massacre itself might not have changed Russia’s approach, Putin has now redirected his forces away from Kyiv due to the strength of the Ukrainian resistance. Soldiers will now move a focus towards the Donbas region, which includes the besieged city of Mariupol, as it looks to dominate the south-east. Access to Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, is now blocked, according to Ukraine’s general staff, adding: “The enemy is regrouping troops and concentrating its efforts on preparing an offensive operation in the east of our country.” At the moment, two-thirds of Russian troops are thought to be en route to Belarus or already there for more supplies and reinforcements. The ministry of defence tweeted out its latest update and concluded fighting is expected to “diminish significantly over this week as the remainder of Russian forces withdraw” and regroup for a fresh redeployment in eastern Ukraine.

Feldman Ecopark “is no more,” founder Alexander Feldman said in a statement on Tuesday after the zoo was “subjected to massive shelling and bombardment” from Russian forces. The statement said the zoo’s “biggest problem” was large predators, such as lions, tigers and bears, which would pose a major danger to humans if they got out of the zoo and roamed free. Feldman said their enclosures were intact but couldn’t withstand more damage. For that reason, if the zoo can’t find a safe location for those animals to go, it may have to euthanize them. “It is unimaginably painful to talk about this, but the main priority now is the lives of people,” Feldman said. Feldman Ecopark emphasized in follow-up statements that euthanasia would be a last resort and that it was still attempting to evacuate animals. The logistics of transporting large zoo animals safely is complicated even under normal circumstances. During a war, supply shortages, road damage and the constant risk of shelling make it even harder. Many animals are in an intensely stressed-out state after a month of hearing shelling. Even so, in the last two days, workers have been able to evacuate multiple lions, a jaguar and a panther, the zoo said on social media alongside a video showing lions being transported. Many people in surrounding cities had stepped up to volunteer to assist however they could, the zoo noted on Facebook. A post shared by Фельдман Экопарк (@feldman_ecopark) Before this week, numerous animals had already been evacuated, including great apes, turtles, birds, alpacas, one of the lions and a van full of kangaroos and wallabies. Some animals that had the potential to survive on their own and don’t pose an imminent risk to people, such as deer, had simply been set loose.",4.177618243310195,3.568600231159006,0.6090180121511888,28

Ukrainian authorities and journalists have seen evidence of widespread civilian casualties in Bucha, a suburban area northwest of Kyiv. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the casualties as evidence of “a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape” ― not “the random act of a rogue unit.” President Joe Biden on Monday called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be held accountable for the violence, which he described as a war crime. Russia has repeatedly asserted that the violence was committed after its forces left the region. Blinken, however, said Tuesday that reports of atrocities committed by the Russians are “more than credible.” “I’m addressing you on behalf of the memory of the deceased,” Zelenskyy told the U.N. council. “They died suffering.” He alleged that Russian troops searched for and killed “anyone who served our country,” including entire families, executing many people in the street. Other people were thrown in wells, Zelenskyy claimed, and some had their limbs or tongues removed. Photographs showed that some of the dead had their hands tied behind their backs. The world has yet to see the full extent of the brutality, Zelenskyy added. The Russians’ behavior is “no different than ISIS,” Zelenskyy said. “And here it is done by a member of the United Nations Security Council.” The Ukrainian leader condemned the group, whose permanent members include the Russian Federation, for not doing more to end the conflict. He proposed three options: Remove Russia from the security council, reform the council, or dissolve it completely. Citing what he called Ukraine’s “moral right” to propose reforms, Zelenskyy argued that Russia’s veto power makes the council worthless in fulfilling its main purpose of peacekeeping. There is currently no process for removing a member of the security council. “Accountability must be inevitable,” Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian delegation sent a video to be played following the president’s remarks, but technical issues prevented it from being shown immediately afterward. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield subsequently announced that the U.S. would seek to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, noting that Russia has used false allegations of human rights abuses on the part of Ukraine to justify its invasion.",3.069379941089173,2.7923047011788835,0.2770752399102894,3

It will not be the last,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said. At the request of U.S. authorities, Spanish officials took possession of a 255-foot yacht known as the Tango in the port of Palma de Mallorca. It’s estimated to be worth at least $90 million. The yacht is owned by Ukraine-born billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and heads the Renova Group, a Russian conglomerate with interests in minerals, mining and tech, among several other sectors. Vekselberg, who once had homes in New York and Connecticut, was also questioned in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election. Justice Department officials obtained a warrant for the confiscation after arguing that the yacht should be forfeited for violating sanctions statutes. It’s the first U.S. seizure of an oligarch’s yacht since Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen created the Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs task force to enforce sanctions over the Ukraine invasion. “Together, with our international partners, we will do everything possible to hold accountable any individual whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue its unjust war,” Garland said.",5.715575661946339,5.316149811928629,0.39942585001771036,23

The reports are consistent with claims by the Mariupol City Council that Russians have kidnapped 20,000 Mariupol residents, according to an English translation of a March 29 post on the council’s Telegram channel. Russian soldiers have transported Ukrainians, including patients and staff from at least two Mariupol maternity hospitals, through Russian-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine, NPR reported. The woman told The Guardian she was among a group of roughly 200 to 300 people who were taken to Novoazovsk, Ukraine, via bus. That’s when they recognized they had arrived at a “filtration camp,” a series of military tents run by the Russian military where those arriving faced interrogation and confiscation of personal items before they were eventually moved to Russia. The woman said she had her photo and fingerprints taken, and was questioned about potential ties to the Ukrainian military and her opinion on the war before being sent to the Russian town of Rostov. Others have reported they had to hand in their phones and passwords, which officers then used to access their phone contacts and register them into a database, according to The Washington Post. The woman left the group after telling the soldiers she had family in the area and has since made her way to the E.U. “Such reports are lies,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Unlawful deportations constitute war crimes, according to the United Nations. President Joe Biden said Putin is a “war criminal” and should face trial, pledging additional sanctions following atrocities documented in Bucha. Moscow said in March it rescued 420,000 people “from dangerous regions of Ukraine, the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics” and evacuated them to Russia. U.S. intelligence warned before the invasion that Russia may resort to its past practices of unlawful detentions. “These acts, which in past Russian operations have included targeted killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, unjust detentions, and the use of torture, would likely target those who oppose Russian actions,” Bathsheba Crocker, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, wrote in a letter to the U.N. The term “filtration camps” originated in the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Soviet citizens that had been living outside the country who then sought to return — even those forcibly taken to Germany as war criminals — were deemed “suspect.” They had to be screened in camps and holding stations before they were readmitted into the Soviet Union or deported, according to U.K. history professor Nick Baron. In February 2000, Human Rights Watch issued a report detailing excessive violence and rape committed by Russian forces inside a filtration camp in Chechnya, following a 1999 offensive against Chechen rebels during Putin’s first month in power. The aggression offset an earlier Russian setback that forced Russia to remove its forces from the region and sign a treaty that gave Chechnya, a majority Muslim republic, large autonomy in 1996, according to NPR. Russia emerged triumphant this time, with Putin celebrating his victory in March 2000. The ongoing Ukraine war has worried those who have followed Chechnya. “There are some pretty disturbing parallels,” Thomas de Waal, a journalist who covered the area in the 1990s, told NPR. “The use of heavy artillery, the indiscriminate attacking of an urban center. They bring back some pretty terrible memories for those of us who covered the Chechnya war of the 1990s.” The southern port city of Mariupol, where those taken to filtration camps originated, has borne the brunt of Russian cruelty and faces continued bombardments.

After killing the original version of the massive climate and social spending package last year, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) recently signaled his willingness to come to the table on a pared-down version, as long as it specifically focuses on climate change, prescription drug prices and cutting the federal deficit. The $1.7 trillion reconciliation package that House Democrats passed in November included approximately $555 billion in total climate spending. In a memo shared with HuffPost and set to be distributed to officials on Capitol Hill and in the White House, climate advocacy group Evergreen Action outlined 15 specific climate investments that were part of the House-approved bill that it hopes to see prioritized in any resurrected version. The group says those provisions would go a long way toward speeding up the transition to renewable energies and breaking free of a global oil and gas market that is empowering Russian President Vladimir Putin and other bad actors. “We want to connect the dots here, to galvanize more support for Congress to take the action that they need to actually solve this problem,” Lena Moffitt, the group’s chief of staff, told HuffPost. “The war in Ukraine is a terrible humanitarian tragedy that is unfolding and has captured everyone’s attention, and is also spotlighting one more reason why we need to get off of fossil fuels.” “It just so happens that Congress is considering a bill that would supercharge our ability to do so,” Moffitt added. While Evergreen Action supports the full suite of climate provisions in the now-stalled Build Back Better Act, its memo spotlights those that would have the most immediate impact on reducing U.S. demand for oil and gas. They include tax credits on everything from electric vehicles and solar panel manufacturing to energy efficient buildings and green hydrogen production; huge investments to decarbonize the industrial, building and manufacturing sectors and electrify the fleet of federal vehicles; and $29 billion for a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to jump-start the deployment of clean energy infrastructure. The memo cites a recent survey from think tank Data for Progress that found over two-thirds of all likely voters support federal investments to advance clean energy in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It also cites a study from policy firm Energy Innovation that concluded the climate provisions in Biden’s Build Back Better would reduce U.S. oil consumption enough by 2027 to offset the amount of Russian oil imported into the U.S. last year. “The takeaway is clear: passing bold investments in electrification and clean energy offers the best pathway to cut U.S. demand for fossil fuels, protect American families’ bottom lines, and end our dependence on authoritarian petrostates,” the Evergreen memo reads. Last month, Evergreen took aim at Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), releasing a video demanding that he deliver on his promise to “forcefully, insistently and urgently” address climate change via a climate spending bill. The group doubled down on that pressure in Monday’s memo, writing, “President Biden and Majority Leader Schumer must get a deal done, and get the climate provisions of the House-passed reconciliation bill through now.” Dozens of House Democrats sent Biden a letter in mid-March calling on him to restart reconciliation negotiations, with climate as his primary goal. Reconciliation is a special budget process that only requires 51 votes to make it through the Senate. Biden has faced enormous pressure from both sides of the aisle in recent weeks. Republicans are demanding that he “unleash” U.S. oil and gas production to combat rising energy costs and help European allies reduce reliance on Russian oil, while Democrats are largely calling on him to move even more quickly toward renewable sources of energy. Last week, Biden ordered a massive release from the nation’s strategic oil reserves — up to 1 million barrels per day for the next six months — to provide relief from high gas prices, but stressed that the ongoing crisis highlights the urgent need for the kind of climate and clean energy investments in his stalled plan. “Ultimately, we and the whole world need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels altogether,” Biden said. “We need to choose long-term security over energy and climate vulnerability. We need to double down on our commitment to clean energy and tackling the climate crisis with our partners and allies around the world.” “We need to embrace all the tools and technologies that could help us free us from our dependence on fossil fuels.” Read the memo below:",5.263427454227625,5.692585235005743,-0.4291577807781177,14

See what bastards you’ve raised,” Zelenskyy posted on his Telegram channel. “Murderers, looters, butchers.” Some of the graphic scenes the president was referring to are shown below. Such photos and videos have been coming out of cities like Bucha and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel, which Zelenskyy adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said looked like a “scene from a horror movie.” Ukrainian troops have discovered brutalized bodies and widespread destruction in the area outside the capital. Authorities said they are documenting evidence as Ukraine’s military reclaims territory and Russian soldiers withdraw to focus on targeting fuel and ammunition supplies in southern and eastern Ukraine. Graphic photos from Bucha showed bodies in the streets, some that Associated Press journalists in the area noted had their hands tied behind their backs and had been killed at what appeared to be close range. Other bodies were found wrapped in plastic, bound with tape and tossed in a ditch. Arestovych said some civilians were shot in the head, and some bodies showed signs of torture, rape and burning. Zelenskyy on Sunday also slammed NATO for not inviting Ukraine to accession talks in 2008. During the alliance’s summit that year in Bucharest, Romania, members invited Albania and Croatia to accession talks with NATO. “The many years of hard work within the Membership Action Plan have paid off,” the NATO secretary-general said at the summit. “Due to your hard work, Allies can be confident that your admission to the Alliance will strengthen NATO.” The alliance was also tasked with deciding whether to provide Georgia and Ukraine with MAP status. Neither nation received such status, and they were left with an open-ended promise of eventual, potential membership. “Bucharest, NATO Summit Declaration. April 3, 14 years ago. There was a chance to prevent, so that Russia did not come,” Zelenskyy wrote in the same Telegram post on Sunday. “Bucha, Kyiv region. Now. Russia has come.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was asked on Sunday about the prospect of guaranteeing security to Ukraine should the country commit to neutrality as part of a negotiation with Russia to end the war. “All of this is up to the Ukrainians, which is to say that, if they negotiate something that meets their needs, that preserves their sovereignty, their independence, we will back it,” Blinken told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “And we’re not going to be less Ukrainian than Ukrainians. We’re not going to be more Ukrainian than Ukrainians. So, first and foremost, it’s up to them, to their elected representatives, to President Zelenskyy. “When it comes to the future, we and allies and partners are going to want to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that this can’t happen again and that Ukraine has the means to defend itself, to deter the Russian aggression,” he continued. “So, we will look at anything that we can do to back up that kind of outcome.”",2.9113589378375493,3.27029974491867,-0.35894080708112064,3

Midway through the telecast of the 64th annual awards ceremony on Sunday night in Las Vegas, the embattled leader offered a plea to all those watching around the world amid Russia’s unprovoked invasion of his nation. In a pre-taped video from a Kyiv bunker, Zelenskyy delivered a powerful speech reportedly filmed within 48 hours of the broadcast, according to Variety, as part of a special tribute to Ukraine. Drawing striking connections between war and the power of music, Zelenskyy asked, “The war. What is more opposite of music?” before relaying the tragic impact of the invasion. “The silence of ruined cities and killed people,” he said. “Our children draw swooping rockets, not shooting stars. Over 400 children have been injured and 153 children died, and we will never see them drawing. Our parents are happy to wake up in the morning in bomb shelters but alive. Our loved ones don’t know if we will be together again. The war doesn’t let us choose who survives and who stays in eternal silence.” “Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals. Even to those who can’t hear them,” Zelenskyy continued. “But the music will break through anyway. We defend our freedom. To live. To love. To sound. On our land, we are fighting Russia, which brings horrible silence with its bombs.”  He concluded his remarks with a call to the celebrity-packed event at the MGM Grand Garden Arena: “Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today. Tell our story. Tell the truth about the war on your social networks and TV. Support us in any way you can, but not silence. And then peace will come.” Zelenskyy went on to say he holds a dream for the cities that have been hardest hit by the war, including Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Volnovakha and Mariupol. “I have a dream of them living,” he said. “And free. Free like you on the Grammy stage.” The video introduced a performance of John Legend’s new song, “Free,” which featured a poem read by Ukrainian refugee Lyuba Yakimchuk and accompaniment by Ukrainian musicians Siuzanna Iglidan and Mika Newton. The stirring performance ended by directing viewers to a donation page to support the war-torn region’s refugees. Prior to the Grammys telecast, rumors swirled earlier this month about whether Zelenskyy would appear at the Academy Awards with both co-host Amy Schumer and one of Hollywood’s most vocal Ukraine supporters, Sean Penn, supporting the idea. But much to Penn’s dismay ― the actor threatened to “smelt” his Oscars in public if the academy chose not to let Zelenskyy speak ― the Ukrainian president did not appear during the ceremony. Instead, the Oscars featured a 30-second moment of silence, which ended with a plea to those tuning in to the awards show: “We ask you to support Ukraine in any way you are able. #StandWithUkraine.” Watch Legend’s performance below.

Besides money, defectors giving up Russian equipment are offered “secrecy, a safe stay in Ukraine and support in obtaining new documents and an exit for a third country.” Oleksandr Kornienko, first vice speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, said in a statement that the money will be “an additional incentive” for the demoralized “occupiers to lay down their arms.”",3.5802092004871966,3.7219493412548594,-0.14174014076766284,23

The suburbs outside Kyiv have seen some of the most important battles in Russia’s war against Ukraine so far, as Russian forces tried and failed to encircle the capital city. Many residents were forced to flee ― some under gunfire ― and join the ranks of the millions of people displaced by the five-week-old conflict. Although Russian forces have been filing out of regions in northern Ukraine, including the Kyiv area, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says they are booby-trapping the territory they leave in their wake with mines. “They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,” Zelenskyy said in one of his nightly addresses, CBS News reported. “There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.” There is some evidence of looting where other Russian battalions are retreating: the Ukrainian defense ministry said on Facebook that a Russian “column of trucks with various properties,” including “industrial goods and household things,” was also spotted en route from the Ukrainian city of Buryn, which lies east of Kyiv, towards the Russian border, according to a translation from Business Insider.

2022-04-02,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-climate-agenda_n_6246104ce4b068157f74dbed,Biden’s Global Climate Agenda Is On The Ropes As Europe Goes To War And The Right Digs In,"Last April, President Joe Biden convened dozens of world leaders for a “virtual climate summit” that sought to generate more ambitious environmental policies ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference later in the year. The summit, held on an occasionally glitchy Zoom call, sought to prove that Biden would restore the climate credibility the U.S. had lost under President Donald Trump, and make it a leader in the global fight against catastrophic planetary warming. Biden has made a series of moves meant to bolster that aim. He returned the U.S. to the 2015 Paris climate accords, pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half before 2030 and to net-zero by midcentury, and issued numerous executive orders to help achieve those goals. But 14 months into his presidency and a year since the summit, Biden is facing Russia’s war in Ukraine, rising global oil and gasoline prices, and the intransigence of climate change skeptics both at home and abroad ― and they are now threatening to derail his climate agenda altogether. Since launching his campaign for president, Biden has pledged to make climate change a centerpiece of both his domestic and foreign policy strategies. He would push countries like Brazil, where right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has presided over record levels of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, to change course, while simultaneously enacting the most ambitious domestic climate agenda in American history. His early moves, and promises of further legislative and executive action to come, did succeed in bolstering U.S. climate credibility on the international stage, particularly among major European leaders who had been dismayed by Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris accords, his formation of a convenient anti-climate alliance with Bolsonaro, and the United States’ general turn against any form of aggressive climate action. “There is a lot more credibility in the way that the U.S. wants to adopt an environmentally friendly policy,” said one European official, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely about the Biden administration’s climate approach. “But there are also some difficulties in the implementation.” The opening three months of 2022 have shown just how big those difficulties are. Data released in January showed that U.S. carbon emissions rose sharply last year after a pandemic-driven downturn the year prior, highlighting the struggles Biden may face in curbing emissions overall as the U.S. economy bounces back to life. In early February, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) announced his opposition to Biden’s Build Back Better plan, a sweeping legislative proposal that initially included $555 billion in climate-related spending, derailing what would have amounted to the largest package of climate-focused initiatives in U.S. history. The same month, a surge of deforestation destroyed an area of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest equivalent in size to Washington, D.C. ― a record for the month of February ― all while Brazilian lawmakers launched a legislative push that could open even more of the forest to industrialization and destruction. And in the final week of February, Russia launched an invasion of neighboring Ukraine, sparking a crisis that, beyond its humanitarian implications, has also exacerbated oil supply crunches. In response, Republicans have demanded the U.S. “unleash” domestic fossil fuel production, while some Democrats have begged the Biden administration to abandon efforts to pass climate legislation, fearing it could crater the party’s hopes in looming midterm elections. Last week, Biden ordered the largest-ever release of oil from the nation’s strategic reserves — an average of 1 million barrels per day for six months — to combat high prices and act as a “wartime bridge” until domestic production can ramp up later this year. The developments have put Biden’s planned international climate agenda in serious jeopardy. “It damages our credibility abroad when you have sweeping campaign promises being made … and then nothing happens,” said Collin Rees, a senior campaigner at Oil Change International, a climate advocacy group. “You can only be the boy who cried wolf so many times on the international stage.” Brazil has long been at the center of Biden’s desire to make climate a foreign policy focus. During a presidential debate in 2020, he pledged to create a $20 billion international fund to help protect the Brazilian Amazon, and cited rampant destruction of the forest as a key failure of Trump’s foreign policy approach. But shifting geopolitical circumstances and the right wing’s fervent allegiance to fossil fuels and environmental exploitation have inhibited those plans almost from the beginning. Early in his presidency, Biden signed a climate-focused executive order that tasked his administration with developing a plan to “promote the protection of the Amazon rainforest and other critical ecosystems that serve as global carbon sinks.” And he sent former Secretary of State John Kerry, who now serves as Biden’s special climate envoy, and other key U.S. officials to Brasília for diplomatic talks meant to persuade the Bolsonaro government to abandon its most destructive policies. Negotiating better forest protections with Bolsonaro, a climate change denialist who has spent his presidency rolling back regulations and incentivizing deforestation, was always going to prove difficult. But it also offered an opportunity. By bringing Brazil, which had drastically reduced emissions and improved its rainforest protections in the past, back to the table, the U.S. could also prove its own bona fides. The on-again, off-again negotiations, during which Brazilian officials repeatedly insisted they needed advance payments to protect the forest, eventually resulted in a cursory pledge from the Bolsonaro government to put an end to illegal deforestation by 2028, two years earlier than Brazil had previously said it would. Throughout the process, Brazilian environmental experts and Indigenous tribes warned the U.S. not to trust Bolsonaro, who they feared would simply legalize deforestation now considered illegal and use any positive outcome ― and financial benefit ― to bolster his own political prospects. “The problem in the country is not money, the problem is the government,” said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a São Paulo-based environmental organization. “We have the money. We don’t have a government willing to face deforestation.” Still, the pledge came at a time when it may have seemed possible to “shift Bolsonaro’s focus,” said Mark Langevin, an expert on Brazilian energy and environmental policy at George Mason University in Virginia. He had replaced a hard-line environmental minister with an official many observers had hoped would approach the job more pragmatically. The reputational damage caused by a record outbreak of fires in 2019, and Bolsonaro’s persistent denials that they were even occurring, had also driven some modern elements of Brazil’s influential agribusiness industry to begin pushing the government to change its approach. Since the agreement, however, Bolsonaro has proceeded the way most environmental experts assumed he would. Brazil’s Congress is already considering a package of legislative proposals favored by Bolsonaro that would allow more large mining projects on protected Indigenous territories in the Amazon and ease regulations over the use of harmful pesticides, The Guardian reported in March. The bills could also lead to another surge in illegal land grabbing, a practice that has helped drive deforestation and violent attacks on Indigenous communities under Bolsonaro, thanks to his government’s lax enforcement of the law and its close ties to garimpeiros ― wildcat miners who have scoured the Amazon for its resources. Even as the forest faces ever-graver threats, Russia’s war appears to have shifted U.S. attention at least for the moment away from deforestation and toward another sensitive environmental topic. After the invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. placed broad new economic sanctions on Russia, including a ban on the import of all Russian fossil fuels. That has sent domestic gas prices ― already on the rise thanks to increased demand at home ― to record highs, which could have drastic political ramifications for Biden and the Democratic Party later this year. In an effort to prevent those increases, the Biden administration has sought to replace lost Russian fuel via other sources, including Brazil. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm urged her Brazilian counterpart, Bento Albuquerque, to boost oil production in a mid-March phone call. Albuquerque immediately agreed, he told Agence France-Presse. That’s a major priority for Bolsonaro, who has sought to paint the Russian war as “a good opportunity” to loosen environmental protections, boost oil production and ramp up mining on Indigenous territories within the Amazon that are rich in potassium, which could be used to produce fertilizer. (Brazil imports most of its fertilizer from Russia.) Brazil has plenty of company in seeking to leverage the crisis to bolster domestic industries. Australia and other coal-producing countries are embracing a surge in coal demand as European nations look to replace supplies from Russia. And Biden, who campaigned on a pledge to “take on the fossil fuel industry,” is facing a pressure campaign from that sector and allied Republicans to boost domestic production of oil and gas in order to combat rising energy costs and assist European allies as they seek to reduce reliance on Russian oil. But the posture toward Bolsonaro demonstrates the ways that Russia’s invasion complicated an already fragile global climate agenda. “The politics of climate, domestically and internationally, are so challenging,” Langevin said. “And now, all eyes are on Ukraine, which just takes all the oxygen out of the room.” It has shifted the U.S. posture elsewhere too. Last month, Biden announced plans to boost exports of liquified natural gas to help Europe transition off of Russian gas, which accounts for 40% of Europe’s supply. The deal with Europe, the administration argued, would speed the continent’s transition away from dirty energy sources altogether. “The president knows ... that the true path to energy security runs through clean energy, so that’s the second part of this agreement,” a senior administration official said on a call with reporters last month. “The first part is getting Europe off Russian gas. The second part is getting Europe off gas altogether. And he’s committed to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and reaping the climate, environmental, economic and energy security benefits of moving decisively down that path.” But it also horrified climate groups in the U.S., who fear it will lead to a large-scale build-out of gas infrastructure and lock in years if not decades of pollution from what is already one of the key drivers of climate change. Methane, the main component of natural gas, accounts for one-third of all human-caused planetary warming. The fossil fuel industry, by contrast, applauded the move. This is the fine line the White House has walked both domestically and internationally: On the one hand, it has repeatedly stressed that Russia’s war is a reminder that the U.S. must speed up its transition to renewable energies in order to break free of a global oil and gas market that empowers bad actors and determines prices at home and abroad. On the other, it has responded to the Republican misinformation campaign about Biden being “at war with” fossil fuels by arguing that the administration has given the industry the tools it needs to increase domestic production. In a speech announcing a U.S. ban on imports of Russian fossil fuels, Biden noted that U.S. oil and gas companies pumped more during his first year than during Trump’s, that production is forecast to reach a record high in 2023, and that the industry has stockpiled more than 9,000 unused but approved permits to drill across millions of acres of federal lands. “It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production,” Biden said. The administration is pointing the finger at U.S. drillers for high prices at the pump, even accusing them of profiteering, while simultaneously trying to appease the industry. Granholm has called on producers to “rise to meet current demand” amid Russia’s invasion. And speaking to a room full of energy industry executives at the CERAWeek conference in Houston last month, Kerry said the Biden administration is committed to an “all of the above” future energy policy. It’s a pro-everything strategy that both Democrats and Republicans have championed for more than two decades, but that is increasingly out of sync with climate science. A report last month concluded that the U.S. and other wealthy, heavy-polluting nations must phase out oil and gas production altogether by 2034 if the world is to have a 50% chance of limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the landmark Paris climate agreement. António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, recently warned that the war and ensuing pursuit of “all-of-the-above” energy could be the death knell for limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees. “Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or kneecap policies to cut fossil fuel use,” he said. “Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.” A White House spokesperson said Biden has not wavered in his push for climate action, but said in the short term energy supply must keep up with demand. “We believe we can walk and chew gum ― address supply in the short term because families need to take their kids to school, and go to work, get groceries and go about their lives ― and often that requires gas,” the spokesperson said. “But in the long term we must speed up ― not slow down ― our transition to a clean energy future.” The State Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Along with ordering a massive draw on the nation’s oil reserves last week, Biden called on Congress to require oil and gas companies to pay fees on idle wells and unused federal leases, as well as pass his stalled Build Back Better climate and social spending package. Early in his presidency, Biden said the U.S. would push the world forward on climate action in large part through leading by example. It couldn’t ask other countries to meet goals or take aggressive actions if it wasn’t willing to meet the moment itself. But the consensus among climate experts and advocates appears to be that while the Biden administration is talking the talk, it is not yet walking the walk — that the rhetoric has not translated into the aggressive policies that scientists say are required to, in the words of the United Nations’ most recent climate report, “secure a livable and sustainable future for all.” Even before Russia’s invasion, U.S. climate groups were disappointed in Biden’s ability to deliver at home. Greenpeace USA, a major environmental organization, gave his first year in office a failing grade on its running scorecard of Biden’s climate actions. The Build Back Better plan and its ambitious climate spending were the administration’s chief legislative vehicle to achieve many of its goals. But its future, as a climate plan or as any plan at all, was in doubt even before the invasion inspired Democratic skittishness about the political impact of rising gas prices and GOP calls to expand domestic oil and gas production. Biden has also come under fire from forest experts. Along with advancing several planned logging projects in mature, carbon-rich forests in the Pacific Northwest, the administration in November released a long-term strategy for slashing emissions that appeared to float cutting down old-growth trees and replacing them with younger stands as a solution to climate change and climate-fueled wildfires. Dozens of climate and public land advocacy organizations have since launched a national campaign to pressure Biden to enact rules to conserve remaining mature forests across the federal estate. John Noël, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace USA, said it’s been “disorienting” to watch fossil fuel permitting and production increase under Biden’s watch after the president described climate change an “existential threat.” “The overall mood is pissed, straight up,” Noël said. “It’s totally unacceptable.” Greenpeace USA is among more than 200 climate, social justice and progressive groups that sent Biden a letter last month urging him to “resist short-sighted policies such as scaling up domestic fossil fuel production” and instead to use his executive power, specifically by invoking the Defense Production Act, to speed up America’s transition to clean energy technologies and flight fossil fuel-driven planetary warming. On Thursday, Biden did invoke the Defense Production Act in an effort boost production of critical minerals used in batteries and clean energy technology. Similarly, the 98-member Congressional Progressive Caucus has called on Biden to take several actions that they argue would allow him to deliver on his campaign promises, including declaring a national climate emergency, reinstating a ban on crude oil exports, prohibiting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters, and ending fossil fuel subsidies. At some point, the Biden administration has to pick a side, said Oil Change International’s Rees. “This desire to not make anybody mad is going to make everybody mad,” he said. “They need to decide if they are going to be with people or polluters.” Biden and his team seemingly have as much if not more work to do to prove themselves on the international stage. Ahead of last year’s COP26 climate summit, Biden pledged to double U.S. climate aid for developing nations from $5.6 billion to $11.4 billion per year by 2024. It was expected to close the gap on the U.S. and other rich nations’ decade-old broken promise of providing $100 billion in climate finance for low-income and vulnerable countries to develop clean energy and adapt to the mounting impacts of climate change. But when Congress passed its $1.5 trillion spending bill on March 10, less than two weeks after the United Nations’ latest dire climate study, it included a measly $1 billion in international climate aid — less than half of what the White House had requested. (To put that in perspective, the U.S. alone experienced 20 separate billion-dollar climate and weather disasters last year.) “This is devastating to the politics around climate action because there are so many kinds of initiatives and political developments that need those funds,” said Joseph Curtin, director of The Rockefeller Foundation’s power and climate initiative. “It’s a major impediment to progress.” On Monday, the White House released its $5.8 trillion federal budget for 2023. While Biden’s statement announcing the request did not mention climate, the proposal calls for $44.9 billion to tackle the crisis, including $11 billion in international climate aid. But the budget request is just that — a request — and the same congressional obstacles that have plagued Biden and his team from the beginning remain. There is still time for Biden to get things right on climate on the international stage, Curtin said. But with so much attention and resources being directed at the crisis in Eastern Europe, it’s going to require some juggling. In the eight months between now and the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, Curtin said it is critical that Biden and his team shore up financial support for initiatives like Net Zero World, which is aimed at providing technical support for countries looking to accelerate a clean energy transition, and South Africa’s Just Energy Transition Partnership, which seeks to speed up South Africa’s shift away from coal. The U.S., the European Union, France, Germany and the United Kingdom committed to invest a combined $8.5 billion toward the South Africa initiative. “I think [climate] is a high priority in the White House,” Curtin said. “But I think it’s taking a little bit of time to crank up the machinery, to deliver on these commitments. Rather than give a very negative grade, I’d prefer to wait and see and assume that the intention is there to deliver on some of these promises.” “Quite honestly, I can’t see any other way of arriving at COP27.”",5.7167625264722055,5.605419579016576,0.11134294745562912,14

Heavy military machinery used by the Russians seems to have kicked up radiation in the area, said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi at a press conference Friday, but he could not confirm reports of Russian troops experiencing radiation poisoning. Russia sparked international alarm in the earliest days of the war for attacking and seizing the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster. The plant requires around-the-clock monitoring to ensure nuclear materials remain safely contained. “We are going to be there very, very soon, because in Chernobyl, there is a lot of work to be done,” Grossi said. He did not indicate any particular cause for alarm, however. “The general radiation situation around the plant is quite normal,” Grossi said. “There was a relatively higher level of localized radiation because of the heavy vehicles at the time of the occupation of the plant and apparently this might have been the case again on the way out.” The speed of the Russians’ departure from Chernobyl came as somewhat of a surprise, although Russian forces have been retreating from areas around northern Ukraine in recent days. Ukrainian authorities said the invading soldiers had dug trenches in the dangerously radioactive Red Forest, which lies alongside the destroyed nuclear power plant, and exposed themselves to “significant doses” of radiation. The troops “panicked at the first sign of illness,” Ukraine’s state power company Energoatom said Thursday. Ukraine’s defense ministry said over Twitter that the Russians “looted” the power plant before retreating.

Zelenskyy named the two individuals as Naumov Andriy Olehovych, ex-chief of the Main Department of International Security of the Security Service of Ukraine, and Kryvoruchko Serhiy Oleksandrovych, former head of the Office of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Kherson region. The Ukrainian president did not spell out what actions prompted the generals’ dismissal, but pledged to root out any more “antiheroes” in the future. “Now I do not have time to deal with all the traitors,” he said. “But gradually they will all be punished.” Over recent months, Zelenskyy has taken steps to tighten his control in Ukraine and steer the country away from Russia. In early February, before the war, he decided to shut down three TV channels owned by Viktor Medvedchuk, an ally to Russian President Vladimir Putin, claiming they aired “propaganda.” Following the invasion, he declared martial law, which he recently extended until late April, and eliminated 11 political parties with ties to the Kremlin. Ukraine and the West have been warning that Russia is regrouping its forces despite promising to scale back to “increase trust” in peace talks, which are set to resume Friday. Russia’s defense minister told military officials Tuesday the country was now turning its attention to the “main goal — the liberation of Donbas,” according to The Associated Press . “What we don’t believe is that [Putin’s] planning to send them home,” John Kirby, Pentagon’s press secretary told MSNBC on Thursday. “What we think he’s going to do is refit these troops, resupply them and put them back into Ukraine for offensive operations somewhere else.” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby talks about what the U.S. is seeing in Russian troop movements around Kyiv:""What we don't believe is that he's planning to send them home."" @PentagonPresSec  Young Russian men of draft age are also worried that Putin will send them to fight on the front lines in Ukraine as annual spring conscription is set to start Friday, despite officials ruling that out.

Although the devastating attacks on Ukraine continue, there is a general consensus that the war has not exactly gone according to the Russian president’s plan and troops have moved back from the capital of Kyiv. Here’s what officials from the U.K. and the U.S. have said about Russia’s efforts: U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace ripped into Putin over his military failures in Ukraine on Thursday, and declared that the Russian president is now caught “in a cage he built himself.” Wallace told Sky News: “President Putin is not the force he used to be. “He is now a man in a cage he built himself. His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. “The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. “He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with consequences of what he has done to his own army. “We have seen it before. It always get worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas.” Russia has repeatedly denied that it is attacking civilian areas as part of its “special military operation” in Ukraine, despite evidence that bomb shelters and maternity hospitals have been targeted. 'President Putin must recognise that his three or four-day plan is now in day 36"".Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ""definitely not going to plan"". Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233 and YouTube  Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the U.K.’s chief of defense staff, expressed a similar point of view when he said Russia’s attempts to seize the whole of Ukraine have “fallen apart.” Speaking at an Institute for Government event on Thursday, he said that Putin was a “weaker and more diminished figure” than he was prior to the invasion — while “NATO is stronger and more united today than at any time I can remember.” He also alleged that Putin had been “misled” about how effective his forces were amid reports that Russia is withdrawing from Ukraine. Some Kremlin aides are allegedly too afraid to tell the president how the invasion is actually going, although Moscow has denied this charge. Radakin also said that the Kremlin appeared to be moving the emphasis onto the east and south of Ukraine, but predicted: “Ukraine armed forces will attack those Russian forces as they retreat.” He also said: “In many ways, Putin has already lost. Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements. “Like all authoritarians, he allowed himself to be misled as to his own strength, including the effectiveness of the Russian armed forces.” Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of GCHQ intelligence agency, shared a similar warning Wednesday. He said: “Even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime.” On Thursday night, the ministry of defense tweeted that Russia is now redeploying elements of its military forces from Georgia. It claimed: “It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 31 March 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦  The Kyiv Independent shared the Ukraine’s Armed Forces estimates when it comes to what Russia has lost since the war began on February 24. Approximately, 17,700 troops have been lost, along with 1,220 vehicles, and 1,751 armoured personnel carriers. The newspaper’s defense reporter Illia Ponomarenko also tweeted: “Russians basically came to Kyiv with an unbelievably stupid and unrealistic plan, killed a lot of people, ruined a lot of homes, and sustained heavy casualties. No results, no reserves. “Now they just have to leave before they get slaughtered in a pocket northwest of Kyiv.” These are the indicative estimates of Russia’s combat losses as of April 1, according to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

No results, no reserves.Now they just have to leave before they get slaughtered in a pocket northwest of Kyiv. In the U.S., the White House claimed there has been “incontrovertible evidence” that the war on Ukraine has “been a strategic disaster for Russia” on Thursday. U.S. President Joe Biden’s communications director Kate Bedingfield told the press that Russia was trying to “redefine the initial aims of their invasion” as a result. She continued: “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military, which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership.” She also pointed out that it is becoming clearer Putin’s war will leave Russia “isolated on the world stage.”",2.7064855664938894,2.443468613233338,0.2630169532605513,15

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, or ICC, said shortly after the war began he would open an investigation into any possible war crimes, and the human rights chief at the United Nations said there is credible evidence that the Kremlin’s military action may amount to such. But what’s the international justification for labeling someone a war criminal, and how are they punished? HuffPost spoke with Leila Sadat, the James Carr professor of international criminal law at Washington University in St. Louis, who has served as a special adviser on crimes against humanity to the ICC since 2012. The ICC was established by an international treaty called the Rome Statute and became the first permanent international criminal court when it began sitting in 2002, with 123 member countries. War is a brutal act, but Sadat said the international community has developed a set of rules about how a war should take place to minimize harm to civilians. The body can prosecute individuals — heads of state, military members and others — under three broad umbrellas of criminal acts: crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. War crimes range from the willful killing of civilians to torture to wanton destruction of nonmilitary targets, but the key is the intent to cause harm outside of those guidelines, known as the law of armed conflict. “The adoption of unlawful methods, or the targeting of unlawful targets is criminal if it’s done with intent,” Sadat said, adding that under those rules, sites like hospitals, schools and places of cultural importance should be safe from attack. “An accident could happen — you could accidentally shoot somebody that you shouldn’t shoot — and it might be a violation, but it might not be criminal.” Russia has been accused of targeting such sites, bombing a theater in Mariupol sheltering civilians labeled “children” and striking a maternity hospital in the city that left at least three people dead. Ten people were also killed waiting for bread in Chernihiv. The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, formally opened an investigation into Russia’s behavior shortly after the invasion began, but the groundwork had been in place since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Forty-one member states jointly asked Khan to open a probe into possible war crimes and an advance team was sent to Ukraine as the attack began. The evidence will then presented to the court, comprising 18 judges from around the world, no two from the same country. Politically the answer is a bit different: Diplomats can lob the term “war criminal” as a catchall for horrifically bad behavior. The ICC team on the ground in Ukraine and neighboring states will look at everything: aerial photographs, interviews with refugees, footage from public databases like eyeWitness to Atrocities, which lets those impacted by war upload footage from conflict zones. NATO members, including the United States, also provide valuable intelligence that could range from transcripts of phone calls between generals to drone footage that can prove the laws of war have been violated. Sadat said when it appears like a bad actor has been committing “a lot of illegality, then you start to think it’s intentional.” “The level of aerial bombardment is just so shocking. The devastation of these cities,” she said of the ongoing attack in Ukraine. Investigators will also look impartially at both sides in a conflict, so Ukraine could also be accused and investigated for war crimes. There is no death penalty, but those convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity can be punished with heavy sentences that stretch into the decades, including life imprisonment. Getting someone to stand trial is another matter, and cases against accused war criminals are a long game, Sadat said. Prosecutors can decide to issue an arrest warrant to have someone stand trail in The Hague, but they have no authority to wade into Russia and slap the accused in handcuffs. “It makes someone’s life really miserable,” Sadat said. “Unfortunately it’s not quick, it’s not like a bad crime has been committed in St. Louis, they chase them for a couple days, boom you have them in jail.” Still, international pressure and frustration among people dealing with sanctions and the heavy toll of war can result in political shifts that could lead to the removal of those in power. That happened in the former Yugoslavia when Slobodan Milošević was put on trial for his role in the the Bosnian and Kosovo wars before the ICC was established. He stood trial but died in his cell in The Hague before a verdict was reached. The ICC also issued an arrest warrant in 2008 against Sudan’s former president Omar al-Bashir on accusations of war crimes and genocide in Darfur. He remained in power until 2019, however, until he was ousted in a coup. Sudan only said it would hand him over last year, more than a decade later. “Politicians are looking for a response here — and a vigorous response — because it’s an awful conflict,” Sadat said. “They hope to score domestic political points, but branding an individual a war criminal, that’s a big deal, especially another head of state.” Such a designation can impede diplomatic efforts, especially in the midst of a war, she added. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he remains open to negotiations. Still, Sadat said the Kremlin’s pattern of bombing cities appeared indiscriminate and shocking, saying labeling such acts as crimes seems like the right thing. “They’re using techniques that are completely illegal to achieve a state purpose, and they’re incorrigible. You can’t sit down and negotiate with them,” she said. “When you think of criminality, the criminal law is the harshest law we have. When you get there, it’s because everything else has failed.”",4.372250449277257,4.32315119230577,0.04909925697148765,2

Tulsi Gabbard’s defenses of Russian President Vladimir Putin have evidently landed them comfortably in the Kremlin’s good graces. During a broadcast on Russian state television this week, Gabbard was apparently referenced in very friendly terms by one of Putin’s most prominent propagandists, Vladimir Soloviev. He introduced Gabbard, a Democratic primary candidate for the 2020 presidential race, as “our girlfriend Tulsi,” according to a translation by Russian media analyst Julia Davis, a columnist for the Daily Beast. A clip was then aired of Gabbard’s appearance on Monday’s episode of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” in which she suggested President Joe Biden was secretly plotting to remove Putin from power. After the clip aired, a panelist reportedly asked, “Is she some sort of Russian agent?” According to Davis’ translation, Soloviev said she was. Meanwhile on Russian state TV: Another translated clip of Tucker Carlson and Tulsi Gabbard, introduced by state TV host Vladimir Soloviev as ""Our girlfriend Tulsi."" After the clip plays, one panelist asks: ""Is she some sort of a Russian agent?"" The host quickly replies: ""Yes.""  During Monday’s interview, Gabbard argued that Biden was pushing for regime change in Russia through “economic warfare.” “They are doing so by waging this modern-day siege against Russia, isolating, containing, destroying their economy, starving the Russian people in the hope that the Russian people or the military will rise up and revolt and overthrow their government and get rid of Putin,” she said during part of the excerpt that aired in Russia. On Sunday, Biden said that Putin “cannot remain in power” in off-script remarks during a speech in Poland. White House officials quickly clarified that Biden was not advocating for regime change in Russia but that “Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.” But according to Gabbard, “it was not a gaffe at all” and Biden is “lying” about his true motives. The Putin-friendly rhetoric is nothing new for the former congresswoman from Hawaii. Last month, as Putin was beginning his invasion of Russia, Gabbard blamed the U.S., NATO and Ukraine, claiming that the war could “easily have been avoided” if NATO had “simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine’s becoming a member of NATO.” She has also lent credence to a Russian-backed conspiracy theory about U.S. biological labs in Ukraine that American officials have warned could serve as justification for Russia to use biological and chemical weapons against Ukraine. In 2019, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested in an interview that Gabbard, then a long shot in the Democratic presidential field, was being groomed by Russia as an “asset” who would run as a third-party candidate and help usher in a Republican president. Gabbard filed and then later dropped a defamation lawsuit against Clinton over the “asset” comment. Carlson, meanwhile, has been a favorite of Russian propagandists for weeks. The Fox News host has repeatedly been featured on Russian state-sponsored television for his defenses of Russia and criticisms of the U.S., NATO and Ukraine, and was even reportedly endorsed by the Kremlin in a leaked memo to state media. Earlier this week, he promoted a bizarre theory to keep Putin in power, suggesting that Islamic extremists would somehow get hold of the country’s nuclear weapons and use them on Americans if he was removed.",5.699791055040978,5.923420980976108,-0.22362992593512931,24

That evening, Natalya — the pseudonym she used in the interview published Monday — said her husband went out to check their front yard after hearing noise. A few moments later she said she heard a gunshot. “I cried out, where is my husband, then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate,” she told The Times of London. “This younger guy pulled gun to my head and said: ‘I shot your husband because he’s a Nazi.’” Then, she said, the two soldiers proceeded to repeatedly rape her, while her son was weeping in a nearby room. Natalya said she recognized one of the two men on social media. This case will be the subject of an investigation — the first official look into sexual violence allegations against Russian forces, according to The Times of London — which was previewed by Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova on Facebook last week. Moscow is contesting the allegations in Venediktova’s post. “It is a lie,” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s press secretary, told reporters last week, according to an Interfax news agency report cited by The New York Times. Natalya and her son Oleksii — also a pseudonym — eventually made it to Ternopil, near Lviv in western Ukraine, where her husband’s sister was staying. She said her husband’s sister encouraged her to break her silence over the violence she endured. “I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husband’s sister made me speak up and there was no going back,” she said. “I understand that many people who have been hurt would stay silent because they are afraid. Lots of people don’t believe terrible things like this happen.” A United Nations resolution brought forward by then-U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in 2008 and adopted that year declared that rape and other forms of sexual violence can be considered war crimes. Maria Mezentseva, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, told Sky News on Sunday that her country will be seeking expertise from the U.K. to support survivors. “There are many more victims rather than just this one case which has been made public by the prosecutor general,” she said. “And of course, we are expecting many more of them, which will be public once victims will be ready to talk about them.” What's happening to women in Ukraine is ""quite a scary scene"", says @mezentseva_dep as she recalls an incident where a woman was ""raped several times in front of her underage child"" after her husband was shot.#Ridge: 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233  Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, accused Russian soldiers of rape at an event in Chatham House in London earlier this month, according to Reuters. “When bombs fall on your cities, when soldiers rape women in the occupied cities — and we have numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities — it’s difficult, of course, to speak about the efficiency of international law,” Kuleba said. A report titled “2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Ukraine” published by the U.S. State Department noted several instances of abuse against both men and women linked to the conflict in Donbas in eastern Ukraine, which started in 2014. The report notes most of those instances took place when people were in detention, and none had been documented since 2017. “Beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members were used as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions,” the report states.

It was Lavrov’s first official visit to China since Russian President Vladimir Putin waged war on neighboring Ukraine in late February. Wang echoed Lavrov’s remarks, saying China is prepared to work with Moscow to build on their relationship. “China-Russia relations have withstood the new test of evolving international landscape, remained on the right course and shown resilient development momentum,” Wang said, according to a release published by China’s foreign ministry on the meeting. “Both sides are more determined to develop bilateral relations and more confident in advancing cooperation in various fields.” Jeremy Fleming, the head of British intelligence agency GCHQ, offered a stark warning to China that a partnership with Russia — a country known for ignoring international rules — would not support its mission to lead the world. “Russia understands that, long term, China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically,” Fleming said during a speech in Australia, according to the BBC. “Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation.” While the meeting was meant to focus on Afghanistan, China’s foreign ministry said Lavrov and Wang also discussed the ongoing tensions in Ukraine. “We support Russia and Ukraine in overcoming the difficulties to continue with the peace talks, support the positive outcomes reached in the negotiations so far, support the deescalation of tensions on the ground and support the efforts made by Russia and other parties to prevent a large-scale humanitarian crisis,” Wang said. China has so far refused to publicly condemn Russia for the war. Earlier this month, the White House warned China — a major U.S. competitor — that there would be consequences if it chose to help Russia evade Western sanctions. Susan Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego, and a former State Department official told The New York Times last month that China’s close ties to Moscow are worrisome for the United States. “It’s certainly concerning, and it is not a positive development from the standpoint of U.S. national security or U.S. national interests,” Shirk said. “They have a kind of common perspective on the U.S. right now, and there is this affinity between the leaders.” Chinese President Xi Jinping has previously referred to Putin as his “best friend.” The two also published a joint statement ahead of the opening ceremony of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, saying the “friendship between the two states has no limits” and asserting “there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation.” Fleming said Putin counts on China for military support and technology, and as a market for its lucrative oil and gas business, per the BBC. On Thursday, Lavrov will visit India, which has continued to buy Russian oil — even in higher quantities during the war, taking advantage of discounts offered by Russia. India has bought close to 13 million barrels of Russian oil since the beginning of the war, compared to almost 16 million barrels in 2021, according to Reuters.",4.053003336276986,3.726938437690746,0.3260648985862402,25

He overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory,” Fleming said in a Thursday speech in Australia. “Short of weapons and morale,” the Russians downed their own aircraft by mistake, he added. Fleming also confirmed that Moscow has deployed mercenaries and foreign fighters as part of its operation. The GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) is a top partner for U.S. intelligence, and Fleming’s statement is his first public comment on the Ukraine war since the invasion began on Feb. 24. “Even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime,” Fleming continued. Russia’s military has lost seven generals and at least 7,000 soldiers as Ukrainian forces have resisted the easy Russian victory that analysts say Putin expected. Russian forces are enduring many more casualties in their ongoing bid to capture the strategic port city of Mariupol, according to a March 30 assessment of the war from the Institute for the Study of War think tank in Washington. “Russia is withdrawing some elements of its forces around [the Ukrainain capital of] Kyiv... for likely redeployment,” analysts Mason Clark, George Barros and Kateryna Stepanenko wrote. “But Russian forces will likely continue to hold their forwardmost positions and shell Ukrainian forces and residential areas.” Russia has repeatedly struck civilian targets, such as hospitals and shelters, in recent weeks, and Western officials worry that it will become more aggressive in doing so ― including by using banned chemical weapons and claiming the Ukrainians have done so. Fleming referred to that risk in his address: “On this and many other subjects, deeply secret intelligence is being released to make sure the truth is heard. At this pace and scale, this is unprecedented.” Negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials to secure a cease-fire have yet to bear fruit.",2.422187300180287,3.195175842993273,-0.7729885428129859,22

Hrybov was part of a group of border guards stationed on Snake Island off the country’s southwestern coast that refused to surrender to approaching Russian forces on the first day of the invasion in late February. “Russian warship, go fuck yourself,” Hrybov could be heard flatly telling the Russians in audio of the interaction released by the Ukrainian military.

The Feldman Ecopark in Kharkiv posted a video earlier this week showing the confused-looking creatures in the back of a van with straw spread out on the floor. Ukraine’s foreign ministry later shared a clip on Twitter. These kangaroos were evacuated from Feldman Ecopark in #Kharkiv. Their enclosures were repeatedly shelled by #Russian Armed Forces.

While the zoo and ministry each mentioned kangaroos, the video also shows wallabies in the van, Max Pulsinelli, spokesperson for the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, told HuffPost. Wallabies are slightly smaller, close cousins of kangaroos. The animals’ enclosures have been “repeatedly shelled” in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, the zoo said in its Facebook post. It also noted that by the time the video was posted, the marsupials had gotten to their destination and were “already safe,” though the post did not specify where they went. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, has faced heavy shelling throughout the Russian invasion, and the Ecopark has not been spared. In early March, Russian bombs killed two employees of the zoo who were trying to feed the animals, the BBC reported. Numerous animals at the park have also been killed, while others, like deer and moose, have been set free into the forest by zookeepers who felt they had better chances surviving on their own. Many of the zoo’s surviving animals have also already been successfully evacuated, including great apes, monkeys, turtles, birds, alpacas and a lion, according to NPR. Many workers at zoos across Ukraine have chosen not to evacuate themselves to remain and care for their animal charges, who are often stressed and terrified from the sounds of shelling. Evacuating zoo animals can pose major challenges due to the size of some animals and the highly specific needs that different species have, and the logistics become even harder during a war, when normal routes become inaccessible and usually routine supplies are hard to get. Last week, a lion and wolf were evacuated from a zoo in southeast Ukraine, and had to be driven in the back of a van with no tranquilizers ― a dangerous situation for both the animals and the drivers. Animals remaining in zoos are at risk not only from bombs, but from running out of food due to a combination of shortages and their regular visitor revenue becoming nonexistent. At least one zoo has asked people around the world to help feed its animals by buying tickets online, even though a real-life visit is clearly off the table.",5.357423063599469,5.978579513252181,-0.6211564496527124,28

Well, it’s not just possible, it’s likely.” Carlson has made a habit of defending Putin, even after the Russian dictator made moves to invade Ukraine. Since the war began, Carlson has become a favorite for rebroadcasts on Russian propaganda channels for blaming President Joe Biden for the invasion, parroting Kremlin propaganda and spreading conspiracy theories justifying the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, a Mother Jones report revealed a leaked Kremlin memo that directed Russian state-sponsored media to use Carlson’s broadcasts “as much as possible” due to his criticism of the U.S. and NATO and defense of Putin. Carlson’s scaremongering comments were in response to a speech Biden made in Poland, where he said of Putin: “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” White House officials promptly clarified that the remark did not reflect a change in U.S. policy and that Biden was not advocating for regime change in Russia, but that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.” Other than Carlson, the off-script remark was also blasted by foreign policy experts who warned it was dangerous and would play into Putin’s narrative.

Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said the announcement is intended “to create conditions for further negotiations,” according to The Associated Press. The country has also now floated the possibility of a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, CNN reported. “If that was to be the case, it is another major concession to President Zelenskyy who has asked from the very beginning, even before the invasion, to have face-to-face talks with President Putin,” CNN’s Christiane Amanpour said. Any ceasefire can’t come soon enough for Ukrainian civilians, who have borne the brunt of Russia’s frustrated and stalled land offensive.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country hosted Tuesday’s talks, called on both sides to end the war. “Prolonging the conflict is not in anyone’s interest,” Erdogan said. Putin explained the reasons behind the war he described as a “special military operation” in Ukraine during a televised address to the Russian people on Feb. 24. “The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,” Putin said, according to an English translation of the speech by Bloomberg. “To this end, we will seek to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine.” The Kremlin has also wanted Russian to be the official second language in Ukraine. While the Financial Times reported Monday that those demands were not in the draft agreement prepared as part of the peace talks, Russia is still asking for Ukraine to stay out of the NATO alliance. Besides, Moscow is continuing to argue for Crimea — which it annexed in 2014 — and Luhansk and Donetsk — two territories held by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern region of Donbas — to be officially recognized as Russian. On Crimea, Ukrainian negotiators said Tuesday they could continue holding talks over a 15-year period, assuming both countries held off from using armed forces to address the issue. Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants a “compromise” in Donbas, according to Reuters, while Russia’s defense minister told military officials Tuesday the country had nearly completed the initial phase of its operation and was now turning its attention to the “main goal — the liberation of Donbas,” according to AP. Ukraine is asking for a cease-fire, security guarantees and that its sovereignty and territorial integrity stay intact, according to the BBC. While Ukraine has ruled out joining NATO, it still applied to join the European Union, something that Russia said it is open to allowing, according to the Financial Times. “Regarding NATO, I have cooled down regarding this question long ago after we understood that NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine,” Zelenskyy told ABC News on March 8, according to Insider. Zelenskyy confirmed he is open to neutrality in Ukraine, which would also mean the country would have to remain impartial in any future conflicts and no foreign military bases would be allowed on its territory. “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it,” Zelenskyy told Russian journalists Sunday, according to an English translation provided by Reuters. All other countries in Europe that are considered neutral, including Austria, Finland and Ireland, continue to have their own militaries to be able to fight back in case they are attacked, according to Vox. Still, Zelenskyy added that a cease-fire agreement would have to be reached before any deal, including a neutrality commitment, goes to a referendum. A “referendum is impossible when there is the presence of troops,” he said. Ukraine has also sought security guarantees from countries including Russia, the U.S., Germany and China, David Arakhamia, head of Zelenskyy’s party in Parliament and a member of Ukraine’s negotiating team, told the Financial Times. Those guarantees would work similarly to NATO’s Article 5 clause where countries are committed to support a member being attacked, Arakhamia explained. Even as Russia has signaled it is prepared to walk back some of its initial demands and deescalated part of its offensive, the West and Ukraine are not confident an imminent breakthrough is possible. U.S. President Joe Biden is holding talks over the phone with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and the U.K. to discuss the latest developments, according to the BBC. “Everything I have seen is [Putin] is not willing to compromise at this point,” an anonymous senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters Monday. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to Zelenskyy, told ABC News on Thursday that even though there was genuine engagement from Russia in the peace talks, it could still be months before any conclusion is reached. “They’re absolutely real negotiations,” Podolyak said. “There’s no attempt to stall for time. That’s definitely not there.” Previous talks held by delegations for the two countries in Belarus and virtually have failed to yield results.",3.3406541619449697,2.8288562557787746,0.511797906166195,15

Trump, who tried to overthrow American democracy in an attempt to retain power despite losing the 2020 election, is now asking Putin to find damaging information on his successor’s son. “I would think Putin would know the answer to that,” Trump said in an interview airing on Real America’s Voice, a pro-Trump website, regarding a payment a decade ago from a Russian oligarch’s wife to a company founded by Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden. “I think he should release it.” Trump’s staff did not respond to HuffPost’s queries about the matter. It’s been nearly six years since Trump called on Russia to “find” emails from then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump’s rival in the 2016 presidential election. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said at a July 27, 2016, news conference. Subsequent investigations determined that Russia did, in fact, honor Trump’s request, starting that same day. Putin’s intelligence services carried out a multifaceted effort to boost Trump’s campaign, including the theft of thousands of documents from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign advisers. Putin then began releasing the stolen material in the final month of the campaign through the allied WikiLeaks group, and Trump ― even though he had been told by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia had carried out the theft ― centered the last few weeks of his campaign on that material. “We love WikiLeaks!” he would proclaim from the stage. Trump, angry afterward that U.S. prosecutors were investigating his campaign’s links to Russia, seized on a new conspiracy theory being spread by Russian spies: that Ukraine had actually helped Clinton in 2016, and that a server containing her emails had been cached somewhere in that country. His obsession with that theory and Hunter Biden, who had used his father’s name and position as vice president to win consulting business in Ukraine in 2014 and 2015, ultimately led to Trump’s first impeachment, after he tried to extort that country’s new president into announcing an investigation into Joe Biden, whom Trump feared most as a 2020 challenger. Trump’s affinity for Putin, though, long predates even his 2016 presidential campaign. He repeatedly praised Putin for at least a decade as he tried to build a condominium tower in Moscow. In a 2007 letter, Trump told Putin he was “a big fan.” He continued to push his “Trump Tower Moscow” project even as he ran for president in 2015 and 2016, and publicly lauded Putin as a better leader than then-President Barack Obama. Once in the White House, Trump continually attacked NATO and the European Union ― actions that aligned with Putin’s long-term objectives of weakening or destroying both institutions. He falsely claimed that the military alliance created by the United States after World War II and the free-trade zone were somehow cheating American taxpayers. He mused about withdrawing from NATO entirely, and reportedly had intended to do so if he’d won a second term. Trump also kept praising and defending Putin, even telling the world in 2018 that he believed Putin over his own intelligence agencies regarding the dictator’s work to get Trump elected. A year later, he tried to have Russia readmitted to the G7 group of large democratic economies, from which it was expelled for invading and annexing Crimea in 2014. Trump said he understood Russia’s need to keep the Crimean Peninsula because it had built a base there for its “large and powerful submarines.” Even on the day Putin sent his armies into Ukraine last month, Trump called him a “genius” and “very savvy” for having invaded. Since then, as images and stories of Putin’s slaughter have emerged, Trump has criticized the invasion, but still has not been critical of Putin personally. After losing the 2020 election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, Trump became the first U.S. president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol, a last-ditch attempt to remain in office, killed five people, including one police officer. That day’s violence also injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides. Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.",5.388353037622188,5.360835181647449,0.027517855974739547,12

Biden said Russia’s use of such weapons would trigger a “significant response.” Doocy replied: “What does that mean?” “I’m not going to tell you,” Biden answered. “Why would I tell you? You got to be silly.” “The world wants to know?” Doocy offered. “The world wants to know a lot of things,” Biden retorted. “I’m not telling what the response would be, then Russia knows the response.” Doocy: When you said that chemical weapon use by Russia would trigger a response in kindBiden: It will trigger a significant responseDoocy: What does that mean?Biden: I’m not going to tell you. Why would I tell you?  NATO’s deputy secretary-general, Mircea Geoană, said last week that if If Russia employs chemical or nuclear weapons in its military assault on Ukraine, the defense alliance would be “forced to take appropriate measures.” Like Biden, he refused to provide specifics. Doocy has clashed frequently with White House press secretary Jen Psaki. Biden referred to the journalist as a “stupid son of a bitch” on a hot mic at the White House earlier this year. But the president later called Doocy to apologize. “It’s nothing personal, pal,” Biden told him, according to the reporter.",3.7169145976133344,3.773711654010347,-0.05679705639701238,25

The comments were part of a sweeping, 90-minute interview Zelenskyy gave to several Russian journalists on Sunday, the first time he’s spoken at length to Russian journalists in their own language since the war began. However, the Kremlin warned Russian media outlets not to publish the interview as part of a broader effort to censor what information Russians are able to receive about the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Details from the call were published by Russian journalists living outside Russia. “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it,” Zelenskyy said, per a translation from Reuters. “This is the most important point.” Ukrainians would have to vote on the compromise, which would bar the country from joining NATO, a long-sought goal that Zelenskyy admitted was unlikely to happen. A vote on an official neutrality stance could only take place during a ceasefire, he said, as a “referendum is impossible when there is the presence of troops.” A new round of peace talks are set to begin this week in Turkey. Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to have shifted tack as his invasion of Ukraine drags on far longer than anticipated, stymied by a fierce Ukrainian resistance. Ukrainian military officials have said they worry the Kremlin may now be focused on dividing Ukraine into occupied and unoccupied territories. Zelenskyy said Putin’s attempt to revert to an era of the past had instead driven the countries further apart. He pointed to the ongoing barrage in Mariupol, which he said had left the city “littered with corpses.” “A humanitarian catastrophe inside the city is unequivocal, because it is impossible to go there with food, medicine and water,” he said of Mariupol. “This is not simply a war, this is much worse,” Zelenskyy added. “A global, historical, cultural split has happened over this month.” Zelenskyy’s comments came more than a month after the invasion began and just days after he called for worldwide demonstrations to show support for Ukraine. “It breaks my heart, hearts of all Ukrainians and every free person on the planet. That’s why I ask you to stand against the war,” Zelenskyy said in a message posted to social media. “…Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities, come in the name of peace, come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.”",3.376121398984578,2.8083492515175017,0.5677721474670765,3

Speaking in Poland at the end of his four-day trip to Europe on Sunday, Biden said of Putin, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” The line came at the end of a 27-minute speech and was ad-libbed by a president famous for doing so. Biden’s prepared remarks in the State Dining Room, his first public appearance since the speech in Warsaw Saturday, were about his budget proposal he is sending lawmakers for the fiscal year that starts in October, but most of the questions from the two dozen reporters assembled before him were about his ad-libbed comment. White House officials on Saturday almost immediately afterward sent out a clarification that the sentence did not reflect a change in U.S. policy, and that Biden was not advocating “regime change” in Russia: “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.” Biden, though, on Monday insisted that and similar explanations did not constitute a “walk back,” and that he was reacting as anyone would after meeting with the victims of Putin’s assault on civilians, including children, in Ukraine. “This is just stating a simple fact that this kind of behavior is totally unacceptable. Totally unacceptable,” he said. “I wasn’t articulating a policy change,” he added. “I think that he continues on this course that he is on, he is going to become a pariah worldwide, and who knows what he becomes at home, in terms of support.” Biden said he had no interest in escalating a conflict with a nuclear armed power, but was expressing a view shared by many. “People like this shouldn’t be ruling countries, but they do,” he said. He also said he was not at all worried that what he said would escalate the conflict or weaken NATO. “NATO has never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been as strong as it is today,” he said. “Never.”",3.582493671194932,4.048262986666953,-0.46576931547202083,25

Sources told The Wall Street Journal that members of the group developed red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands soon after their March 3 meeting. The report was corroborated by the investigative journalism website Bellingcat, which added that the symptoms subsided over the next week and their lives are not in danger. Chemical weapons experts told Bellingcat that, based on the likely toxin and dosage used, the act was intended to intimidate the victims instead of cause permanent harm. A source with direct knowledge of the matter told The Guardian that Abramovich lost his sight “for several hours” and required treatment in Turkey. A source with direct knowledge has just confirmed to me the WSJ/Bellingcat reports that Abramovich suffered symptoms of poisoning. ""Roman lost his sight for several hours"" and was treated in Turkey, the source said. Abramovich’s camp told the Journal it’s unclear who may have targeted the group. BBC also confirmed the reports, and noted that Abramovich traveled between Moscow and Kyiv for “several rounds of talks” at the start of the month. Ukrainian negotiators were unwilling to confirm the incident.

Following a performance by Reba McEntire that was introduced by Ukraine-born actor Mila Kunis, who mentioned feeling “gutted” by recent global events, a message appeared on screen. “We’d like to have a moment of silence to show our support for the people of Ukraine currently facing invasion, conflict and prejudice within their own borders,” the screen read. “While film is an important avenue for us to express our humanity in times of conflict, the reality is millions of families in Ukraine need food, medical care, clean water, and emergency services. Resources are scarce, and we — collectively as a global community — can do more.” The 30-second clip ended with a call to all those watching around the world: “We ask you to support Ukraine in any way you are able. #StandWithUkraine.” #Oscars holds moment of silence in support of Ukraine.  Ahead of the 94th annual ceremony, there were rumors that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would make a surprise virtual appearance during the show to urge celebrities and artists to speak up in solidarity with his country. Zelenskyy’s aides reportedly lobbied the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to show some form of support, according to The New York Times, with Kunis helping to coordinate the Ukrainian government’s outreach. Zelenskyy has long held ties to the entertainment industry. Before he was elected Ukraine’s president, he worked as an actor and comedian, starring for years in the satirical comedy series “Servant of the People,” which is now available to stream on Netflix. He also appeared as a contestant in the Ukrainian version of “Dancing with the Stars” and voiced the role of Paddington Bear in the 2014 film, among other past credits. Amy Schumer, who is co-hosting the ceremony with Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall, was the first to publicly mention the idea of Zelenskyy appearing at the event, but the academy had stayed mum on whether he’d been invited. “I wanted to find a way to have Zelenskyy satellite in or make a tape or something, just because there are so many eyes on the Oscars,” Schumer said on “The Drew Barrymore Show” earlier this month. “I think it’s a great opportunity to at least comment on a couple of things. I have some jokes that kind of highlight the sort of current condition.” Amid the speculation that producers nixed Schumer’s idea, Sean Penn, one of Hollywood’s most vocal Ukraine supporters, threatened to smelt his own Oscar trophy in protest. “If it turns out to be what is happening, I would encourage everyone involved — though it may be their moment, and I understand that, to celebrate their films — it is so much more importantly their moment to shine, and to protest and to boycott that Academy Awards,” Penn, who was on the ground during the early days of Ukraine’s invasion, told CNN’s Jim Acosta in an interview this week. The entertainment industry has come out in full force to show support for Ukraine. A slew of stars, including Jamie Lee Curtis and Jason Momoa, sported blue ribbons on the red carpet provided by the United Nations refugee agency. In recent months, many celebrities have publicly condemned Russia’s actions and raised funds for refugees fleeing the country. Perhaps most notably, Kunis, who was born in Ukraine before moving to the United States as a child, and her husband, Ashton Kutcher, raised nearly $35 million through a GoFundMe campaign for refugee and humanitarian aid efforts. The couple spoke with Zelenskyy over a video call earlier this month with the president thanking them directly for their efforts to secure aid in the war-torn nation.",4.353030632034718,3.95265750057105,0.4003731314636685,3

When Oksana Markarova appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union,” host Dana Bash said Russian military officials seemed to be signaling a potential change in strategy. What was once an invasion meant to seize the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv has instead shifted to focus on Crimea and the separatist-controlled Donetsk and Luhansk regions of the Donbas, according to Moscow. “First, we can always count on Russia lying,” Markarova said. “They lied before the war that they will not start the war. They lied in 2014 that they did not attack us when they illegally occupied Crimea and Donetsk and Luhansk. And they are lying during the past 33 days about not attacking civilians, about not besieging Mariupol and killing people there, about not kidnapping people and taking them into Russia.” “I think the signals that we hear from Russia merely comes from the fact that they were not able to do anything that they have planned to achieve — either blitzkrieg, taking over Kyiv,” she added. “We can always count on Russia lying.”Ukrainian ambassador to the US @OMarkarova tells @DanaBashCNN that Ukraine is ready to negotiate a peace agreement with Russia, but the country is not willing to give up territory and leave it under Russian occupation. #CNNSOTU  Bash asked the ambassador if there were any circumstances under which Ukraine would give up regions like Crimea or the Donbas in order to reach a peace agreement with Russia — a possibility that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has so far rejected. Chuck Todd, the host of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” asked Markarova similar questions on Sunday as well. “I don’t even think we should be asking Ukraine what we are ready to give up. We are fighting for our country,” Markarova told CNN. “The territorial integrity and sovereignty of any country is enshrined not only in the statehood of [the United Nations], but should be enshrined in every heart and mind of anyone who believes in democracy.” The ambassador went on to give some historical context for the country’s resistance to giving up land. “So, after this brutal aggression, we, of course, are ready to negotiate. And we are negotiating the humanitarian corridors. And we are ready to negotiate a peace agreement, but the peace agreement should include them leaving our territory, all of it,” she said. “And no, we are not ready to give up on some of our people or some of our territories and leave it under occupation. Because occupation, as we see now, as we saw in 1932 during the Holodomor, as we saw in previous times when Russia occupied us — occupation for Ukrainians mean extermination of us.”",3.611547945959638,3.0860986493668765,0.5254492965927615,3

Yes, Putin was smart,” Trump said at a rally in Commerce, Georgia, before adding that he was surprised by Putin’s decision to start a war. “I actually thought he was going to be negotiating. I said, that’s a hell of a way to negotiate ― put 200,000 soldiers on the border,” he said. “I think he made a big mistake, what he’s done to so many people. Boy, that was a big mistake. But it looked like a great negotiation, that didn’t work out too well for him.” Trump is back to saying Putin is smart. He says he thinks Putin made a mistake but then describes it as a “great negotiation that didn’t go so well for him”  Though Trump called Russia’s invasion a mistake, he has not condemned Putin as a leader. Earlier this month, Trump called Putin a “genius” for invading parts of Ukraine after declaring those regions to be independent. In a subsequent interview with Fox News, Trump declined to call Putin “evil” when confronted about those remarks. An estimated 2,570 civilians have been recorded as killed or wounded since the start of Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, according to a recent tally by the United Nations, which said the actual count is likely considerably higher. The U.N.’s tally includes more than 80 dead children. NATO this week also estimated that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have died from fighting. Trump on Saturday also called Chinese leader Xi Jinping “smart.” “He runs 1.5 billion people with an iron fist. Yeah, I think he’s pretty smart. And they have a chain over there. If you’re a dummy, you get left here,” he said, gesturing low. “It’s like a pyramid. The smartest one gets to the top. That didn’t work so well recently in our country.” Trump, who repeated his false claims of “massive voter” fraud during the 2020 election, also predicted that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan will “be next.” “I would say that that’s a very good possibility that he will invade Taiwan, because he doesn’t respect the United States of America any longer and he had a lot of respect for us a year and a half ago,” he said.",3.7424198447681345,3.4379800613753253,0.3044397833928092,24

That’s just not what he does,” Bolton added. Bolton spoke to the newspaper as it examined Trump’s boasts that the Russian invasion of Ukraine would not have happened on his watch — in part because of his claimed excellent relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Early on, Trump called Putin’s Ukraine invasion “genius.” If the invasion had occurred while he was president, he could have ended it, Trump has also claimed. The former president said last week he would use U.S. nuclear submarines to threaten Russia, which many observers viewed as dangerously provocative, especially since Putin has already indicated he’s ready to use nuclear weapons. Bolton had said earlier that Trump in fact helped set the stage for the invasion. His repeated flattery of Putin and his weakening of America’s relationship with Europe emboldened the Russian leader, while Trump’s “contempt” for Ukraine and his baseless claims that its government was corrupt weakened that nation’s standing. “I think all contributed to a precarious status for Ukraine, which would have continued in a second term,” for Trump, Bolton told The Palm Beach Post. In 2019, Trump froze military aid to Ukraine authorized by Congress that he then tried to use as an enticement to convince Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to launch an investigation into Trump’s rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The action led to Trump’s first impeachment. The aid stall was far more serious for Ukraine than many realized at the time, according to Bolton. “The urgency of the particular $250 million was that it was appropriated money that under the federal government’s bizarre budget procedures would have expired on Sept. 30, 2019,” Bolton recounted to the newspaper. He also said that Ukraine wasn’t the only nation that faced increased security risks in the Trump administration. Bolton believed Trump’s objective was to “withdraw the U.S. from NATO or substantially limit” Washington’s support for the defense alliance. That’s what Putin was “waiting for” in a second Trump term, Bolton told The Washington Post early this month.

If Russia uses “chemical weapons or other kinds of higher-end systems against Ukraine, this will be changing fundamentally the nature of the war that Mr. Putin has waged against Ukraine.” The fear of Russia’s use of far more horrifying weapons has increased as Vladimir Putin fumes over an operation he thought would be successfully completed quickly. “Mr. Putin probably believed his own post-imperial fantasies, thinking that Ukrainians will welcome them with open arms,” Geoană said. “In fact, they got very fierce resistance. We are convinced that today, even with reinforcements that are still coming into Ukraine, Russia does not possess the forces and the capacity to occupy the whole of Ukraine,” he added. Until there is some resolution, “we hope that Mr. Putin will not go even further down the road of war crimes, and even more devastation against a sovereign nation,” said Geoană.",2.8835445059274707,3.4605423027273243,-0.5769977967998536,15

Griner, who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, was arrested in mid-February by Russian authorities who claimed she was carrying vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage at an airport. She had been in Russia playing for a team there, a common practice for WNBA players due to the higher pay. But Griner’s detention did not make the news in the United States until March, after Russian customs officials and news outlets publicized the arrest. The fact that Griner’s initial arrest seemingly went unnoticed ― and the relative quiet of the U.S. media and the WNBA even after the news broke ― has drawn criticism, notably a New York Magazine story asking, “Why Isn’t Brittney Griner the Biggest Sports Story in the Country?” Russia announced the arrest about a week and a half into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, prompting speculation that officials hoped to use Griner for leverage with the U.S. Leslie’s comments suggested that people closer to the situation shared that concern, though she didn’t say exactly where the instruction to not make a “fuss” came from. “I won’t say who said that, but it’s kind of what’s been spreading throughout the women’s basketball world,” she said. She added that those who care about Griner struggled with whether keeping quiet was actually the right thing to do. “It’s heartbreaking, for all of us,” she said. Griner remains incarcerated in Russia. An official from the U.S. Embassy who was allowed to see her said she was in “good condition,” the U.S. State Department said earlier this week. The WNBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost about Leslie’s comments. The organization said in a statement earlier this month that it was working “diligently” to get Griner home.",5.948425477045408,5.712350570346629,0.23607490669877862,0

It is absolutely horrific what has happened to them,” said Ingraham, before asking guest Todd Bensman: “But is bringing them all the way to the United States in their best interest? And what about the U.S. taxpayers?” Bensman, a senior national security fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies ― a far-right anti-immigrant group that’s known for its ties to white nationalists ― suggested the refugees would be better off staying in Europe where they have been offered three-year residencies with associated health care, rights to work and housing. “So there’s really no reason whatsoever for Ukrainians to be coming to our border or for us to be bringing in huge swells, numbers of Ukrainians here,” he argued. “They’re doing great for a group of war refugees.” “The issue is that they are not asylum-seekers,” Bensman added. “They have asylum, right in their own neighborhood, so it’s a little bit disingenuous.” “Then that makes more sense. OK,” Ingraham agreed. More than 3.5 million refugees have now fled Russia’s invasion. More than half of Ukraine’s 7.5 million children have been displaced by the conflict.

Putin likened the world’s condemnation of Russia to the backlash that “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling received for controversial comments about the transgender community. Rowling was “canceled,” Putin said, “just because she didn’t satisfy the demands of gender rights,” according to an interpreter’s translation. “They’re now trying to cancel our country,” he continued. “I’m talking about the progressive discrimination of everything to do with Russia — this trend that is unfolding in a number of Western states.” He added: “They’re now engaging in cancel culture.” Rowling responded in a tweet rejecting Putin’s comparison. “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics,” she wrote. She added an “IStandWithUkraine” hashtag and linked to an article about prominent Putin critic Alexei Navalny being imprisoned.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was ripped for missing some crucial context as he tried to attack his onetime good friend, President Joe Biden, on Thursday. Biden, speaking at an emergency summit of NATO leaders about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, explained how he’d been inspired to run for the White House following former President Donald Trump’s “both sides” comment after the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Graham fired back on Twitter: “As Ukraine burns, President Biden is talking about Charlottesville and domestic politics. Very sad.” As Ukraine burns, President Biden is talking about Charlottesville and domestic politics. Very sad. Critics pointed out how Biden was only responding to a journalist’s question about European concerns that the world’s coordinated response against Russia could be undone if Trump won the 2024 election. Others pointed out Graham’s own wild tangents and Trump’s habit of turning every press conference into a diatribe against his enemies. As Ukraine burns, Republicans are talking about CRT and reversing court decisions legalizing interracial marriage. Very sad. Still the loyal lapdog. Very sad.

The Americans indicated the emotional moment was likely a sign of a broader upheaval and poor morale in Russia over the military operation in Ukraine. Maj. Gen. Yevgeny Ilyin, deputy chief of the main directorate of international cooperation, became upset in a rare meeting late last month with Americans at the Russian ministry of defense in Moscow, CNN reported. A U.S. defense attaché inquired about Ilyin’s Ukrainian family roots just as the meeting was breaking up, according to a U.S. summary of the meeting obtained by CNN. The typically “stoic” Ilyin became “flushed and agitated,” according to the U.S. account of the meeting. He said he was born in Dnipropetrovsk and then moved with his family to Donetsk, where he went to school. Both cities are in Ukraine. He then called the situation in Ukraine “tragic and I am very depressed over it” — then exited the room without shaking anyone’s hand, according to the account, CNN reported. What specifically Ilyin was reacting to, as well as the circumstances of the meeting and other details, could not immediately be determined, according to CNN. “At the very least,” noted the American account, “it is clear that morale problems among Russian forces are not limited to front-line troops,” the summary concluded.

Earlier on Thursday, Russia’s Defense Ministry released a colorful diagram that claims to prove that President Joe Biden’s son was involved in funding a secret U.S. bioweapons plot in Ukraine. Several commentators predicted the claim would end up on Fox News, where Hunter Biden theories are ever-popular. Julia Davis, a columnist for The Daily Beast who monitors Russian media, suggested it was crafted with hopes of getting a Fox News feature. If you thought Russian propaganda was ever “sophisticated,” I hate to break it to you: it was always quite stupid. Still is. Here is their latest gem: Hunter Biden funded bio-labs in Ukraine. Handcrafted for Fox News.  Hours later, it got its shoutout. Citing a report in the right-wing website National Pulse, Carlson said, ”Apparently a private equity firm run by Hunter Biden funded some of the research into pathogens in these biolabs.” “What are the outlines of that story? We’re not sure,” he continued. “We know it’s legitimate to ask what it means, why wouldn’t it be? You’re not a Russian agent repeating discredited Putin talking points if you ask. You’re a good citizen.” Tucker Carlson cites reporting by The National Pulse saying that a private equity firm run by Hunter Biden funded some of the research in Ukrainian biolabs.  Russia’s baseless claims about American biological warfare labs in Ukraine have taken root in U.S. right-wing networks in recent weeks. Despite repeated debunking from U.S. officials, Carlson has devoted considerable airtime to promoting the conspiracy theory, appearing to side with the Kremlin over the U.S. government.

President Joe Biden joined European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday to announce a new plan under which the U.S. and other countries will increase shipments of liquified natural gas to Europe by at least 15 billion cubic meters in 2022, with further increases in years to come. “We want as Europeans to diversify away from Russia towards suppliers that we trust, that are friends and that are reliable,” von der Leyen said during a joint news conference in Brussels. However, Europe remains reliant on Russian energy and can’t cut it off overnight. Last year, Russia provided 8% of all U.S. petroleum imports, including 3% of crude oil imports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. has not imported any natural gas from Russia since 2019, according to Forbes. The U.S. banned imports of Russian oil and gas earlier this month. “The United States produces far more oil domestically than all of Europe,” Biden said when he announced the ban, according to NBC News. “We can take this step when others cannot.” The European Union relies on Russia for 40% of its gas, 27% of its oil imports and 46% of coal imports, according to Reuters. “We are much more dependent in Europe in comparison to the situation in the United States,” Charles Michel, president of the European Council, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday. “It’s why we must be intelligent. The goal is to target Russia, the goal is to be painful against Russia. The goal is not to be painful for ourselves.” Exclusive: @eucopresident Charles Michel says that on sanctions, the EU's situation differs from the US.Europe is much more dependent on Russian gas, ""that's why we must be intelligent... The goal is to be painful against Russia. The goal is not to be painful for ourselves.""  Russia’s energy relationship with Europe traces back to the Cold War, explained Pierre Noël, global research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. Natural gas from the Soviet Union helped Western Europe move away from oil products after the oil shocks of the 1970s. In 1981, then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan imposed sanctions effectively banning American companies from participating in development of a gas pipeline from Siberia to Germany. But Reagan lifted the sanctions a year later following fierce opposition from the gas and oil industry, according to The New York Times. Years later, in the early 2000s, some European countries were growing increasingly wary of dependence on Russian energy as Putin first came to power and Europe’s political relationship with the country changed. “However, Russia was always a very reliable supplier and adapted its commercial terms to the changing European market, ensuring the competitiveness of its gas,” Noël said. Besides, some European powers like Germany and France wanted to maintain a relationship with Russia, and deemed energy an area where cooperation had proven successful, Noël added. E.U. countries are worried that further pressure on Russia could cause vast damage to the global economy. Germany — Europe’s biggest economy and the world’s fourth-largest — relies on Russia for more than half of its gas and a third of its oil, according to the London School of Economics. Stopping Russian energy supplies could prove risky. “Economic damage would be considerable,” Christian Egenhofer, an associate senior research fellow at the think tank Center for European Policy Studies, told HuffPost. “Should we weaken our economies is one question. The other is whether we should keep more sanctions ready, for in case Russia uses chemical weapons or more brutality towards civilian targets.” In the meantime, it is unclear how much financial pressure the E.U. is willing to tolerate to punish Russia. “I think it’s important for us at the European Union level to protect our economic strength, our economic power,” the E.U.’s Michel told CNN. “This is the key condition in order to support Ukraine and to take painful measures against Russia.” Worldwide prices of gas and oil reached record highs after Russia invaded Ukraine. Soaring costs also may affect other industries, warned Anne-Sophie Corbeau, global research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. “High gas prices also mean high power prices,” Corbeau told HuffPost. “That could have a serious impact on our industries. That can also have a disastrous impact on fertilizer production and therefore food production, which can compound a potential food crisis.” Biden has accused Putin of using his country’s energy supplies to “coerce and manipulate his neighbors” and “drive his war machine.” ""We're coming together to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian energy""US President Joe Biden outlines major deal between US and EU on liquified natural gas which will attempt to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy  Putin has already shown he is willing to exploit this reliance by announcing Wednesday that payments for Russian gas will have to be made in rubles for “unfriendly countries.” That could prove even more complicated for Europeans, who must balance their dependence on Russia with their condemnation of a war that has forced over 3.7 million Ukrainians to flee their country. “I suppose people will first look at their contracts and demand that the contracts be respected,” Noël said of Russia’s European customers. “However, there is no appetite in Europe for a sharp aggravation of the energy crisis, and therefore governments would likely ask European companies to comply, forcing them to procure the Russian currency.”",4.772453363635544,3.953238220181808,0.8192151434537362,14

The war, which began on Feb. 24 when Russian troops invaded Ukraine, has stretched far longer than Putin or military analysts anticipated, with a fierce Ukrainian resistance holding off the Russian military in Kyiv and other cities. Earlier this week, NATO said that as many as 15,000 Russians had been killed in the conflict and up to 25,000 more injured. Ukraine has claimed that figure includes six Russian generals; the Kremlin has acknowledged just one of those generals’ deaths. At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin has upped his military’s assault on civilian targets, bombing Ukrainian cities while peace talks make little ground. The U.S. has said those attacks amount to war crimes, and pointed to the shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Figures show at least 2,500 Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the war, although the actual number of fatalities is likely far higher. Zelenskyy has become a national hero through his leadership during the invasion, wielding social media to rally Ukrainians and appeal for aid and military support from Europe, Asia and the United States. But fears have grown that Putin, angered at the stalled effort, could turn to the country’s vast arsenal of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in order to shift the tide of battle. President Joe Biden is in Europe this week for a summit with NATO allies and the European Union to hash out new sanctions against Russia and discuss further military aid. According to The New York Times, the White House has also quietly assembled a team of national security officials to sketch out how it will respond if Putin turns towards weapons of mass destruction. In his video address Thursday, Zelenskyy urged people all over the world to recognize the Kremlin’s assault against Ukraine as not just a war against his people, but a “war against freedom as it is.” “Make yourselves visible and heard,” he said. “Say that people matter, freedom matters, peace matters, Ukraine matters.

Gen. James Marks put the blame for Russia’s faltering invasion of Ukraine firmly on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his excessive pride. Marks, now a military analyst for CNN, said Wednesday that Putin likely thought the invasion would be a 48-hour “cakewalk” with cities across Ukraine falling quickly to his troops. The war is now in its fourth week, with the United Nations estimating that some 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops have been killed. “I mean, that’s hubris,” Marks told anchor Pamela Brown. “That’s a misunderstanding, a strategic miscalculation that’s incredibly huge. And Putin is in the intel business and he totally blew it. I mean, that’s phenomenal.” Russian forces were ill-prepared for the assault on their neighboring country as a direct result of Putin’s arrogance, Marks continued. “They thought they would … get into Kyiv and they’d immediately be welcomed and they’d have an opportunity to be replenished in (a) short amount of time. That has been totally exposed,” he explained.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine the following day. Amid fierce Ukrainian resistance, up to 15,000 Russian troops are reported to have been killed to date. NATO allies have firmly denounced Putin’s aggression and economic sanctions imposed by the West are choking Russia’s economy. Albright wrote of meeting Putin in 2000, when the then-acting Russian president “spoke unemotionally” about “his determination to resurrect Russia’s economy.” In notes she recorded at the time, Albright described Putin as “small and pale” and “so cold as to be almost reptilian.” He “claimed to understand why the Berlin Wall had to fall but had not expected the whole Soviet Union to collapse,” she added. “Putin is embarrassed by what happened to his country and determined to restore its greatness.” Read Albright’s final op-ed for The New York Times here.",3.074652622994511,2.9483714593066543,0.1262811636878567,15

Biden made the announcement at a Brussels news conference following high-level meetings with U.S. allies. The president has focused on maintaining a united Western front against Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling that Putin should not test whether the NATO military alliance will defend member countries that were once within Moscow’s sphere of influence. “NATO has never, never been more united than it is today. Putin is getting the opposite of what he wanted,” Biden said. Some of Biden’s new measures will target 328 members of Russia’s parliament, several prominent Russian businesspeople and 48 firms that produce military equipment for Russian forces. The president is also setting up a coordinated effort with the governments of Japan, Britain, Canada and various European nations ― hoping to make it harder for Russia to work with countries like China, India and the United Arab Emirates to dodge the unprecedented sanctions that the U.S. and its allies have imposed on much of the Russian financial system. “We will sustain what we’re doing ... that’s what will stop him,” Biden said. The president and his counterparts are particularly focused on pushing China to oppose Russia’s intervention, a senior administration official told reporters in a call earlier in the day. Putin has relied on tacit support from Beijing so far, and experts believe he hopes for more help. Asked about his message to Chinese leadership, Biden said: “I think that China understands that its economic future is much more tied to the West than it is to Russia.” U.S. administration officials hope that the combination of financial pain and military pressure ― through ongoing NATO support for Ukrainian forces ― will convince Putin to cut a deal and pause his assault. The president has repeatedly said he does not want to see a broader war between Russia and U.S. partners, and that he will not deploy American forces to fight the Russians. The strategy relies on maintaining some room for diplomacy. Earlier in the month, the White House shelved a plan to sanction Roman Abramovich, one of Russia’s richest men, because Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Biden that the businessman could be a useful go-between in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. “This isn't something Poland or Romania or Germany should carry on their own. This is an international responsibility.” Still, Biden suggested the U.S. was willing to further toughen its approach in response to any Russian escalation. National security officials are worried that Putin may deploy chemical weapons, which the president addressed. “The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,” he told reporters. And Biden said he would like to see Russia excluded from the G-20 global economic forum ― a step that would need to be approved by G-20 members China and Saudi Arabia, who are wary of angering Russia. The president also announced $1 billion in additional humanitarian aid for Ukraine and neighboring countries hurt by the assault. The U.S. will accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, he added, focusing on people who have family members stateside. Congress recently approved more than $4 billion in assistance for Ukraine. After lengthy consultations on Thursday and a public show of solidarity, Biden is expected to travel to Poland, which borders Ukraine, on Friday. Poland is hosting millions of Ukrainians displaced by the fighting, and is the key entry point for Western reinforcements for Ukraine’s defense like missiles, ammunition and defensive gear. “This isn’t something Poland or Romania or Germany should carry on their own,” the president said Thursday. “This is an international responsibility.” Biden said he hopes to meet with refugees in Poland, but said for security reasons that he would not yet reveal where or how that would take place.",2.885707764392207,2.574583723110264,0.3111240412819427,25

The G-20 brings together the world’s largest economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and the European Union ― which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urgently seeking to join without success. The next meeting to discuss economic and trade issues affecting the group is scheduled to take place this October in Bali, Indonesia, focusing on the theme “Recover Together, Recover Stronger.” Russia’s ambassador to Indonesia, Lyudmila Vorobieva, said Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to attend. Vorobieva claimed that the “reaction of the West” to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine “is absolutely disproportional.” Russia is facing a wide variety of sanctions both from Western governments and private companies ― the scale of which is believed to have come as a shock to Putin. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov admitted this week that the Kremlin did not predict the extent of the sanctions. Responding to a reporter’s claim that, despite all the sanctions, the West has still not managed to “deter” Putin’s aggression, Biden said the reporter was missing the point. “The maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain ... that’s what will stop him,” Biden said, urging NATO countries and G-7 allies to remain united against Russia.",2.9113430852020383,3.8037831415431147,-0.8924400563410764,25

The indictments have been under seal since mid-2021 but were made public to bolster growing concerns that Russia may unleash cyberattacks against the U.S., Europe and other nations that have opposed its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. In one indictment from August 2021, Justice Department officials said three hackers from Russia’s federal security service (FSB), the Kremlin’s spy agency, worked to target and compromise the energy sector so it could “disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future time of its choosing.” The hacking took place between 2012 and 2017, and targeted “thousands of computers, at hundreds of companies and organizations, in approximately 135 countries,” officials alleged. A second indictment from June 2021 homed in on an employee of Russia’s ministry of defense and his co-conspirators, alleging Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh hacked a multinational energy company in 2017. Officials said the hackers installed malware that interfered with a refinery’s safety systems. Gladkikh spent six months in 2018 researching how he could deploy a similar effort at U.S. refineries. Today, @TheJusticeDept unsealed charges against four Russian government actors for their roles in separate malicious #cyber campaigns targeting the U.S. energy sector. “Russian state-sponsored hackers pose a serious and persistent threat to critical infrastructure both in the United States and around the world,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. “Although the criminal charges unsealed today reflect past activity, they make crystal clear the urgent ongoing need for American businesses to harden their defenses and remain vigilant.” The four Russians are not in U.S. custody, but a Justice Department official told The Guardian that the “benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future.” Russia does not extradite defendants to the United States, so the citizens will likely not be brought to trial. President Joe Biden has warned about the growing potential for Russian cyberattacks in recent days, saying he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon turn to such tactics. “The more Putin’s back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ … one of the tools he’s most likely to use, in my view, in our view, is cyberattacks,” Biden told reporters on Monday. “The magnitude of Russia’s cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it’s coming.”",4.356689738653865,4.078134400462202,0.278555338191663,5

Biden said in a statement Monday that his administration “can’t defend against this threat alone” and cited recommendations for private businesses and leaders in critical infrastructure to follow. But individual Americans can also do their part. “State-sponsored cyberattacks aren’t usually financially motivated; instead, they aim to be more disruptive to institutions,” said Stephanie Carruthers, a white hat hacker who is chief people hacker at IBM’s X-Force Red. “As we see cyber increasingly become a powerful tool used in warfare, consumers can do their part to avoid getting caught in the digital crossfire or becoming an attacker’s entry point into an organization’s network.” Here are some of the most important recommendations from real-life hackers and other cybersecurity experts: The Biden administration is urging companies to mandate the use of multifactor authentication on their systems, and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency includes it among their top four recommendations for individuals right now, too. This can include turning on two-step verification for your Google accounts and Gmail, social media platforms like Facebook, your Social Security account, and banking and credit card websites. Multifactor authentication “essentially requires a second form of authentication by the consumer to protect their account in the event a password has been compromised,” Carruthers explained. Kevin Johnson, CEO of the consultancy Secure Ideas and a hacker hired by companies to test their own security vulnerabilities, said using multifactor authentication everywhere you possibly can is one of the easiest and most important things people can do to protect themselves against cyberattacks. “[Hackers] find the weakest link, and the weakest link are people,” he said, adding, “Any place that you’re not using MFA, if an attackers gains access to your account there, they can leverage that access against you further. If I get access to your email, I have access to everything.” If MFA isn’t possible, there may be other fallbacks that essentially do the same thing. “Biometric authentication forms are also a safer backup option: Using a fingerprint or Face ID is tougher for a cybercriminal to get around,” Carruthers said. Passwords are everywhere, and they are the gateway into your bank account, emails, employer or organizational information, and more. Once a cybercriminal figures out one password, it will open the door to others. “Consumers need to do a better job of updating their passwords regularly, choosing long and unique passwords for each account, and realizing that using their dog’s name and their birth year for a password combination is a poor and risky choice that can easily be guessed,” Carruthers said. Johnson warned that even when a system’s password complexity requirements seem strong, they are not that strong against hackers. Just because your credit card website requires your password to have a capital letter, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols, for example, doesn’t mean your choice is actually strong or secure. CISA recommends that you go above simply using a complex password and get a password manager, which can both generate and safely store legitimately complex passwords while you only have to remember one master password. One of CISA’s top recommendations for individual-level protection against Russian cyberattacks is to update software and apps and turn on automatic updates so they stay current. “Bad actors will exploit flaws in the system. Update the operating system on your mobile phones, tablets and laptops,” CISA recommends. “And update your applications –– especially the web browsers — on all your devices, too.” The fact that your laptop or phone is operating just fine on outdated software does not mean it is operating securely. Johnson said when he encounters people who have the mentality of “‘This is how we’ve always done it,’ ... I know that i’m going to have an easy time [hacking them].” CISA estimates that more than 90% of successful cyberattacks start with a phishing email, in which “a link or webpage looks legitimate, but it’s a trick designed by bad actors to have you reveal your passwords, Social Security number, credit card numbers or other sensitive information.” Carruthers said one telltale sign of a phishing scam is receiving odd requests from a work colleague or your company’s upper management. “CFOs and HR departments are very often impersonated by cybercriminals to invoke a certain action from an employee,” she said. The level of urgency or presence of emotional stressors is also a subtle tip-off. “Is the email, text or voicemail you received evoking a sense of urgency, panic or fear?” Carruthers said. That’s a sign. When in doubt, don’t click, and directly contact the person or organization to find out if the request is legitimate. Nick Santora, CEO of the security awareness training platform Curricula, said people fall prey to the mentality of thinking cyberattacks won’t happen to them, but phishing scams “happen every day to countless numbers of victims.” “Anyone can pretend to be someone they’re not on the other end of the phone or other side of the screen,” Santora said. “Confidence is king, and that’s why hackers are successful in this approach targeting the most vulnerable population, such as the elderly.” Just because someone says they are a trusted individual hired by a legitimate organization doesn’t mean they are. Johnson shared an example of when he was hired by a bank to test its physical security. Only one employee called him out and asked why he was present at the bank’s data center. Johnson complimented her for catching him and said that he was hired by the company to run a security test. He told her to keep his presence a secret for the sake of the test, and she did so. “She didn’t ask for any proof, she got my business card.... That’s the only verification she did,” Johnson said. ”All I did was switch the script on her, and she didn’t stop to think about it.” His example underscores why you should verify before taking someone’s credentials at face value. “Scam artists and cybercriminals will do their homework. They will study their targets, their social media profiles and do as much open-source reconnaissance to craft a phishing lure that will avoid suspicions,” Carruthers said. “If a consumer has doubt or isn’t sure, if an email, text they’ve received is legitimate, they shouldn’t engage with it.”",4.654488245132739,4.228450687616245,0.4260375575164934,5

Since the start of the war, Zelenskyy has said he is Russia’s “No. 1 target,” and U.S. officials have voiced repeated concerns about his safety. But the Ukrainian leader has refused to flee his country, choosing instead to stay in Kyiv, the capital, as it continues to ward off a Russian takeover. The alleged founder and leader of the Wagner Group, Dmitry Utkin, is believed to have Nazi sympathies ― an irony if true considering how Russian President Vladimir Putin has justified his aggression in Ukraine by claiming it needs to be “de-Nazified.” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss announced that the Wagner Group numbered among dozens of individuals and businesses to be newly sanctioned, describing it as “the organisation of Russian mercenaries reportedly tasked with assassinating President Zelenskyy.” Also facing sanctions are Alfa Bank, five other financial institutions and a variety of individuals, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s stepdaughter, who reportedly lives in a multimillion-dollar London flat. The European Union slapped sanctions on the Wagner Group and other entities accused of funding it back in December, citing serious human rights abuses by members. Russia says it does not use the mercenary group, which it refers to simply as a private company. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, that plausible deniability comes in handy: “The Russian government has found Wagner and other private military companies to be useful as a way to extend its influence overseas without the visibility and intrusiveness of state military forces.” European security officials suggested in February that hundreds of Wagner Group fighters had been trickling into eastern Ukraine to lay the groundwork for the war, according to The New York Times. Ukraine’s defense ministry said on Sunday that a new group of Wagner mercenaries had entered the country with the aim of targeting the president and other high-ranking Ukrainian officials.

We need to act now,” IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a Wednesday statement that did not mention Russia or its President Vladimir Putin directly. “I remain gravely concerned about the safety and security of the nuclear facilities in Ukraine,” Grossi said. “We have been and will remain in close and continuing contact with the Ukrainian Government, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine, and the nuclear operator Energoatom.” The IAEA said earlier this month that Ukrainian intelligence indicated Russia planned to take “full and permanent” control of the facility, which Russia denied. Grossi offered to personally come to Ukraine to help address the situation. Any agreement, he said, “would include substantial assistance and support measures, including on-site presence of IAEA experts at different facilities in Ukraine, as well as the delivery of vital safety equipment.” “This assistance is essential to help avert the real risk of a severe nuclear accident that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond,” Grossi said. Through nerve-wracking bombing campaigns over the last month, Russian troops have forcibly taken control of two nuclear facilities: the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is the largest such facility in Europe, and the Chernobyl nuclear plant, which was the site of a catastrophic meltdown in 1986. Hundreds of workers are being held hostage at both facilities, ostensibly to avoid catastrophe, but they are reportedly not being well taken care of. “Physically and morally, they are exhausted,” the wife of one technician who works at the Chernobyl site told Agence France-Presse, a French news service. The workers are reportedly fed only two small meals per day. Before the war, the Chernobyl plant was maintained by nuclear engineers working for a Ukrainian regulatory agency. The area around the meltdown site, called the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, remains one of the most radioactive spots in the world. Ukraine’s nuclear agency announced this week that radiation monitors around Chernobyl had stopped working and that Russian bombs had destroyed a new laboratory on the premises that handled nuclear waste. The laboratory, the agency said, contained “highly active samples and samples of radionuclides that are now in the hands of the enemy, which we hope will harm itself and not the civilized world.” Video released from inside the Zaporizhzhia plant in early March had showed how a worker shouted at the Russians over the loudspeaker system, begging them to stop bombing the nuclear site. No bombs hit any critical infrastructure there, but the incident alarmed security experts around the world who said nuclear facilities should be off-limits in warfare.

Blinken highlighted a Russian attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol and a United Nations estimate that the war has killed at least 2,500 Ukrainian civilians so far, and likely many more. “The U.S. will continue to track reports of war crimes and will share information we gather with allies, partners and international institutions and organizations,” the secretary added. “We are committed to pursuing accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecution.” Earlier this month, the International Criminal Court launched an investigation into the Russian offensive after an uncommonly large number of countries referred the issue to the court’s chief prosecutor. Prosecutions could take place in U.S. courts if they have any jurisdiction over alleged war criminals or in third countries where such targets could be vulnerable, according to Beth Van Schaack, the Biden administration’s ambassador at large for global criminal justice. Van Schaak participated in a State Department press briefing after Blinken issued his statement. She noted that international law doctrine allows for high-ranking officials to be held responsible for the actions of their subordinates — raising the prospect of possible future cases against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Van Schaack declined to specify American intelligence identifying evidence of war crimes or particular incidents the U.S. is probing, but she noted that proof could include materials like intercepted signals. “Keeping the world apprised of what’s happening on the ground in Ukraine is extremely important,” she said.

State Department spokesperson Ned Price provides an update on US basketball star Brittney Griner who remains detained in Russia on allegations of drug smuggling.  In February, Griner, who plays for both the Phoenix Mercury and UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia, was detained for allegedly carrying hashish oil in her luggage. Hashish oil is a cannabis product and an illegal substance in Russia. Russian state news agency TASS said Griner would be detained until May 19, pending further investigation. “The court granted the request of the investigation and extended the period of detention of the US citizen Griner until May 19,” Moscow’s Khimki Court told TASS, CNN reported. Last week, the WNBA released a statement regarding Griner’s incarceration. “In close collaboration with U.S. government agencies, elected officials, individuals and organizations with expertise in these matters, and Brittney Griner’s representatives and family, we continue to work diligently to get her safely home to the United States,” the WNBA said. It’s a “complex situation that is extremely difficult for Brittney, and her family,” the statement added, and the WNBA’s main priority “remains her safe return.”",6.7663128168437625,7.249049729950603,-0.48273691310684086,0

The young children and their families arrived at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis on Tuesday after being airlifted from Poland where they had been receiving temporary care amid the violence, said the U.S. State Department, which assisted with their transportation. Video provided by St. Jude showed some of the children, 9 nine months to 9 years, smiling, waving Ukrainian flags, and one carrying a Minnie Mouse backpack, while entering the nonprofit hospital after their incredible journey. More children are expected to arrive as early as next week, a hospital spokesperson told HuffPost. “Our promise to children with catastrophic diseases extends around the globe, and we are honored to play a part in helping these families move to safety to continue their children’s treatment,” said St. Jude president and CEO James R. Downing in a statement. The children are part of St. Jude’s newly launched SAFER Ukraine program which aims to evacuate children with cancer from Ukraine’s war zone and provide them with continuing cancer treatment at hospitals in Europe, the U.K., Canada and now the U.S. Last week 21 Ukrainian cancer patients arrived in the U.K. for treatment as part of the program. St. Jude said more than 20 countries have offered to take in these patients. “Organizers have sought to keep patients as close to home as possible to minimize disruption to their lives, but factors such as decreased clinical space availability and advanced patient medical needs can require sending children farther from home,” the hospital said of its geographical decisions. The international program was launched shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24 and has thus far assisted more than 600 patients, from translating medical records to providing transportation, the hospital said. In addition to medical care, the children will receive trauma-informed psychosocial therapy to address any psychological, social, emotional and cultural needs. The patients and their siblings will also receive a school curriculum developed by the hospital’s educators, the hospital said. The children first begin their journey at a triage center in the town of Bocheniec, Poland, where they are medically evaluated and stabilized. Once the patients’ needs are accessed, they are transported to various cancer centers, though those in more dire condition may first receive stabilizing treatment at a local hospital in Poland before they are sent off again, Dr. Marcin Włodarski, a pediatric hematologist at St. Jude who is staffing the triage center, told The Associated Press. Doctors at the clinic, which is being assisted by multiple cancer and charity organizations, said they have been receiving an influx of patients since the invasion began. “At times we can have convoys with only 20-something patients but we can have up to 70 patients at a time and even more,” Dr. Marta Salek, another St. Jude pediatric hematologist oncologist at the triage center in Poland, told the AP. More than 3.6 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of Russia’s invasion nearly four weeks ago, according to United Nations data, though the U.S. government has thus far only taken in several hundred Ukrainian refugees. The U.S. government has said that it will help bring refugees to the U.S. as a last resort if they are not able to find shelter in Europe, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki stating on March 9 that it’s believed that the “vast majority” of refugees would want to stay in neighboring countries. The department acknowledged on Tuesday that the four children flown to Memphis for cancer treatment “represent a small proportion” of the thousands of cancer patients whose treatment has been interrupted due to the war. “That is why, together with our allies and partners, we will continue to support our Ukrainian partners as we seek to save lives and bring this needless war to a close,” it said.",4.083016165626411,3.8883039950166065,0.1947121706098045,27

Lavrov also called the sanctions an act of “theft.” “The Russian Federation must be made to never again depend on supplies from abroad. … Russia has no right to allow dependence on the West in vital sectors of its economy,” Lavrov said, according to Russian state-owned news outlet TASS. The official added that the Kremlin would still be “ready to cooperate” with the West in the future “if they want.” Putin made the decision in February to invade Ukraine despite NATO and Western leaders holding repeated talks to avoid a war. A large number of nations, including the United States, slammed Russia with increasingly severe sanctions — sending the ruble plummeting and the Russian economy in shambles. Russia’s Elvira Nabiullina tried to resign from her position as central bank governor after Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing four people with knowledge of the discussion. Putin reportedly ordered her to stay, nominating her for a new five-year term last week so that she’s forced to deal with a wartime economy isolated by global sanctions. Bloomberg’s sources told the outlet that her departure would now be seen as a betrayal by the president. Kommersant claims Anatoly Chubais is in Istanbul, as seen here getting cash out an ATM  Anatoly Chubais, Russia’s climate envoy who advised Putin, resigned and left Russia on Wednesday — making him the highest-level officer to quit the Kremlin since the beginning of Russia’s invasion. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed the resignation to the Financial Times, but said Chubais’ reason for leaving is a “personal matter.” The business oligarch known for overseeing Russian privatization after the fall of the Soviet Union left due to his opposition to the war in Ukraine, according to Bloomberg, citing two sources familiar with the situation.

On Sunday, the physician who was identified only as Dr. Iryna, shared video clips, photos and comments about what her team and their patients were experiencing with Beckham’s 71.8 million followers. She’s head of Kharkiv’s regional prenatal center, located about six hours from Kyiv. On the first day of the war, all of the pregnant women and mothers at the center were evacuated to the basement. “It was a terrible three hours that we spent together,” she noted on Instagram stories. However, many of the babies could not be moved to the safety of the basement. “Unfortunately, we can’t take babies who are in intensive care to the basement because they rely on life-saving equipment,” Dr. Iryna wrote alongside photos of newborns in the ICU. The first days of the invasion were the most difficult, she said. “We had to learn how to work with bombings and strikes,” Dr. Iryna noted. “My workday is 24/7. Now I’m not only the head of the center, but I continue to work as a pediatric anesthesiologist. I unload cargo, I work on logistics and offer emotional support.” She added: “We are probably risking our lives but we don’t think about it at all. We love our work. Doctors and nurses here, we worry, we cry, but none of us will give up.” A post shared by David Beckham (@davidbeckham) Beckham also urged his followers to donate to UNICEF and to keep checking the site for more updates on the lives at risk in Ukraine. “Together we can really make a difference,” he said.",4.6098741663834994,2.945821216777277,1.6640529496062224,28

It’s Laura Ingraham. It’s Greg Gutfeld. Greg, by the way, he is married to a Ukrainian woman. He just had to help his mother-in-law escape Ukraine. So, I do not understand this.” As for Carlson, Chavez said his comments nearly gave her a stroke. “He started essentially apologizing for Vladimir Putin, which he does almost every night on his show,” said Chavez. “I got so angry. If Tucker Carlson had been in striking distance, I would have pummeled him.” Chavez, a senior fellow at the National Immigration Forum who left the Republican Party in 2020 to become an independent because of the rigged election lies, also blasted Fox News for fear-mongering in a bid keep the U.S. from providing any further help to Ukraine. “In addition to bashing NATO and acting as if NATO is somehow a threat to world peace, is that they are also trying to scare their listeners into thinking that if we do anything more ― including providing the S-300s, providing the drone switchblades, providing airplanes, or God forbid, actually setting up a no-fly zone ― that Vladimir Putin is going to launch a nuclear attack. And that it’s going to be justified, essentially,” she said. And it’s working. Chavez said her brother-in-law, who watches Carlson religiously, is considering fleeing to Mexico to avoid a potential nuclear strike. In recent years, Carlson has become the Kremlin’s poster boy for Russian propaganda. “The Russian state agencies are actually saying, ‘Use Tucker Carlson on Russian networks. Use him as much as you can.’ There was a leaked memo about trying to use clips from Tucker Carlson to let the Russian people know that Americans know how dangerous this is,’” Chavez said.

At the end of the discussion, the opinion hosts thanked the government for its help in rescuing Hall, who was hospitalized with serious injuries after a vehicle he was traveling in was struck by fire near Kyiv. Two colleagues working with him, Pierre Zakrzewski and Oleksandra Kuvshynova, were killed in the same attack. “Thank you as well for your ― the Department of Defense and the Pentagon ― in assisting getting our man Benjamin Hall out of Ukraine,” Doocy said. “Yeah, God bless you for that,” Earhardt added. Fox News provided more details on Monday about how Hall had been evacuated from Ukraine via Poland to Germany. During a segment, anchor Dana Perino credited Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Polish and Ukrainian armed forces, and the group Save Our Allies for the rescue effort. Kirby said his department’s thoughts and prayers were with Hall, his family and everyone at Fox News. “We were very glad to be able to help get him the care that he needs, and we look forward to seeing him come home to his family where he belongs,” he said. “Again, it was the right thing to do, and we were pleased to be able to help.” Kilmeade chimed in by adding: “But, Admiral, you didn’t help a little, you helped a lot.” “Thanks, Brian. Again, we, unfortunately, as I think you all know, we’re all too familiar with these kinds of injuries. And we’ve built up an expertise on how to treat the kinds of injuries that Mr. Hall had,” Kirby responded. “We applaud the work that he, other Fox journalists, as well as all journalists are doing even today on the ground in Ukraine,” he added.

Maks Levin is a photojournalist and documentary filmmaker who disappeared while working on the front lines near Kyiv, his friend and colleague Markiian Lyseiko said on Tuesday. On March 13, Levin apparently drove in his own car to photograph the fighting in the Vyshhorod district — an area facing intense Russian violence. The journalist reportedly left his car near the village of Guta-Mezhigirska and went south toward the village of Moschchun. His last communication was apparently from that morning, after which his phone went offline. Levin “may have been injured or captured by Russian troops,” Lyseiko said. “Me, I will stay on the front line as long as I am physically able,” Levin told VICE in an interview published on March 9. “These soldiers are my friends.” Levin has been covering war in Ukraine since the 2014 revolution and the fight with Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region in the east. He and Lyseiko were on the front lines covering the Battle of Ilovaisk in August 2014, which became one of the largest military operations in Ukraine and a turning point in Russia’s war with the independent country. During the battle, 400 Ukrainians who were promised a safe corridor out of the city were slaughtered. Despite being injured, Levin was one of four journalists who managed to escape. He and Lyseiko later created the documentary “After Ilovaisk.” “The war has affected me personally: in October 2014, Viktor Gurnyak, my good friend, colleague, and volunteer of the Aidar Battalion was killed in a battle at the 31st checkpoint. There were guys in Ilovaisk that I became friends with, some of whom died or went missing,” Levin said of his experience on the front lines. “We still keep connections with so many people who survived the battle. This story united us forever. And now it is my inner obligation to tell about Ilovaisk survivors.” Levin was born in Kyiv and has worked with Ukrainian publications like LB.ua and Hromadske, as well as international outlets like Reuters, BBC and The Associated Press. His photos have been published in media ranging from TIME to Ukraine Crisis Media Center to The Moscow Times. He’s also shot projects for organizations like the United Nations, the World Health Organization and UNICEF. “Max has four children, boys,” Levin’s friend and fellow Ukrainian journalist Tetiana Bezruk tweeted. “Max, we are praying for you and we hope you are alive and in touch.” Lyseiko has asked the public to contact him with any information on Levin’s whereabouts. “We are deeply concerned about the disappearance of Ukrainian journalist Maks Levin, and call on anyone with information on his whereabouts to come forward immediately,” said Gulnoza Said, an official with the Committee to Protect Journalists. “Far too many journalists have gone missing while covering Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and all parties to the conflict should ensure that the press can work safely and without fear of abduction.” Levin is the latest journalist in Ukraine to either go missing or be killed. Yevhenii Sakun died March 1, Brent Renaud died March 13, and Pierre Zakrzewski and Oleksandra Kuvshynova both died March 14. Oleg Baturyn and Victoria Roschina both disappeared on March 12. Russian occupiers released Baturyn on Sunday and Roschina on Monday. Roschina was forced to release a video saying Russian troops saved her life. “The Russians were hunting us down. They had a list of names, including ours, and they were closing in,” wrote Mstyslav Chernov and Evgeniy Maloletka, who were the only remaining international journalists in the bombarded city of Mariupol.

David Petraeus","The reported deaths of five Russian generals in Ukraine is a sign of significant trouble for the Kremlin’s invasion, retired U.S. Gen. David Petraeus told Jake Tapper on CNN Sunday. “This is very, very uncommon. This is in the first three weeks,” said Petraeus. “These are quite senior generals.” Petraeus said four of the deaths have been confirmed. “I think the fifth we’ll hear today,” he added. Petraeus attributed the deaths to a variety of factors, including Ukrainians jamming Russian communications, skilled snipers and a Russian military structure that keeps decisions in very few hands. “The bottom line is that their command and control has broken down. Their communications have been jammed by the Ukrainians,” Petraeus said. “Their secure coms didn’t work. They had to go to a single channel that’s jammable ― and that’s exactly what the Ukrainians have been doing to that.” Without communication options, the military column gets stopped. And when an impatient general heads to the front to find out what’s going on, he’s shot and killed. “The Ukrainians have very, very good snipers and they’ve just been picking them off left and right,” Petraeus added. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, also said the Russians were in trouble in Ukraine. “Russian generals are running out of time, ammunition and manpower,” Hodges wrote in an assessment last week for the Center for European Policy Analysis. “That’s not based on any inside intelligence — it’s clear from open source information and my own experience.” In the latest blow to Russian military leadership, officials confirmed Sunday that navy commander Andrei Paly was killed in fighting in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Agence France-Presse reported. Paly, 51, was the deputy commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Check out Petraeus’ full interview in the video clip above.",3.409167414953707,2.6963157769777966,0.7128516379759104,22

Russian commander Col. Gen. Sergei Beseda was in charge of the FSB’s Ukraine operation, according to the Journal, citing a U.S. official. The unidentified American official also told the newspaper that “bickering had broken out” between the FSB and the Russian Ministry of Defense, which were the key government agencies planning the invasion. Citing Russian news sources, The New York Times reported that a second FSB official was also under house arrest. Russia’s military operation has not gone nearly as well as planned. CIA Director William Burns told Congress earlier this month that Putin had planned to seize the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv within two days. Yet the city continues to fend off Russian forces nearly a month after the invasion began. As many as five Russian generals have been killed in the fighting, according to Ukraine. That’s bad news for officials surrounding Putin, observers warn. “When it comes to this guy, it’s clear that the culture of ‘someone is at fault and is going to pay’ is clearly still operative,” former CIA and National Security Council official Jeffrey Edmonds told the Journal. But the finger-pointing and rising fear and discontent in the Kremlin could also be bad news for Putin. Russian history scholar Stephen Kotkin said in a recent New Yorker interview that Putin is only getting the information that “he wants to hear. In any case, he believes that he’s superior and smarter. This is the problem of despotism,” he added. “It’s why despotism, or even just authoritarianism, is all-powerful and brittle at the same time.” Read the full Wall Street Journal story.",3.9679865588714365,4.073368960115497,-0.10538240124406029,23

But the dissatisfaction with the current situation has been accumulating for many years,” she said through a live translator. “Because the propaganda on our state channels was becoming more and more distorted. And the pressure that has been applied in the Russian politics could not leave us indifferent.” ""The propaganda on our state channels was becoming more and more distorted.""Russian state TV editor, Marina Ovsyannikova speaks to her protest on live television: ""I was hoping that my performance, in a way, would help people change their mind.""  The Kremlin has always attempted to stifle the free flow of information in Russia, but intensified its control over news and free speech after invading Ukraine. The government imposed a law that would punish anyone spreading what it considered “false” information about the invasion with up to 15 years in prison. Ovsyannikova said Sunday that she initially wanted to participate in anti-war protests at Manezhnaya Square in Moscow. But after seeing security carrying out the new law by imprisoning protesters, she decided participating in collective demonstrations “was going to be a rather useless action on my part.” “I decided that maybe I could do something else, something more meaningful with more impact, where I could attract more attention to this and I could show to the rest of the world that Russians are against the war,” she said. “And I could show to the Russian people that this is just propaganda, expose this propaganda for what it is and maybe stimulate some people to speak up against the war. And I was hoping that my performance, in a way, would help people change their mind.” After her protest and following detention, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would bring up Ovsyannikova’s case in his next conversation with Putin ― adding that he wants to offer the journalist protection, “either at the embassy but also protection through asylum.” Ovsyannikova said she refused Macron’s offer to take asylum in France “because I am a patriot.” “I want to live in Russia. My children want to live in Russia. … And now I believe in the history of my country,” she said. “The times are very dark and very difficult, and every person who has a civil position who wants to make that civil position known must speak up. It’s very important.” Ovsyannikova’s demonstration was partly meant to convey to the world that not all Russian people believe in Putin’s actions, and that many civilians in Russia are against the war. “The severe sanctions that the West is imposing on all of the people is probably a correct decision, but you must understand that not just the oligarchs and Putin’s closest circle are suffering from these sanctions. Ordinary people, ordinary Russian citizens who are against the war are also being affected,” she added. “So I just wanted to show the world that it’s not just black and white in Russia. And I wanted to show our Russian people that they need to think critically and analyze the information that is being presented to them critically.”",3.2758761282300006,4.072569344617013,-0.7966932163870122,23

The Clash title refers to BBC reports during the bleak days of World War II that began with the greeting: “London Calling.” Now “Kyiv Calling,” which was recently recorded by the popular three-member Ukrainian punk band Beton near the front lines (and mixed in Los Angeles by producer Danny Saber, one of the last to work with Clash lead singer Joe Strummer before his 2002 death), is also a fundraiser. Proceeds will go to the Free Ukraine Resistance Movement. Donations will help fund a shared communications system to alert Ukrainians to threats, and lobby for international support. A gut-wrenching music video of the retooled Clash song shows devastating images of exploding bombs, beleaguered Ukrainians, suffering — and defiance and heroism. Footage shot by the bandmates’ friends, family and volunteers shows Russian military attacks from Kharkiv to Kyiv, The Guardian reported. “Kyiv calling to the faraway towns. Kyiv calling to the whole world,” say the rewritten lyrics. “Kyiv calling to the NATO zone. Forget it, brother, we can’t go it alone.” Still: “Kyiv is rising. We live for resistance,” says the anthem. Band musicians Bohdan Hrynko, Oleg Hula and Andriy Zholob are also playing other roles in the resistance. Many musicians in Ukraine have traded “guitars for guns,” said Beton guitarist Zholob, Reuters reported. He also works as an orthopedic surgeon treating the war wounded. “Many Ukrainian musicians are now on battlefields or in territorial defense,” he added. But the music itself also plays a key role, Zholob emphasized. “We hope this song shows Ukrainians’ spirit and our defiance to Russian aggression ... [and is] a symbol of solidarity and hope.” He added: “We have no doubt about our victory. We are proud to be Ukrainians and feel the support from musicians abroad. It means so much.” Check out the new resistance anthem in the video up top and Clash’s original “London Calling” below.",3.8262695526563992,3.8747162397373263,-0.04844668708092703,28

That’s what authoritarianism is all about, and we should know that by now.” Listen to the audio here: Later, on his prime-time Fox News show, Hannity said the “manufactured” rally was Putin’s “best attempt to look like Donald Trump.” He also called Putin a “murderous thug” and said his war on Ukraine had become a “humiliating disaster.” Russians were “required to attend” the event,” he said, “unlike a Trump rally.” Watch the video here: Hannity: His best attempt to look like Donald Trump  Hannity has previously called for Putin had to be removed “by whatever means necessary,” but also on Friday he repeated a Kremlin statement questioning President Joe Biden’s health. “Now, like I’ve been saying, Biden’s weakness on the world stage, it is emboldening bad actors all across the globe,” Hannity said after reading the Russian talking point word for word.

A people is being destroyed in Europe,” and the West stands idle. The clearly exhausted president, appearing in his now-trademark khaki T-shirt, accused Germany of ignoring Western values over the years so it could continue to do business with Russia. In the process, it grew increasingly reliant on Russia’s oil and gas — a dependence that supplied Russian President Vladimir Putin with funds to wage war, he argued. “We kept telling you that the Nord Stream [gas pipelines] was a weapon, a preparation for a major war.” But “the economy, the economy” was always the priority with Germany, he said. All of Europe, not just Ukraine, is at risk, he warned, evoking memories of Adolf Hitler’s march across Europe. “Help us stop the war,” he pleaded. Zelenskyy also called on Germany to help destroy a new “wall” Russia was erecting in Europe. It’s “no longer a Berlin Wall — but rather, a wall running all through Europe between freedom and slavery, and this wall will get stronger and stronger ... taller and taller with every bomb” dropped on Ukraine, Zelenskyy told the members of the Bundestag. He urged German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to “tear down this wall,” echoing a speech in 1987 by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan in Berlin before the symbolic and physical barrier came down. The Parliament gave Zelenskyy a standing ovation before his speech and repeated it at the end, despite his harsh message.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) erupted at a reporter on Friday who questioned her on her apparent support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and her attacks on Ukraine. “You can just stop,” she snapped at Axios reporter Andrew Solender when he asked if her comments and actions “represent a sympathy for Russia and the Kremlin” in its invasion of Ukraine. “I don’t have any sympathy for Putin and Russia,” Greene insisted. “So you can take your pro-Putin garbage and can take it somewhere else.” She also called the Russian leader “murderous.” Marge Greene loses her cool and snaps at a reporter this morning trying to ask about her Russia comments.  But just last month, Greene was a key speaker at a white nationalist conference where Russia was given a post-invasion “round of applause” and the audience chanted Putin’s name. She has also attacked “neo-Nazis” in Ukraine, parroting Putin’s broad characterization of the country in a vain attempt to justify his invasion. Hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy implored U.S. Congress on Wednesday for more help battling Russia’s devastating invasion, Greene indicated in a video on Facebook that “both sides” were responsible for Russia’s military assault on a sovereign nation. Putin is targeting and slaughtering civilians in a brutal unprovoked war against Ukraine, a sovereign democratic nation. Only the Kremlin and their useful idiots would call that “a conflict in which peace agreements have been violated by both sides.”  She also challenged Ukraine’s legitimacy, claiming on Facebook that Ukraine’s 2014 revolution was a U.S.-backed coup and that its current government “only exists because the Obama State Department helped to overthrow the previous regime.” Greene was one of only eight Republicans in the House on Thursday to vote (in a 424-8 tally) against legislation to revoke normal trade relations with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Greene called decorated military veteran and former National Security Council official Alexander Vindman a “clown” on Twitter for criticizing comments she had made about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Vindman accused her and what he called the “pro-Putin” Republican Party of essentially handing the Russian president permission to invade Ukraine with their “cheerleading.”",3.202342383602506,3.6218335548768805,-0.4194911712743745,3

But the fundraising is “not done,” they noted in a video posted together to Instagram. A post shared by Ashton Kutcher (@aplusk) “Over 65,000 of you donated,” said the Ukraine-born Kunis. “We are overwhelmed with gratitude for the support.” She added that the “collective effort will provide a softer landing for so many people as they forge ahead into their future of uncertainty.” Kunis pointed out that the money was “far” from enough to solve the war-ravaged country’s problems, so she and Kutcher are going to continue to raise money. “We’re going to do everything to ensure that the outpouring of love that came from you all ... finds the maximum impact for those in need,” said Kutcher. “As funding comes in, we’re going to treat every dollar as if it’s being donated out of our pocket, out of respect and honor for the work that went into earning it, with the intent of love for which it was given.” The couple promised earlier this month to match $3 million in donations to assist Ukrainians fleeing their nation amid the Russian invasion. Now that the goal has been met, the effort continues. “Please don’t stop donating, whether to us or to other unbelievable foundations out there,” Kunis said. “This is just the beginning of a very, very long journey.” Kunis was born in Chernivtsi in Ukraine, and moved to the U.S. with her family in 1991 around the age of 8. She told Maria Shriver in an interview early this month that she “very much” has “always felt like an American.” But she often told people she was born in Russia, she confided to Shriver. It was easier, for one thing, because everyone knows about Russia and where it is, she explained. Kunis said she mostly had felt far removed from Ukraine and her ties there, but that changed suddenly late last month, when Russia invaded. “I can’t express or explain what came over me, but all of a sudden I was like, ‘Oh my God,’ I feel like a part of my heart just got ripped out,’” Kunis said. “It was the weirdest feeling.”",3.3967042883181366,3.105222622474534,0.2914816658436026,29

Though McCarthy said he was wrong, Cawthorn’s initial comment about corruption in Ukraine echoed a universal Republican talking point from 2019 and 2020. Back then, Republicans were defending then-President Donald Trump for having withheld military aid for Ukraine in an effort to solicit damaging statements about Joe Biden from Zelenskyy.

Messages often include pleasant greetings followed by facts about the invasion, accurate media reports or footage of the war. “Let them know the truth.

The 1920 refers to a historic battle that year when Polish fighters stopped an invasion by a far greater force of Russian invaders. “We started as a group of friends and cyber security and communication experts from Poland,” a spokesperson for the group of nearly 100 members told Business Insider. “When the war broke out it was obvious that we would support the Ukrainians.” Squad303 claimed on Twitter Wednesday that 30 million messages had been sent to Russians, though that could not be confirmed: We do not know how to start this tweet... how to say HOW MUCH WE ❤️YOU!

His identity was reportedly confirmed by an aide to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a U.S. citizen had been killed in Ukraine but did not provide a name or further details. “My brother Jimmy Hill was killed yesterday in Chernihiv, Ukraine,” Cheryl Hill Gordon wrote on Facebook on Thursday afternoon. “He was waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down by Russian military [snipers]. His body was found in the street by the local police.” The U.S. embassy in Kyiv said Wednesday that Russian forces had shot and killed 10 people standing in line for bread in Chernihiv.

According to Hill’s Facebook page, he was a freelance lecturer and had worked at the Taras Shevchenko National University in Kyiv. Katya Hill said he was a social worker and forensic psychologist and had worked on and off in Ukraine for about 20 years. He traveled to Chernihiv in December to seek treatment for his partner Irina, a Ukrainian citizen who has multiple sclerosis, his friend told an Idaho news station earlier this month. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Hill and his companions were trapped inside a hospital with limited food, water and electricity. In a series of updates on Facebook in his final days, Hill said his partner, whom he called Ira, was in intensive care. He said they wanted to flee the city, but couldn’t determine how to do so safely. “Its a living nightmare but we are alive,” he wrote in one post last week. “Bombing throughout the day. Helpless feeling.” “We could try a break out tomorrow but Ira’s mom doesnt want to,” Hill wrote earlier this week. “Each day people are killed trying to escape. But bombs falling here at night.” He said he and his companions only had enough food for a few more days and that it was very cold in the hospital. Chernihiv, a city close to the Russian border, has been surrounded by Russian military. Civilians are increasingly dying under sustained attack from enemy forces in residential areas. The city’s mayor said last week that Chernihiv had run out of room to bury its dead. In his final post, on Tuesday, Hill said that the bombing had intensified and there was no way out.",3.4633437001843923,4.133045240711774,-0.6697015405273818,22

Personally, I agree,” Blinken said while giving an update on the conflict that has killed Ukrainian citizens and members of the media. “Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction in the past three weeks I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,” Blinken added. Blinken cited recent attacks by Russian troops on Ukrainian hospitals, schools, apartment buildings, a boarding school for visually impaired kids, civilians lined up for bread, and a theater where hundreds had taken shelter. “The word ‘children’ had been written in Russian in giant white letters on the pavement outside the building so that you could know from the air that there were children outside,” he said of the theater attack in the southern port city of Mariupol. Blinken also cited the deaths of Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and filmmaker and journalist Brent Renaud, who was on assignment for Time magazine. Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova, who was working as a freelancer for Fox News, was also killed in the attack that killed Zakrzewski and wounded Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall. Blinken confirmed that a U.S. citizen is also among the recent dead, but said he had no further details. The victim has been identified by local U.S. media and family as James Whitney Hill. Hill had extensively posted on Facebook about his efforts to survive the war while caring for a sick loved one in the city of Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine. His last post was on Tuesday. A family friend told Idaho station Local 8 News that Hill had traveled to Chernihiv in December for life-extending multiple sclerosis treatment for his partner, Irina, who’s a Ukrainian citizen. A woman identifying herself as Hill’s sister posted on Facebook that he was gunned down by Russian military snipers in Chernihiv while waiting in line for bread.

She read aloud a poem by Bono, in which the U2 frontman got lyrical about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “I got this message this morning from Bono,” Pelosi said in CSPAN video from the event, adding that the singer “has been a very Irish part of our lives.” The poem was structured as a set of three limericks, and concluded with the lines, “Ireland’s sorrow and pain / Is now the Ukraine / And Saint Patrick’s name now Zelenskyy.” Pelosi’s reading received applause and some appreciative chuckles from the audience. But many people on Twitter did not respond as positively, especially after the full text of Bono’s work began to circulate. And here’s that poem that Pelosi says Bono sent to her this morning, from the pool report: “Ireland's sorrow and pain/Is now the Ukraine/And Saint Patrick's name now Zelenskyy.”  Some took note of Bono’s decision to use the limerick, which is a form of verse traditionally associated with comedic and/or crude subjects. It’s three limericks in a trench coat! oh my god it's structured as a three-verse limerick (think 'there once was a man from Nantucket') Limericks are almost exclusively used for vulgar and/or humorous topics I think? This is like a world-historically inappropriate marriage of form and content Others pointed out that while the poem is clearly meant to honor Ukraine, Bono called it “the Ukraine.” Ukrainians have made it clear they prefer that their country be called simply “Ukraine,” because “the Ukraine” carries historical connotations of the country being part of Russia and not its own nation. surely nothing says ""we're thoughtful and care about Ukraine and its people and pay attention to the matter with the careful and scrupulous detail we pay to choice of language elsewhere"" quite like you say it by rendering the nation's name as, ""*the* Ukraine"" ""The Ukraine."" Jesus and Seamus Heaney wept. And still more Twitter users were simply stricken by an overwhelming sense of cringe. just kill me My therapist: “The Bono Ukraine poem is not real. It can’t hurt you.” The Bono Ukraine poem: If Bono himself handed this to me, I’d say “Surely this is so nice you’d want to hang it on your *own* refrigerator.” And that is all. This is worse than anything the Brits ever did to us Ok, on the one hand that's awful. On the other hand I'm now kind of looking forward to the nuclear armageddon I'd previously been worried about. So there are some positives. nothing can prepare you for what Bono's St Patrick's Day poem about Ukraine actually is, or what it is the opening act for After reading the poem, Pelosi ― as CSPAN noted in a well-crafted tweet ― introduced Riverdance.

He then explained the real reason for the video: “That is why I hope that you will let me tell you the truth about the war in Ukraine and what is happening there. No one likes to hear something critical of their government, I understand that. But as a longtime friend of the Russian people, I hope that you will hear what I have to say,” Schwarzenegger said. Schwarzenegger then explained how fighting for the wrong side can have lasting repercussions, using the example of his father, Gustav Schwarzenegger, who he said had to live with shame and guilt of fighting for the Nazis in World War II. “He lived the rest of his life in pain,” Schwarzenegger said. “Pain from a broken back. Pain from the shrapnel that always reminded him of those terrible years. And pain from the guilt that he felt.” Schwarzenegger said he doesn’t want the Russian soldiers fighting Vladimir Putin’s battle to end up “broken” like his father. “So every bullet you shoot, you shoot a brother or a sister,” he said. “Every bomb or every shell that falls is falling not on an enemy but on a school or hospital or a home.” Schwarzenegger also told the Russians watching the video message that “your lives, your limbs, and your futures are being sacrificed for a senseless war condemned by the entire world.” Although the message is directed toward the “Russian people,” RawStory noted that Schwarzenegger is just one of 22 people that Vladimir Putin follows on Twitter, along with Barack Obama and Elon Musk. You can see the video message below. I love the Russian people. That is why I have to tell you the truth. Please watch and share.  Schwarzenegger’s message was highly praised by Twitter users, including one State Department employee. ""This is not the Russian people's war."" Thank you, @Schwarzenegger, for sharing your message with the people of Russia, expressing deep concern over the Kremlin's war against Ukraine, and ensuring that the truth cuts through Putin's lies. Others followed suit. When A-list celebrity meets technology, Putin propaganda goes hosta la vista, baby. I am late for an appointment. Arnold made me late, and he made me weep. You need to see his message to Russia's soldiers, civilians, protesters and #Putin FANFUCKINGTASTIC This really is a fantastic statement, and is much better than the collective punishment approach being taken too frequently against Russian people outside of Russia. To my knowledge, no Russian film star or public figure has attempted anything remotely like this, despite the far closer cultural ties Russia has with Ukraine. The closest thing I’ve seen is pop stars complaining about the “ethnic persecution” of Russians in Europe.

The Olympic gold medalist was arrested earlier this year at an airport outside Moscow and was accused of smuggling hashish oil in her luggage. Moscow’s Khimki Court told TASS it was granting “the request of the investigation and extended the period of detention” for Griner, multiple outlets reported. TASS also quoted a source from Russia’s Public Monitoring Commission, which has access to prisons, who said that Griner was sharing a cell with two other inmates but that her 6-foot-9-inch frame was too tall for the standard jail bed, according to NBC News. Griner reportedly has ordered books ― a biography of the Rolling Stones and a tome by Fyodor Dostoevsky. CCTV footage released by Russian state media shows Griner, 31, walking through the Sheremetyevo airport in February with a small black rolling suitcase. That was the last time she was seen publicly. Griner is a center for the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury team who has been playing basketball in Russia during the offseason for several years ― something many American athletes do because the pay is so lucrative. Her wife, Cherelle Griner, her WNBA team and USA Basketball representatives all said they were aware of Griner’s detention before the news surfaced earlier this month, but appeared to be wary of provoking the Russian government by drawing attention to her plight. Cherelle Griner posted a message on Instagram thanking fans for their concern. “I understand that many of you have grown to love BG over the years and have concerns and want details,” she said. “Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.” Griner’s detention in Russia ― a country hostile to LGBTQ individuals ― has sparked concern that she could be mistreated while in custody.",6.948747587559975,6.956170276917736,-0.007422689357761136,0

Fedorov was released five days after video showed him being kidnapped by Russian soldiers. “We have finally managed to release the mayor of Melitopol from captivity,” Zelenskyy said, according to the translation included in the video. “Our Ukrainian city of Melitopol, which did not submit and will not submit to the occupiers.

2022-03-17,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-gas-prices_n_62334a6ae4b046c938d82228,Democrats Blame Oil And Gas Companies For Driving Up Gas Prices,"WASHINGTON — Ahead of the midterm elections, President Joe Biden is trying to head off a potentially potent political attack and convince voters that rising gas prices are not his fault. The problem for Democrats is that voters tend to blame whoever is in power when things are going badly, and inflation and high gas prices could cost them control of both houses of Congress next year. As the war in Ukraine has dragged on, Biden has repeatedly warned Americans that they may see consequences at the pump with Russian President Vladimir Putin disrupting global supplies And with the cost of a gallon eclipsing $4 in the last week, Biden castigated oil companies for profiteering at the pump. “Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans,” Biden tweeted Wednesday. Democrats have seized on a recent decline in the price of crude oil as evidence that greedy gas companies are hoarding profits. “Over the past few weeks — as war in Ukraine began — the price of a barrel of oil rose precipitously. That immediately translated to oil and gas companies raising the price for Americans at the pump,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech on Wednesday. “But something is happening that Americans shouldn’t overlook: Over the past few days, oil prices have actually been decreasing, but the price of gas at the pump has not.” Schumer vowed to haul in CEOs of oil and gas companies before the Senate to testify, accusing them of reaping billions of dollars in profits “instead of finding ways to give Americans a break at the pump.” Oil prices are decreasing, gas prices should too. Last time oil was $96 a barrel, gas was $3.62 a gallon. Now it’s $4.31. Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans.  White House officials have similarly been calling the rise in gas prices “Putin’s price hike.” The war disrupted Russian oil imports to the U.S., and Democrats joined Republicans in calling for an outright ban on Russian oil. But after Biden enacted such a ban last week — which he had resisted doing because it would increase domestic gas prices — Republicans blamed the higher prices entirely on Biden. Even before Russia’s buildup of troops along its border with Ukraine last year, Republicans had been blaming Biden for the increase in fuel costs, which jumped as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and the economy reopened. High gas prices are part of the worst overall inflation surge since 1982, one that has prompted the Federal Reserve to try to slow the economy in order to bring prices down. The Fed has blamed supply chain problems related to the pandemic, but Republicans have spent the past year slamming the American Rescue Plan, which they say gave the American people too much money to spend. “The president is literally gaslighting the American people. He feels that if he says it enough, people are going to believe that fuel prices are Putin’s fault,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said Wednesday. As for the recent decline in crude oil prices, it actually has resulted in a slight decrease in gas prices, shaving off four cents per gallon this week, according to AAA. The cost of a gallon rose 70 cents in the first two weeks of the war. But the oil price decline, which apparently resulted from falling demand due to a COVID-19 outbreak in China, might not last. “There isn’t a significant expectation that oil prices are going down substantively, and there’s further fighting in Ukraine,” Diana Furchtgott-Roth, an adjunct economics professor at George Washington University, said in an interview. She added that the White House could lower oil price expectations by boosting domestic production and imports from Canada. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, said it’s typical for retail prices to fall more slowly than they rise. “As we’ve seen in the past, it takes time for changing market conditions to work through the supply chain and for the price of crude oil to be widely reflected in the price we pay at local gas stations, more than 95 percent of which are independently owned small businesses and not operated by oil companies,” API’s Frank Macchiarola said in an email. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week gas prices should fall faster. “Retail gasoline prices are updated at least daily, and if gas retailers’ costs are going down, they need to immediately pass those savings onto consumers,” Psaki said Wednesday. Separately, assistant press secretary Vedant Patel pointed to recent oil company pledges to plow profits into stock buybacks instead of boosting supplies. The three biggest oil companies have seen their profits jump last year as gas prices surged. The furious efforts by Democrats to control the message on high gas prices is a recognition of the political headwinds they face going into the midterms. According to a recent Yahoo/YouGov poll, 30% of Americans said Biden is at fault for high gas prices, while 23% pointed their finger at oil and gas companies. The administration has sought to quell concerns by announcing a release of more than 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves around the world, as well as calling on oil producers to pump more oil. Democrats have also discussed ideas for how to blunt the high prices at the pump, including approving a temporary reprieve from the federal gas tax, and sending Americans direct payments to help offset their fuel costs. But there’s little agreement in Congress on any of the proposals.

Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) a star of Russian TV propaganda. NBC News correspondent Raf Sanchez, who is back in the U.S. after three weeks working in Moscow, tweeted a clip from Russian state TV on Thursday showing Cawthorn attacking Zelenskyy as his country was being invaded and bombed by Russia. “Remember that Zelenskyy is a thug,” Cawthorn, who is running for reelection in November, told supporters earlier this month in an appearance in Asheville, North Carolina. “Remember that the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt and is incredibly evil and has been pushing woke ideologies.” Madison Cawthorn: “Zelenskyy is a thug. Remember that the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt and is incredibly evil and has been pushing woke ideologies.” (First reported by @WRAL)  Since then, Sanchez tweeted, Russian state TV has “jumped” on Cawthorn’s comments and played them “over and over.” The journalist said he was exposed to a heavy dose of televised propaganda in Moscow, where TVs in the NBC bureau are tuned to Russian state-controlled broadcasts. Russian state TV also jumped on comments by Republican congressman Madison Cawthorn, who called Zelenskyy “a thug”. That got played over and over.  In contrast, President Joe Biden said Thursday at a St. Patrick’s Day event on Capitol Hill that it was “murderous dictator” Russian President Vladimir Putin who was a “pure thug” for waging an “immoral war against the people of Ukraine.” Another American darling of the Kremlin and Russian state TV has been Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has repeatedly bashed Ukraine and Zelenskyy and defended Putin. The Kremlin asked state-controlled Russian media to highlight Carlson’s broadcasts “as much as possible,” according to a leaked Russian government memo obtained by Mother Jones. Sanchez noted that he saw “a lot of clips of Fox’s Tucker Carlson criticizing the U.S. or Ukraine. Like several times a day.” Russian state TV spent a lot of time talking about high gas prices in the US – saying they were a sign of American sanctions backfiring. And a lot of clips of Fox’s Tucker Carlson criticising the US or Ukraine. Like several times a day.  Some of Russia’s misinformation broadly characterizes Ukrainians as neo-Nazis, according to Sanchez. He posted a video from Russian state TV “claiming to show a Nazi flag in a captured Ukrainian base.” Endless claims that Ukraine is led by neo-Nazis.Sometimes cloaked as a history lesson (a lot of talk about Bandera, a Ukrainian ultra-nationalist who died in 1959). But often it’d more blatant, like this clip claiming to show a Nazi flag in a captured Ukrainian base.  Other Russian media stories have emphasized that rising gas prices in the U.S. proved that sanctions against Russia weren’t working, showcased “heroic” Russian soldiers, or still hadn’t updated troop deaths since March 2, Sanchez noted. After video of Cawthorn’s “thug” remark first surfaced, the congressman tweeted that he also thought Putin’s actions in Ukraine were disgusting. But he took another dig at Zelenskyy, saying he “should not push misinformation on America,” and did not elaborate any further. In a statement Wednesday following Zelenskyy’s remarks to Congress, Cawthorn apparently changed his tune, saying that the “Ukrainian people’s resilience in the face of Russian aggression” has “inspired the world.” Cawthorn did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment about appearing in Russian war propaganda.",4.433676718206486,4.20400321740069,0.22967350080579596,24

More than 400 companies have either withdrawn, suspended or scaled back their operations in Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine, a list compiled by Yale’s School of Management shows. Guardian Industries, owned by Koch Industries, employs 600 people across two glass manufacturing facilities in Russia. Koch also has an additional 15 employees in the country outside of Guardian Industries. “While Guardian’s business in Russia is a very small part of Koch, we will not walk away from our employees there or hand over these manufacturing facilities to the Russian government so it can operate and benefit from them,” Dave Robertson, president and COO of Koch Industries, said in the statement. Robertson criticized Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, which have killed civilians and led over 3.1 million people to flee their homes, according to data published by the United Nations. “The horrific and abhorrent aggression against Ukraine is an affront to humanity,” he said. “It violates our company’s values and principles.” Still, the company is choosing to maintain its presence in the country and follow Russian rules, arguing that leaving would harm its employees. “Koch companies are complying with all applicable sanctions, laws and regulations governing our relationships and transactions within all countries where we operate,” Robertson said. In a virtual address to Congress on Wednesday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged lawmakers to pressure companies in their states to cut business ties with Russia. “All American companies must leave Russia from their market ... immediately because it is flooded with our blood,” Zelenskyy said. “Peace is more important than income, and we have to defend this principle in the whole world.” Ukrainian President Zelenskyy calls on members of U.S. Congress to issue further action against Russian politicians, apply pressure on companies to exit Russia.""All American companies must leave Russia...immediately because it is flooded with our blood.""  Koch Industries, Inc., which employs over 120,000 people in more than 50 countries, has annual revenues of $115 billion, according to Forbes. Charles Koch, the company’s 86-year-old CEO, threw his money behind the tea party movement after Barack Obama’s election victory in 2008. But he has said he regrets the partisanship he has come to be known for over the years. “Boy, did we screw up! What a mess!” he wrote in his book “Believe in People: Bottom-Up Solutions for a Top-Down World,” published in November 2020. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in November 2020, following the presidential election, he did not reveal which candidate he supported. Still, after the violent insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Koch Industries was the fourth-largest donor bankrolling Republican lawmakers who falsely argued that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election, according to OpenSecrets, the nonprofit tracking money in U.S. politics. But Koch himself said Republicans should certify Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory.

Trump said he believed Putin’s tactics were aimed at striking some sort of deal with the United States. The U.S., he claimed, never made a good trade with the Russians “until I came along.” “And then he went in — and I think he’s changed,” Trump said. “I think he’s changed. It’s a very sad thing for the world. He’s very much changed.” Trump’s admiration for the Russian dictator has been an issue, even for some supporters. In a recent interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity as Russia’s attack on Ukraine intensified, Trump refused to call Putin evil, despite the Trump-supporting host’s prompts. And he stumbled to walk back his gushing over Putin’s strategy, dwelling on semantics instead. In his interview with the Examiner, Trump retreated to his hollow claim that he’d been “very, very tough on Putin.” “I get a bad rap on that,” Trump insisted. “At the same time, I got along with him very well. But I got along with most [world leaders] very well.”",4.945224751566826,5.560864068723664,-0.6156393171568375,24

There is growing concern that Russia could turn to chemical or biological weapons as its invasion drags on, causing a major escalation in the conflict. President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on Wednesday warned his Russian counterpart against it, although Zelenskyy said the Russian military had already escalated the warfare when it began to bombard civilian targets. “I believe that Russians have already crossed all the red lines when they started shelling civilians,” he told NBC News’ Lester Holt. “They’ve killed over 100 children. I don’t understand the meanings of red lines. What else should we wait for? Letting Russians kill 200, 300 or 400 children?” Zelenskyy went on to say that even if Kyiv falls amid an onslaught, Ukrainians would never fall in lockstep behind Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Our people are unconquerable,” Zelenskyy said, noting that negotiations with Russia had been “very difficult” thus far. “You can conquer the city, break the heart, but you won’t be able to force anybody to love someone. That is why the heart will always remain with Ukrainians.” In our @NBCNews exclusive interview, Zelenskyy tells @LesterHoltNBC, “Our people are unconquerable, and this is what our people have clearly demonstrated.” Watch our @NBCNightlyNews report and more on @TODAYshow tomorrow  The interview was aired after Zelenskyy gave a powerful address to Congress in which he called on the U.S. to “do more” while invoking the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S. and the 1941 Japanese strike on Pearl Harbor. “Right now the destiny of our country is being decided,” Zelenskyy said, adding that the Kremlin had “attacked not just us, not just our land, not just our cities, it went on a brutal offensive against our values.” While Biden has called Zelenskyy’s request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine a non-starter, the White House announced an additional $800 million in military aid to the nation hours after the speech. The figure includes hundreds of anti-aircraft systems; small arms, such as grenade launchers and rifles; drones; and 25,000 sets of body armor. “This is a struggle that pits the appetites of an autocrat against humankind’s desire to be free,” Biden said as he announced the funding.",3.0428906205977353,2.315837959403916,0.7270526611938193,3

The Russian word for “children” was painted on the pavement in huge white letters on two sides of the building, according to satellite imagery from Maxars. There was no immediate information on the number of injuries or deaths. The word 'children' was painted in large Russian script on the ground outside the Mariupol Drama Theatre, Maxar satellite images collected on March 14 showed. Ukraine accused Russia of bombing the theater on Wednesday. Russia denies the attack  Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said the Drama Theater had been destroyed, calling it a “horrendous war crime.” “Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter,” Kuleba said in a tweet. While critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine have been calling him a “war criminal” for weeks, on Wednesday U.S. President Joe Biden joined them. Another horrendous war crime in Mariupol. Massive Russian attack on the Drama Theater where hundreds of innocent civilians were hiding. The building is now fully ruined. Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter. Save Mariupol! Stop Russian war criminals!  “He’s a war criminal,” Biden said plainly. Russian troops have been laying siege to Mariupol for about two weeks, encircling the city and largely preventing civilians from leaving. Electricity, food, water and medicine are all running out. It’s a medieval tactic that Putin has used before with devastating consequences in Aleppo, Syria, in 2016 and in Grozny, Chechnya, in 2000. The plight of Mariupol has been chronicled for the Western world by two Associated Press journalists, who believe they are the only international members of the press still in the city. People have been melting snow for drinking water, they report, and venturing out only for essentials before returning to wherever they are sheltering from the persistent shelling. The number of casualties is unknown because it is often too dangerous to venture out to find the wounded and the dead; the official number is around 2,400, according to The New York Times. Russia claims that its forces are not targeting or killing civilians, but Russian artillery has decimated apartment buildings and hospitals, and killed people along evacuation routes. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops took 500 people ― about 100 doctors and patients and 400 people who lived in houses nearby ― hostage at one hospital in Mariupol late Tuesday. The troops allegedly rounded up neighbors and drove them to the hospital, using gunfire to prevent anyone from trying to leave. In the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, Russians “shot and killed 10 people standing in line for bread,” the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Wednesday. The International Criminal Court at The Hague announced earlier this month that it was investigating whether war crimes were being committed by the Russians. Part of the rationale Putin has used to justify his invasion was a purported “genocide” in the eastern part of Ukraine, but the United Nations’ International Court of Justice said Wednesday that its investigation had found no evidence of such a genocide. In a largely symbolic gesture, the ICJ ordered Russia to halt its assault.",3.571931348680213,3.712163443962639,-0.14023209528242608,22

The streaming platform announced on Wednesday that “Servant of the People,” a sitcom Zelenskyy starred in before becoming president, is available for viewing by U.S. audiences. The announcement of the show’s return to Netflix happened the same day that Zelenskyy asked Congress to “do more” to help his country fight back against Russia. You asked and it’s back!Servant of the People is once again available on Netflix in The US. The 2015 satirical comedy series stars Volodymyr Zelenskyy playing a teacher who unexpectedly becomes President after a video of him complaining about corruption suddenly goes viral.  The political satire series features Zelenskyy as a schoolteacher who becomes the president of Ukraine after calling out corruption in the country. The show debuted in 2015 and ran for three seasons, until Zelenskyy was elected president of the country for real on his own anti-corruption campaign. He won in a landslide. A clip from the series showing Zelenskyy’s character in the show, Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko, receiving a fictional phone call from then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, went viral earlier this month, particularly because of the last line in the clip: “Fucking Putin.” I can’t wrap my mind around the existence of this clip.

Smirnova, 30, who had been the Bolshoi’s prima ballerina since 2016 and whose grandfather was Ukrainian, posted an emotional message on the Telegram app, The Guardian reported. “I have to be honest and say that I am against war with all the fibers of my soul,” she said, according to a transcript provided by the Dutch National Ballet. She added: “I never thought I would be ashamed of Russia, I have always been proud of talented Russian people, of our cultural and athletic achievements.

Remember Sept. 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories, into battlefields. When innocent people were attacked from air.” “Our country experiences the same every day, right now, at this moment, every night for three weeks now,” he added. Zelenskyy reiterated his request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, although he acknowledged that the United States was unlikely to go that far. So he followed that ask for other types of assistance, both humanitarian and military, while saying he was extremely grateful for all the aid the U.S. government has already provided. “If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative,” he went on, requesting other assistance to fight Russia, including S-300 missile systems. Establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine ― which Zelenskyy has requested before ― would potentially be a major escalation of the conflict, requiring U.S. and NATO to shoot down Russian aircraft. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki has said the president “continues to believe that a no-fly zone would be escalatory.” Biden has also repeatedly said he does not want to put U.S. troops on the ground in Ukraine or do anything that could lead to World War III with Russia, another nuclear power. Congress has passed nearly $14 billion in humanitarian and military assistance to Ukraine so far. President Joe Biden over the weekend approved $200 million in security assistance for Ukraine and is expected to announce later on Wednesday an additional $800 million, bringing the total security aid provided to the country since Biden took office to $2 billion. Zelenskyy repeatedly turned to U.S. ideals and history to make his case, invoking both Mount Rushmore and Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech at times. “I have a dream. These words are known to each of you,” he said. “Today, I can say, I have a need. I need to protect our sky. I need your decision, your help. Which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words, ‘I have a dream.’” In his speech Wednesday, Zelenskyy also criticized the current governing bodies of the world, saying they were failing and that what was needed was a “union of responsible countries” that can stop conflicts immediately. At one point, Zelenskyy played a graphic video showing Ukrainian cities both before and after Vladimir Putin’s invasion, in happy times and then full of destruction with injured children and people crying as they try to escape the carnage. At the end of his speech, Zelenskyy appealed directly to President Joe Biden: “You are the leader of your great nation. I wish you to be leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace.” He received a standing ovation after his remarks. After the speech, lawmakers focused on Zelenskyy’s call for other types of assistance, brushing aside the no-fly zone and making clear that there’s little support on either side of the aisle for such a move. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) called the request for a no-fly zone “compelling” but added, “I think every one of us are deeply concerned about this spiraling into all-out war.” “The point of the no-fly zone request is to make us feel guilty that we can’t do the no-fly zone, so that we work even harder on everything that we can do. It’s brilliant. It’s exactly what he should be doing. It’s effective,” Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) said. Republicans have seized on Poland’s offer of MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine as a way to criticize Biden’s handling of the situation, even though the Pentagon said the transfer of such planes would be logistically problematic and risk escalating the war. (The United States would then have sent Poland, a NATO ally, replacement F-16s.) “The idea that we’re going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews — just understand, don’t kid yourself, no matter what y’all say, that’s called World War III,” Biden told a gathering of House Democrats last week. “I think right now, providing the MiGs, they can create a no-fly zone,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. “He’s never asked for American men or women to be in a battle, all he’s ever asked for is, ‘Give us the opportunity to defend ourselves. Don’t let us fight with sticks.’” “The longer President Biden waits trying to figure out excuses to not offend Putin, it’s costing lives in Ukraine,” Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), the No. 2 House Republican, told reporters after Wednesday’s speech. Zelenskyy speaks to Biden almost daily by phone, and about two weeks ago, he also had a call with lawmakers during which he asked for more assistance.",2.776559221811096,3.1718895661538116,-0.39533034434271563,3

If you want to get something done right send Trump. “If you want to get something done right send Trump,” the ex-president’s eldest child added. Critics reminded Trump Jr. of his father’s own flattery of Russian President Vladimir Putin throughout his presidency. Others suggested Trump be shipped off “one way” and recalled his questionable behavior with world leaders at summits when he was in office. One way.  You can’t make him love you Don I think he has a prior speaking engagement at the Mar a Lago omelette bar. Oh sweetie I haven't seen big daddy Donald Trump volunteering to meet with Putin and Zelensky on the Russia/Ukraine border to mediate between them. His bone spurs must be acting up again. Your stupid father was busy dismantling and undermining NATO, much to Putin's delight.All of our European allies think he is a dangerous idiot, and they are absolutely right. Biden is uniting them.This is a serious situation, no time for a showboating halfwit like Donald. Of all the stupid ideas you’ve had, and there have been many, this is by far the dumbest. #DumbDonJr Nothing is stopping any Trump from flying into Kyiv and lending a hand, Tough Guy. *If you want to get something done right (for Putin) send TrumpSince what we actually want is something done well for America, we're sending Biden.  Why would we send the guy we fired? Yep.Send this guy.Send the manbaby who’s one true skill was in uniting the rest of the world’s leaders (other than the dictators & despots) in a shared disdain for his moronically selfish insane adult diapered ass.Yes. Send the guy who couldn’t even win re-election.Send him.  Sorry Jr, but I think @MaryLTrump is too busy........... I want you to do us a favor though Just a friendly reminder that THIS is what happens when you send Trump.  “My people came to me saying they think it's Russia. I have President Putin, he just said it’s not Russia, I will say this, I don’t see any reason why it would be.”",3.2751131790137387,3.8909026495803567,-0.615789470566618,24

Zelenskyy specifically asked the United States to “close the sky” over Ukraine to protect civilians who are being slaughtered by Russian airstrikes. The Biden administration has opposed the move, with the president saying it would kick off “World War III.” Instead of jets or American troops, Biden said the U.S. would send 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 9,000 anti-armor systems, including 2,000 Javelins, and 7,000 small arms, including grenade launchers, rifles, pistols, shotguns and machine guns for civilians to defend themselves. The White House said 20 million rounds of ammunition and 100 drones would also be shipped, along with 25,000 sets of body armor and the same number of helmets. The new package brings the total amount of Ukrainian aid authorized this week to $1 billion, as a $200 million package was approved over the weekend. “This is a struggle that pits the appetites of an autocrat against humankind’s desire to be free,” Biden said from the White House. He added that he was using his “presidential authority” to transfer the equipment overseas from the U.S. Department of Defense. The president also praised Zelenskyy’s speech, saying he watched it from the White House residence Wednesday morning. Zelenskyy began by addressing members of Congress in Ukrainian, invoking Sept. 11 and Pearl Harbor as he described his country’s fight to hold onto its democracy. He then screened a short video that contrasted images of sunbathed Ukrainian cities with what many parts looked like now, with apartment buildings hollowed out by Russian bombs and doctors struggling to save children hit by shrapnel. Many of the images were graphic. A message stood out at the end: Close the sky over Ukraine. “Is this too much to ask?” he’d said minutes earlier. Zelenskyy then switched to English and spoke to Biden directly. “I am addressing the President Biden,” he said. “You are the leader of your nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace.” Foreign policy experts have said that instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine would amount to direct U.S. involvement in Russia’s war, because enforcing airspace restrictions means shooting down planes that violate it. Some members of Congress have urged Biden to facilitate the transfer of jets to Ukraine so that Ukrainian pilots could do the work themselves, but the administration has said it would not go that far, either, believing that Russia would view it as direct provocation. Others doubt the impact that a couple of dozen warplanes could have. “We believe the most effective way to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia is to provide increased amounts of antitank weapons and air defense systems, which is ongoing with the international community,” Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, who heads up the U.S. European Command, told The Washington Post last week. “The Ukrainians are making excellent use of these weapons now,” Wolters added. Although the Russians outnumber the Ukrainians in tanks and planes, Ukrainian fighters have seen some success using smaller defense weaponry. Getting the additional weapons to people all over Ukraine could be difficult, however, if Russia makes good on its threat to target convoys of supplies sent from Western nations. Ukrainian officials allege that Russian forces are already blocking humanitarian aid to the city of Mariupol, which is encircled by Russian troops that are preventing many from fleeing.",4.147114920541402,3.233153063084009,0.9139618574573936,3

Marina Ovsyannikova told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday that her life had changed irrevocably, but she hoped she would not face criminal charges. The Kremlin has clamped down on news and free speech since its invasion of Ukraine, imposing a law that could punish anyone spreading what it deems “false” information about the Ukraine invasion with up to 15 years in prison. “I decided to do it spontaneously, but the decision was brewing for quite a long time,” Ovsyannikova said, according to a live translation. “Lately I have been feeling a cognitive dissonance, more and more, between my beliefs and what we say on air. It was a growing sense of dissatisfaction that kept increasing every year, and the war was the point of no return.” On Monday evening, Ovsyannikova walked behind the presenter of Channel One with a poster that said “Stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” The mother of two was arrested and fined $270. She said she was interrogated for 14 hours. She said she has not been in touch with her colleagues since the incident because the authorities had taken her phone, but she had heard online that multiple state news channel employees had resigned. “I think this is becoming a public demonstration because many are feeling a disconnect between the reality and what we say on air,” she said. Ovsyannikova said she had been “afraid until the last minute” before she dashed onto the set. Watch the interview on CNN.",4.9188442316529235,3.4728785512207607,1.4459656804321628,23

On Monday, officials in Bayonne, New Jersey, added an acrylic board to cover the Russian president’s name on the memorial, which is formally called, “To the Struggle Against World Terrorism,” but is also known as the “Teardrop Memorial” and “Tear of Grief.” The sculpture was a gift from Russia, and Putin visited Bayonne back in 2005 for the groundbreaking on the memorial. However, after Putin sent troops to invade Ukraine, city officials decided erasing his name from the dedication plaque was a prudent move. “It’s definitely satisfaction, but I don’t want to take away from the monument,” Tom Cotter, the city’s Department of Public Works director, told NBC New York. “It’s unfortunate Putin’s name’s on the monument, but I don’t want this to be a Putin thing. I still want this to be a 9/11 monument.” Cotter said having Putin’s name on a memorial protesting terrorism isn’t exactly appropriate given current events. “Basically what’s happening in Ukraine right now is like a form of terrorism, the invasion of that country,” Cotter said. Bayonne Mayor Jimmy Davis took credit for the action, saying he made the decision so “we don’t deface this honoring of the victims and families of 9/11/01, and we show our support with the people of Ukraine,” according to NJ1015.com. Davis also said covering Putin’s name is a statement against the president alone and not the Russian people. “We remain grateful to the Russian people for the memorial. They did not start the war. Mr. Putin did. The memorial will stay in place on our waterfront. It is not going anywhere,” Davis said in a statement. Davis doesn’t seem to be worried about how Putin might react to being removed from the city’s memorial, mainly because he doesn’t have good memories of the Russian leader. “In my opinion, he’s probably the coldest human being I’ve ever met,” Davis, who was a police captain at the time of Putin’s visit, told NBC New York.",2.890596585824062,3.068164886695136,-0.17756830087107378,29

The president is scheduled to go to Brussels on March 24 for a NATO summit in which leaders will “discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. Psaki said Biden will also “reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies.” While there, the president is expected to join a European Council summit, where Psaki said he will “discuss our shared concerns about Ukraine,” including efforts to impose economic sanctions on Russia, provide humanitarian aid to civilians impacted by the violence, and address other challenges related to the invasion. Biden will travel to Brussels next week to participate in a NATO summit on the situation in Ukraine, Psaki says  The White House said it is still finalizing details of the trip and could not confirm whether Biden would also travel to Poland or meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been pleading for Western leaders to do more to aid the country under attack. Zelenskyy will deliver a virtual address to Congress on Wednesday. “His goal is to meet in person, face-to-face with his European counterparts and talk about and assess where we are at this point in the conflict in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,” Psaki said. “We’ve been incredibly aligned to date ― that doesn’t happen by accident. The president is a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy, so it’s an opportunity to do exactly that.” The trip to Europe would be Biden’s first since October, and follows Vice President Kamala Harris’ visits to Poland and Romania last week. The announcement came on the same day Russia announced sanctions on Biden and other top U.S. officials, in a move aimed at restricting travel to Russia. The move is in response to sanctions that prevent Russian officials from entering the U.S. “It won’t surprise any of you that none of us are planning tourist trips to Russia,” Psaki told reporters. “None of us have bank accounts that we won’t be able to access, so we will forge ahead.”",4.95504839829636,5.017607354781676,-0.06255895648531595,25

Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova, who was working as a freelancer for Fox News, was also killed in the attack, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. “Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for FOX News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us,” the network said in a statement. “His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched.” Fox News host John Roberts announced Zakrzewski’s death on Twitter and said the cameraman was “an absolute treasure.” Last year, as the U.S. withdrew its forces from Afghanistan, Zakrzewski helped Afghan freelance associates and their families with leaving the country, Fox News said in its statement. “In December at our annual employee Spotlight Awards, Pierre was given the ‘Unsung Hero’ award in recognition of his invaluable work.” Before the attack that killed Zakrzewski and injured Hall, Hall pushed back against Fox News personality Greg Gutfeld for saying the media is trying to rouse up an “emotional response” with its coverage of Ukraine. “Speaking as someone on the ground, I want to say that this is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response,” Hall told Gutfield. “This is absolutely what’s happening.” More details of the attack on the journalists are not yet known.",4.157956558828061,5.121944406005006,-0.963987847176945,9

In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours.” In a new address overnight, Zelensky spoke directly to Russian soldiers, in Russian: “You will not take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives... But your lives will also be taken. But why should you die? What for? I know that you want to survive.”  Zelenskyy said his country’s fighters continue to resist the invasion and have inflicted major damage on the Russian military. “You’ve already understood everything,” Zelenskyy said. “You will not take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives. There are a lot of you. But your life will also be taken. But why should you die? What for? I know you want to survive.” He added that Russian forces will face a further reckoning, for committing war crimes. “Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable,” Zelenskyy warned. “Responsibility for a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities is inevitable.” The United Nations continues calling for an end to the war, citing the human cost and the devastating impact on the global economy, especially on developing nations, due to rising prices of food and energy. “All of this is hitting the poorest the hardest and planting the seeds for political instability and unrest around the globe,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Monday. Zelenskyy also pleaded with ordinary Russians to continue to resist Russian President Vladimir Putin’s misinformation campaign. State-run media in Russia have been using the term “special military operation” instead of “war” to describe the fighting and falsely say Ukraine is led by neo-Nazis, according to the BBC. Zelenskyy made a special mention of Marina Ovsyannikov, the news editor who stormed the set of the Channel One newscast with a poster reading, “Stop the war. Don’t believe the propaganda. They are lying to you,” in Russian. “As long as your country has not completely closed itself off from the whole world, turning into a very large North Korea, you must fight,” Zelenskyy said. “You must not lose your chance.” The prime ministers of three European Union and NATO member countries — Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia — are traveling to Kyiv on Tuesday as Russian soldiers edge closer to the capital. “Europe must guarantee Ukraine’s independence and ensure that it is ready to help in Ukraine’s reconstruction,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki tweeted.

Mentions that they spoke last week after their ""little kerfuffle"" and ends by calling Hall ""a lovely guy.""  Last Tuesday, Gutfeld suggested the media was trying to inspire an “emotional response” to the war in Ukraine because “that makes a profit for news companies.” From Kyiv, Hall pushed back. “Speaking as someone on the ground, I want to say that this is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response,” he said. “This is absolutely what’s happening.” Gutfeld later called Hall’s comments a “cheap attack” and doubled down on his assertions about a one-sided narrative in the coverage of Ukraine. On Monday, Fox News announced that Hall had been hospitalized while reporting outside Kyiv. The network said Tuesday that its cameraman, Pierre Zakrzewski, was killed in the same attack, as was Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova, who was working as a consultant for Fox News. On Tuesday, Gutfeld said that he and Hall had “joked about” their on-air debate last week and that Hall had said, “‘Greg, you can’t do my job, and I can’t do yours.’” “And I said, ‘duh,’” Gutfeld continued. “My job is way easier.

General: Russia May Face Trouble In Ukraine ‘Within The Next 10 Days’,"A former U.S. Army general predicted Monday that the Russian military could soon run out of the manpower and weaponry needed to continue its invasion of Ukraine. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe, said recent moves by Russia to extend its campaign to western Ukraine and reports that the country had asked China for military supplies may mean the Kremlin is running out of steam. “Russia’s decision to transition to a war of attrition, where they’re smashing cities, putting civilians on the road for fear of being murdered, they need three things to do this, and they don’t have those three things,” Hodges said on MSNBC’s “Meet the Press.” “They don’t have the time, they don’t have the manpower and I don’t think they have the ammunition.” WATCH: Russia needs three things for a war of attrition that they don't have: ""the time ... the manpower and ... the ammunition,"" says @general_ben. ""Within the next 10 days Russia is going to culminate, which means they will not be able to continue the attack any further.""  Hodges’ comments were buoyed by evidence that Russia was running low on weaponry as Ukraine continued to mount a fiercer-than-expected resistance, notably around the capital of Kyiv. He said that if the West continued to support Ukrainians, it could be less than two weeks before the Russian military reached what he referred to as its culmination point. “Assuming that we, the West, not only continue but accelerate the delivery of the capabilities the Ukrainians need, I think within the next 10 days that Russia is going to culminate, which means they will not be able to continue the attack any further,” Hodges said. “So, it’s kind of a race, actually, if we give the Ukrainians enough so they can outlast Russia.” Russian forces will culminate within the next ten days if we maintain pressure on them...they have manpower problems and ammo shortages. Accelerate/expand support to UKR to destroy Russian arty, rockets, and cruise missiles. Now is the time to keep our foot on the gas. Hodges added that there was a big caveat to his prediction, a nod to Putin’s unpredictability during the invasion. “I’ve been wrong a lot,” he said. “I don’t have a crystal ball here.”",3.4973595328476677,4.674041220664344,-1.176681687816676,15

Zelenskyy previously addressed all members of the U.S. Senate during a private video call earlier this month. It’s unclear whether this week’s address will be made public. Congress last week approved nearly $14 billion in humanitarian and military assistance to Ukraine as it struggles to repel a Russian invasion. President Joe Biden over the weekend also approved an additional $200 million in weapons for Ukraine, bringing the total security aid provided to the country since January to $1.2 billion. But the Biden administration has so far resisted one of Zelenskyy’s top requests: the imposition of a no-fly zone over Ukraine in an effort to protect civilians from Russian airstrikes. White House officials have argued that such a move could put U.S. planes and pilots at risk of engagement with Russian troops, heightening the risk of a broader nuclear war. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also noted in an interview with CNN over the weekend that a no-fly zone may not prove as effective due to reliance by Russian troops on artillery, rather than simply fighter jets. .@SenAngusKing of Intel Cmte notes to me and @DanaBashCNN: “the destruction in Ukraine is almost entirely the result of missiles and artillery (not bombs from aircraft) which a no-fly zone would not stop.

Amid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, parts of Carlson’s on-air spiels have been translated to serve as pro-Russia propaganda on Russian state-sponsored TV. The Fox News host has blamed the U.S. for Russia’s war and repeated pro-Russia talking points, evidently nabbing the attention of the Kremlin, which reportedly directed state media to use clips of his broadcasts “as much as possible” earlier this month. “When I hear apologists for Putin in America, I wonder who they are and what they’re made of,” Durbin said during a speech condemning Russian atrocities in Ukraine. “Tucker Carlson is one that even the Russians are recommending that their friends in the media listen to. Making excuses on Fox for Vladimir Putin. There are no excuses. Not acceptable,” the senator said. “Mr. Carlson should be ashamed of himself.” ""Tucker Carlson ... making excuses on Fox for Vladimir Putin. There are no excuses, none acceptable on the subject. Mr. Carlson should be ashamed of himself."" — Sen. @DickDurbin  According to a Mother Jones report published over the weekend, a Russian government agency asked media and commentators in a March 3 memo to use clips of Carlson’s broadcasts because he “sharply criticizes” the actions of the U.S. and NATO and their “negative role in unleashing the conflict in Ukraine.” On Thursday, ABC’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, reported that Carlson’s commentary justifying Russia’s attack on Ukraine has at times been an almost “word-for-word” recitation of Putin’s remarks. Carlson has promoted these types of views for years. In 2019, he asked, “Why do I care what is going on in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia? ... Why shouldn’t I root for Russia? Which I am.” Following backlash, he claimed he was joking. As Russian aggression intensified in the lead-up to the invasion, Carlson defended Putin and criticized Ukraine, arguing that Ukraine was not a democracy. After Putin began his brutal attacks on the neighboring nation and its civilians, Carlson admitted that it had taken him “by surprise” and that some of his analysis was wrong. He has since amplified a baseless Russian conspiracy theory about secret U.S.-backed biological warfare labs in Ukraine. Carlson and his Fox News colleague Laura Ingraham were also featured in a speech by Durbin on the Senate floor last year.

During a Twitter scuffle over comments she made on Fox News, Campos-Duffy inadvertently admitted that former President Donald Trump tried to bribe Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden’s family based on unproved corruption accusations. The strong-arming attempt came while Biden was running for president against Trump. The scuffle started after Kevin Kruse, an author and professor of history at Princeton, looked askance at some of Campos-Duffy’s comments on Fox News, in which she claimed that Zelenskyy probably wished Trump were president now instead of Biden: If you’d told me 25 years ago that ⁦@RCamposDuffy⁩ would turn out to be the most embarrassing member of Real World San Francisco I’m not sure I’d have believed you, but here we are. What an unbelievable idiot. Campos-Duffy, who was on MTV’s “Real World” reality show before becoming a Fox News personality, fired back at Kruse, but in her haste she inadvertently admitted a truth that many conservatives have tried to hide: Trump initially threatened to withhold $391 million in military aid unless Ukraine investigated Biden’s son Hunter, who had been on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. The scheme led to Trump’s first impeachment in December 2019. Many Twitter users were quick to point out what Campos-Duffy was admitting: lol she just admitted Trump was blackmailing Ukraine ""He used that leverage to try to get Zelinsky to expose the proven Biden family corruption in Ukraine.""

Then, in Russian below: “Stop the war. Don’t believe the propaganda. They are lying to you.” Journalists at Meduza, an English-language independent Russian news outlet, identified the protester as Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at the station. The mother of two has reportedly been arrested and, under a new law, could potentially face up to 15 years in prison. A woman burst onto Russia’s main live evening newscast today with a sign that says:“Stop the warDon’t believe propagandaThey’re lying to you”And chanting: “Stop the war! No to war!” Shortly after her arrest, a prerecorded video circulated online of Ovsyannikova explaining why she chose to speak out, blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for the “fratricidal” war against Ukraine, and apologizing to viewers for her past work at the station. “Unfortunately, I’ve spent many of the last few years working for Channel One, doing Kremlin propaganda, and I’m deeply ashamed of this,” she said, according to a translation. “Ashamed that I allowed lies to come from the TV screen. Ashamed that I allowed the zombification of the Russian people.” “We Russians are thinking and intelligent people,” she added. “It’s in our power alone to stop all this madness. Go protest. Don’t be afraid of anything. They can’t lock us all away.” Here's her full speech, translated into English.  In a surreal turn, Russian media reporting on Ovsyannikova’s actions were unable to accurately do so under the country’s strict new media laws.

The idea of a one-to-one fight might sound appealing to fans of bad action films, but Musk may not be the best guy to pin the hopes of a free Ukraine on. Although the 6-foot Musk towers over the 5-foot, 7-inch Putin, the Tesla CEO told podcaster Joe Rogan in 2020 that, while he lifts weights and uses a treadmill, he prefers not to exercise. More important, he’s only dabbled in fighting sports like taekwondo, karate, judo and Brazilian jiujitsu. Meanwhile, a 2014 profile of Putin claimed that the Russian president swims for two hours a day and lifts weights in the gym. He also has military training in hand-to-hand combat. Still, many Twitter users had thoughts about whether putting a serious geopolitical crisis in the hands of a billionaire Twitter troll was the right plan of action. Well this ought to do the trick. Problem solved everyone! Musk is challenging Putin to a fist fight... If this was how conflicts were resolved, it would save a lot of innocent lives...

In December 2020, he was widely panned on social media after appearing to complain that displaying pronouns in online bios was not visually appealing.

The Kremlin has been cracking down on anti-war demonstrations since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine almost three weeks ago. The controversial move has caused widespread devastation in Ukraine, and isolated Russia as the international community condemns Putin’s aggression with severe sanctions. However, Moscow has been shutting down independent media outlets and reducing access to social media platforms for Russian citizens to prevent the reality of the Ukrainian invasion reaching the general public. People in Russia have not even been able to call the invasion what it is, or a war. Now the Russian authorities have gone one step further and appear to be removing demonstrators with blank signs from the streets, as seen in this video: Police in Nizhny Novgorod arrested a demonstrator today for protesting with a blank sign. Welcome to Russia in 2022.  According to independent Russian human rights project, Ovd Info, approximately 14,911 people in Russia have been detained since Putin launched his invasion in Ukraine on Feb. 24. Similar videos have also been shared on Twitter. In one, a woman holds up a sign which just says, “two words” in Russian. The activist asks the cameraman, “Am I going to get arrested for this or not?” Within a matter of seconds, she is removed by a group of police officers dressed in protective gear with helmets and visors. Then another woman approaches the camera, and starts to explain why she supports the war against Ukraine – but before she can say anything, police grab her by the arm and pull her away from the screen too. One of the most extraordinary videos I’ve ever seen. The first woman is holding up a sign that says ‘two words’.  Another social media video appears to show Russian citizens deflecting questions about whether they agree with the war. What do the Russians say about the attack against Ukraine?

This dramatic legislation came into place during the first week of the invasion, after the Russian Duma cracked down on the spread of any so-called “false information” related to the invasion. As a result, open acts of defiance — such as the one seen below — are rare and usually come with significant consequences.

A leaked 12-page memo from a Russian government agency to media on March 3 said “it is essential to use as much as possible fragments of broadcasts” by Carlson, according to a translation by Mother Jones, which said it obtained the note from a contributor to a national Russian media outlet. Carlson “sharply criticizes” the actions of the U.S. and NATO and their “negative role in unleashing the conflict in Ukraine,” the memo said, per the news site. Carlson is also critical of the “defiantly provocative behavior from the leadership of the Western countries and NATO towards the Russian Federation and towards President Putin, personally,” it reportedly continued. The document was titled “For Media and Commentators” and sent from Russia’s Department of Information and Telecommunications Support, according to Mother Jones. The outlet said Carlson was the only Western journalist referenced in the memo. Retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the former director for European and Russian affairs at the National Security Council whose testimony figured prominently in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment, weighed in on the report, tweeting at Carlson to “Live your life in such a way that the Russian government and state TV apparatus doesn’t think you’re an ally.” Carlson has evidently landed in the Kremlin’s good books after consistently amplifying Russian propaganda on his show. On Thursday, ABC’s chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl reported that Carlson’s rhetoric was “almost a plagiarism” of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s. In the days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Carlson defended Putin and questioned why he was expected to dislike him. “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?” he asked. Since the invasion, Carlson has blamed the U.S. for Russia’s attack and parroted baseless Russian conspiracy theories about secret American biological warfare labs in Ukraine. He also complained that he was falsely accused of rooting for Russia. (He has openly admitted to doing so in the past.) “Why do I care what is going on in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia?” Carlson said in 2019. “And I’m serious. Why do I care? Why shouldn’t I root for Russia? Which I am.” He later claimed he was joking. Multiple excerpts from his show have been translated to serve as propaganda on Russian state-sponsored TV, including one in which he argued that Ukraine is not a democracy but “a client state of the Biden administration.”",4.093833668229916,4.645400783107958,-0.5515671148780417,24

The Latvia-based outlet, Meduza, has published stories in both English and Russian since 2014, relying on a combination of advertising revenue and donations from readers. That changed drastically in 2021, when the Kremlin branded the news website a “foreign agent” and ad revenue evaporated. Some 30,000 Russian donors stepped in to make up the difference, according to the outlet. But now that sending money into and out of Russia is virtually impossible, Meduza is once again facing an existential crisis. Meduza’s editorial staff in Russia fled the country at the start of the war ― some on foot, in the middle of the night ― and are now scattered across Asia and Europe. Though Meduza’s website has been blocked in Russia, the outlet says millions of Russians continue to read via the outlet’s app and encrypted messaging apps, like Telegram. (Meduza has produced a number of joint investigations in the past via a partnership with BuzzFeed, HuffPost’s parent company.) Now Meduza is getting a signal boost from news outlets around the world in a bid for new members. “We ask you to take the place of our dedicated supporters from Russia,” the Meduza staff wrote in a crowdfunding appeal. “We have a duty to tell the truth. We have millions of readers in Russia who need us. Without independent journalism, it will be impossible to stop this monstrous war.” One of the outlets pitching in is Krautreporter, a crowdfunded German news cooperative that offered to help lead the crowdfunding effort after reading about Meduza’s plight on social media. “This is one of the few shots that Russians have at getting independent reporting and good information,” Krautreporter publisher Leon Fryszer told HuffPost, emphasizing the two outlets share no formal, professional relationship. “I think there needs to be a counter-force to what the Kremlin is doing now, and Meduza has a good chance at being that.” “It’s something very practical that we can do for Russians in a situation where sometimes it feels like you’re paralyzed because you can’t do a lot,” he added. Despite the setbacks, the staff of Meduza is still hard at work. In the past they’ve exposed everything from the presence of Russian mercenaries in Venezuela to the machinations of Russia’s propaganda apparatus; these days it’s mostly 24/7 war coverage. “Meduza is very popular and that’s a huge responsibility because a lot of people rely on us for factual information that nobody else will have either the experience, the resources or the will to report,” investigative reporter Alexey Kovalev told the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford. “We are immensely proud of this.

And he’s warning Russian President Vladimir Putin that the end could be swift ― for both his military and his more than two-decade rule. “The collapse of their position could be sudden and catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of attrition,” Fukuyama wrote for the American Purpose website. “The army in the field will reach a point where it can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will vaporize.” Fukuyama, author of 1992′s “The End of History and the Last Man,” blamed incompetent planning by Moscow, which anticipated that its forces would be welcomed in Ukraine. “Russian soldiers were evidently carrying dress uniforms for their victory parade in Kyiv rather than extra ammo and rations,” wrote Fukuyama, who holds several positions at Stanford, including Olivier Nomellini Senior Fellow at the university’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

The statement cited 31 attacks that destroyed or damaged health care facilities since the beginning of the Russian invasion, curtailing Ukrainians’ access to services, including vaccinations against COVID-19. “Humanitarian partners and health care workers must be able to safely maintain and strengthen essential health service delivery, including immunization against COVID-19 and polio, and the supply of life-saving medicines for civilians across Ukraine as well as to refugees crossing into neighbouring countries,” the statement says. Vaccination rates in Ukraine were low, even before the invasion. Only about 35.7% of the population had received two COVID-19 vaccine doses as of Feb. 23, according to Reuters. Daily cases peaked at 41,694 on Feb. 10 and have been decreasing since, although the war has impacted access to testing. Ukraine has reported 106,985 COVID-19-related deaths during the pandemic. Ukrainian health care workers have been told to take note of patients’ symptoms, instead of seeking COVID tests, Dr. Oleksandr Matskov, deputy director of the General Public Health Center of Ukraine, told The New York Times. The war has upended life across the country and has eclipsed COVID concerns for many everyday Ukrainians. “People are not frightened about COVID anymore,” Dr. Marta Saiko, head of the therapy department at the Clinical Municipal Emergency Hospital in Lviv, told The New York Times. “People are frightened of the war.” Over 2.8 million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, according to U.N. data last updated on Sunday. Most have sought refuge in Poland, where border staff have not been requesting vaccination certificates or COVID-19 tests, according to Euronews. Typically, travelers from outside the E.U. are required to show a negative COVID-19 test result and proof of vaccination or recovery certificate to avoid quarantine, according to the Polish government’s website. Jean-Claude Cordeau, head of the Urban Search and Rescue mission in the Polish village of Medyka, looks after refugees making the crossing from Ukraine, including small children arriving with hypothermia. “COVID at this border crossing here in Medyka is obviously not a priority,” Cordeau told Euronews. “Not a priority for us, and not a priority for refugees that are arriving.” Still, WHO’s Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove warned the pandemic is not over and said the chaos in Ukraine is a breeding ground for infectious diseases. “Certainly, this pandemic is not taking a break, despite the fact that we have this war, despite the fact that we have challenges and many countries are facing challenges right now,” Van Kerkhove said during a WHO press briefing on Wednesday. The BA.2 variant, also known as “stealth omicron,” has driven China’s biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020.

Facebook and Instagram — which are both owned by Meta — have altered their guidelines to allow users in certain countries to post content that’s typically forbidden, such as hate speech and calls for the death of Russian soldiers or politicians, according to The Verge. Russia banned Facebook last week, claiming it allowed “discrimination against Russian media,” The Verge reported. Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri tweeted last week that Russia’s decision to ban the social media platform would “cut 80 million in Russia off from one another” and “the rest of the world.” On Monday, Instagram will be blocked in Russia. This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong. The Russian parliament has also blocked access to Twitter for its citizens. A slew of corporations have pulled their services from Russia. Social media app TikTok banned all livestreaming and content creation in Russia due to President Vladimir Putin’s new law that criminalizes anything he deems to be “fake news” as Russia continues its violent invasion of Ukraine. “In light of Russia’s new ‘fake news’ law, we have no choice but to suspend live-streaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law,” TikTok said last week in a statement.",4.401431649328768,4.563304590708865,-0.16187294138009722,27

Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) on Monday provided a lengthy rationale for declining to ever appear on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program, describing it as being “full of Russian propaganda and not news.” “Tucker Carlson invited me on his show tonight, but that’s not going to happen… ever,” the lawmaker tweeted alongside a video statement. “While he echoes Putin’s lies, I’ll remain focused on supporting the Ukrainian people.” Carlson often attacks Kinzinger, one of a handful of Republicans in Congress who have been repeatedly and publicly critical of former President Donald Trump. Kinzinger has also gone after Carlson in the past for spreading disinformation and sentiments supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “His insistence that the West was provoking war with Putin, his spreading lies about bio labs, and his continued spewing of conspiracy theories are nothing but complete evil,” Kinzinger said in his video statement. “His show is full of Russian propaganda and not news, and I will not validate his show by making an appearance. I do not want to be associated with it in any way.” He predicted what would happen if he appeared on the program, noting that Carlson’s playbook for “hostile” interviews is to interrupt the guests and then laugh “when he’s been caught in a lie.” Carlson has openly admitted that he lies on his show. “We know the interview would be promoted to get more viewers, to make more money, to further empower his garbage,” Kinzinger added. Tucker Carlson invited me on his show tonight, but that’s not going to happen…ever. While he echoes Putin’s lies, I’ll remain focused on supporting the Ukrainian people. My video statement:  Pointing to the dire situation in Ukraine as Putin wages war, Kinzinger said it was time for “serious conversation and decisive action.” “Not a self-serving showboat clamoring for more clicks tonight.” Kinzinger encouraged viewers to join him in supporting Ukraine by donating to a humanitarian aid fund for Ukrainian refugees on his website. “Tucker has made it clear he stands with Putin and his war against freedom,” Kinzinger added. “I stand with Ukraine, democracy, and the men and women willing to fight and die for their country.” He concluded by offering his and his wife’s prayers for Benjamin Hall, a Fox News correspondent who was injured while reporting in Ukraine. “The job they do is dangerous and appreciated,” he said. Last week, Carlson taunted the congressman to appear on his show after Kinzinger slammed him for hosting a UFC fighter who said that the Biden administration “shouldn’t be giving our tax dollars” to Ukraine. Carlson has faced furious backlash in recent weeks for peddling Russian conspiracy theories and promoting pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine talking points. His commentary are so aligned with Russian propaganda that the country’s state-controlled television channels have aired excerpts of his broadcasts with subtitles, and the Kremlin reportedly asked state media to highlight Carlson’s programs.",3.7327705883897053,4.550465813958325,-0.8176952255686194,24

Brent Renaud, a 51-year-old Peabody Award recipient, was fatally shot in Irpin, northwest of Ukraine’s capital. A second journalist was injured along with him, said Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv’s regional police force, in a message posted on Facebook. (Warning: The message includes disturbing photos of a body, believed to be that of the filmmaker.) Nebytov also shared a photo of Renaud’s passport and media credentials issued by The New York Times. “Of course, the profession of journalism carries risks. Nonetheless, U.S. citizen Brent Renaud paid with his life trying to highlight the deceit, cruelty and ruthlessness of the aggressor,” Nebytov’s post read. Renaud was not on assignment for the Times in Ukraine at the time of his death. A Times press badge he was wearing had been issued for an assignment “many years ago,” a spokesperson for the news outlet said Sunday. “We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death. Brent was a talented filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years,” the Times said in a statement. PBS NewsHour reporter Jane Ferguson said on Twitter that she was at the roadside scene where Renaud’s body lay under a blanket and that there was nothing Ukrainian medics could do for him. She quoted an outraged Ukrainian police officer as saying: “Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist.” Danylo Shapovalov, a surgeon volunteering for the Ukrainian territorial defense, told AFP that the journalists were riding in a car when they were shot at. “There were two journalists and one of ours (a Ukrainian),” he told the news outlet. “Our guy and the journalist are wounded, I provided them first aid, the other one received a wound in the neck, he died immediately.” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking on CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” called news of a U.S. journalist’s death “obviously shocking and horrifying” and said it’s just the latest example of “brazen aggression” by Russian forces. “I will be consulting with my colleagues, we’ll be consulting with the Ukrainians to determine how this happened and then to measure and execute appropriate consequences as a result of it,” he said.",4.316901297058492,4.914663361569395,-0.5977620645109027,9

The request comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin expanded his assault on Ukraine to the country’s west, killing 35 people in an attack on a military base not far from its border with Poland. But Russia has faced fiercer than expected resistance, particularly around Kyiv, and there is evidence the country is running low on weaponry, the Financial Times reported. It’s unclear how China responded, and U.S. officials only spoke to the outlets on condition of anonymity to preserve Russian intelligence gathering efforts. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C., said he’d “never heard” of the Russian request for support. “The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting,” Pengyu said in a statement to The New York Times. “The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.” Russia and China are close political allies and Beijing has refused to condemn Putin’s invasion, instead saying it hoped for a negotiated end to the conflict. The Biden administration has increased diplomatic pressure on China in recent weeks, exchanging barbs about the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign. Beijing has said it blames the U.S. and the United Nations for the invasion. Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, is set to travel to Rome on Monday to meet with a senior Chinese official and deliver warnings about any support Beijing may offer to Russia. “We have communicated to Beijing that we will not stand by and allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses from the economic sanctions,” Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world.” The Times notes that China has traditionally bought its military equipment from Russia, but Beijing has advanced missile and drone programs that could aid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The paper, citing independent analysts, also added that there is evidence Russia may be running low on missile supplies. The request comes amid a raft of harsh economic sanctions against Russia and the swift departure of many Western businesses from the country.

Audio of the incident quickly went viral and became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance against the Russians. Though the border guards were first thought to have been killed, they are now reported to have been captured and are alive.

Face-Off","In a heated U.N. Security Council meeting Friday, Russia accused the United States of supervising and funding Ukrainian biological weapon operations, a statement that was angrily denied by the Ukrainian and American ambassadors. Some observers fear the accusations are a bid by Russia to justify rolling out its own biological warfare against the Ukrainians. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month that Russia would “fabricate allegations about chemical or biological weapons to justify its own violent attacks against the Ukrainian people.” Russia presented no evidence for its claims, and United Nations officials say there is nothing to support allegations of the existence of biological weapon operations in Ukraine. China, however, has amplified the unsupported claims. But Russia’s U.N. representative, Vasily Nebenzya, insisted Friday that at least 30 Ukrainian labs were discovered near the Russian border that are working on weaponizing diseases, including anthrax, cholera and “the plague.” The research, which he claimed threatens Europe, involves research using diseases carried by birds, lice and fleas, The Washington Post reported. The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, vehemently denied all such claims. She accused Russia of calling for the Security Council meeting “for the sole purpose of lying and spreading disinformation.” Russia is “attempting to use the Security Council to legitimize disinformation and deceive people to justify President [Vladimir] Putin’s war ... against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,” she said. “Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program, and there are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States — not near Russia’s borders, not anywhere,” Thomas-Greenfield added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Facebook post that it’s Russia, not Ukraine, which is capable of planning such an atrocity. “No chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land,” he said. “The whole world knows that.” Russia accuses “that we are allegedly developing biological weapons, allegedly we are preparing a chemical attack. This makes me really worried,” he added, noting that he has two children. Ukraine does have a network of biological labs supported by the U.S. But they’re part of a biological threat reduction program intended to mitigate deadly outbreaks, whether natural or manufactured. Early efforts date to the 1990s to dismantle the former Soviet Union’s program for weapons of mass destruction, The Associated Press reported.",4.0620697357839015,4.462159278179352,-0.4000895423954507,25

The Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed that Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses and was under investigation.

Danilchenko also ironically suggested organizing a “People’s Choice Committee” to “solve all the critical issues for ... the Melitopol region.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday lashed the kidnapping of Melitopol’s legitimate mayor, comparing it to the actions of “ISIS terrorists.” He called it a “crime against democracy.” The mayor of #Melitopol Ivan Fedorov was kidnapped, said Anton GerashchenkoAccording to him, Fyodorov refused to cooperate with the Russian military occupying the city.

Trump has faced widespread backlash for calling Putin’s tactics a work of “genius” last month as the authoritarian leader prepared to invade Ukraine. His rhetoric met resistance from some high-ranking Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who said on Wednesday that Putin was not a genius but an evil dictator. Hannity gave Trump an opportunity on Thursday to walk his comments back, two weeks after Putin launched a brutal war that has killed hundreds of civilians. “You came under some fire when you said that Vladimir Putin is very smart,” Hannity said during an interview with Trump. “I think I know you a little bit better than most people in the media, and I think you also recognize he’s evil, do you not?” Trump declined to say and instead tried to argue about the semantics of his praise for the dictator. “Well, I was referring to the fact that he said this is an independent nation, talking about Ukraine, and I said that ... this was before there was any attack. He’s calling it an independent nation,” Trump said, adding that “this doesn’t seem to be the same Putin that I was dealing with.” “But I will tell you, he wouldn’t have changed if I were dealing with him. He wouldn’t have changed,” he added. Trump declines to call Putin ""evil"" when Hannity prompts him to  Trump then criticized President Joe Biden’s nuclear posture during the crisis in Eastern Europe and described how he would have handled it if he were in charge. Biden has declined to match Putin’s heightened nuclear alert status, avoiding an escalation of warnings between the two superpowers. “Look, Biden, every time he gets up he says they are a nuclear nation. He should say we are a nuclear nation,” Trump said. “And, you know, I rebuilt our whole nuclear arsenal, stronger, bigger, better than ever before,” he added. “He should say, ‘We are a nuclear nation and we don’t want war ... and we don’t want to wipe out Russia.’” He condemned the violence as “a crime against humanity” and said it “has to end” now, though he also noted that if it comes to an end as things stand, it’s “going to look like a big loss” for Putin. Hannity later circled back to the backlash against Trump for his praise of Putin, giving him another chance to retract those comments. ″You’ve often quoted to me Sun Tzu, ‘The Art of War.’ Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Is that how you viewed Vladimir?” the Fox News host said. “Did you view Vladimir Putin and people like President Xi and Kim Jong Un and the Iranian mullahs as enemies that you needed to keep close?” Again, Trump offered no condemnation for the authoritarian leader. “I got along with these people. I got along with them well. That doesn’t mean they are good people. It doesn’t mean anything other than the fact that I understood them and perhaps they understood me,” Trump said. “Because they knew there’d be a big penalty.” LOL -- Hannity is trying so hard to get Trump to denounce authoritarians like Putin and he just refuses to do it  Hannity had already tried to explain away Trump’s praise for Putin on Ukraine, arguing on Feb. 24 that it was “taken out of context.” Donald Trump Jr. also chimed in on the subject this week, suggesting his dad’s cozying up to dictators was a ploy to “play these guys.” As president, Trump routinely alienated U.S. allies, including Canada and Germany, while praising autocratic leaders like Putin, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.",5.551060670995987,2.8030733236587886,2.7479873473371987,24

Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Carlson repeatedly defended Putin, noting that the Russian leader had never called him a racist. He’s also admitted to “rooting” for Russia and said the U.S. should butt out, and claimed Putin “just wants to keep his western borders secure.” This week, Carlson, who has openly admitted to lying, blamed the United States for Russia’s attack on Ukraine. And on Thursday night, Carlson appeared to attack one of his own network’s reporters for debunking some of the conspiracy theories he’s spread on his show.",4.633222167211928,4.409170108163106,0.2240520590488222,24

The “Bad Moms” star was born in Chernivtsi but moved to the United States with her family in 1991 around the age of 8. Kunis told Maria Shriver in a candid interview uploaded to YouTube Friday that because of this, she “very much” has “always felt like an American.” “People were like, ‘Oh, you’re so Eastern European.’ I was like, ‘I’m so LA! What do you mean?’ Like, my whole life I was like, ‘I am LA through and through,’” Kunis said. Kunis said that because she identified so strongly as an American that being Ukrainian felt “irrelevant” to her for a majority of her life — although she still has close friends in Ukraine and visited the country often with her family and her husband, Ashton Kutcher. Nonetheless, she admitted that whenever people would ask her where she was from, she’d say she was Russian for “a multitude of reasons.” “One of them being when I came to the States and I would tell people I’m from Ukraine, the first question I’d get was, ‘Where is Ukraine?’” Kunis said. “And then I’d have to explain Ukraine and where it is on the map, and i was like ‘Ugh, that’s exhausting.’” So, she soon figured out a shorthand. “But if I was like, ‘I’m from Russia,’ people were like, ‘Oh, we know that country.’ So I was like, great, I’ll just tell people from Russia,” Kunis said. But all of that changed for the “Four Good Days” star when Russia invaded Ukraine late last month. “This happens and I can’t express or explain what came over me, but all of a sudden I was like, ‘Oh my God, I feel like a part of my heart just got ripped out,’” she said. “It was the weirdest feeling.” She now says that she won’t tell people she’s from Russia anymore. “Hell no, I’m from Ukraine!” she told Shriver. She also noted that the way Ukrainians are handling the conflict has given her a renewed sense of “pride.” She said that she was recently speaking to one of her Ukrainian friends about how his family is handling the conflict. “They refuse to evacuate,” Kunis said of her friend’s family. “And they all go to work everyday. So they’re in their bomb shelter at night, they wake up in the morning, they take whatever they have to protect themselves in the city, and they go to their office to continue working. It is a different breed of people,” Kunis said. Ukrainians’ resilience in the face of devastating circumstances is an aspect of the conflict that has caught many people’s attention. Videos of a pianist playing Louis Armstrong’s “What A Wonderful World” outside of a train station in Lviv and a girl singing “Let It Go” in a bunker have gone viral on social media. There are many heroic stories about Ukrainians having to travel hundreds of miles to escape violence. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declined an offer from the U.S. to evacuate him and has reportedly dodged multiple assassination attempts. “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelenskyy said in February, soon after the Russian invasion. Kunis told Shriver she’s now trying to instill Ukrainian pride in her children, daughter Wyatt, 7, and son Dimitri, 5, both of whom she shares with Kutcher, who was raised in Iowa. “I turned to my kids and I was like, ‘You are half Ukrainian, half American!’ Like, I literally was like, ‘Look, you!’ And my kids were like, ‘Yeah mom, I get it.’ And I was like, ‘No! You are Ukrainian and American.’ I was like, ‘You are half Iowa, half Ukraine.’ And they’re like, ‘OK, I get it.’”",3.5210924168014572,2.92156325896949,0.599529157831967,29

There’s no quid pro quo here,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Sept. 29, 2019, defending Trump’s attempt to coerce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into smearing Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic challenger Trump most feared, by withholding military aid to Ukraine. “This type of diplomacy is hard to watch but nonetheless has existed and hardly rises to an impeachable offense,” said South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds on Nov. 7, 2019. In recent days, those same Republicans and many others have come around to urge Trump’s successor, Democrat Joe Biden, to provide more military assistance to Ukraine in the face of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin’s invasion. “Vladimir Putin is a cold, calculating killer. We must continue to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their country,” Rounds wrote on Twitter on Feb. 25. “I have never seen a leader rise to the occasion more than President @ZelenskyyUa has done,” Graham added a day later. “You can see by the mad scramble to support Zelenskyy and Ukraine that they are afraid of the consequences of their past miscreance,” said Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Back in 2019, Trump, his personal lawyer and allies in his administration pushed for Zelenskyy, a former comedian and political novice, to announce an investigation into Biden and to search for evidence that Ukraine had worked to elect Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, proof of which supposedly existed on a computer hidden somewhere in that country. That false story, according to U.S. officials, was concocted by Russian intelligence in an attempt to deflect attention from their own successful work to put Trump into the White House in that election, Trump, nevertheless, demanded Ukraine act on the Russian conspiracy theory and held up $391 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine. In a now-infamous phone call with Zelenskyy, Trump asked him for “a favor,” which led to a whistleblower complaint that sparked Trump’s first impeachment. Among 197 Republicans in the House and 53 in the Senate, only one — Utah Sen. Mitt Romney — voted that Trump had abused his power and should be removed from office because of it. Some argued that while Trump’s call with Zelenskyy might have been improper, it did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. Others, like Maine’s Susan Collins, said that the House impeachment vote by itself would be enough to chasten Trump and dissuade him from such behavior in the future. “The president has been impeached. That’s a pretty big lesson,” she said. Trump, though, was not at all chastened. In fact, the morning after the Senate voted not to remove him from office, he held a raucous celebration in the White House itself. “It was evil, it was corrupt, it was dirty cops, it was leakers and liars,” he said as dozens of GOP lawmakers whooped and cheered in the East Room. Two years later, Trump is out of office, having lost his reelection and failed in his attempt to overthrow the republic to remain in power. Five thousand miles to the east, Zelenskyy has become a global hero for his leadership against Putin’s aggression. “It’s dangerous to judge anything in the moment, but Trump’s fawning comments about Putin, disdain for NATO and strong-arming of Zelenskyy may be a heavy burden for Republicans moving forward,” said David Axelrod, the Democratic consultant behind former President Barack Obama’s 2008 victory. “You can see by the mad scramble to support Zelenskyy and Ukraine that they are afraid of the consequences of their past miscreance.” It’s unclear exactly how much Republicans’ support for Trump — and indirectly, for Putin — in late 2019 and early 2020 will matter in November 2022 as the GOP tries to take control of both chambers of Congress. Neil Newhouse, a prominent Republican pollster, estimates the potential effect at “nada.” “There is very little chance that legislators’ votes against Trump’s impeachment regarding Ukraine will impact a single vote in the ’22 election,” he said. “It’s ancient history to most voters and of little relevance to the current conflict.” “Voters vote on the issues that are affecting their lives today, and never on what happened in the previous administration,” added Rick Tyler, a GOP consultant who worked on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s 2016 presidential campaign. Amanda Carpenter, a former Cruz aide in his Senate office, said tying candidates to Trump’s pro-Putin, anti-Ukraine scheme could work but would require considerable effort from Democrats. “Are Democrats going to make that a top campaign issue? I don’t see them making the impeachment vote a priority,” she said. “This is a moment where we need unity on supporting Ukraine and things are too volatile now to predict how it will play in 2022.” She added that some Republicans’ vocal criticism of Ukraine and Zelenskyy today, such as recent remarks by North Carolina congressman Madison Cawthorn, could prove damaging in specific instances. “Stuff like this on an individual level, that is so clearly out of step with mainstream opinion, could be an issue in certain races,” she said. AEI’s Ornstein agreed. “My guess is that the issue will be muddied enough, and the tribal impulse strong enough that it won’t matter for House members. The Senate could be a little different. It might be that this is an issue that could have an impact at the margins on Ron Johnson, for example,” he said of the Wisconsin Republican seeking reelection. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, for one, hopes Congress and the country can unite on helping Ukraine now and not try to “relitigate” things like Trump’s Ukraine impeachment. “We can’t live in the past,” said Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber. “The past is the past. I think we are where we are.” Igor Bobic contributed reporting.",4.594823146298682,4.259581966000666,0.3352411802980164,11

Images circulated around the world show four people lying bloodied and motionless on the pavement in Irpin, Ukraine, after they were fired on by Russian troops. Three of them were Serhiy Perebyinis’ loved ones: his wife, Tatiana, his 18-year-old son, Mykyta, and 9-year-old daughter, Alisa. The fourth was Anatoly Berezhnyi, a 26-year-old church volunteer who was helping the family, according to the Times. “I recognized the luggage and that is how I knew,” Perebyinis told the newspaper. Times photographer Lynsey Addario captured a widely viewed image of the four civilians that appeared on the paper’s front page. Perebyinis, a computer programmer, was not with his family because he was caring for his mother in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, he told The Washington Post. He said his two dogs had also died. “I lost everyone and lost the meaning of life,” he told the Post, calling what happened to his family a “war crime.” Tatiana Perebyinis was the chief accountant for a software company headquartered in London, SE Ranking. The company said Monday it was devastated to learn of her death. “There are no words to describe our grief or to mend our pain,” the company said, adding that it was crucial to them that the family did not become “statistics.” “Her family became the victim of the unprovoked fire on civilians, which under any law is a crime against humanity,” the statement read. On Sunday, as residents of Irpin were trying to flee the area, Russian forces fired mortar shells on the city, including a bridge being used by evacuees, killing at least eight people, including Perebyinis’ family. Video from the moment of the strike shows a Ukrainian soldier standing outside a building before a sudden blast. As the debris and dust clear, soldiers can be seen running to a number of bodies on the ground. Someone is heard screaming for a medic, and a dog can be heard barking and howling. Ukraine has accused Russia of indiscriminately shelling heavily populated areas and violating agreements on humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians. On Wednesday, at least three people, including a child, were killed after a Russian airstrike on a hospital in the city of Mariupol, the city council said. At least 549 civilians have been reported killed in the Russian invasion, though the real figure is likely higher, according to the United Nations. Perebyinis told the Times he felt it was important that his family members’ deaths were recorded on camera. “The whole world should know what is happening here,” he said.

Cause it seems like the tensions are high. How does this all end? Is this going to be a long-term thing? How do you see it unfolding?” Nelk Boys founder Kyle Forgeard asked the former president during a sit-down discussion about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Well, and I said this a long time ago, if this happens, we are playing right into their hands. Green energy. The windmills don’t work. They’re too expensive. They kill all the birds. They ruin your landscapes,” Trump answered. “And yet the environmentalists love the windmills. And I’ve been preaching this for years. The windmills ― and I had them way down ― but the windmills are the most expensive energy you can have. And they don’t work.” Trump has a long-documented hatred of wind turbines, ever since a protracted and failed legal fight to stop Scottish officials from building what he called a “really ugly wind farm” in view of his Aberdeen golf resort. He routinely spouts bizarre lies about windmills, including the widely-mocked claim that the noise they make causes cancer. OMG I’m dying!!! On a UFC podcast today, Trump is asked how he sees the war in Ukraine playing out and he launches into a riff about windmills!  He continued to discuss windmills for some time before telling an anecdote about giving a “white flag” as a gift to former German Chancellor Angela Merkel over discussions about Nord Stream 2, a controversial natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. Both the U.S. and U.K. are banning oil imports from Russia to punish the Kremlin for its war on Ukraine, causing a spike in already-high gas prices for Americans. It seems Trump was citing a theory in right-wing circles that the crisis in Ukraine was a ploy to push alternative energy, as rising gas prices could force the adaption of cleaner energy such as wind turbines. Last month, for example, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson suggested that the Biden administration was provoking conflict with Russia to make a play against fossil fuels and push for renewable energy.

From the cities of Kharkiv to Mariupol to Chernigov, they are being absolutely flattened. And from all corners of this country, people are fleeing for safety.” “In the city of Mariupol, people are drinking water from puddles because the Russian forces haven’t allowed them to get out. When they have tried to get out, they are shelled.” “And don’t take it from my word, take it from the words of some of those who are trying to flee,” he added, cutting to footage of tearful civilians trying to escape. After Greg Gutfeld said the media is airing emotionally manipulating viewers on Ukraine to push a narrative, Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall pushes back:""Speaking as someone on the ground, I want to say that this is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response.""  During a discussion about Russia’s targeting of Ukrainian civilians, Gutfeld questioned the news coverage of the conflict, suggesting it was being manipulated to try to create a reaction. “I can feel the galvanizing force of these stories that kind of have sped up and are accumulating to create a narrative,” the Fox News host said. “And they only go in one direction. And I understand why they only go in one direction, because it’s the invaded who experience the atrocity, right? And that’s all we’re going to see.” “However, I can’t help but feel that this is a lot like other stories that we’ve gone through in the Digital Age in which an image is taken and then played over and over and over again to create some kind of emotional response out of you, because that makes a profit for news companies, right?” he added. Here are Greg Gutfeld's comments that preceded Benjamin Hall's rebuke live from Ukraine:""This is a lot like other stories...in which an image is taken and then played over and over and over again to create some kind of emotional response out of you, because that makes a profit""  He then drew a link between coverage of Ukraine and media reporting on police brutality in 2020, which he implied was overblown and led to “a year of riots.” “Just because the news is pushing these videos at you doesn’t mean you gotta do something,” he said. He later responded to his colleague’s comments from the war zone, calling it a “cheap attack.” “Should I address Benjamin Hall’s cheap attack on me or be a good co-worker and let it slide?” he asked his colleague Dana Perino. “I will be the better man here,” he continued. “As I said before, when this started, we want the quickest end possible. My concern has always been, when a narrative creates a story that bolsters one side, that is out of its element, will you create more suffering?” More than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded it two weeks ago, according to the United Nations.

In an open letter to employees, McDonald’s president and CEO Chris Kempckinski said: “Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.” Because of its large size and global reach, the chain is often copied by other companies if it takes a stance on an issue or makes a major operational change. The Big Mac became available in Russia on Jan. 31, 1990, when the opening of the first McDonald’s in the final months of the Soviet Union drew international attention. That day over 30,000 people queued around the block for a first taste of U.S. fast food, representing the thawing of Cold War tensions and an increasing appetite among young people for a slice of Americana. The BBC’s Moscow correspondent, Steve Rosenberg, was among many to comment on the significance of the decision. He wrote on Twitter: “In 1990 I was in the queue when McDonald’s opened its 1st restaurant in Moscow: when iron curtains were crumbling & Russia was embracing the West. Today McDonald’s announced it is temporarily closing its 850 restaurants in Russia. Hugely symbolic.” In 1990 I was in the queue when McDonald's opened its 1st restaurant in Moscow: when iron curtains were crumbling & Russia was embracing the West.

Some cited the “McDonald’s peace theory” – the idea first expounded by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman that no two countries with a McDonald’s will ever go to war. McDonald’s leaving Russia. End of an era. I guess McDonald’s peace theory holds again Pressure has been mounting on McDonald’s and other Western companies that had remained in Russia to pull out. Following the McDonald’s announcement, other iconic U.S. brands – Coca-Cola and Pepsi – said they would pause operations in the country. PepsiCo, the soft-drink and snack maker, will suspend all advertising in Russia and stop the sale of its drinks brands, and rival Coca-Cola said it will suspend its business there. Coffee chain Starbucks also said Tuesday it is suspending all business activity in Russia, including shipment of its products and cafes run by a licensee. Earlier, Shell stopped buying oil from Russia and said it would cut links to the country entirely while the United States stepped up its campaign to punish Moscow by banning Russian oil and energy imports. Britain too said it would ban imports of Russian oil but only by gradually phasing them out during 2022 to give businesses time to find alternative sources of supply.

The U.N. email, with the subject line “Ukraine crisis communication guidelines,” was intended for internal use by staff. It also reminded workers to be careful about personal use of social media. “We, as international civil servants, have a responsibility to be impartial,” the email read. Zelenskyy said his representatives contacted the U.N. following the disclosure, first reported in the Irish Times on Tuesday. “We made everything clear and quickly received assurances: there will be no lies in the U.N. structures,” Zelenskyy said. “There will be no playing along with the aggressor. The word ‘war’ will be heard on this site. Because that is the truth. We will not allow anyone in the world to ignore the suffering and murder of our people, our children.” Earlier, Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba accused the U.N. of censorship. “It’s hard to believe that the UN could essentially impose the same kind of censorship as the Kremlin imposes inside Russia now by banning the use of words ‘war’ and ‘invasion’ among UN staff,” Kuleba tweeted on Tuesday. “I urge the UN to swiftly refute such reports if they are false. UN reputation at stake.” It’s hard to believe that the UN could essentially impose the same kind of censorship as the Kremlin imposes inside Russia now by banning the use of words ‘war’ and ‘invasion’ among UN staff. I urge the UN to swiftly refute such reports if they are false. UN reputation at stake. In a since-deleted tweet posted on Tuesday, the official U.N. spokesperson account said the staff email was “fake.” A subsequent tweet omitted that assertion. It is simply not the case that staff have been instructed not to use words like “war” and “invasion” to describe the situation. In fact, on Monday, the head of political affairs @DicarloRosemary tweeted this: Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general, did not deny the email was sent to staff, but told the Irish Times “it can not be considered official policy.” Dujarric on Tuesday told reporters at the U.N. daily press briefing that there were no banned words for staff on the subject of Ukraine. “I just wanted to correct the mistaken impression that U.N. staff were told to avoid using certain words to describe the situation in Ukraine,” Dujarric said. “It’s simply not the case that there was some sort of global instructions to all U.N. staff not to use words like ‘war’ or ‘invasion’ to describe the situation.” From today's noon briefing: the @UN does not have a list of banned words when it comes to describing the war in Ukraine.

The White House confirmed on Monday that Biden had sent a group of U.S. officials to Caracas for renewed talks last weekend. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the “ongoing” discussions included dialogue about “energy security” — a suggestion that the U.S. had discussed potentially easing the de facto embargo it placed on Venezuela’s oil industry in 2019. The attempt to reengage Maduro is the latest sign that the U.S. is reassessing its foreign policy in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine to mitigate the effects of isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin — including potential fuel shortages that have pushed domestic gas prices to record highs. U.S. overtures to Venezuela sparked bipartisan criticism, particularly from hawkish foreign policy voices that have egged on an aggressive approach to Maduro. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) criticized the White House on Monday for placating a human rights abuser who has overseen disputed elections and dismantled Venezuelan democracy in exchange for domestic political relief that may not materialize. But many others have welcomed the potential shift, and not just because Venezuelan oil may help reduce gas prices that reached $4.17 per gallon across the United States on Tuesday even before Biden announced a new ban on Russian oil imports. The United States’ approach to Venezuela, which has spent the last five years mired in economic, political and migration crises, has been disastrous: It has failed to mitigate the humanitarian damage of those crises, and perhaps even helped make it worse. Now, Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine may have provided just enough space for a much-needed reset to finally begin. “The puzzle we’ve all had for the past several months is: Why doesn’t the Biden administration do something to change course from the Trump policy?” said David Smilde, a University of Tulane professor and Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. “It took the conflict in Ukraine to provide the straw that broke the camel’s back, to get Biden to change things around a bit.” The U.S. and Venezuela have sparred for two decades, ever since socialist President Hugo Chávez won his first election in 1999. Maduro, who assumed the presidency upon Chávez’s 2013 death, has been a thorn in the side of Biden’s two immediate predecessors. In 2015, President Barack Obama sanctioned seven Venezuelan government officials amid concerns that Maduro’s government had engaged in widespread corruption, as well as crackdowns on political opponents. President Donald Trump followed with new sanctions in both 2017 and 2018, when Maduro emerged victorious from elections that his opponents, the United States and many international organizations alleged were rife with fraud. In 2019, the U.S. (along with dozens of other countries) recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country’s legitimate leader and launched a “maximum pressure” campaign meant to dislodge Maduro from power. Trump’s approach to Venezuela, while popular in some quarters, was quickly exposed as nakedly political and broadly impractical. He empowered hard-line appointees whose saber-rattling toward Maduro included repeated refusals to take implausible military actions off the table. This was primarily meant to shore up support among Venezuelan voters in South Florida, the fastest-growing Latino population in the swing state, and among large populations of Cuban American voters who see Maduro as an extension of Cuba’s Communist government. From that standpoint, Trump’s approach was successful: It helped him gain massive ground among Latino voters in the Miami area and easily win Florida in the 2020 election. But by nearly every other measure, the maximum pressure campaign toward Venezuela has been an abject, and sometimes tragicomic, failure. The U.S. pressure campaign further brutalized Venezuela’s economy, which had already experienced hyperinflation and severe energy, food and medicine shortages. But it largely failed to hit Maduro and top government officials. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s weaponization of humanitarian assistance for political purposes, along with its decision to undermine negotiations between Maduro and the Venezuelan opposition, cratered any hope of real progress and did almost nothing to alleviate a humanitarian crisis that had driven millions of Venezuelans into extreme poverty or out of the country. “The maximum pressure campaign toward Venezuela has been an abject, and sometimes tragicomic, failure.” By the time Trump left office, Guaidó was largely impotent at home and losing support abroad, and his opposition movement deeply splintered. Maduro, by contrast, was by most accounts stronger and more stable than he was when the campaign kicked off, free to continue to crack down on political opponents, dissenters and human rights. Ties between Caracas and Moscow had also deepened: As the U.S. ramped up pressure on Caracas, Russia expanded its oil holdings in Venezuela and helped Maduro and his government evade American sanctions. The policy was, in sum, the exact catastrophe many experts had warned it would become. “Sanctions without a more comprehensive strategy are an absolute waste of time,” said Brian Fonseca, a foreign affairs professor at Florida International University and former analyst at the United States Southern Command. “Sanctions are an instrument meant to encourage discussion, but there’s got to be discussion.” Still, Biden maintained the broad tenets of the maximum pressure strategy upon taking office in 2021. He continued to recognize Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader and left the aggressive sanctions regime in place. Despite growing calls for change from foreign policy officials, members of Congress and some members of the Venezuelan opposition, a strategic shift seemed unlikely to materialize before the 2022 elections, especially as Democrats fretted about further erosion of support among South Florida voters. But then, the Russian invasion of Ukraine shifted American priorities both domestically and internationally. Abroad, Biden’s efforts to thwart Putin have taken foreign policy precedence over hard-line tactics toward countries like Venezuela. At home, political concerns over modest engagement with Maduro have taken a backseat to a much bigger worry: that rising gas prices, which Biden desperately attempted to characterize as “Russia’s fault” on Tuesday, might crater Democrats in upcoming midterm elections that already seem likely to generate sizable Democratic losses. Engagement with Maduro still makes for a touchy political subject in Florida, but Latino voters there may be open to a course change as well. A majority of Venezuelan American voters in Florida said that foreign policy is somewhat or very important to their voting decisions in a recent poll conducted by the Latino Public Opinion Forum at Florida International University. Roughly 45% said they disapprove of Biden’s continuation of Trump’s maximum pressure approach to Maduro, compared to just 37% who support it, and nearly two-thirds said the sanctions had either fallen short of their expectations or “failed completely” to meet their expectations of change in Venezuela. Roughly 60% of Venezuelan American voters — and an even larger share of Cuban American voters — said they could support an easing of oil sanctions if Maduro didn’t manage new oil revenues and they were directed toward the country’s humanitarian crisis, the poll found. “The findings suggested that the diaspora would be open to lifting things like oil sanctions,” Fonseca said. “When you look at priorities, they don’t think the sanctions are having an effect, and they see the humanitarian crisis as more important than beating the [Maduro] government.” That atmosphere has provided a natural backdrop for a shift in relations. Venezuela likely can’t produce enough oil to fully offset Russian imports. But, like much of the oil the U.S. buys from Russia, Venezuelan oil is of the heavy crude variety, making it a natural replacement at U.S. refineries along the Gulf and East coasts that were specifically built to turn heavy crude into gasoline. It will likely take months for Venezuela to ramp up its oil production to previous capacities if sanctions are eased, but even an immediate injection could help dampen price spikes in the U.S. over the coming months. From a foreign policy standpoint, engaging Maduro now could have multiple benefits as the U.S. and Europe seek new ways to counter Putin’s aggression. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela increased U.S. dependence on Russia: American imports of Russian oil have doubled since the U.S. placed sanctions on Venezuelan oil in 2019. Easing the sanctions on Venezuela now could both weaken Russia’s oil industry and its overall ties with its strongest ally in the Americas. That could limit Russia’s power in the Western Hemisphere, a region the U.S. still paternalistically views as its own backyard. But it may also make it easier for Biden to place new and alternative sanctions on Putin and Rosneft — Russia’s largest oil company, a subsidiary of which the U.S. has already sanctioned in Venezuela — if he chooses to, Fonseca said, providing the U.S. with another potential way to combat Putin’s advances in Europe. Eased sanctions could also lead to renewed diplomatic negotiations with Maduro and advances toward a resolution to Venezuela’s democratic, economic and humanitarian crises. The U.S. and Venezuela appear to have made little progress during the initial round of discussions. But on Monday, Maduro signaled his openness to more talks with the U.S. — and pledged to restart negotiations with the Venezuelan opposition. Previous rounds of talks stalled in October when Maduro abruptly backed out. “Easing the sanctions on Venezuela now could both weaken Russia’s oil industry and its overall ties with its strongest ally in the Americas.” The path forward is difficult and full of caveats. The U.S. and the Venezuelan opposition still want a pledge for new rounds of “free and fair elections,” while Maduro wants the U.S. to lift sanctions completely. Maduro, Smilde said, has used past negotiations as a stall tactic to maintain or consolidate his domestic power, and the Venezuelan opposition has already expressed concerns that he’s preparing to do so again. But some progress does seem possible: On Tuesday night, Venezuela released two of the six former Citgo executives it had detained in October after the U.S. secured the extradition of a key Maduro ally in Colombia. Five of the six detainees, who had been serving house arrest sentences, are American citizens; the other is a U.S. permanent resident. The release of two prisoners may not yet mark a return to the pre-October status quo, but it’s at least a suggestion that further talks could achieve more if the U.S. presses Maduro for substantive democratic and human rights reforms. As part of the ongoing talks, the U.S. “needs to require a commitment that actual progress is made,” Smilde said. “They need to get some actual commitments from Maduro, and work on actual democratic issues.” “There’s a lot of space for improvement this year in terms of electoral institutions and electoral democracy, so it’d be great if they focus on that and not just on U.S. citizens that are prisoners in Venezuela,” Smilde added. “The ironing out or forging of some actual commitments on human rights is something that could make this go in the right direction.” The alternative is continuing a strategy that has paid little dividend. On Monday, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) opined that the only thing Biden should negotiate with Maduro is “the time of his resignation,” the sort of empty rhetoric U.S. officials have aimed south for three years with no real plan to back it up. “The bottom line,” Fonseca said, “is that our policy has done little to move the needle. And so this may be an opportunity for us to rethink and recalibrate our policy towards Venezuela.”",4.332711210211774,3.913759006352613,0.4189522038591611,21
2022-03-09,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-russian-oil_n_6228fecee4b031ec52a02dea,"In Trump’s Putin Rehab Tour, One Sticking Point: A Big Jump In Russian Oil On His Watch","WASHINGTON — As former President Donald Trump works to rehabilitate his image on Ukraine by hammering his successor on Russian oil imports, he is hamstrung by his own record on the issue: an increase of 39% of petroleum products from that country over his four years. “We should not be buying Russian energy,” Trump said recently at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida, part of an extended effort to rewrite his Vladimir Putin-friendly presidency into something more attuned to the current sentiment about the Russian dictator. “No president was ever as tough on Russia as I was.” Trump, though, has not explained why Russian oil imports increased from 142.0 million barrels in 2017, his first year in office, to 197.7 million barrels in 2020 — an increase of 39%. In contrast, Russian oil went from 205.5 million barrels in 2009, predecessor Barack Obama’s first year, to 161.3 million barrels in 2016, his eighth and final year in office — a decrease of 22%. Trump’s staff did not respond to HuffPost queries about the matter. In reality, the imports of crude oil and other petroleum products from Russia into the United States have never accounted for more than a small percentage of this country’s demand. Moreover, purchase decisions are made by individual traders and refinery operators seeking the cheapest source at any given moment, not by the federal government. The decrease in Russian oil during Obama’s administration coincided with an increase of cheaper U.S. oil thanks to a boom in fracking in shale deposits, according to oil industry analysts. This continued two years into Trump’s years before Russian imports started increasing again as OPEC producers sought to build markets in India and other developing nations, making Russian oil somewhat less expensive in comparison. Still, the comments by Trump and other Republicans suggest that the U.S. should have actively cut off Russia from the American market some time ago. That did not happen until this week, when President Joe Biden signed an executive order banning such imports on Monday. Trump’s recent criticism of Russia’s invasion marks a radical departure from his decades of praise for the country and its longtime ruler. In a 2007 letter to Putin, Trump told him he was “a big fan” of his. Five years later — after Putin had already invaded Chechnya and Georgia ― Trump posted on Twitter: “Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow ― if so, will be become my new best friend?” For many years — including during his run for president in 2015 and 2016 — Trump sought a deal to build a condo tower in Moscow. Also in 2016, when asked why he supported a “killer” like Putin, Trump responded that the United States had also killed people. That same year, he openly asked for Russian help in the November election, and then used that help on a daily basis during the campaign’s final month. Once in office, Trump continued to praise Putin, as well as other authoritarian rulers around the globe, saying he was proud to get along with them. According to his onetime national security adviser John Bolton, Trump tried continually to end sanctions on Russia and prominent Russians, but met resistance from Bolton and others in his administration. “Putin saw Trump doing a lot of his work for him,” Bolton told Julie Mason’s XM radio show Wednesday morning. “He thought maybe in a second term, Trump would make good on his desire to get out of NATO and that would ease Putin’s path just a bit more.” Fiona Hill, a Russia expert on the National Security Council during Trump’s years, said while it was true that the U.S. government imposed new sanctions and took other steps against Russia during his term, it was done in spite of Trump, not because of him. “The tough steps were taken by his administration, true, and he didn’t block,” she said. “But that’s about it.” In 2019, Trump tried to persuade the other large, industrialized democracies in the G-7 to readmit Russia, which had been expelled because of its invasion and annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. He defended that annexation because Russia had subsequently built a base there for its “large and powerful submarines.” Also that year, Trump tried to extort Ukraine’s new president into announcing an investigation into Joe Biden, then the Democrat he feared most as a 2020 challenger. He held $391 million in congressionally approved military aid hostage — thereby helping Putin’s continued efforts to weaken Ukraine. That president, Volodomyr Zelenskyy, is now hailed around the world for his leadership as his country fights Putin’s current invasion. Trump’s praise for Putin continued even as the Russian dictator began that second invasion of Ukraine last month. “I said, this is genius. Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine — Putin declares it as independent,” he told radio hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton. “Oh, that’s wonderful. So Putin is now saying it’s independent — a large section of Ukraine. I said, how smart is that? And he’s going to go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s the strongest peace force. We could use that on our southern border.” Days later, at CPAC, Trump still did not criticize Putin by name, but had stopped praising the invasion. “This is an assault on humanity. So sad,” he said instead. After Trump’s Ukraine extortion scheme became public thanks to a whistleblower, he was eventually impeached for it in early 2020, but was allowed to remain in office by Senate Republicans. He was impeached a second time in his final days in office for trying to overthrow the republic by inciting a riot to block the certification of his election loss.",3.999534099409798,3.34083439384341,0.6586997055663879,24

He’s a dictator. And I think he’s murdering people right now.” During an interview on a right-wing talk radio program last month, Trump lauded Putin’s strategy for invading the country. “I said, ‘This is genius,’” Trump said as he recalled watching the news after Putin declared two sections of Ukraine to be independent and ordered troops to storm the regions for alleged “peacekeeping” purposes. “So, Putin is now saying, ‘It’s independent, a large section of Ukraine.’ I said, ‘How smart is that?’ And he’s going to go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s the strongest peace force,” Trump said. “We could use that on our southern border,” he added. “That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re going to keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy.” CNN's @mkraju asks House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy about Trump's lavish praise of Putin:""I do not think anything's savvy or genius about Putin,"" McCarthy says in a rare break from Trump.  McCarthy also said he agreed with former Vice President Mike Pence’s comment last week that there is no room in the Republican Party for “apologists for Putin.” Trump has since described the invasion of Ukraine as “a Holocaust” and “a horrible thing that’s happening,” urging Russia to stop killing Ukrainians. However, he has not walked back his praise of Putin. Trump has also repeatedly claimed that conflict would not have happened if he was still president. Some of his allies on the far-right have behaved similarly. When Russian aggression against Ukraine had not yet escalated into a full-scale invasion, Fox News host Tucker Carlson defended Putin, parroting Kremlin talking points in an infamous rant on Feb. 22 with such efficacy that Russian TV later aired segments of his broadcast.

Anastasiia Laletina, 19, pulled out of her biathlon middle-distance sitting race on Tuesday morning after she learned that her father — a soldier in the Ukrainian army — was taken prisoner by Russian invaders, the Agence France-Presse reported. “They beat him,” team spokesperson Nataliia Harach told the news agency. “She was very upset and couldn’t take part in the race.” Harach said Laletina was resting and receiving support from the team’s doctor. She also said that a Ukrainian team coach’s home in Kharkiv was recently bombed. The Ukraine Federation of Sports for Persons with Locomotor Disabilities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ukrainian team is doing exceptionally well at the winter games in Beijing, despite the emotional toll of the harrowing circumstances in their country. It has racked up six gold medals so far, and is second to China, which leads the pack with eight, according to The Guardian. Russia was banned from the games after the nation invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, shortly after the Winter Olympics wrapped up in Beijing. Russian para-athletes were sent home from Beijing on Friday — the day of the opening ceremony for the Paralympic Games — while the Ukrainian team had to escape war zones to participate, per The Associated Press. “It’s a miracle that we have made it to the Paralympics,” Ukrainian delegation head Valerii Sushkevych told the AP. The Ukrainian athletes are under intense stress due to the invasion of their home country, Sushkevych told The New York Times. He said their eyes are red and puffy and that they cling to their phones, hoping for updates, and only set them down moments before an event starts. Sushkevych said the Paralympics are very popular in Ukraine, and that the competition is typically somewhat of a holiday in the country. “[But] today, no,” he told the Times, partially through an interpreter. “I ask the athletes in the morning, ‘Did you sleep?’ I ask another, ‘Did you sleep?’ They say, ‘No, no.’ They have dull, sad faces. The mood is very difficult. We are all thinking of home.” Still, the Ukrainian athletes have decided that competing in the international event is of utmost importance to them. “We, the Paralympic team, have our battles in Beijing,” Sushkevych told the Times. “If we did not come here, it would be like losing position, like capitulation.” Paralympic athlete Oksana Shyshkova, who won Ukraine’s fourth gold medal in a cross-country ski event Monday, echoed this sentiment to the Times. “We’re here to represent our country … to glorify our country, to tell the world that Ukraine exists,” she said.",5.745181373805692,4.593321309083636,1.1518600647220563,1

A rapidly changing list of the companies compiled by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, shows representation across a broad range of industries, from Apple to Exxon, McDonald’s to Maersk. McDonald’s decision Tuesday to “temporarily” close its restaurants and pause operations in Russia is particularly symbolic. The burger chain was among the first Western brands to begin operating in the former Soviet Union in 1990 under Mikhail Gorbachev’s policy of perestroika. At the end of last year, McDonald’s operated around 850 restaurants in the country, 84% of which were operated directly by the company as opposed to franchisees. The company employs 62,000 people in Russia and serves millions of customers there each day. McDonald’s said Tuesday it would continue to pay the salaries of its Russian and Ukrainian employees. Sonnenfeld’s list is more than just a tally of companies wary of Moscow, however: It also inventories the companies doing business in Russia that have so far chosen to remain. Among them are big names like Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, and Pepsi, all of which are facing increasingly loud calls to take action. While a humanitarian argument can be made for consumer brands like these choosing to remain in operation, Sonnenfeld isn’t convinced. In an article comparing the current economic sanctions to those imposed on South Africa in the 1980s in an effort to dismantle apartheid, Sonnenfeld argued economic pain is kind of the point. “Reagan’s argument [in 1986] was that sanctions would in fact hurt South African Black people and not solve the problems of Apartheid, while we lose positive influence,” he wrote. “Those are the same counterarguments echoed today about not hurting Russia’s population. The purpose of sanctions, however, is to impose pain without the violence of war.” “Vladimir Putin, the most vicious autocrat of this century, rules through tyranny and fear. As he continues to fail, people will lose their fear and he will lose his power,” he added.",3.6800232463697786,4.5173073581559935,-0.8372841117862149,27

Citing U.S. and Middle Eastern officials, the Journal reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the UAE’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan both declined requests to speak to Biden amid dissatisfaction in both countries over U.S. policy in the region. “There was some expectation of a phone call, but it didn’t happen,” a U.S. official told the Journal, referring to the planned discussion between the Saudi crown prince and Biden. “It was part of turning on the spigot” of Saudi oil. Biden did, however, speak with the crown prince’s father, King Salman, on Feb. 9, the Journal reported. Officials said relations had grown strained between the U.S. and the two Persian Gulf nations over the Biden administration’s lack of support for the war in Yemen and its revived negotiations on the Iran nuclear deal. Saudi officials reportedly also seek legal immunity for the Saudi crown prince, who faces multiple lawsuits in the U.S., including over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The White House has looked to Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for talks about increasing oil production to offset the effect of the Ukraine crisis on energy markets. Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on Russian oil imports, a major escalation of sanctions that will cause further price hikes for American consumers. Saudi and Emirati officials had earlier this month rejected calls to pump more oil, saying they would stick to a production agreement approved by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+), an alliance that includes Russia.

Quote, ‘I appreciate and admire President Zelenskyy’s desire to join NATO,’” Carlson began, selectively quoting one sentence from the vice president’s lengthy remarks at a news conference in Munich, Germany, on Feb. 20. “Message: Up yours, Vladimir Putin, go ahead and invade Ukraine,” Carlson continued. “And, of course, Vladimir Putin did that just days later. So the invasion was no surprise to the Biden administration. They knew that would happen. That was the point of the exercise. “We watched all this happen, we missed it. How? Honestly because it was insane and therefore very hard to take seriously. Why in the world would the United States intentionally seek war with Russia? How could we possibly benefit from that war? We still don’t know the answer to that question.” As Russian aggression escalated in February, Biden warned repeatedly and publicly that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was likely imminent and said the U.S. would respond “swiftly and decisively” to any attack. It’s not clear how Carlson “missed it.” At the time of those warnings, he was still defending Putin and parroting Kremlin talking points. Take a minute to listen. @TuckerCarlson is actually accusing America of starting this war. Not Putin. Not Russia. But America. It’s our fault. He’s blaming America for launching this war. Tucker channels today’s GOP. And today’s GOP is the new “blame America” party. The absurd take comes after frantic backtracking on Carlson’s part in the wake of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Several excerpts from his show have been translated to serve as propaganda on Russian state-sponsored TV, including one in which he argued that “Ukraine is not a democracy” but “a client state of the Biden administration.” Since Putin launched Russia’s offensive on the country, Carlson has admitted he was wrong and complained that he was falsely accused of rooting for Russia. But instead of taking ownership of the mistake, he professes to have been taken by surprise by the whole thing, wondering, “Why didn’t we see this coming?” and trying instead to pin the blame on President Joe Biden and Harris. In reality, Western powers had warned of Russian aggression for months.",4.163670686228958,4.191725667757393,-0.02805498152843544,24

He probably shouldn’t hold his breath. Even before Biden’s announcement from the White House that he was banning all Russian petroleum products from the United States, the GOP’s de facto leader, former President Donald Trump, had put out a statement in all capitals: “BREAKING NEWS: HIGHEST GAS PRICES IN HISTORY! DO YOU MISS ME YET?” And no sooner had the White House released the language of the executive order than did Ronna McDaniel, who chairs the Republican National Committee, put the blame for higher prices directly on Biden. “Families know Biden’s agenda is to blame for the pain at the pump, and no series of lies will change the reality of his failures,” McDaniel said in a statement, which expressed no support for Biden’s action and contained no references to Ukraine or Russia’s dictator, President Vladimir Putin. “They aren’t holding on to any principles here. They’re looking for cudgels,” said Amanda Carpenter, a former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas who broke from the Republican Party because of its support for Trump. She added that Biden should make clear to Americans that Republicans supported his move, and that he should also embrace “an all-options above approach” to domestic energy. “If people really want someone to blame, it’s Putin,” she said. “That, also, shouldn’t be hard for Biden to explain.” In his remarks from the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Biden tried to do exactly that, as he made clear he is aware of the political costs of higher gas prices. “Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the gas pump,” he said, calling the increases “Putin’s price hike.” Even before Russia’s buildup of troops along its border with Ukraine last year, Republicans had already been blaming Biden for the increase in fuel costs, which was a predicted result of the economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. Those increases, which took place over the span of a year, pale in contrast to the sharp leap prices have taken since the start of Russia’s invasion. Nationally, prices had gone up about $1.50 over the 15-month period beginning when the COVID vaccine became available in late 2020, but they have risen another 75 cents in just the past two weeks. Oil companies, meanwhile, have seen record profits, as demand and prices have increased with the recovering economy. They’ve plowed nearly $40 billion into stock buybacks that enrich existing shareholders but do nothing to invest in new energy production. Biden alluded to that in his remarks as well. “To the oil and gas companies and to the finance firms that back them, we understand Putin’s war against the people of Ukraine is causing prices to rise. We get that. That’s self-evident,” he said. “But it’s no excuse to exercise excessive price increases, or padding profits or any kind of effort to exploit the situation ... Russia’s aggression is costing us all, and it’s no time for profiteering or price gouging.” Biden also countered GOP claims that domestic production has ground to a halt during his presidency, pointing out that the United States is on track to produce more oil and gas next year than ever before ― even as he argued that the smarter option for the country and the world is to move away from fossil fuels and toward renewables. “It will mean that no one has to worry about price at the gas pump in the future. That’ll mean tyrants like Putin won’t be able to use fossil fuels as weapons against other nations,” Biden said. “And it will make America a world leader in manufacturing and exporting clean energy technologies of the future to countries all around the world. This is the goal we should be racing toward.” On Capitol Hill, one Senate Republican acknowledged that his party bears some responsibility now for gas prices, given Republicans’ advocacy for the Russian oil ban. “I think that we own some of that,” said North Dakota’s Kevin Cramer. “It’s hard for us to escape some of it because we’ve been advocating for this, taking the lead on it. But at the same time, we’ve taken the lead on more policies that can increase domestic production.” Cramer, though, appeared to be a rare voice. Far more common among Republicans were views like that of Cruz. On Tuesday afternoon, the Texas senator posted a boast from December by White House chief of staff Ron Klain that gas prices had decreased 25 cents in recent weeks. Cruz added the comment: “This one aged well.” Igor Bobic contributed to this report.",4.01772697971532,3.6937283811782127,0.32399859853710744,21

Apple halted sales in Russia, Nike and Ikea closed their stores in the country, and Mastercard and Visa suspended their services there. But some large companies, such as PepsiCo, have made no statements condemning the war and have continued business as usual. McDonald’s had not said whether the food giant would continue business in Russia amid the war — until Tuesday afternoon, when the company released a statement saying it will temporarily close all restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in the market. “In Russia, we employ 62,000 people who have poured their hearts and souls into our McDonald’s brand to serve their communities,” the company said. “At the same time, our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine. “Years ago, when confronted with his own difficult decision, [former CEO] Fred Turner explained his approach quite simply: ‘Do the right thing.’ That philosophy is enshrined as one of our five guiding values, and there are countless examples over the years of McDonald’s Corporation living up to Fred’s simple ideal,” the statement continued. “Today is also one of those days.” In a message shared to employees and franchisees, CEO Chris Kempczinski shared that McDonald's will temporarily close all restaurants and pause all operations in Russia. Click to read the message in its entirety.  McDonald’s has 847 restaurants in Russia, and says on its website that operations in Ukraine and Russia amount to approximately 9% of worldwide sales and 3% of profit. The company said it will continue paying the salaries of employees in Ukraine and Russia. Russia accounts for over 4% of PepsiCo’s sales, according to The New York Times. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli warned several companies, including McDonald’s and PepsiCo, on Friday of “significant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risks,” attached with doing business in Russia, according to Reuters. DiNapoli, who oversees the $258.1 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund, wrote in letters to the companies on Friday that reassessing operations in Russia “would address various investment risks associated with the Russian market and play an important role in condemning Russia’s role in fundamentally undermining the international order that is vital to a strong and healthy global economy.” McDonald’s said its Ronald McDonald House Charities will continue to fully operate in Russia, and that the RMHC in Ukraine is partnering with local hospitals to deploy medical supplies and helping provide humanitarian aid throughout the country. PepsiCo did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Other Western-based brands, including Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Burger King, also have attracted criticism for continuing to operate in Russia. Actor Sean Penn, who recently returned to the U.S. after filming a documentary on the Russian invasion in Ukraine, called on Monday for Americans to boycott those brands. “Until Coca-Cola, PepsiCo & McDonalds suspend business in Russia, American citizens have a very safe & simple way to stand with Ukraine,” Penn tweeted. “Any among us can suspend our purchases of their products & ask our friends to consider doing the same.” Until Coca-Cola, PepsiCo & McDonalds suspend business in Russia, American citizens have a very safe & simple way to stand with Ukraine. Any among us can suspend our purchases of their products & ask our friends to consider doing the same. Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba over the weekend called out Shell Oil for buying Russian crude oil. “One question to @Shell: doesn’t Russian oil smell Ukrainian blood for you?” Kuleba wrote on Twitter Friday. “I call on all conscious people around the globe to demand multinational companies to cut all business ties with Russia.” I am told that Shell discretely bought some Russian oil yesterday. One question to @Shell: doesn’t Russian oil smell Ukrainian blood for you? I call on all conscious people around the globe to demand multinational companies to cut all business ties with Russia. Shell announced on Tuesday it would stop buying oil and natural gas from Russia, and said it would close its service stations in the country. “We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel — despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking — was not the right one and we are sorry,” CEO Ben van Beurden said, according to The Associated Press. “As we have already said, we will commit profits from the limited, remaining amounts of Russian oil we will process to a dedicated fund.” Sanjana Karanth contributed to this report.",4.733145070899455,5.5032571693385615,-0.7701120984391068,27

Hopko asked for embargoes on commodities like gas and oil from Russia. (President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the U.S. is banning imports of Russian oil.) She also called for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently did as well. National security experts have warned that establishing a no-fly zone could result in a war between nuclear-armed powers. Hopko grew emotional as she described the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, including hundreds of thousands of people without water in the city of Mariupol, where a 6-year-old girl reportedly died of dehydration in the ruins of a Russian shelling site Tuesday. “I think the world must demonstrate leadership,” she said. “It is horrible. I understand, it’s horrible,” Tur said. She noted that Western powers have so far rejected calls for a no-fly zone to prevent direct conflict with Russia that could escalate into a larger war. “There are a lot of Americans out there who are saying they want a no-fly zone as well,” Tur said. “But again, so far what we’re hearing from officials is they don’t want to start another world war.” ""This is about humanity."" @HopkoHanna talks to @KatyTurNBC about the dire situation in Ukraine as pressure mounts for a no-fly zone.  Breaking down in tears, Hopko said: “There is no explanation. Look, this is not just this one kid.” “We cannot just watch how many Ukrainians are dying. I’m asking Biden, I’m asking Congress: Please help our nation,” she said. “I don’t understand why we have to convince everybody this is about humanity.” More than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine to escape the Russian invasion, according to the United Nations, which called it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. Countries within the NATO alliance, which does not include Ukraine, have sent weapons to Kyiv and levied unprecedented economic sanctions against Russia. However, allies have ruled out actions that would create direct conflict with the country. A no-fly zone would prohibit Russia from using warplanes to attack Ukraine, meaning NATO would be responsible for shooting down planes that violate the declaration. According to intelligence from the U.K., Russia made minimal ground advances over the weekend, but unleashed a high level of air and artillery strikes on military and civilian sites in Ukrainian cities. The U.N. has recorded 406 civilian deaths in Ukraine, including eight people who were reportedly killed in a town west of Kyiv after Russia shelled a civilian evacuation route.",4.076513877965782,3.6181388799332095,0.45837499803257264,3

Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) appears to have a short memory ― or at least hopes voters do ― about the country’s involvement with Ukraine. On Monday, the House minority leader posted a tweet where he expressed regrets that the U.S. didn’t supply Ukraine with weapons earlier and suggested speeding up weapons sales to Taiwan “so they can safeguard their future against China.” Just as the United States should have supplied weapons to Ukraine sooner, we should speed up the sale of weapons to Taiwan so they can safeguard their future against China. The issue with the tweet is that the reason the U.S. didn’t get those weapons to Ukraine earlier is because former President Donald Trump sought a quid pro quo and threatened to withhold $391 million in military aid unless the country investigated his political rival Joe Biden. It was this issue that led to Trump’s first impeachment in December 2019. Many people with apparently better memories than McCarthy happily reminded him and brought receipts.

On Monday, the Russian government released a list of countries it deemed “unfriendly.” The Kremlin has approved a list of countries who have been “unfriendly” to Russia. They include: Australia, UK, EU countries, Iceland, Canada, Liechtenstein, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Korea, San Marino, Singapore, USA, Taiwan, Ukraine, Montenegro, Switzerland, Japan Not surprisingly, the United States and Ukraine made the list, but many Twitter users were surprised that tiny nations like Liechtenstein, Montenegro and San Marino were included. And they had thoughts. So, everyone except China and North Korea basically. And we thought Trump was insecure. So, basically most of the civilized world. Got it. The Kremlin has identified San Marino as being unfriendly to Russia, but apparently not a country like Sweden that is providing weapons to destroy Russian tanks. Really makes you wonder about Russian intelligence.  It would’ve been easier to publish a list of countries who have been “friendly” to Russia, but what do I know? 🤷🏼‍♂️ My new preferred tourism list👇 A few Twitter users thought the list reminded them of a movie, but not a “Cold War” classic like “Rocky IV” or “Red Dawn.” Specifically “Mean Girls.” This is like a nemesis list only it makes me think of mean girls instead Oh cool.

Liechtenstein and San Marino on this list makes it feel a bit like when Kanye said he had beef with Peppa Pig. A few people wondered why San Marino made the list, but they had theories. Really wondered who in San Marino spilled their venti iced quad oat milk latte on Putin, then found out it's a whole ass country LMAO Dan Marino, briefly thinking Russia declared war on him this morning.  San Marino punching above it’s weight. Some jokingly took Russia’s side. Typical shit stirring Liechtenstein.

The Ukraine is on this list and is under attack? Does that mean someone else is next? If they choose the USA the list will go away. But some people noted the list could hurt Russia’s relationship with China since it referred to Taiwan as a country, which goes against China’s insistence that Taiwan is its territory. Hey China, your best friend just called Taiwan a country. They listed Ukraine...??And if Russia is such good buddies with China, listing Taiwan as a country is also pretty awkward.

The Russian embassy in London on Monday tweeted that Russia, which attacked Ukraine, is actually attempting to stop a war in Ukraine. Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine’s U.N. ambassador, held up the tweet, read the message and fired back. “Let me remind the Russian diplomats that in London, in case of need for mental help, you can dial NHS line 111,” he wrote, referring to the emergency number for the National Health Service in the U.K. “Thank you.” Ukrainian Ambassador holds up a tweet from Lavrov and advises Russian diplomats that they can obtain assistance for mental help from the NHS by dialing 111  Russia attacked Ukraine and is currently under investigation for alleged war crimes after multiple reported attacks on civilian targets as well as for creating a massive humanitarian crisis in which 1.5 million people have fled the nation so far. Kyslytsya made headlines soon after the invasion began by delivering a blunt warning to Russian leaders during an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting. “There is no purgatory for war criminals,” he told Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya. “They go straight to hell, ambassador.” On social media, others took issue with the same post from the Russian embassy in London that provoked the response from Kyslytsya: Say what now?

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told The New York Times this week that U.S. analysts don’t have any details about the number of Syrians Russia has recruited or whether they may already be in Ukraine.

2022-03-07,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ukraine-conflict-memes-social-media_n_62252dece4b0bd1df76d6a67,"Westerners, Please Stop With The Memes And Hot Takes On The Ukraine Crisis","You may have heard of “main character syndrome,” a term popularized on TikTok and Instagram. It’s what happens when someone’s desire for individuality mixes with the desire to romanticize their own life, which leads to them feeling (and acting) like life is a movie starring them. In some ways, this little bit of egoism may be harmless — but when you blend main character syndrome with social media and privilege, it can be a recipe for clueless, insensitive and downright strange behavior. Responses to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine have demonstrated this. It’s no surprise that main character syndrome is so intricately linked with social media — after all, what’s the point of acting like your life is a movie if nobody is around to watch it? It becomes problematic, however, when this desire to center yourself in every discourse, dialogue and disaster takes precedence over everything. Even a major European war. As commentator and YouTuber Natalie Wynn put it: “I always hated war, hated Twitter. But somehow I wasn’t prepared for how much I would hate war Twitter.” The past few weeks, timelines have been littered with takes and discourses so atrocious that I find myself wondering if social media can possibly get worse — and then something else goes viral and I remind myself that yes, it actually can. “This person posts a lot, but there’s always this feeling that there’s something left unsaid in their posts: namely, the desire for you to pat them on the back and tell them what a good person they are.” Take, for example, clairvoyants using their tarots to predict the death toll, people fetishizing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a “heartthrob” as he evades assassination attempts, and “90210” star AnnaLynn Mccord’s spoken-word poem in which she somehow positions herself as the would-be savior of Ukraine, if she only had the chance to be Vladimir Putin’s mother. Then there are the particularly egregious Marvel comparisons, such as Twitter threads detailing how Avengers characters would react to the conflict; editing Zelenskyy as Captain America and dubbing him “Captain Ukraine”; or “fan-casting” Jeremy Renner to play the Ukrainian president in an eventual movie about an event that is continuing (and worsening) each day. There are the numerous jokes about being “drafted” coming from people who, unlike the men in Ukraine being pulled out of cars at the border and forcibly conscripted, are tweeting from the middle of the United States. There is the flood of comments on a fake Putin Instagram page calling him “Vladdy Daddy” and begging him to “Plz wait until the next euphoria ep.” We also need to talk about the “slactivists.” Not to be confused with an actual activist, a slacktivist will take pictures of themselves at an anti-war protest like it’s Coachella, then post screenshots of all the money they’re donating to help Ukrainian citizens. This person posts a lot, but there’s always this feeling that there’s something left unsaid in their posts: namely, the desire for you to pat them on the back and tell them what a good person they are. Sometimes, these “activists” may take to social media to explain just how hard it is for them to do the bare minimum. They may confess that they’re suffering from “allyship fatigue,” or say that as an empath, they know exactly how it feels to be a Ukrainian citizen as they tweet from their idyllic bedroom in the suburbs. The only cure for their angst is sharing memes about how they’re “living through a historical event,” even though their lives haven’t changed at all. That isn’t to say that people outside of Ukraine struggling with their mental health are invalid. It’s not wrong or insensitive to be triggered by these current affairs — the problem lies with those people who try to claim that their experiences are equivalent to those of people who are facing injury, death, bereavement and displacement. There’s a multitude of reasons why (mostly white) Westerners centering themselves during the Ukraine crisis is problematic. For one, it’s incredibly dismissive of the pain and day-to-day struggle that Ukrainians are experiencing. By treating themselves as the “main character” of the Ukraine crisis, these people are diminishing its very real importance and far-reaching implications, equating it to being the next big blockbuster starring them. It’s concerning, too, that these kinds of posts also have the potential to drown out Ukrainian voices that are also trying to be heard on social media. Even if many of these posts are going viral because they’re being mocked, that is still a high level of engagement that could have been better utilized elsewhere. And let’s not forget: None of these posts actually help Ukrainians in any way. They might make the poster feel better about themselves, or elevate their self-importance as a part of this “historical event,” but these words and gestures are ultimately hollow — especially if they aren’t followed up with any meaningful action. Rather than centering ourselves in marginalized groups’ crises and yelling into our own echo chambers, we can do three simple things: stop, listen and amplify. Stop sharing posts that spread misinformation, diminish the struggles of Ukrainian people and center yourselves. We need to listen to Ukrainian citizens and reliable, unbiased news sources about ways we can help. And finally, most importantly, we need to amplify the voices of those who are directly involved: sharing their words and their stories rather than constructing our own. For Ukrainians, this is their reality. Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

It started when the controversial lawmaker posted a tweet on Sunday claiming “Biden’s poor decision making leading up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin declaring war on Ukraine.” 1. Tragically, people are dying because of Biden’s poor decision making leading up to Putin declaring war on Ukraine.Biden’s weakness and failure as a leader not only has put America last but is a danger to the entire world. But Vindman, who as a former national security aide offered key testimony in President Donald Trump’s 2019 impeachment for dealings with Ukraine, refused to let Greene’s statement go by without a fact check. “Nope. It’s because you and your pro-Putin party encouraged Putin to invade, by cheerleading him,” Vindman responded. Nope. It’s because you and your pro-Putin party encouraged Putin to invade, by cheerleading him. Worse yet, you undermined @POTUS efforts to signal punishing costs… you undermined U.S. efforts deter the war. You have blood in your hands. The American people will not forget. Vindman’s wife, Rachel Vindman, also chimed in, calling Greene “crazy stupid” and asking, “why do you insist on telling us over and over?” We all know you are crazy stupid but why do you insist on telling us over and over? Greene attacked Vindman, saying he wants to “drag Americans into war with Russia with his big tough tweets and his zoom interviews on CNN,” but didn’t deny the substance of his arguments. Nor did she deny or object to him accusing her and the GOP of being “pro-Putin.” This clown wants to drag Americans into war with Russia with his big tough tweets and his zoom interviews on CNN.Go ahead and go fight yourself since you’re from Ukraine.You are clueless about Americans being fed up with sending our sons and daughters to die in foreign lands. Vindman later responded with a heartfelt tweet reminding Greene and others that he proudly served in the U.S. Army after he and his family came to the country as refugees. This is what service looks like. I served my country--the United States of America who welcomed my refugee family--for 21 years, 6 months, & 10 days in uniform & I continue to serve out of uniform.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg referenced the use of cluster bombs in Ukraine on Friday, according to Reuters. “We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law,” Stoltenberg said. Cluster munitions disperse when fired, causing destruction over a wide area and posing “an immediate threat to civilians,” according to Human Rights Watch. Ukraine has brought a case against Russia at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, seeking a court order to stop the war. For that reason, Ukraine has dispatched visual teams to areas shelled by Russia, according to The Washington Post. Russian lawyers snubbed Monday’s first hearing. The court could decide the case this week. As Western leaders continue to resist Ukraine’s call for imposing a no-fly zone over the country, they are providing more military equipment. Blinken told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that the U.S. is in “very active discussions” with Poland to back-fill any fighter jets provided to Ukraine. “All of us together are continuing to take steps to increase the pressure on Russia through additional sanctions, all of which are very actively under discussion and will be implemented in the in the coming days, as well as taking further steps to give the Ukrainians what they need to defend themselves against the Russian aggression,” Blinken said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that NATO members have the go-ahead to send fighter jets to Ukraine as the U.S. and allies continue their efforts to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's invasion.  Blinken also said the U.S. may heighten economic sanctions, possibly including banning Russian oil imports. Oil prices climbed further on the suggestion. “We are now in very active discussions with our European partners about banning the import of Russian oil to our countries, while of course at the same time maintaining a steady global supply of oil,” Blinken told NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “The actions we’ve taken to date have already had a devastating impact on the Russian economy.” Sec. of State Blinken reiterates this to Chuck Todd on Meet the Press: ""We are now in very active discussions with our European partners about banning the import of Russian oil to our countries, while, of course, at the same time maintaining a steady global supply of oil.""

At least 4,357 people were arrested in 56 cities across the country, and could face years in jail. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently signed a new law that broadly criminalizes the spreading of information that goes against the Kremlin’s account of the incursion. The law effectively prohibits calling the military action in Ukraine a “war” or an “invasion.” Those found violating it, including protesters, can face up to 15 years in prison. Russia’s interior ministry confirmed that it had arrested thousands of people Sunday, including about 1,700 in Moscow and 750 in St. Petersburg. OVD-Info said more than 13,000 people have been arrested in the country since demonstrations began, including journalists and children. “The screws are being fully tightened ― essentially we are witnessing military censorship,” Maria Kuznetsova, a spokesman for OVD-Info, told Reuters. She added that the protests this weekend were “rather big” and had spread to cities in Siberia “where we only rarely such such numbers of arrests.” In some videos posted to social media, protesters could be heard chanting “No to War!” in Moscow and St. Petersburg, statements that would appear to violate Putin’s new legislation.

TikTok said people use the platform as an “outlet for creativity and entertainment that can provide a source of relief and human connection during a time of war,” but emphasized that it needed to prioritize user and employee safety. The company said it will continue to “evaluate the evolving circumstances in Russia to determine when we might fully resume our services with safety as our top priority.” The app’s messaging feature will not be affected for users based in Russia, according to the statement. In response to the conflict in Ukraine, TikTok also recently announced that it would apply labels to identify content published by state-controlled media accounts “to bring viewers context to evaluate the content they consume on our platform.” 1/ TikTok is an outlet for creativity and entertainment that can provide a source of relief and human connection during a time of war when people are facing immense tragedy and isolation. However, the safety of our employees and our users remain our highest priority. Putin and the Russian parliament passed a law on Friday that would punish citizens with up to 15 years in prison if they are found to be “spreading intentionally fake news about the military” and its conflict with Ukraine, Reuters reported. Russia’s new measure makes it a criminal offense to call Putin’s invasion of Ukraine a “war” instead of the Kremlin’s preferred description of “special military operation,” according to The New York Times. Several international news organizations, including CNN, BBC, ABC News, and Germany’s ARD and ZDF, have suspend operations in Russia because of the new law. The Russian parliament has also blocked access to both Facebook and Twitter for its citizens. Other major social media platforms have placed their own restrictions and bans in order to block Russia from spreading misinformation. YouTube and Meta, which operates Instagram and Facebook, banned the accounts of Russian news outlets RT and Sputnik last week. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a tech company based in China. China also strictly monitors the media that circulates within its borders and has close ties to Russia.",5.595366469089368,4.159019804807335,1.4363466642820324,23

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Sunday defended tweeting out a photo from an online meeting with Ukraine’s president, dismissing complaints that participants were asked not to post anything on social media out of concern for the wartime leader’s safety. Rubio insisted that his photo of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was shared before he and others were told by the Ukrainian ambassador not to share any information from the meeting. He also claimed that “there was no security risk” in what he did. The photo remained on his Twitter page Sunday morning. Rep. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) also shared images of Zelenskyy from that meeting while informing their Twitter followers about their participation. “There were over 300 people on this call,” Rubio said in an interview with ABC News’ “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.” “The details of the call were emailed to a bunch of people. And it was a nondescript picture unlike any of the others ― just like the other ones you’ve seen on the air. So there was no security risk there.” Marco Rubio shrugs off tweeting out Zelenskey's photo during his Zoom call:""There was nothing secure about that call. The picture is a nondescript picture... There's no risk posed. But you're always gonna have a couple people who want their name in an article somewhere.""  Rubio further suggested that people who have complained about him posting the photo have done so because they want media attention. “You’re always going to have a couple people who want their name in an article somewhere,” the senator said in a separate interview with CNN’s “State of the Union.” Democratic Reps. Dean Phillips (Minn.) and Jason Crow (Colo.) both called out Rubio and Daines for posting photos. Phillips called the lawmakers’ behavior “appalling and reckless ignorance,” while Crow chastised them for not taking the security concerns seriously. “The lack of discipline in Congress is truly astounding,” Crow tweeted. “If an embattled wartime leader asks you to keep quiet about a meeting, you better keep quiet about the meeting.” The Ukrainian Ambassador very intentionally asked each of us on the zoom to NOT share anything on social media during the meeting to protect the security of President Zelenskyy. Appalling and reckless ignorance by two US Senators. Zelenskyy has been working from bunkers since Russian troops invaded Ukraine and has survived at least three assassination attempts by Kremlin-backed assassins in the past week, according to a Times of London report published Thursday. Representatives for Grassley and Daines did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. CORRECTION: A previous headline on this story misspelled the Ukrainian president’s last name.

And, by going to streets, you’re actually exposing yourself to a greater danger,” said Tolokonnikova, who served more than 21 months in prison for participating in a 2012 protest against Putin. Citing an example of the police brutality that she said is occurring daily, Tolokonnikova said that a 14-year-old friend of her daughter was beaten by police for attending an anti-war protest last week. The child’s father confronted the officers at the protest, she said, and he was then beaten and ultimately hospitalized. “Situations like that, they’re, unfortunately, happening quite often,” Tolokonnikova said. “That’s why I know that a lot of Russians are trying to leave the country. But, also, there are a number of people who are convinced that they should not leave, because they don’t want to give Russia as a gift to Putin. They want to stand their ground.” Tolokonnikova expressed particular enthusiasm over the involvement of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Navalny, who nearly died from a nerve agent poisoning that he has blamed on the Kremlin, has organized daily protests against Putin despite being behind bars. He also called for all Russians, no matter their location, to protest against the invasion — a move Tolokonnikova called “incredible.” “Show the world that Russians don’t want war. Come out in the squares of Berlin, New York, Amsterdam or Melbourne, wherever you are. Now we are all responsible for Russia’s future. For what Russia will be in the eyes of the world,” Navalny wrote Sunday in a blog post, according to Reuters. More than 4,300 people were detained across Russia on Sunday for participating in such protests, according to an independent protest monitoring group. Russia’s interior ministry had said the number detained was around 3,500, Reuters reported. Multiple arrests in central Moscow today as people respond to Navalny’s call for protests. But with Twitter and Facebook blocked, his reach in the country is even more limited.",5.204847735935908,4.925039207424115,0.2798085285117926,8

A sign reading “President Zelensky Way” was posted outside the Consulate of Russia on Sunday afternoon in honor of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been fighting to fend off the invading Russian army. “It was a symbolic gesture on our part,” Claude Taylor, photographer and chair of the progressive Mad Dog PAC, told HuffPost. Taylor said the PAC’s longtime billboard designer, who is going only by his first name, Sean, is currently in Dnipro, Ukraine, with his wife, a citizen of the country.

Taylor said he hoped the block that the Russian embassy takes up could be renamed permanently. In 2020, D.C.

However, it’s the latest entertainment giant to limit its operations over the Kremlin’s ongoing invasion in Ukraine. Other major entertainment companies, including Disney, Sony, Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros., have halted the release of new films in Russia, like “The Batman,” “Turning Red” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 2.” Netflix’s move comes shortly after the company said it would immediately “pause” its Russian television and film productions and that it would refuse to abide by laws that may have forced the company to carry 20 Russian propaganda channels. TikTok also said it would ban all live-streaming and content creation in the country over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s new law that criminalizes whatever he deems “fake news.” Other tech giants, including Microsoft, Apple and Google, have suspended sales in Russia, which has drawn international ire over its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

Jack Sweeney, a freshman at the University of Central Florida, has started out by posting a list of some of the yachts on Twitter, and noted that the tracking isn’t “automated yet.” Wealthy Kremlin-supporting Russians are trying to hide their superyachts amid sanctions from the U.S. and other allies in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. President Joe Biden specifically named yachts when he warned oligarchs backing Russian President Vladimir Putin that sanctions were coming for them. “We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets,” Biden during his State of the Union last week, addressing the oligarchs. “We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.” Now I've set up @RussiaYachts not automated yet but we'll be keeping watch and posting updates. Sweeney’s yacht tracking comes at a critical time. The Associated Press reported Saturday that it was tracing the movements of some 56 super-yachts (over 79 feet long) believed to be owned by “Kremlin-aligned” Russian oligarchs. Using online tracking services VesselFinder and MarineTraffic, AP discovered that more than a dozen of the vessels were heading to — or had arrived at — remote ports in small nations, possibly beyond the reach of Western sanctions. A few others had mysteriously gone dark. Some massive yachts have been seized, however. French authorities, for example, took the $120 million, 289-foot super-yacht Amore Vero last week in the Mediterranean resort town of La Ciotat, even as the crew was scrambling to make a quick departure, the AP reported. The yacht is believed to belong to Igor Sechin, a Putin ally who runs Russian oil giant Rosneft. New yacht-tracker Sweeney first drew widespread attention in January when he was profiled in tech publication Protocol for tracking Musk’s flights and posting what he found on his Twitter account @ElonJet. When Musk asked him in a tweet to stop it because it was a “security risk,” Sweeney responded that he had every right to track Musk’s flights because he was using publicly available data. He later said he would stop if Musk paid him $50,000 (Musk had reportedly offered $5,000). Sweeney’s account is still tracking Musk’s flights. Sweeney then began tracking the private jets of Russian oligarchs in response to several requests to do so after the invasion of Ukraine. Sweeney discovered that the jets appeared to be traveling on a daily basis, despite financial sanctions and airspace travel restrictions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and other Ukraine allies. Sweeney tracks the flights using public data from the ADS-B Exchange. It’s not yet clear what he’ll use to hunt down the oligarchs’ yachts.",3.43526431567852,4.836630070391376,-1.401365754712856,23

Specifically, Trump said the U.S. could “put the Chinese flag” on F-22 fighter jets and use them to “bomb the shit out of Russia,” according to a recording of his speech that was obtained by The Washington Post. “And then we say, China did it, we didn’t do it, China did it, and then they start fighting with each other and we sit back and watch,” Trump said. The audience laughed at the comment, which seemingly was made in jest, a source told CBS News. The Post noted it would be highly unlikely that Russia would believe a distinctive F-22 had been sent by China. Such deception would also appear to violate the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit using a flag, insignia or uniform of another nation during an armed conflict. “A ruse like that one is perfidy and violates [international humanitarian law] and customary international law. Perfidy in lay terms is treachery,” William Banks, a law professor at Syracuse University who researches national security, told the Post. Trump previously praised “brilliant” Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as “genius.” (Former Vice President Mike Pence said Friday at the same event for GOP donors that there’s “no room” in the party for “apologists for Putin,” but he didn’t call out Trump specifically.) Trump also praised North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his speech, calling the dictator “seriously tough” and saying his top generals and aides “cower” before him. “His people were sitting at attention,” Trump recalled. “I looked at my people and said, ’I want my people to act like that.’” Again, the audience laughed. Trump also falsely claimed, yet again, that he won the 2020 presidential election, according to both CBS and the Post. Republican donors may have been chuckling about Trump’s speech, but critics on Twitter were not. This man had the nuclear codes This man had top secret clearance. “You know what uranium is, right?

As for Visa, transactions “initiated with Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country, and any Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia will no longer work within the Russian Federation,” according to a statement from Visa Inc. Visa will also no longer support domestic transactions in Russia, according to the company. All transactions will be the responsibility of Russia’s National Payment Card System, NSPK. Both companies cited Russia’s devastating military attack on Ukraine and its civilians as the reason behind the decisions. “We are compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,” Al Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer of Visa, said in a statement. He added: “We regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia. This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values.” Mastercard noted that it had already recently blocked “multiple financial institutions” from the Mastercard payment network, apparently as part of ongoing sanctions against Russia. “These have been and will continue to be very difficult days — most of all for our employees and their families in Ukraine; for our colleagues with relatives and friends in the region; for our colleagues in Russia; and for the rest of us who are watching from afar,” Mastercard said in its statement. “As we take this step, we join with so many others in hoping for and committing to a more positive, productive and peaceful future for us all.” Mastercard said it will continue to focus on the safety and well-being of nearly 200 employees in Russia, and will continue to provide pay and benefits to them. In a video call on Saturday morning with members of Congress, Zelenskyy asked for more lethal aid to fend off the invading Russian army, and pleaded for additional sanctions, including a ban on Russian oil imports and a controversial no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace.

It was a startling statement, given that Trump just recently praised Putin as a “genius” for invading Ukraine, where the Russian military is attacking a sovereign nation and dropping bombs on civilians. “They’re all saying, ‘Oh, he’s a nuclear power. It’s like they’re afraid of him,’” Trump told Daly, referring to Putin, in the call posted on Instagram Friday. “You know, he was a friend of mine,” Trump preened. “I got along great with him.” But Trump insisted on the call that he also played tough with his buddy. If Putin invaded Ukraine, Trump claimed he warned him: “We’re gonna hit Moscow.” And “he sort of believed me, like 5%, 10%,” Trump added. “That’s all you need.

And John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, has accused Trump of setting the stage for Putin’s invasion by constantly criticizing Ukraine and delaying arms shipments to the nation — and lavishing praise on Putin. Trump “did not” take a tough stance on Putin, Bolton said earlier this week on Newsmax. John Bolton pushes back on Newsmax host: ""[Trump] barely knew where Ukraine was...It's just not accurate to say that Trump's behavior somehow deterred the Russians""  Trump also risked NATO’s survival as a foil to Russian aggression by constantly attacking the Western alliance.

The airspace request came just as Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a threat to any country thinking about implementing a no-fly zone, saying Russia would regard it as active participation in the conflict. Western national security experts fear that such a move would amount to an American declaration of war against Russia, which holds the most nuclear weapons of any country in the world. “No-fly” means that if Russian aircraft breached Ukrainian airspace, they could be shot down. President Joe Biden’s administration has repeatedly rebuffed the suggestion, as has NATO. So Zelenskyy asked for planes in the absence of airspace restrictions. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the Ukrainian leader “made a desperate plea for Eastern European countries to provide Russian-made planes to Ukraine.” “These planes are very much needed,” Schumer said, pledging to help facilitate their transfer. Ukrainian fighters are less familiar with American-made planes, and negotiations with European countries to provide military aircraft to Ukraine have fallen apart. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) indicated that the U.S. could make a deal to compensate Eastern European nations in exchange for those countries supplying Ukraine with “Soviet-style” planes. Zelenskyy’s “top priority” is “to take back their skies, which are being used by Putin to wage war against cities and murder civilians,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in a statement. More than 280 members of the House and Senate were present for the call with Zelenskyy, according to Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. The idea of sending more aid to Ukraine appears to have widespread support in both chambers. “Ukraine needs airpower urgently and America should send it. Zelensky’s message is simple: ‘Close the skies or give us planes,’” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement. “Let’s be clear-eyed about our options: A No-Fly Zone means sending American pilots into combat against Russian jets and air defenses — in a battle between nuclear powers that could spiral out of control quickly,” Sasse said. “But Americans should absolutely send Ukrainians planes, helicopters, and UAVs.” Coons said Zelenskyy “underscored the urgent need for more military support and humanitarian aid from his Western partners.” Zelenskyy said that a ban on Russian oil imports could be “even more powerful” than the measures Western countries have taken to block Russian banks from using the SWIFT financial system, according to The New York Times. A bipartisan bill to block Russian oil and gas imports has growing support in the House and Senate, but the Biden administration has pushed back, due to the potential cost to Americans. A Pentagon official said Friday that the “vast majority” of a $350 million aid package approved by the Biden administration last week at the start of the Russian invasion has arrived in Ukraine. The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv is bracing itself for an even more vicious attack from a massive column of Russian forces slowly making its way to the city. Citizens in other cities ― including Mariupol, which aid groups say is running out of food and medicine ― are increasingly desperate to leave. While Russian and Ukrainian authorities said they had reached a deal to form safe “corridors” for civilians to flee two areas of the country, Ukrainian officials accused the Russians of failing to hold up their end of the bargain, halting the evacuations.",3.5069014570247923,3.442202466897321,0.06469899012747149,3

The Russian Federal Customs Service issued a statement on Saturday saying that a United States citizen who is a gold medal-winning basketball player was detained in Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow last month after customs workers said they found vapes containing cannabis oil in her luggage. Multiple Russian news outlets, including TASS and Lenta.ru, later identified the basketball player as Griner. Additionally, a video released by the customs service appeared to show Griner, The New York Times reported. The statement said officials have opened a criminal drug smuggling case against the athlete. The offense carries a penalty of five to 10 years in prison. Griner, 31, is a center for the Phoenix Mercury and won gold medals with the U.S. women’s national basketball team in the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. “We are aware of and are closely monitoring the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia,” the Phoenix Mercury said in a statement. “We remain in constant contact with her family, her representation, the WNBA and NBA. We love and support Brittney and at this time our main concern is her safety, physical and mental health, and her safe return home.”  Griner’s agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, told the Times she could not comment “on the specifics” of the case but said she is “in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams” and the WNBA and NBA, and all were working to “get her home.” Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, posted on Instagram thanking fans for their support. “Thank you to everyone who has reached out to me regarding my wife’s safe return from Russia,” she wrote. “Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.” For several years, Griner has played for the Russian basketball team UMMC Ekaterinburg during the U.S. off season. WNBA players often play in Russia, where the pay is better, when they are not competing for their American teams. The announcement about Griner comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine continues to escalate and Russia faces harsh sanctions from the West. As tensions mount between Russia and the United States, the Times noted that Griner’s arrest may be an attempt to generate leverage for a prisoner exchange.",6.504273808737998,6.976766309251641,-0.4724925005136429,0

In a 2018 summit with NATO allies, for instance, Trump said the U.S. would “go it alone” unless NATO members started paying more money. The importance of NATO has come into sharp focus in the last two weeks as Russian forces continue to invade Ukraine on Putin’s orders. Putin, who has long attempted to destabilize Western countries, has instead brought the U.S. and its European allies closer as NATO nations agreed to severe and unprecedented sanctions that have already begun to cripple the Russian economy and wipe out its stock market. Last week, Trump tried to take credit for NATO and the support Ukraine has seen from the U.S. in its defense against Russia. But it was Trump who denied Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid in 2019 because he wanted Zelenskyy to investigate then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, who ultimately won the 2020 election. The revelation contributed to Trump’s first impeachment. Trump also believed an unfounded conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton had a computer server in Ukraine that contained thousands of classified emails. Asked what Bolton thought of Trump’s handling of Ukraine, the former adviser to Trump didn’t mince words. “I think it went very badly,” Bolton told the Post. “It was hard to have discussions on geostrategic issues when the president’s main interest was getting ... Rudy Giuliani in to see Zelenskyy so they could go find Hillary Clinton’s computer server.”",3.809109786771893,3.776399777595072,0.032710009176820876,12

On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill into law that criminalizes spreading what the government deems to be fake news, The Associated Press reported. Under the new measure, a statement as simple as referring to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “war” rather than a “special military operation” could constitute criminal disinformation, according to The New York Times. Punishment could include fines or up to three years’ imprisonment, with 15 years possible if authorities decide a report had “severe consequences.” International news organizations that have announced they would be temporarily suspending operations in Russia include: The BBC: “The safety of our staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs,” Director-General Tim Davie said in a statement. The Canadian Broadcast Corporation: “In light of this situation and out of concern for the risk to our journalists and staff in Russia, we have temporarily suspended our reporting from the ground in Russia while we get clarity on this legislation,” the CBC announced. CNN: “CNN will stop broadcasting in Russia while we continue to evaluate the situation and our next steps moving forward,” a spokesperson told the network’s media correspondent, Brian Stelter. Bloomberg News: “The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country,” a spokesperson said in a statement sent to HuffPost. ABC News: “We will continue to assess the situation and determine what this means for the safety of our teams on the ground,” a spokesperson said in a statement. Germany’s ARD and ZDF: In a statement shared by The Associated Press, the public broadcasters said they were examining the consequences of the law and would suspend reporting from Moscow for now. While it’s not suspending operations, The Washington Post has made the decision to remove bylines and datelines for journalists working from Russia. Multiple independent Russian news outlets have also shuttered in anticipation of the crackdown. TV Rain, which had already been blocked by regulators, gave its last broadcast via YouTube on Friday, ending with a proclamation of “no to war.”",6.291928859784444,5.344415587266245,0.947513272518199,27
2022-03-04,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/media-hawkish-iraq-ukraine_n_622125c4e4b042f866eaf43c,"The Media Are Still Clinging To Their Hawkish, Pro-War Tendencies","In 2003, the United States launched an invasion of Iraq based on government lies, fueled by eager media personalities who were far too willing to parrot what officials were telling them. It wasn’t just that they valued access and were buddies with their sources. There was also too often a mainstream willingness to accept that showing strength and power was important for a country like America, and the best way to do that was to go win a war. Of course, things didn’t go as planned. It wasn’t quick. We weren’t greeted as liberators. And there was no “mission accomplished,” as President George W. Bush so famously, and prematurely, declared in June 2003. Plenty has changed since then. There’s far more questioning, on both sides of the aisle, about whether the United States needs to jump in and fix all the world’s problems with boots on the ground. But some things remain, such as the media’s tendency to embrace their hawkish side. And it’s been creeping into the coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some high-profile media figures have pushed bellicose, and even reckless, rhetoric over the past week, suggesting to varying degrees that America should take steps that would almost inevitably lead to war with Russia. NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel suggested that by not attacking a massive Russian convoy of tanks and armored vehicles outside Ukraine’s capital, the United States and other countries were watching “in silence.” Perhaps the biggest risk-calculation/moral dilemma of the war so far. A massive Russian convoy is abt 30 miles from Kyiv. The US/NATO could likely destroy it. But that would be direct involvement against Russia and risk, everything. Does the West watch in silence as it rolls? Clint Watts, a former FBI agent and MSNBC contributor similarly tweeted that more needed to be done about the massive Russian convoy outside Ukraine’s capital ― and called doubts about more intervention “handwringing.” Strangest thing - entire world watching a massive Russian armor formation plow towards Kyiv, we cheer on Ukraine, but we’re holding ourselves back. NATO Air Force could end this in 48 hrs. Understand handwringing about what Putin would do, but we can see what’s coming And Fox News host Sean Hannity simply said, “Why isn’t there some group ― nobody has to take credit for it ― I believe in covert operations and plausible deniability. They’re sitting ducks. Why don’t we take out that convoy?” On Monday, a New York Post editorial headline read, “West Must Consider Intervening to Stop a Slaughter in Ukraine.” To be clear, the Ukraine crisis is very different from Iraq. The United States is not the primary aggressor. But America’s mistakes in 2003 have hung over the U.S. response to Ukraine. Last month, as President Joe Biden’s administration was warning the world its intelligence showed that Russia was planning to attack Ukraine, officials repeatedly had to assure reporters and the international community that its intelligence could be trusted ― unlike in 2003. “Now, I am mindful that some have called into question our information, recalling previous instances where intelligence ultimately did not bear out,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the U.N. Security Council in February. “But let me be clear: I am here today not to start a war, but to prevent one. The information I’ve presented here is validated by what we’ve seen unfolding in plain sight before our eyes for months.” And indeed, the Biden administration’s intelligence ended up being right on point, exposing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s plans and showing the world clearly what he was up to. It didn’t stop Putin, but it denied him the element of surprise and gave other countries more time to prepare a unified response. “Sadly we’re seeing so many of the same mistakes we always see in the media during wars.” Biden has repeatedly said he is dead set against sending U.S. troops into Ukraine to fight Russia, another nuclear power. “That’s a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another,” he told NBC News in an interview. He reiterated that message in his State of the Union address Tuesday: “Let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.” That rhetoric left some media personalities wanting ― or at least wondering why he didn’t provide ― more aggressive rhetoric. NBC host Chuck Todd thought Biden should’ve turned it into a wartime speech, wondering why he didn’t devote significantly more time to talking about the European crisis ― despite all the economic and other issues that America has to deal with at home. (For the record, Biden led his remarks with Ukraine and spent about 12 minutes on the topic in a speech that lasted just over an hour.) Todd said he thought Biden would “spend a little more time explaining why it is our fight, as you said, ‘good versus evil,’ explain a little bit more and a little bit of the history of the defense of Europe, and why we’re in this position.” “Sadly we’re seeing so many of the same mistakes we always see in the media during wars,” said Stephen Miles, president of Win Without War, a network of activists and organizations. “Focusing on the leaders directing the violence instead of those suffering from it, false choices between doing nothing and the U.S. going to war, and focusing more on troop movements and airstrikes than the causes of conflicts and how we might build a lasting peace. We desperately need the media to do better.” There has also been plenty of racism in the Ukraine coverage, with a media industry ― still very white ― expressing more sympathy for what Ukrainians are going through because they look like them. “What’s compelling is looking at them, the way they are dressed,” Al-Jazeera English anchor Peter Dobbie said. “These are prosperous, middle-class people. These are not obviously refugees trying to get away from the Middle East... or North Africa. They look like any European family that you’d live next door to.” “This isn’t a place ― with all due respect ― like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European... city where you wouldn’t expect that,” CBS foreign correspondent Charlie D’Agata said in another example of media bias. The Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association put out a statement recently condemning the “orientalist and racist implications that any population or country is ‘uncivilized’ or bears economic factors that make it worthy of conflict.” Despite some of these discouraging tendencies by some members of the media, the environment is very different from what it was in 2003. It’s much more diffuse, and troubling comments ― whether ones that make light of getting U.S. troops involved in a wider conflict or racist characterizations ― have been quickly called out on social media. On Tuesday morning, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul ― who is a frequent presence on MSNBC ― played into the good vs. evil frame, tweeting that there are no more “innocent” or “neutral” Russians now. “Everyone has to make a choice — support or oppose this war,” McFaul wrote. “The only way to end this war is if 100,000s, not thousands, protest against this senseless war. Putin can’t arrest you all!” In other words, you’re either with us or against us. McFaul later deleted that tweet after receiving heavy criticism. Without sending troops to Ukraine, the international community has to rely on economic aid and sanctions. The United States and other European countries have been giving significant military and financial assistance to Ukraine while imposing crippling sanctions on the Russian economy. There seems to be widespread support for Biden’s policies on Ukraine, including economic sanctions on Russia and Putin, aid to Ukraine and troop assistance for NATO allies. But 82% of respondents in a recent CBS News/YouGov poll said they were at least somewhat concerned about the crisis in Ukraine becoming a wider war in Europe, and 71% said they do not want the United States to send troops to fight Russia.",4.237040054167201,2.503281243975356,1.733758810191845,20
2022-03-04,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ukraine-russia-war-oil-prices-inflation_n_622233ade4b042f866ed25d6,Democrats And Republicans Are Willing To Risk Higher Inflation To Punish Russia,"WASHINGTON — There is bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill that punishing Russia for its war on Ukraine would be worth risking more inflation. Top Republicans and Democrats this week called on the Biden administration to ban Russian oil imports, which have been carved out of economic sanctions in order to protect European and U.S. consumers from higher gas prices. Even Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has done more than any lawmaker to force his own party to reckon with current levels of inflation, said higher gas prices would be an “inconvenience” for American consumers — acceptable collateral damage for hurting Russia as much as possible. “I would gladly pay 10 cents more a gallon,” Manchin said Thursday at a press conference, where he and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) announced a bill to force the administration to ban Russian oil. The war has already sent oil prices soaring to the highest level in a decade, with gas prices following. The national average cost for a gallon of gas rose 11 cents just this week, according to the American Automobile Association. Manchin and many others in Congress, especially Republicans, have for the past several months decried inflation as a “tax” on everyone in America, one that especially burdens people with low incomes, such as retirees receiving Social Security benefits. HuffPost asked Manchin if people would accept higher gas prices as the cost of supporting Ukraine after they’ve been told so many times that rising prices represent an unfair tax. “It is a tax,” Manchin said. “This is war.” The most recent consumer price index snapshot showed inflation had risen at 7.5% in January compared to a year ago, the fastest rate of inflation since 1982. Motor fuel accounts for 2.8% of the index. Economists debate exactly what’s driving inflation, but there’s no doubt that pandemic-related supply problems collided with strong consumer demand to put upward pressure on prices last year. Republicans have mostly blamed the American Rescue Plan, saying the extra unemployment benefits and $1,400 direct payments Democrats approved in March 2021 gave consumers too much spending power. Manchin has said he doesn’t regret voting for the bill, but he has agreed with Republicans that more spending would be inflationary. The Federal Reserve will try to quell inflation this year by raising interest rates, boosting the cost of credit so that people and businesses spend less money. Curbing inflation without hurting job growth is a tricky balancing act, and in the past, rate hikes have led to recessions. The war in Ukraine makes the Fed’s job more difficult. It’s not clear how much a Russian oil ban would affect prices, however, since markets started shunning Russian oil weeks ago out of fear it would be sanctioned later, meaning gas prices could be reflecting the impact of a ban even though it hasn’t happened yet. The U.S. also only gets about 10% of its oil imports from Russia. President Joe Biden announced this week that the U.S. would tap its strategic petroleum reserve to boost supply; Republicans have said the U.S. could offset the loss of Russian imports by boosting domestic energy production. But the White House has resisted the bipartisan calls to cut off Russian oil. “We are looking at other options we could take right now to cut U.S. consumption of Russian energy — but in the context of maintaining a steady global supply of energy,” an administration official said in an email. Federal Reserve Board Chair Pro Tempore Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that the war’s effect on the economy is uncertain, and that it’s unclear how long the oil price spike will last. “The concern, though, is there’s already a lot of upward inflation pressure, and additional inflation pressure does probably raise, at the margin, the risk that inflation expectations will start to react in a way that is negative for controlling inflation,” Powell said.",5.1960796247659475,5.103076131128534,0.09300349363741311,21

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) followed up his call for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assassination with a “Fox and Friends” appearance on Friday defending the extreme suggestion. Graham first floated the idea in a pair of widely condemned tweets and a Fox News interview on Thursday as Putin’s invasion of Ukraine entered its second week. “Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military?” Graham wrote Thursday evening, referencing the German officer who led a failed assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler in 1944. “The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out. You would be doing your country ― and the world ― a great service,” Graham wrote. “The only people who can fix this are the Russian people. Easy to say, hard to do,” he added. Despite swift blowback in the U.S. from politicians in both parties and from the Kremlin, Graham renewed his push for murder on Fox News’ morning program. “The way this will end is when he gets charged with a war crime — Putin and his cronies — and then one day we nab him when he leaves Russia,” Graham said. “But the best way for this to end is having ... the ‘Russian Spring,’ so to speak, where people rise up and take him down because if he continues to be their leader, then he’s going to make you complicit in war crimes.” He went on to address Russians directly: “You’re a good people. You’ll never have a future. You’ll be isolated from the world, and you’ll live in abject poverty. So, I’m hoping somebody in Russia will understand that he’s destroying Russia and you need to take this guy out by any means possible.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Graham’s stance was “certainly not a statement you would hear coming from the mouth of anyone working in the administration.” Russia’s U.S. ambassador, Anatoly Antonov, called the idea “unacceptable and outrageous” on Facebook, according to NBC News, and said the level of hatred for Russia in the U.S. was “off the scale.” Conservatives in the U.S. also called Graham out onli “I am respectfully asking Senator Graham to read the second half of Julius Caesar,” right-leaning New York Times columnist Ross Douthat wrote on Twitter. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) labeled it “an exceptionally bad idea.” “Use massive economic sanctions; BOYCOTT Russian oil & gas; and provide military aid so the Ukrainians can defend themselves,” Cruz wrote on Twitter. “But we should not be calling for the assassination of heads of state.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) ― the extremist who entertained QAnon conspiracies ― wrote in a tweet that Graham’s suggestion was “irresponsible, dangerous & unhinged.” Rachel E. VanLandingham, a professor of law at Los Angeles’ Southwestern Law School, acknowledged that Putin’s attacks amounted to international crimes, but doubted his murder would de-escalate the war in Ukraine. “Depends on who replaces him,” VanLandingham wrote in an email. “Will this lead to true regime change, regime change that is more willing to abide by rule of law? Dangerous and risky. Would Putin dying tomorrow be an effective means of ending the current conflict? I don’t see evidence of that.” But VanLandingham said she could see how Putin’s rampant violations of international norms made the idea appealing on its face. “There are children being slaughtered by Putin’s bombs, as well as the erosion of the entire legal architecture established to maintain world peace,” VanLandingham said. “If simply killing Putin could end that, I understand the desire to bring that about.” Russia is currently under investigation at the Hague by the International Criminal Court following a barrage of accusations that its soldiers have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Western leaders have been funneling supplies to Ukrainian troops and citizens fighting off their invaders, and have imposed unprecedented economic sanctions on Russian oligarchs and the Russian economy. While Putin’s plans for Ukraine are opaque, his troops attacked and seized a large Ukrainian nuclear power plant and he has vaguely threatened to use Russia’s vast nuclear arsenal against countries that get in his way.",3.3911530705823227,3.0703665081601024,0.32078656242222037,20

Since Russia’s unprovoked war on its western neighbor began last week, Zelenskyy has been conducting business from a handful of bunkers throughout the nation’s capital, having declined an offer from the U.S. to evacuate him. That’s left him vulnerable to attempts on his life by teams of Kremlin-backed assassins. Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov told a Ukrainian television network that anti-war elements in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) have been essential in helping foil some of the plots. In a defiant speech last week, Zelenskyy acknowledged that he is “target No. 1” in an effort to “damage Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.” “But we are not afraid, we are not afraid of anything,” he said. “We are not afraid to defend our country. We are not afraid of Russia.” U.S. officials warned last month that Russian forces have compiled a hit list of Ukrainian citizens to be killed or sent to detention camps. The Kremlin has reportedly dispatched two separate groups of mercenaries to Kyiv in an attempt to fulfill that directive. One is being orchestrated by the Wagner Group, a private military contractor run by Vladimir Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin, aka “Putin’s Chef.” The other is a group of elite Chechen fighters controlled by Chechen Republic leader Ramzan Akhmadovich Kadyrov. Danilov said on Tuesday that an assassination attempt by the Chechens over the weekend failed, and the group responsible for the attempt had been “destroyed.” Among those killed by Ukrainian forces was Chechen-Russian Gen. Magomed Tushayev, who has been accused of torturing and killing LGBTQ+ people in Chechnya. “As we’ve seen in the past, we expect Russia will try to force cooperation through intimidation and repression,” a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity told Foreign Policy. “These acts, which in past Russian operations have included targeted killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, detentions, and the use of torture, would likely target those who oppose Russian actions, including Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists and anti-corruption activists, and vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons.”",3.5229435287564166,3.3041095685295176,0.21883396022689894,3

The attackers were Russian saboteurs targeting fleeing civilians, Ramsay reported. “It’s a professional ambush,” Ramsay says in narration over the video. “The bullets just don’t miss.” As the car takes fire, the journalists make a run for it down an embankment.

The Fox News personality ― who in the past has confessed to lying on his show ― admitted his commentary on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had been misguided. But instead of taking full responsibility for his rhetoric parroting Kremlin talking points and defending Russian President Vladimir Putin, Carlson instead suggested Russia’s aggression had been a surprise (despite Western powers warning of it for months) and then snidely tried to pin the blame on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. “We’ve been taken by surprise by the whole thing. We’re not the only ones who were, but we’re willing to admit it. The only thing more embarrassing than being wrong in your estimates is pretending that you weren’t,” blustered Carlson, who has taken a different tone since the invasion and has whined about being falsely accused of rooting for Russia. Carlson snarkily suggested Harris’ involvement in the Biden White House’s response to the crisis meant it wasn’t so serious. “Why didn’t we see this coming, this total loss of control?” he asked. “Well, because we assumed that if things were dire, serious people would be involved in fixing them. But we looked up and we saw Kamala Harris involved, and that reassured us.” “If the future of Europe and the world hung in the balance, as now so obviously it does, of course, the Biden administration would not have sent Kamala Harris to fix it,” Carlson added. “That is absolutely not Kamala Harris’s job. That was our assumption. But, as noted, we were wrong.” Watch the video here:",3.628526624347717,4.797261349055655,-1.1687347247079383,24
2022-03-04,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/guilty-ukraine-mental-health-news_l_621ffcc9e4b07f40688f1b30,To Anyone Feeling Guilty For Carrying On With Your Life Right Now,"Last Saturday, Kira Rudyk, a member of Ukrainian parliament and leader of the Voice Party, had simple, humdrum plans for the day: She was going to plant tulips and daffodils in her backyard. But days before, Russia invaded her country. So instead she spent her weekend learning to fire a rifle and preparing for further attacks on Kyiv. “We are not going anywhere,” Rudyk said in a tweet that went viral. “This is our city, our land, our soil. We will fight for it. So next week I can plant my flowers. Here.” It was a stark reminder of how easy it is for us to take for granted ― and even squander ― the mundane aspects of life. Now, as Russian President Vladimir Putin ratchets up the pressure on the civilian population in Ukraine, many of us in other countries feel a sense of unease about our lives going on as normal. It’s disconcerting to go to dinner or make plans with friends while you know so many other lives are in total upheaval. Guilt ― or vicarious trauma ― is a natural part of witnessing the pain of others while not directly being impacted by it, said Akua K. Boateng, a psychotherapist in Philadelphia. “These feelings parallel survivor’s guilt and/or remorse that manifested with COVID within the past two years,” she told HuffPost. “Having guilt surface during this time is a sign of self-compassion and deep empathy for those in our world.” Our sense of guilt and hopelessness has been hyper-activated during these trying 2020s, with the pandemic, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the Black Lives Matter movement rightfully demanding our attention. When you consider all that’s happening in the world, it often feels like there’s a futility and pointlessness to day-to-day life. Sitting with this disillusionment feels appropriate. Having the audacity to enjoy life in a moment like this can feel morally wrong. “It also brings up weighty personal values questions like, am I being complacent? When someone’s rights are being violated, do you do nothing or do you take action?” said Jennifer Chappell Marsh, a marriage and family therapist in San Diego, California. Chappell tells her patients worried about Ukraine to give themselves permission to feel competing feelings: “It’s OK to feel grateful for what you have and grief for others at the same time. These feelings can coexist.” It’s equally OK to be suffering in your own way right now, over something completely unrelated to the crisis in Ukraine. Earlier this week, psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb shared a conversation she had with a patient about the war. “I really shouldn’t feel so depressed,” the patient said. “I mean, people are dying in Ukraine but I’m lucky to be safe.” Gottlieb responded, “Can there be a war *and* you feel depressed?” It wasn’t something her patient had even considered. “There is so much suffering in the world, whether it’s because of war or COVID or the many other tragedies we face,” the psychotherapist wrote on Twitter. “But please don’t minimize your pain because you don’t think it’s valid compared to something else.” To get by, we have to become skilled at holding and connecting with many, sometimes conflicting realities, said Sarah Spencer Northey, a marriage and family therapist based in Washington, D.C. This means that you can feel heartbreak for people caught in a war halfway around the world, and also be suffering from a comparatively minor problem of your own, like a breakup. You can also be over-the-moon-happy for a friend who just got engaged. “The two or three don’t cancel each other out,” Northey told HuffPost. “In the breakup scenario, you may need to make the wise decision that though you care about suffering across the world, you first need to take care of yourself and heal from your own personal heartache.” This doesn’t mean closing your eyes to what’s happening, she said: “It just means you should live with this awareness and find where you are called to act in the life that you’ve been given.” In the week since Russia invaded, many have shared a quote card by writer and illustrator Mari Andrew that captures so much of this experience. It says, “Someone has always clinked a cocktail glass in one hemisphere as someone loses a home in another while someone falls in love in the same apartment building where someone grieves. The fact that suffering, mundanity and beauty coincide is unbearable and remarkable.” Beautiful words by @bymariandrew. I was on the inside looking out 10 yrs ago, wondering how others were brushing their teeth or decorating for the holidays while I grieved the loss of my son. Now I’m doing the mundane while the people of Ukraine fight for their lives & country.🇺🇦  Andrews wrote the short piece in response to the Australian wildfires in early 2020, as she watched so much of a faraway country burn. “I wanted to remind myself how the world has always been this way: grief and beauty occurring simultaneously,” she told HuffPost. “It’s so confusing for our brains to grasp, but it helps to understand our context in history, how this is nothing new.” “We have much greater access to news now, but there have always been horrors and wonders at the same time.” There’s a quiet power in embracing our “normal” lives, since normalcy is exactly what the people of Ukraine are fighting for right now, as Rudyk, the Ukrainian politician, so aptly exemplified. “We can’t eradicate the unethical behaviors of a country, individual, or government solely by attacking or calling out unethical behaviors,” said therapist Rachel Kazez, a Chicago therapist and founder of the therapy program All Along. “We also must maintain and create enough beauty, effort, normalcy and goodwill,” Kazez said. “Doing so reminds bad actors that there’s a life that’s more appealing than the one they’re engaging in. We normalize good to crowd out the bad.” Elisabeth LaMotte, a therapist in Washington, D.C., told HuffPost that she has reminded clients concerned about Ukraine that guilt is often anger in disguise and directed inward. “It often frees up tremendous energy to connect with the anger and use it as the powerful source of energy that productive anger can be,” said LaMotte. Channeling that angst into something productive may mean protesting or leaving flowers at the Ukrainian embassy. It could mean getting involved at immigrant advocacy groups like Kind Works or RAICES or donating and sending humanitarian supplies to the Ukrainian people. It may mean posting on social media to spread awareness and updates, but keep in mind that no one is going to think you’re ill informed or an uncaring monster if you don’t have something interesting to say about the roots of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the threat of nuclear war or the concept of no-fly zones. As HuffPost reporter Rowaida Abdelaziz remarked earlier this week, “It’s OK to not tweet about a conflict you don’t know much about. It is also OK — in fact encouraged! — to read reliable sources in order to learn more about said conflict. (And still not have to tweet about it!)” And although this is very much a livestreamed war ― there are myriad videos shot by Ukrainians documenting the horrors of the invasion, or showing the unimaginable courage of the Ukrainian people ― it’s important to step away from the screen and catch a breath sometimes. It’s not selfish to attend to your own mental health. “Ingesting media stories and visual recounts of trauma can lead to vicarious and or re-traumatization of your own system,” Boateng said. “Make use of any coping strategies that keep you healthy.” Gaining a better understanding of the world and doing what you can to help is productive. Wallowing in your particular despair isn’t. In times like these ― when you’re so far away from a crisis, but also affected by and fixated on it ― there’s a John Keats quote that Andrew finds heartening. “I must choose between despair and Energy ― I choose the latter,” the English poet wrote in a letter. Right now, Andrew said she’s trying to choose energy, which very much includes tending to the people she loves and caring for her body and its nervous system. “It’s horrific that people in Ukraine suddenly can’t enjoy a simple weekend at home, but refusing to enjoy mine in solidarity doesn’t seem nearly as helpful as giving what I can and helping what I can ― small actions that show I care about their lives as well as my own,” the illustrator said. “Refusing to enjoy or at least take care of ourselves is just giving into that horrible hopelessness.”",3.294689419000648,4.7628009330871945,-1.4681115140865466,29

Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor claimed to have documented 26 such violations on Facebook since October 2020, taking particular issue with the site’s crackdown on state-run media outlets, including the Zvezda TV channel, state-run news outlets RIA Novosti, Sputnik and Russia Today, and the pro-government news websites Gazeta.ru and Lenta.ru. The Facebook ban was followed by reports of increasingly limited access to Twitter and YouTube in the country, although a Twitter spokesperson told HuffPost the company hadn’t seen anything “significantly different” than the restrictions that began last week. Radio Free Europe reports Apple’s and Google’s app stores have been targeted as well. “Soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out,” Meta president of global affairs Nick Clegg said in a statement confirming the news. “We will continue to do everything we can do restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organize for action,” Clegg said. A host of tech companies have drastically limited their business with Russia in the last week, including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Oracle. The move is part of a broader crackdown in Russia on potential voices of dissent, focusing especially on media outlets that aren’t directly controlled by the Kremlin. The BBC and CNN suspended their operations in Russia on Friday after the nation’s parliament passed a law criminalizing the spread of “fake” or “false” news regarding its invasion of Ukraine. Putin is expected to sign the bill on Saturday. Under the law, referring to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “war” rather than a “special military operation,” for instance, could be punished by up to 15 years in prison.",4.449120791443906,4.989055410858849,-0.539934619414943,27

The visit is meant to “demonstrate the strength and unity of the NATO Alliance” and show the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine “in the face of Russian aggression.” Since Russia began its attack on Ukraine last week, hundreds of civilians have been reported killed so far, though the exact count remains unknown. More than 1 million Ukrainians have fled the violence, largely into neighboring countries, including Poland. During her visit, Harris plans to discuss how the U.S. can further support the countries receiving refugees. Her office’s statement reiterated the U.S.’s strategy in responding to Russia’s “unprovoked and unjustified invasion,” which includes providing humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and imposing “severe” economic sanctions on Russia.

Zelenskyy said a large number of Russians are believed to have died in the conflict so far, but he alleged that no one is keeping track. Russian President Vladimir Putin amassed around 150,000 troops to support the conflict, according to the Pentagon. Most have been deployed. “No one is counting them. No one cares how many die in the shellings,” Zelenskyy said. “They knew in advance they were not going to show to their families, to their mothers, what happened to their children, that they died here,” he went on. “They came here to kill us, and we are defending our freedom and our homes, and that’s why they’re dying. We don’t want to kill them.” ""[Russia] brought crematoriums with them... we don't want to kill them""Ukrainian President Zelensky tells a press conference ""the end of the world has arrived""  In the eight days since the invasion began, people on social media have circulated graphic photos and videos of dead Russian soldiers apparently abandoned on the sides of roads. The Telegraph previously reported that mobile crematoriums were expected to be used on the battlefield, citing U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Putin pledged Thursday to grant the families of fallen soldiers 5 million rubles ― around $50,000 ― in what The New York Times said was the first time Putin publicly acknowledged that Russians have died in the war. The Russian leader also sought to downplay widespread reports that the Ukrainians have put up a much stronger defense than he’d anticipated, claiming that the “special military operation in Ukraine” is “going strictly according to the schedule just as it has been planned.” The Russian Defense Ministry on Wednesday announced that nearly 500 of its soldiers have been killed and another 1,600 injured, although Western estimates are significantly higher. Ukraine says its fighters have killed more than 5,000 Russian troops. An American official told The New York Times the figure is more like 2,000. Russia reportedly took control of the Ukrainian port city Kherson this week ― the first major city to be taken over. But according to the Pentagon, and scattered reports, the Russian military is facing a serious morale problem made worse by food shortages. Some Russian troops are sabotaging their own military vehicles and laying down arms, according to the Pentagon, in order to avoid fighting a war that Russian authorities have baselessly described as a mission to liberate oppressed Ukrainians.",3.6894118794571686,3.7955793020907964,-0.10616742263362777,3

TV Rain, described by The New York Times as a “youthful independent television station,” announced Thursday that it would stop operating indefinitely under intense pressure from the Kremlin. Russia’s telecommunications regulator had already blocked TV Rain earlier in the week, and some of the station’s employees have fled the country out of fear for their own safety, the Times reported. On Thursday, the outlet delivered its final show, which aired on YouTube. “No to war,” Natalia Sindeyeva, one of TV Rain’s founders, said as the station’s employees walked out of the studio. The station then began playing Tchaikovsky’s “Swan Lake” ― a reference that many well-versed in Russian history recognized. The staff of the Independent Russian TV station 'Dozhd' (TV Rain) resigned during a live stream with last words: “no war” and then played Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake echoing the same from Soviet state TV in August of 1991.  As NPR noted in a piece earlier this year about the significance of “Swan Lake” in Russian political history, Soviet state TV aired the ballet on a loop after the death of Premier Leonid Brezhnev while a new party leader was being selected. It did the same following the deaths of Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko. Then, in 1991, Soviet TV aired the ballet during the attempt to overthrow President Mikhail Gorbachev ― a failed coup that helped precipitate the collapse of the Soviet Union. That’s it. @tvrain is gone. What were the final images the famed TV station chose to broadcast? There was only ever one option, of course.  There are well-founded fears that reporting any news diverging from the official government line in Russia could result in prison time or worse. Just before TV Rain cut to “Swan Lake” on Thursday, a disclaimer flashed on screen stating the show was the work of a foreign agent. That became a requirement for the station back in August, when Russia’s justice ministry declared TV Rain a foreign agent — a designation editor-in-chief Tikhon Dzyadko vehemently denied — in the lead-up to a parliamentary election.",4.526529116643778,4.988130939486264,-0.46160182284248563,9

The shelling took place at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, a city about 400 miles from Kyiv. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it had spoken with Ukrainian officials, who said there are no changes in radiation levels at the site, which provides about 25% of Ukraine’s power. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister, Dmytro Kuleba, confirmed the reports on Thursday evening, saying a fire had broken out. He called for an immediate cease-fire to allow emergency officials to stop the blaze and said Russian troops were firing on the facility “from all sides.” “If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger” than the 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, Kuleba tweeted. “Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!” Reuters added later that the fire was in a training building outside the plant, although it could not verify its seriousness. The Ukrainian State Emergency Service said early Friday morning the blaze had been extinguished, and there were no deaths or injuries linked to the shelling. Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out. If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone! Nuclear experts said the plant’s reactors are a different type than the ones used at Chernobyl and that emergency safety measures should kick in. The shelling should pose little risk if the containment vessels aren’t damaged and outside power can be restored to the site, although they warned that any military action at a nuclear facility was a danger. “We don’t know the status of the system or the power and until we do, we won’t know the full extent of the risk,” tweeted Jon B. Wolfsthal, a former adviser to then-Vice President Joe Biden. “Yes, a fire at any nuclear plant is a bad thing but there are a few things to know.” Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the plant, told a Ukrainian television station that one of the site’s six nuclear reactors was on fire. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but has nuclear fuel inside, he said. Open pools where spent nuclear fuel rods have been cooling are also a concern, The New York Times noted. Tuz added that firefighters initially weren’t able to get near the plant because they are being shot at, The Associated Press added. Rafael Mariano Gross, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, also called for an immediate halt in military action near the plant, saying the body would continue to support Ukraine in hopes of maintaining nuclear safety and security.

2022-03-03,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/putin-ukraine-diplomacy_n_6220f251e4b0ae4ab9c90118,Can Anyone Persuade Vladimir Putin To Choose Peace In Ukraine?,"Peace in Ukraine depends on the international community achieving something it has been unable to do for years: changing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mind. After centralizing power over two decades at Russia’s helm, Putin now singlehandedly makes the key decisions about his country’s national security policy. Ukraine and Western governments are working on three tracks to make him stop his invasion: They are trying to persuade Putin directly, while simultaneously pressuring Russians who might influence him with unprecedented global financial sanctions that Western nations say will continue until the Ukraine offensive ends. And they are stiffening Ukraine’s resistance to the onslaught to show that an easy, cheap military win is not an option for Putin. But one week into the war, Western officials are extremely pessimistic about the chances of the Russian leader choosing to stop fighting and pursue a diplomatic settlement, saying they know little about Putin’s plans and are alarmed by the indications that they do have. “Right now, I frankly do not see how anybody can get through to Putin,” said Vaira Vike-Freiberga, a former president of Latvia who met with her Russian counterpart repeatedly. “He is so dead set on rewriting history ... he has invented a parallel universe in which he lives mentally.” As Russian forces advance toward the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, “the man is about to commit mass genocide,” she continued. “What is anybody going to tell him that hasn’t been told already by President [Joe] Biden, [British] Prime Minister [Boris] Johnson, [German] Chancellor [Olaf] Scholz? ... This man is beyond being reached by words and certainly way beyond logic.” French President Emmanuel Macron is the most prominent Western leader to maintain a dialogue with Putin. In a Thursday call, the Russian leader told his French counterpart that he will continue his assault and may even demand more concessions from the Ukrainians. “There was nothing that Putin said that reassured us,” a top French official later told The Economist. Though Ukraine opened talks with Russia on Monday that have had limited results and its president requested direct negotiations with Putin on Thursday, most foreign policy experts believe the key to a cease-fire is an agreement between Moscow and the major players it views as comparable world powers, like the U.S. or the European Union. Biden last spoke with Putin on Feb. 12 and believes it is inappropriate to hold another call while Putin’s invasion is ongoing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week. Speaking to NBC News for a story published on Thursday, a U.S. official said, “there are no signs Putin is willing to” deescalate at this point. Western officials and analysts say they know what a possible deal would have to achieve: Primarily, it would need to address Putin’s desire for a greater Russian say over security conditions in his neighborhood while committing him to principles respected by most countries like the right to national sovereignty. Yet they do not know when to expect him to take the first step towards that settlement — and they worry that if such negotiations do come, Putin may simply lay the groundwork for more conflict in the future. Putin watchers are struggling to make sense of the Russian leader’s current calculus. The intelligence community lacks human sources close to him, per The Washington Post, particularly because some Russians who were able to provide such information in recent years have left the country. Some observers, however, see reason to be nervous about his state of mind. “Putin is not doing well. He’s shouting at staff. His war is behind schedule. This is a dangerous time,” a European official told the Post. Fiona Hill, a Putin biographer who worked on Russia issues at the White House, recently told Politico she sees a new level of “visceral emotion” in the Russian president’s public remarks, which worries her because he faces few checks and balances within the Kremlin. In handling Putin now, officials must prepare for him to use anything in his arsenal — including nuclear weapons — and have a plan to respond, Hill said. On Thursday, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov hinted that Russia might unleash chemical weapons and blame the terrifying escalation on the U.S. and Ukraine. Three possible factors could now push Putin toward the negotiating table. The first depends on timing: how fast Western military support, from anti-tank missiles to air defense systems and ammunition, gets to the Ukrainians. Such aid is largely coming by land through Poland into western Ukraine, but it will then have to be transported to front lines further east. “If that help has arrived in time to be of any effectiveness to slow down the encirclement of Kyiv and of Kharkiv” — the most important Ukrainian cities currently under attack — “then, since Putin has been spinning lies from morning to night, he will easily invent himself a reason why he might stop the aggression,” Vike-Frieberga said. The U.S. and other Ukrainian partners could also inflict more economic pain on Russia with two tactics that would be especially alarming to Putin: sanctions on Russia’s crucial energy industry, which NBC reported the Biden administration is now considering, and specifically targeting Putin’s personal wealth. While Western governments are sanctioning deep-pocketed Russians in the hope that they can turn Putin against the war, those figures have limited influence. “He makes it clear that he, the great leader, allows the oligarchs to become filthy rich but they must respect [his] wishes and desires,” Vike-Frieberga said. “I personally doubt that he would be influenced by their pain. His own personal pain is a different matter.” The Biden administration and foreign friends like the French are repeatedly signaling that it’s not too late to choose peace. Putin could “deescalate,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told NBC News in an interview aired Wednesday, and on Thursday, a U.S. defense official told NBC that Washington and Moscow had established a channel of communication. Should the Russian leader decide to negotiate, world leaders and diplomats would face the fresh challenge of designing an effective deal. Putin may be satisfied with ending the current crisis with a relatively modest win rather than capturing all of Ukraine like splintering the country into weak quasi-states, according to Hill, the former White House adviser. But some analysts fear that now that he has shattered the long taboo of waging a large-scale war in the heart of Europe, Putin is initiating a long, ambitious and likely bloody campaign to elevate his global status. “He wants to go into history as a major figure for the greatness of Russia” who can reverse the toll of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of countries such as Latvia, said Vike-Freiberga. After stepping down as the country’s president, Vike-Freiberga served as the head of a group of retired world leaders called the Club de Madrid. (She remains a member.) “When I first met him ... he told me what a sad thing it was that there was a border between our countries now” and people needed visas to travel between them, Vike-Freiberga said. “I told him [Latvians] were very happy to have passports where they could go to Paris and London instead of being taken in cattle cars to Siberia.” Many international relations analysts say Putin’s agenda is about far more than Ukraine — including his often-stated concerns about the country possibly joining the NATO military alliance — and he ultimately seeks an era-defining settlement. “Putin has said that only a few great powers — Russia, China, India and the United States — enjoy absolute sovereignty, free to choose which alliances they join or reject,” Georgetown University professor Angela Stent wrote in a January essay. “He is determined to reassert Russia’s right to limit the sovereign choices of its neighbors and its former [Soviet-era] allies and to force the West to accept these limits.” Stent advised Western officials to design a new status quo in Europe that Putin would see as worth standing by. Such a deal would be hard to craft. It would need to reassure European nations that Washington is not negotiating away their right to seek support like military equipment or troop deployments from the NATO military alliance — shows of solidarity that Europeans have counted on as Russia has intervened militarily and politically in their region. Meanwhile, it would need to address Russia’s concerns about key neighbors drawing closer to the West and its increasing global isolation. And American and allied negotiators would have to contend with complex and time-honored Russian diplomatic tactics. In a 2021 paper for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, former Pentagon and State Department official Michael Albertson assessed how to negotiate with Putin by examining the history of U.S.-Russian arms control talks. Calling Putin “a dealmaker, but not necessarily a negotiator,” he wrote that Russian mediators often present a long list of grievances, distracting from the issue at hand, and he noted “a dramatic reduction” in U.S. officials’ familiarity with their Russian counterparts in recent years. “From a Russian perspective, the best negotiating approach is to stick to a hard line at one end of the negotiating spectrum, wait for a centrist U.S. proposal, let time and political pressure build on the U.S. side, and wait for the U.S. position to gradually shift closer to the preferred Russian outcome,” Albertson wrote. If Putin outmaneuvers his Western counterparts, the ultimate result could be even deadlier wars in the future. Vike-Freiberga believes the limited international response to his past incursions into Ukraine and Georgia drove Putin to launch his current invasion. “Appeasement has only whet his appetite,” she said.",3.614107389510678,3.9802014273136685,-0.36609403780299044,15

It’s not Russia’s obscenely rich oligarchs, who face economic sanctions and seizures of their assets worldwide, the former top analyst on the National Security Council told Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Late Show.” Instead, it’s the “very small circle” — such as Russia’s heads of intelligence, military and security services — who cooked up the invasion plan with Putin, said Hill. “These are not the kind of guys who have yachts off Monaco, palaces in Paris or anything like this,” Hill explained. “These are people who are very much rooted in Russia itself and I don’t think they’re too worried about all of these sanctions and everything that’s cut off, because they’re not invested in the West. They’ve really got that bunker siege mentality — fortress Russia.” Members of this small circle are who Putin “probably does have to worry about” if “it looks like Russia is losing,” said Hill, an intelligence analyst under former President George W. Bush and Barack Obama who later served on the National Security Council under Donald Trump. Hill was an important witness during Trump’s first impeachment. “I don’t think they care about the world of public opinion,” Hill added. “But if there’s not any movement on the ground, if that great convoy of tanks just basically runs out of gas and is just left there, and if they have to kind of lay waste to Ukraine to basically get a success … you might then start to get a backlash from those people who are thinking this has not gone as they intended.” Watch the interview here:",4.078081829542351,4.060977448370585,0.017104381171765937,20

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is “very open” to the idea of sanctioning Russian oil and gas, though it is concerned how it would impact energy prices at home and abroad. “We’re considering it, it’s very much on the table, but we need to weigh what all of the impacts will be. We’re not trying to hurt ourselves, we’re trying to hurt President Putin and the Russian economy,” Psaki said Wednesday in an interview on MSNBC. Republicans have unanimously said Biden should stop the oil imports and also undo restrictions on domestic oil production, such as by greenlighting the Keystone pipeline and allowing energy companies to drill in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — longtime GOP priorities. Democrats such as Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) have also called for sanctions to include Russian energy. “It is simply inexplicable that we and other Western nations continue to spend billions of dollars on energy from Russia,” Manchin said this week. “This funding directly supports Putin’s ability to stay in power and execute a war on the people of Ukraine.” The war has already pushed up crude oil prices, partly because supply has decreased due to oil traders preemptively shunning Russian crude just because it might be sanctioned later. It’s all happening at a time when overall price inflation has already surged to the highest level in 40 years. Federal Reserve chair pro tempore Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that the Fed is keeping a close eye on how Ukraine could affect oil and other commodity prices, but that the war’s effect on the economy would be unpredictable. “The effects are going to be passed through into gas prices, into lower economic activity, and into inflation, headline inflation,” Powell told the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, adding that he didn’t know how substantial the effects would be. Powell said the Fed would raise interest rates starting this month to stymie inflation by slowing the economy, hopefully without causing a recession. To counteract higher gas prices increase, Biden announced in his State of the Union address this week that the U.S. would tap its strategic petroleum reserve. “I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy and that we use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers,” Biden said. Russian crude represented a small but growing fraction of overall U.S. oil imports in the past year, so it’s possible cutting it off would spike gasoline prices and worsen overall inflation. But Manchin said inflation would not result. “We’re producing a million a million barrels less a day than we have shown that we can easily do,” Manchin told HuffPost. As they demand the U.S. stop Russian oil and gas imports, Republicans are also ratcheting up attacks against the Biden administration for causing high gas prices across the country. Their strategy is putting Democrats in a box just months from the November midterm elections. Republicans conceded, however, that increased domestic production would not necessarily replace Russian imports in the short term. “Obviously, trying to build new infrastructure is a challenge,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told HuffPost. “But I mean, a long journey starts with the first step. And so I think sending a message to the fossil fuel sector that they’re not persona non grata, and we don’t need them, would be a good start.” Climate hawks argued that the Ukraine crisis underscored the need to wean the U.S. off fossil fuels, and that although immediate steps can be taken to stabilize energy supplies, the long-term prioritizing of renewable energy shouldn’t be ditched outright. “It is our dependence on fossil energy that creates the power for these petro-fascists around the world,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said.",5.718956027775576,4.040799207872636,1.6781568199029397,21

A group of lawmakers on Wednesday asked the Biden administration whether they needed additional tools to ensure malign actors aren’t evading U.S. and multilateral sanctions on Russia by using virtual currencies. “Strong enforcement of sanctions compliance in the cryptocurrency industry is critical given that digital assets, which allow entities to bypass the traditional financial system, may increasingly be used as a tool for sanctions evasion,” Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Mark Warner (Va.), Jack Reed (R.I.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio) said in a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The letter added that “there are growing concerns that Russia may use cryptocurrencies to circumvent the broad new sanctions it faces from the Biden administration and foreign governments in response to its invasion of Ukraine.” Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the rest of the world have severely curtailed Russia’s ability to do business, crushing the value of Russian currency and shuttering its stock market. But some have speculated that cryptocurrencies — speculative assets that purport to be an alternative to government-backed currency — could give Russia a way to mitigate the sanctions, since cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are traded outside of the traditional banking system. It’s not just Democrats concerned about the possibility of a crypto end-around. “I want to find out how it’s been used by the Russians,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told HuffPost, after saying earlier this week that cryptocurrency has been “rearing its ugly head” in Russia. Other Republicans sounded more skeptical of a crypto sanctions problem, suggesting their effect may be negligible. “I don’t think that it’s all that plausible for the Russian government to be able to evade sanctions on a significant scale with crypto right now,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said. The topic also came up in a House hearing on Wednesday with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, where Democrats asked Powell how much of a problem crypto might be for sanctions. “It is past time for all of us to lead on creating a regulatory environment in which we, rather than the world’s despots, terrorists and money launderers benefit from the emergence of cryptocurrency,” Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said. Powell said he didn’t know whether cryptocurrency offered Russia a sanction workaround, but that it was a possibility Congress should address. “It underscores the need really for congressional action on digital finance, including crypto currencies,” Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. “We have this burgeoning industry which has many many parts to it and there isn’t in place the kind of regulatory framework that needs to be there.” Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the agencies with some regulatory authority over the crypto industry, said Congress should “close loopholes” to protect American consumers from being defrauded. But she said Congress shouldn’t act in an ad hoc way because of the war in Ukraine. “What we need is a structure for transparency and oversight and accountability,” Stabenow told HuffPost. Congress imposed tax reporting requirements on some players in the crypto industry last year to help pay for roads and bridges in a bipartisan infrastructure bill. The industry lobbied hard against the new rules but ultimately lost. Since then, the industry has ramped up its investment in lobbying. “The number of people that came out of the woodwork trying to beat us up for doing that was amazing,” Warner said.",4.030539738874047,5.017940153781537,-0.9874004149074898,21

Todd said the growing refugee crisis in Ukraine was “a very important missed point by the president” in his national address, and asked NBC correspondent Tom Llamas how that detail was playing out in Lviv. “It’s yet another part of this story that I think a lot of us thought he’d use this time with the American public to speak more about,” Todd said. “What are you seeing in Lviv, Tom?” Llamas said he didn’t expect Biden’s speech to resonate much with the Ukrainian people for several reasons, the most obvious being that they’re fighting for their lives at the moment and probably didn’t see the speech. “They are preoccupied right now,” he said. “They have Russian troops in their country trying to take over their land.” Llamas also noted that it was 6 a.m. in Lviv, meaning Biden’s speech ― if people even had the ability to watch it or interest in watching it ― would have begun at 5 a.m. local time. You can watch their exchange here: Llamas went on to say that the things Ukrainian residents would have wanted to hear from Biden are things that he’s said he won’t do. Namely, he said, they want NATO to enforce a no-fly zone around Ukraine and they want the United States and its allies to put boots on the ground. Biden should have given a more “inspirational message,” concluded Llamas. “He should have talked more about helping these refugee families.”",3.3601599869147853,3.173482918434566,0.18667706848021925,10

The plant, near the city of Enerhodar in the country’s southeast, is the largest in Ukraine and the whole of Europe.

What appear to be garbage trucks are parked farther down the road, behind makeshift bunkers made of sandbags, parked cars and piles of tires. More unbelievable bravery from every day Ukrainian citizens. The road into the town of Energodar which contains Europe's largest nuclear power plant is blocked by vehicles and people.

Radiation does not know nationalities, [it] does not spare anyone!” Gerashchenko’s fears are not unfounded. On Sunday, Russian missiles struck a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv. Ukraine’s State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that the building thankfully was undamaged and there were no reports of radioactive release. The IAEA called on Russia to allow “necessary services, equipment and components” be delivered to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities at all times, and for the staff at such facilities to be given adequate rest so as to not “compromise their safety or put them under undue pressure.” Russian forces that invaded the country seized control of the shuttered Chernobyl nuclear facility last Thursday, reportedly holding hostage the staff who maintain and protect the contaminated nuclear facility.",5.279779802956343,4.385743278495126,0.8940365244612165,22

Photos first posted by Alexandra Arkhipova on Facebook show the children behind bars. Arkhipova, a university researcher, said the kids and the two women were detained and brought to a police station. “Five children aged 7 to 11 and their mothers Olga Alter and Ekaterina Zavizion were detained today for trying to lay flowers to the Embassy of Ukraine (and also - what a terrible crime - the children made a poster! )” Arkhipova wrote in a Facebook post.

Over the last few days, several reports from the Ukraine-Poland border have indicated that Black people living in Ukraine have had a much tougher time getting to safety. According to CNN, the refugees of color were forced to wait in frigid conditions with no food or water. On Tuesday, Ukraine’s foreign minister said that all people leaving the country should be treated fairly. “Ukrainians have been prioritized over Africans — men and women — at every point,” Rachel Onyegbule, a Nigerian medical student, told CNN. “There’s no need for us to ask why. We know why.” The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put the Western world’s inability to see Black people as human in the spotlight. While rallying the troops and his people to fight back against Putin’s aggression, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was successful in appealing to our common humanity. It’s not something that Black and brown people in conflict have really ever been able to do. Even the ones trying to flee Ukraine. One CNN producer tweeted about his sister who is from Sierra Leone and lives in Ukraine. Her harrowing escape from the country included walking 10 hours in the cold, sleeping outdoors and abandoning belongings. One student from Guinea said he and other Africans were physically prevented from crossing into Ukraine while they watched white people be let through. “Unlike with people from the Middle East or countries with predominantly Black or brown populations, for whom war and other devastation are often seen as 'expected,' the Western media very quickly realized the humanity of Ukrainians.” Though many may feel as if the unprovoked attack on Ukraine is unprecedented, the horrifying truth is that for many countries and people, war has been a constant for decades. But Palestinians, Iraqis, Afghans and Syrians— though constantly under the threat of death and destruction — haven’t been receiving overwhelmingly warm welcomes and worldwide support. At times, it’s been the exact opposite. In 2015, Hungarian camerawoman Petra Laszlo was filmed tripping and kicking Middle Eastern refugees who had fled from war. She was sentenced to three years probation in 2017 but her sentence was overturned the following year. Unlike with people from the Middle East or countries with predominantly Black or brown populations, for whom war and other devastation are often seen as “expected” (as if their skin color predetermined whether or not they’d get to live a peaceful existence), the Western media very quickly realized the humanity of Ukrainians. “This isn’t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades,” CBS’s Charlie Agata said. “This is relatively civilized, relatively European.” Decoding the dog whistle is not rocket science; the outpouring of support for white Ukrainians while ignoring or even impeding Africans’ escape from the conflict is clearly rooted in white supremacy and the idea that we must do everything to stop war in countries like Ukraine while, in brown and Black countries, that’s just the way those people are. And in the United States, the racist double standard is so extreme that some Republicans are comparing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to alleged problems in other “white” countries — namely, this one. “We also have neighbors to the north who need freedom and need to be liberated and we need that right here at home as well,” Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) said at CPAC last week, equating a bloody invasion to wearing a mask at the grocery store in the U.S. and Canada. But still, after some early praise for Putin from former President Donald Trump, who remains the Republican Party’s standard-bearer, and from Fox News’ talking heads, even the GOP had to concede that the Ukrainians were putting up an impressive fight. Much of the world has united behind Ukraine. Members of Congress are wearing yellow and blue — the colors of the Ukrainian flag. Social media users have changed their profile pictures to declare their alliance with the Ukrainian people, and pundits are musing openly (and dangerously) about the U.S. getting directly involved. At President Joe Biden’s State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, his lines about the conflict drew bipartisan support. Republicans, whose sole goal is to oppose anything the Democrats believe in, were on their feet cheering and applauding Ukraine. Can you imagine getting bipartisan support for Afghan refugees or Black Lives Matter? The U.S. is rightly horrified. But the U.S. is also hypocritical. Turning entire nations into The Other is what leads to wars, genocides and other atrocities. This very thing that the U.S. and its allies are doing — declaring Ukraine good and therefore deserving of our support while either demonizing or flat-out ignoring similar atrocities in non-Western countries — is how wars like the one Russia is waging begin in the first place. The solution here, however, isn’t to turn our backs on Ukraine. But if the U.S. and the rest of the West want to consider themselves the good guys — the people who defend democracies and the ordinary people of the world — they must, for once, do the same for the people who don’t look like them.",3.2942046692326534,3.1432237041876614,0.15098096504499203,20

General Assembly, 141 of 193 member states voted for the resolution, a symbolic move that condemns the invasion of Ukraine and reflects the growing global outrage as the war there rages on. The document calls for an immediate end to the invasion and for the protection of civilians and those delivering humanitarian aid. Five countries voted against the resolution — Russia, Belarus, Syria, Eritrea and North Korea. “An overwhelming majority of nations around the world condemn Putin’s war,” Biden said Wednesday. “An overwhelming majority of nations recognize that Putin is not only attacking Ukraine, he is attacking the very foundations of global peace and security — and everything the United Nations stands for.” “And an overwhelming majority of the world recognizes that if we do not stand up to Putin’s Russia, it will only inflict further chaos and aggression on the world.” Putin thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond — and he thought he could divide us at home. He was wrong. I spent countless hours unifying our European Allies. We countered Russia’s lies with truth. And now, the free world is holding him accountable. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., told the body on Wednesday that the resolution was essential because the U.N. was being “challenged” by Putin’s actions. “If it has any purpose, it is to prevent war and to condemn war and to stop war,” she said before the vote. “That is our job here today.” Biden took direct aim at the Kremlin’s misinformation war behind the invasion, saying the vote shows “the world is rejecting Russia’s lies.” “We can all see what is happening in Ukraine with our own eyes,” he said. “Russia is responsible for the devastating abuses of human rights and the international humanitarian crisis that we are watching unfold in Ukraine in real time. There is no room for excuses or equivocation.” “Russia is to blame.”",2.9111327204257087,3.2952407126352212,-0.3841079922095125,3

The Fox News host whined to his millions of viewers on Monday that people are accusing him of rooting for Russia, days after he defended its president, Vladimir Putin, and leaned into Kremlin talking points ahead of its brutal invasion of Ukraine. He had argued Ukraine was “not a democracy” and delivered a lengthy rant last Tuesday questioning why he should be expected to hate the authoritarian leader. A clip of that monologue later aired on Russian state-sponsored TV with subtitles. But when Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) criticized Carlson’s rhetoric, noting that his comments served as televised material to rally Russians for Putin’s cause, Carlson was not happy. “It’s such an awful thing to say,” he griped after airing Swalwell’s remarks. “We hesitated to even play it.” He added: “It’s very common. You hear it every day. The question is: Why are they saying that? It doesn’t make sense.” Carlson’s critics did not have to look far back to offer him an explanation.

We are defending our home, we do not have any other option. We will not get tired, we will not stop, we will not surrender, we will continue defending our home.” Vacuum bombs, also known as thermobaric weapons, suck in oxygen to create high-temperature and high-pressure explosions that can cause widespread destruction and death. There hasn’t been independent confirmation that Russia has used vacuum bombs in Ukraine. On Saturday, CNN reporters near the Ukraine-Russia border said they identified a Russian thermobaric rocket launcher. Markarova said Russia is targeting orphanages and schools in Ukrainian cities. “We believe Russia, which is now acting like Nazi Germany during the World War II, essentially killing innocent civilians,” Markarova said. “It’s horrible, they have to pay the price, they have to be isolated.” She said Ukraine is working with the Biden administration and Congress to secure more weapons. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) who was among the senators meeting with Markarova behind closed doors Monday, told Politico the current crisis calls for unity. “This is the most dangerous moment since the Cuban missile crisis,” Murphy said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration has not confirmed reports of Russia using thermobaric weapons. “If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime,” Psaki said. World leaders have expressed alarm over Russia’s tactics during the invasion. “It is clear that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use barbaric and indiscriminate tactics against innocent civilians to bomb tower blocks, to send missiles into tower blocks, to kill children, as we’re seeing in increasing numbers,” U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday from Warsaw.

On Tuesday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that Russia’s invasion had “affected Ukrainians and non-citizens in many devastating ways.” “Africans seeking evacuation are our friends and need to have equal opportunities to return to their home countries safely,” the official said, adding that Ukraine’s government “spares no effort to solve the problem.” There have been numerous reports in recent days of African students and other immigrants facing racist treatment as they seek to flee cities under attack. This includes Black people being kept from boarding buses and trains even as white Ukrainians were able to and being kept waiting hours in the cold at the border with Poland. Earlier Tuesday, the United Nations’ high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, also recognized the “different treatment” between Ukrainians and “non-Ukrainians,” as he put it. “There should be absolutely no discrimination between Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians, Europeans and non-Europeans,” the U.N. official said, adding that the international organization “plans to intervene to try to ensure that everybody receives equal treatment.” “Everyone is fleeing from the same risks,” he added. Several African governments have condemned the racism Africans have faced as they’ve sought to leave the war-torn country. On Monday, the Nigerian government called out “unfortunate reports” of Ukrainian police “refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains” headed toward Ukraine’s border with Poland. South Africa’s head of public diplomacy echoed similar concerns that South African students and other Africans “have been badly treated” at Ukraine’s border with Poland. Over 600,000 people have fled Ukraine since Russia attacked last week, the U.N. said. The African Union, which represents the 55 countries of the African continent, said Monday that “reports that Africans are singled out for unacceptable dissimilar treatment would be shockingly racist and in breach [of] international law.” The nations urged all countries to “show the same empathy and support to all people fleeing war notwithstanding their racial identity.”",5.124452527622265,3.251154524550238,1.8732980030720268,27

The new Twitter account @RUOligarchJets, run by University of Central Florida student Jack Sweeney, tracks when private jets owned by Russia’s oligarchs take off and land — then sends out the locations to over 167,000 followers. Sweeney’s new tracking efforts come as Ukraine fights for its sovereignty after Russian invaded the European country under Putin’s direct orders. In his tracking, Sweeney found that these Russian-owned jets appeared to be traveling on a daily basis despite harsh financial sanctions and airspace travel restrictions that are being imposed on Russia by President Joe Biden and other allies to Ukraine. Sweeney uses public data provided by the ADS-B Exchange, a website that collects flight data in real time, to track the private Russian jets, just as he does with his other account @ElonJet, which tracks tech billionaire Musk. According to Sweeney, these Russian jets are more extravagant than other private jets he’s previously tracked. “The aircrafts these oligarchs have are absolutely crazy,” Sweeney told Bloomberg, emphasizing how Russia’s richest people were traveling on commercial-sized aircrafts including the Airbus A319 and Boeing 737. “Their planes are huge compared to other jets.” Sweeney first made headlines in late January after the tech-focused media site Protocol published a profile about the teen and Musk’s efforts to shut him down. The Twitter account caught the attention of Musk, who asked Sweeney in a direct message, “Can you take this down? It is a security risk,” according to Business Insider, which obtained a screenshot of the messages. Musk then offered to buy the account from Sweeney for $5,000, adding that the student would also be “generally helping make it harder for crazy people to track me,” Business Insider reported.",4.766132533687859,5.249998661629429,-0.48386612794157013,23

Five people died in the bombing. “To the world: what is the point of saying «never again» for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar? At least 5 killed. History repeating…” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted Tuesday. The attack comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked World War II as a justification for invading Ukraine, saying he wanted to “denazify” the country. As The Washington Post noted, Putin’s comments were likely meant to help sell the invasion back home, where “rhetoric around fighting fascism resonates deeply” still. Other countries quickly called Putin out for his cynical twisting of history. To start, Zelenskyy himself is Jewish and had family members killed in the Holocaust. Putin’s target may not have been Babyn Yar, but rather the TV tower located close to the memorial. The New York Times reported that videos captured at least two other explosions in the area, in addition to the one that struck the tower itself. But the damaging of Babyn Yar further delegitimizes Putin’s purported motives. Babyn Yar is the site of one of the worst mass murders of Jews during the Holocaust. On Sept. 29-30, 1941, Nazi killing squads executed more than 33,000 people there. Nazis murdered an estimated 100,000 people at Babyn Yar during World War II. In response to the Babyn Yar attack Tuesday, the Auschwitz Memorial in Poland tweeted, “It’s hard to expect the Russian army to respect the dead if it is not capable of respecting human lives.” Last week, it also said in a statement that people in Ukraine were being killed “purely because of insane pseudo-imperial megalomania.” The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum also tweeted its outrage about Babyn Yar on Tuesday. And previously, it called out Putin for exploiting the Holocaust to invade Ukraine. “In justifying this attack, Vladimir Putin has misrepresented and misappropriated Holocaust history by claiming falsely that democratic Ukraine needs to be ‘denazified,’” the museum said in a statement on Feb. 24. “Equally groundless and egregious are his claims that Ukrainian authorities are committing ‘genocide’ as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine.” The White House said Zelenskyy and President Joe Biden spoke Tuesday about continued U.S. support for Ukraine.

The British oil company said the share amounts to 19.75% of Russia’s Rosneft, a stake valued at $14 billion. It’s unclear how BP will divest itself of the holdings or who could buy them, but the decision reflects a broader shift among companies to abandon Moscow amid the ongoing assault. If BP walks away from the holdings completely it could cost the company up to $25 billion, it said. “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region,” Helge Lund, the company’s chairman said in a statement. “BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change. It has led the BP board to conclude, after a thorough process, that our involvement with Rosneft, a state-owned enterprise, simply cannot continue.” BP’s current and former chief executives, Bernard Looney and Bob Dudley, also resigned from the Rosneft board with immediate effect. In response, Rosneft released a statement attacking western media and accusing BP of bowing to public pressure to destroy a “30-year-long cooperation.” “BP has come under unprecedented pressure from both the regulator and its shareholders,” Rosneft said in a statement translated by The Associated Press. “BP’s decision was preceded by a Western media campaign full of false reports and conclusions.” Russia has drawn widespread fury around the globe for the invasion of Ukraine and faces both economic sanctions and a broader movement to reject anything to do with the Kremlin. Russian planes have been barred from many European nations’ airspace. Norway said its sovereign wealth fund would divest billions in assets from Russia. And liquor outlets in the U.S. and Canada have begun pulling Russian vodka from store shelves. Western nations have also said they will block Russia’s access to global financial networks. The BP decision came amid sharp criticism from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and shortly after a call between BP’s chief executive and the British business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. Kwarteng praised BP’s move on Twitter: I welcome BP’s decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft oil company.Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine must be a wake up call for British businesses with commercial interests in Putin’s Russia.",4.115882907645955,4.165242489440271,-0.049359581794315766,27

But that didn’t stop the former president from taking credit for the existence of the group of Western powers on Monday in a statement emailed to reporters: “I hope everyone is able to remember that it was me, as President of the United States, that got delinquent NATO members to start paying their dues, which amounted to hundreds of billions of dollars. There would be no NATO if I didn’t act strongly and swiftly. Also, it was me that got Ukraine the very effective anti-tank busters (Javelins) when the previous Administration was sending blankets. Let History so note!” Trump bragged. Observers familiar with Trump’s antipathy toward NATO and his lack of concern for Ukraine’s defense against Russia quickly pointed out the fact-free nature of his statement. Politico reporter Sam Stein (formerly of HuffPost) posted Trump’s statement on Twitter, with some context. Trump, who discussed pulling the US from NATO takes credit for NATO’s existence in a new statement. Trump, who threatened to withhold weapons funding from Ukraine to get dirt on Biden, takes credit for Ukrainian weapons in same statement.  Others soon followed, including retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the former National Security Council aide who reported that Trump was trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son in exchange for U.S. aid. That disclosure helped form the basis of Trump’s first impeachment. It was trump that undermine U.S. national security & froze military assistance to Ukraine, leaving that lion of a nation, vulnerable to attack. It was Trump’s attacks on NATO that encouraged Putin to believe NATO was fragile. Others also provided fact checks. July 25, 2019Zelenskyy: “[W]e are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.”Trump: “I want you do us a favor though…” This is the guy who withheld military aid to Ukraine, openly talked of dismantling NATO, and cozied up to Putin. Perhaps he should sit this one out. Trump threatened with withdraw if countries didn’t meet minimum obligation of GDP spending on their own defense. Lativa’s FM, and other Baltic state leaders, said the admin overall strengthened NATO and increased spending on defense. None of this here is true. And never forget that when donald trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to extort President Zelenskyy, 99% of republicans in Congress refused to remove trump from office. Trump ordered 12K US forces to leave Germany — because it didn’t do what he wanted. Let History so note! One person did find it interesting as a “politicial litmus test” that Trump now wants to take credit for NATO, considering that the world is rallying for Ukraine and against Russia. All the incongruities cited aside, there’s one notable thing about this statement. As a political litmus test. Trump has a knack for jumping into a parade and claiming it’s his. It’s notable that Trump *wants* to take credit for this.",4.013043109343367,4.172476489574009,-0.15943338023064246,15

John Oliver opened his HBO show on Sunday night with a segment about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the Emmy-winning host couldn’t help but tackle how CNN “somehow managed” to make its coverage of air-raid sirens blaring in Kyiv “even worse” by transitioning from the devastating scene to an “aggressively American” ad. The Applebee’s spot, which went viral last week, features a man Oliver refers to as a “human boot barn” shaking “his nonexistent ass” to the tune of Zac Brown Band’s “Chicken Fried.” The abrupt cutaway from the somber Ukraine footage to the ridiculous ad could have come straight from 2006’s “Idiocracy.” WW3 sponsored by Applebees. We’re living in an episode of South Park.  Soon after the spot went viral last week, Applebee’s acknowledged that the ad placement was inappropriate and said “it never should have been aired” — and Oliver pointed out the significance of the company doing this. “You know if Applebee’s is apologizing for interrupting the coverage of Russia invading Ukraine, this week got seriously out of hand,” he said.

Snider first endorsed the use of the anti-authoritarian anthem on Saturday on Twitter, and explained he had very personal reasons for doing so. “I absolutely approve of Ukrainians using ‘We’re Not Gonna Take It’ as their battlecry,” he wrote. “My grandfather was Ukrainian, before it was swallowed up by the USSR after WW2. This can’t happen to these people again!” I absolutely approve of Ukrainians using ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" as their battlecry. My grandfather was Ukrainian, before it was swallowed up by the USSR after WW2. This can't happen to these people again! #FUCKRUSSIA But Snider hasn’t always signed off on the song being used as an anthem. In September 2020, he forbade the song to be used by a group of what he called “moronic” anti-maskers in Florida who didn’t want to cover up in a Fort Lauderdale Target store. Snider explained why he gave permission to Ukrainians while condemning the Florida anti-maskers in a fiery Twitter post, saying in part, “Well, one use is for a righteous battle against oppression; the other is a infantile feet stomping against an inconvenience.” People are asking me why I endorsed the use of ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" for the Ukrainian people and did not for the anti-maskers.

The 157-foot Lady Anastasia, which belongs to Rosoboronexport director general Alexander Mikheev, was docked in Majorca, Spain, over the weekend when the sailor, who worked on the boat as a mechanic, opened the engine room’s valves in an attempt to sink it, the BBC and local news outlets reported. “My boss is a criminal who sells weapons that kill the Ukrainian people,” the sailor, identified as 55-year-old Taras Ostapchuk, told officers on Saturday as he turned himself in, according to the Majorca Daily Bulletin. He stood by his actions the following day in court, saying: “I don’t regret anything I’ve done and I would do it again.” The man told the court he had worked on the vessel as a mechanic for about 10 years and decided to scuttle it after seeing video of a Russian military cruise missile hitting a building in Kyiv during Russia’s invasion. A high-rise apartment building near Kyiv’s Zhuliany airport was struck by a missile on Saturday. The assault left at least six civilians injured, a rescue worker told The Associated Press. The man said he believed that the missile was produced by Mikheev’s company and so opened the valves, flooding and severely damaging the engine room, according to the Daily Bulletin. Prior to becoming CEO of Rosoboronexport, Mikheev was general director of Russian Helicopters, which is Russia’s largest rotorcraft manufacturer. The sailor was released by the court and said he planned to return to Ukraine to help the war efforts, the Daily Bulletin reported, citing an interview he gave with local Spanish news outlet Ultima Hora.

Engel noted Monday that a massive Russian convoy was in a position to be destroyed by the U.S. or NATO and said that direct involvement against Russia would risk “everything,” meaning a nuclear war. However, in the next sentence, he said, “Does the West watch in silence as it rolls?” Perhaps the biggest risk-calculation/moral dilemma of the war so far. A massive Russian convoy is abt 30 miles from Kyiv. The US/NATO could likely destroy it. But that would be direct involvement against Russia and risk, everything. Does the West watch in silence as it rolls? But as Reason.com noted, “the U.S. cannot attack Russia because Congress has yet to declare war on the country. And make no mistake, a direct attack on Russian forces by either the U.S. or NATO would be an act of war” and dramatically increase the risk of nuclear warfare. Many Twitter users were shocked that Engel seemed almost eager to get his war on and also tried to remind him: Be careful what you wish for. This is an NBC News US senior correspondent near-demanding that nuclear powers enter a hot war. It is always incredible to witness how so many American reporters become champions for US militarism, without a shred of concern for the human life they purport to care about. This is NBC's chief foreign policy correspondent, advocating for, uh, nuclear war. How is this journalism? This is utter madness. A major network's chief corresp is asking thisSince USSR got nukes in 1950s, US policy under *every* prez has been not to fight USSR/RUS directly *except* (a) w/in NATO or (b) Western hemis—Cuban Missile Crisis “Watch in silence” = Hungary 1956, Czech 1968, Berlin many times The way you tweet about whether the US and NATO should engage in a full-on war against a nuclear-armed super power is shockingly glib. It's not as simple as ""watch in silence as it rolls"" or not. The stakes are risking nuclear annihilation. 1) No one is watching in silence, the West has done almost everything Ukraine has asked of it, and 2) you're asking for world war and nuclear standoff. Hopefully no one at US/NATO is taking that even remotely seriously. Richard Engel: So is Biden gonna start WW3 or what here? Nice framing. False binary. Putin couldn't script it better. Very dramatic. A long time ago I wrote something arguing that the Kantian idea of ""fiat justicia, ruat caelum"" wasn't entirely coherent when it comes to literally world-ending choices because the moral project of improving the world requires that there be a world left to improve Remember that in Richard Engel's book ""War Journal"" he said that before the invasion of Iraq he knew it ""was a land where careers were going to be made"" and that being there for war was his ""big break"" should nato blow up a bunch of russian military personnel? i am very smart. Some people offered advice to Engel in hopes he’d rethink the point he was making in his tweet. i dunno if i was a chief foreign correspondent i would not glibly wonder why one nuclear power isn't carpet bombing another nuclear power's forces if you want a war so badly, go enlist Pro tip: do not tweet questions like this until you've given at least, oh, I don't know, a whole thirty seconds of thought to steps two, three, and four of your decision tree.

Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) endorsed the idea of creating a no-fly zone over Ukraine amid the Russian invasion of the eastern European country, which grows deadlier by the day as Russian troops lay siege to population centers. “Clearly, in the absence of a U.N. resolution, which Russia would veto, a strong coalition of like-minded nations should step in and seriously consider this,” Wicker told HuffPost on Monday. Ukrainian officials are reportedly urging President Joe Biden and NATO to impose a no-fly zone over parts of the country as large numbers of Russian troops approach the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, but top White House officials have ruled out the idea. A no-fly zone would require “implementation by the U.S. military — it would essentially mean the U.S. military would be shooting down planes, Russian planes,” threatening the outbreak of a larger war involving the U.S., White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. “That is definitely escalatory, that would potentially put us in a place where we are in a military conflict with Russia. That is not something [Biden] wants to do,” Psaki said in an interview on MSNBC. “Those are all the reasons why that’s not a good idea.” Most Republicans also oppose the idea of sending U.S. troops into Ukraine. “They’re not a NATO country, as much as we want to help them. I don’t think we can get in a situation where we’re almost asking for engagement,” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said Monday when asked if he supported imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) offered a blunter response. “That would mean World War III,” he told HuffPost. But Wicker, who will likely become the next top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee after Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) steps down later this year, argued Russian President Vladimir Putin is “the one escalating this war.” “Tens of thousands of women and children fleeing from Kyiv west have created a humanitarian situation that the international community needs to step in and be involved in,” he argued. Earlier on Monday, Wicker issued a statement knocking Biden for taking “options off the table, including close air support,” amid the conflict in Ukraine. That comment drew a response from Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who tweeted, “Let’s just be clear what that is - the U.S. and Russia at war. It’s a bad idea and Congress would never authorize it.” “Military equipment for Ukraine, humanitarian support for Ukraine, crippling sanction on Russia, movement of U.S. troops to the eastern flank of NATO - these are all the right moves,” Murphy added. “But direct war between the world’s two nuclear powers should be a non-starter.",4.1717130281071855,3.8062759306084053,0.3654370974987802,3

On Monday, the Nigerian government called out the “unfortunate reports” of Ukrainian police “refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains” headed toward Ukraine’s border with Poland. With around 4,000 Nigerians, mostly students, “stranded” in Ukraine, the Nigerian government said, there have been reports of Polish officials refusing Africans entry into Poland. “It is paramount that everyone is treated with dignity and without favour,” Nigeria’s presidential office and residence said in a statement on Twitter. “All who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN Convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.” South Africa’s head of public diplomacy echoed similar concerns that South African students and other Africans “have been badly treated” at Ukraine’s border with Poland. The South African foreign office official shared a video of a woman at a Ukrainian border town saying Africans waiting to cross were being “pushed,” “shoved” and “denied access,” forced to wait in the cold as Ukrainians got “special treatment.” SA students & other Africans have been badly treated at the #Ukrain/Poland border. 🇿🇦 Amb J Mngomezulu has driven from Warsaw (5 hours) to go deal with the matter, receive our nationals & offer further support. 🇿🇦 Amb G Tsengiwe in Hungary is also attending to SANs on his side.  One Nigerian man, identified only as Isaac, told BBC News that Africans were being “chased back” and hit by police “armed with sticks,” and said border officials had told them they were “not tending to Africans.” Another Nigerian, Osemen, told the news outlet that only Ukrainians were being permitted to board a train in Lviv to the border with Poland. A group of Congolese students told Canada’s CTV News that Africans were being “put aside” until border guards processed Ukrainians, and were told that “Ukrainians go first.” Responding to the reports of disparate treatment, the Polish embassy in Nigeria said in a statement Saturday that “all nationals are given equal treatment and none are discriminated against,” adding that Nigerians were “among those” who’d been able to cross into Poland “in recent days.” The Polish government in Nigeria added that the situation at the border is “becoming increasingly challenging” and that it takes “longer with each passing day” to get through. Tens of thousands of African students have been studying in Ukraine, according to Reuters. Over 500,000 people have fled the country since Russia attacked last week, the United Nations said. The U.S. civil rights group the NAACP released a statement Monday condemning the mistreatment of Black people seeking to flee Ukraine, saying: “As history has taught us, whenever there is a crisis, Black and brown communities will feel the effects first and be provided with aid last.” “Black families, immigrants… are not only facing challenges to evacuate a deadly warzone but are being pushed from trains and beaten by police officers,” the NAACP said. “These callous acts are atrocious and reprehensible… Every individual must be treated with dignity and humanity.”",5.495614313075442,3.593137316272309,1.902476996803133,27

D’Agata’s characterization was among a flurry of similar commentary in the media that critics have slammed as racist and, in some cases, historically inaccurate. While reporting from Kyiv on Friday, a day after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, D’Agata said of the latter country, “This isn’t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades.” “This is a relatively civilized, relatively European — I have to choose those words carefully, too — city, where you wouldn’t expect that or hope that it’s going to happen,” he said. “Civilized”  A clip of the moment drew millions of views and condemnation from many people, including historians and journalism organizations. “As someone who has lived through wars and invasions with the world watching, I deeply empathize with the Ukrainian people. The deeply racist coverage has been very telling as well,” Mostafa Minawi, an associate professor of history at Cornell University, wrote on Twitter. “I wonder what would lead someone like [D’Agata] to think it is ok to compare the value of peoples’ lives and who qualifies as ‘civilized.’” Nader Issa, a reporter at the Chicago Sun-Times, tweeted, “If that’s the version where he chooses his words carefully, was the alternative just going to be ‘these are civilized white people and not uncivilized brown people.’” The Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association (AMEJA) released a statement in response to coverage of the Ukraine crisis, citing D’Agata’s remarks as one of several examples of “racist news coverage that ascribes more importance to some victims of war over others.” AMEJA called on all news organizations to be mindful of implicit and explicit bias in their coverage of the war. D’Agata responded to the criticism during a Saturday report, saying, “I spoke in a way that I regret, and for that I’m sorry.” He said what he’d been trying to convey was that Ukraine had not seen war on this scale in recent years, compared to conflicts he’d covered in other parts of the world. Several other journalists and public figures have been called out for similarly troubling analyses. David Sakvarelidze, the former deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine, said in a BBC interview that “it’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed” by Russia’s assault. The BBC journalist interviewing him did not challenge the comment. [Thread] The most racist Ukraine coverage on TV News. 1. The BBC - “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed” - Ukraine’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze  Daniel Hannan, a British journalist and former pro-Brexit politician, wrote in The Telegraph, “They seem so like us. That is what makes it so shocking. War is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations. It can happen to anyone.” And Al Jazeera English anchor Peter Dobbie said it was “compelling” that the refugees appeared to be “middle-class people.” “These are not obviously refugees trying to get away from areas in the Middle East that are still in a big state of war. These are not people trying to get away from areas in North Africa,” he said. “They look like any European family that you would live next door to.” In addition to accusations of racism, several critics called out the inaccurate implication that this type of conflict has been limited to countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia in recent history, pointing to wars in Europe in the 1990s. In 1992, war broke out in Bosnia. 100,000 deaths, countless refugees, Sarajevo sieged. And before that, war in Croatia and Slovenia. After, war in Kosovo. Can we please stop calling Ukraine ""the worst armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War""? It's deeply disrespectful  Al Jazeera later apologized for its presenter’s comments, calling them unfair, insensitive and irresponsible. It added that the “breach of professionalism is being dealt with.” The BBC and The Telegraph did not immediately return requests for comment. In its statement, AMEJA warned newsrooms not to make comparisons that “weigh the significance or imply justification of one conflict over another.” “This type of commentary reflects the pervasive mentality in Western journalism of normalizing tragedy in parts of the world such as the Middle East, Africa, South Asia and Latin America,” the group said. “It dehumanizes and renders their experience with war as somehow normal and expected.”",3.7439667890198365,5.136180864520855,-1.3922140755010188,20

They have a great president right now who has really said clearly, ‘Live free or die.’ He said, ‘I don’t need a ride, give me ammunition. The fight is right here,’” Boebert said in an interview with Fox News personalities Kayleigh McEnany and Pete Hegseth at the Conservative Political Action Conference that aired on the Fox Nation streaming service. “But we also have neighbors to the north who need freedom and need to be liberated and we need that right here at home as well.” Lauren Boebert told Fox Nation at CPAC that Canada needs to be ""liberated"" along with Ukraine.""We also have neighbors to the north who need freedom.""  The gun-obsessed, extremist lawmaker had been referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s refusal of a U.S. offer to be evacuated from Kyiv, as Russian troops continued to press into the capital in an unprovoked attack that has shocked the world. Zelenskyy has vowed to defend the country with its citizens, saying, “We are not putting down arms.” The city’s residents have sheltered in underground bunkers and subway stations and accepted weapons from the government to join the fight in the streets as Russian airstrikes rain down on the capital and other cities. Boebert made the outrageous comments after Hegseth brought up Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and called him an “autocrat” because he quashed anti-vaccine protests that had paralyzed international supply chains for weeks. The demonstrators were against vaccine mandates and an assortment of other measures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Boebert claimed President Joe Biden is “jealous” of the control that “tyrant Trudeau” has, adding that the Ukraine crisis is “all because of weakness in America.” She did not mention the actual cause of the Ukraine crisis, Russia’s authoritarian president, Vladimir Putin. Boebert is notorious for making hateful, bigoted and false statements with potentially dangerous repercussions.

Russia: Airlines are cancelling flights in/out of Russia; numerous countries closed airspace to Russian airlines. U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available. Our advisory level is 4: Do Not Travel.  The alerts came as the European Union on Sunday said it will impose a blanket flight ban on all Russian planes, whether they are “Russian-owned, Russian-registered or Russian-controlled aircraft.” Private Russian planes have also been banned from entering the U.K.’s airspace. The State Department raised its travel advisory for Russia to its highest level late last month, while urging U.S. citizens to avoid all travel there if possible. “Do not travel to Russia due to ongoing tension along the border with Ukraine, the potential for harassment against U.S. citizens, the embassy’s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia, COVID-19 and related entry restrictions, terrorism, harassment by Russian government security officials, and the arbitrary enforcement of local law,” the department said at the time.

The weapons’ planned purchase and delivery to a country under attack would be a first for the EU. We are stepping up our support for Ukraine.For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack. We are also strengthening our sanctions against the Kremlin. “So let me be very clear, our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane and that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” she said of the first of several tactics being rolled out. Plans are also underway to ban RT, formerly known as Russia Today, and Sputnik state media, said von der Leyen, who slammed both as part of the “Kremlin’s media machine.” Both outlets “will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war and to saw division in our union,” she said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the ban will be strictly on television broadcasts or on the internet as well. The EU’s decision to supply Ukraine with military arms is a major turning point for the union, which had at times been split on how to respond to Russia’s aggression. It follows other Western countries stepping up their own military aid in recent days. President Joe Biden on Saturday instructed the U.S. State Department to free up an additional $350 million worth of weapons for Ukraine. The U.S. has already committed more than $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine over the past year, said Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Germany on Saturday also reversed its long-standing policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones. Russia’s invasion “marks a turning point,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said while announcing his decision. “It threatens our entire post-war order. In this situation, it is our duty to do our utmost to support Ukraine in defending itself against Vladimir Putin’s invading army. Germany stands closely by Ukraine’s side,” he said in a statement. Scholz’s decision didn’t affect only Germany’s weapons contribution but other countries’ as well. Estonia had last month requested to send weapons to Ukraine that had been previously owned by Germany and Finland, but under international law, the Baltic state had to get permission from both countries to do so. Though the U.S. State Department cleared Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to send U.S.-made missiles and other weapons to Ukraine, Germany’s government had refused, as The Wall Street Journal reported.",4.601722139142717,3.912244533837924,0.6894776053047935,15

So there is this little game that’s called the turtle game, to explain to them how to act during the attacks,” Rudyk told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Saturday. “So you tell them that you go down on your belly, you open up your mouth, you close your ears with your hands, and that’s how you pretend you’re a turtle. And we had to pretend that we are turtles quite a few times today.” Kira Rudyk, a member of the Ukrainian parliament & a mother, describes the “turtle game” that parents teach their kids to do for protection in #Kyiv: “Go down on your belly, you open your mouth, close your ears with your hands, and that’s how you pretend that you’re a turtle.”  The game described by Rudyk is similar to duck-and-cover drills commonly practiced by U.S. students during the Cold War era. While stressing the need for more humanitarian aid, UNICEF said the attacks on Ukraine pose an “immediate and growing threat to the lives and well-being of the country’s 7.5 million children.” Rudyk has spoken to several news outlets about attacks on Kyiv, including airstrikes, that have taken place since Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday.

The Ukrainian Chorus Dumka of New York took the famous Rockefeller Center stage to perform “Prayer for Ukraine,” a patriotic Ukrainian hymn and anthem, during the show’s cold open. The sobering performance followed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military invasion into the country earlier in the week. “It is a prayer to God to save Ukraine and to bless her with freedom, good faith and good fortune so that her people would love her for many, many years,” the choir’s director and conductor, Vasyl Hrechynsky, told HuffPost Sunday of the 1885 song selection, which is also known as “God Bless Ukraine.” “It has continued to be a way that we express our faith in God and that He will allow Ukraine to persevere especially in this most critical time of aggression and war,” he added. “SNL” cast members Kate McKinnon and Cecily Strong introduced viewers to the choir. Following the performance, the camera panned to white candles on a table that spelled out “Kyiv,” the Ukrainian capital, as the audience sat in silence.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Sunday that Democrats including President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.) all are part of the reason that Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. “I don’t think Vladimir Putin would have moved on Ukraine were it not for the weakness displayed ― certainly by the Biden administration, but by the West in general,” Johnson said in a Fox News Sunday interview. “I’m certainly hoping that Col. Vindman, Adam Schiff, Nancy Pelosi ― who used Ukraine as a pawn in their impeachment travesty ― are also recognizing and reflecting about how they weakened Ukraine, weakened the West, weakened America by the divisive politics that they play.” “There’s much blame to go around, but in terms of atrocities, that falls squarely on the shoulders of Vladimir Putin and his cronies,” Johnson added. Ron Johnson blames Vindman, Pelosi, and Adam Schiff for weakening Ukraine with Trump’s impeachment  Democrats did not randomly bring Ukraine into the 2019 impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump. They were not the ones using the country as a political pawn. That year, Trump held back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in order to pressure the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to dig up dirt on the Biden family. The money, which was approved by Congress, was intended to help Ukraine fight Russian aggression. Trump finally released the money after pressures from lawmakers in both parties. Zelenskyy had also desperately sought a meeting with Trump ― which was never granted ― as a show of force against Russia. He finally received his White House meeting last August, with President Joe Biden. Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, led the prosecution in the Trump impeachment trial. Col. Alexander Vindman was a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council at the time, and one of the few people to listen in on Trump’s July 2019 call with Zelenskyy. Vindman’s testimony was a key part of Democrats’ impeachment of Trump. “I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government’s support of Ukraine,” Vindman told lawmakers. Rachel Vindman, Alexander’s wife, tweeted a defense of her husband Sunday, saying Johnson was “the last person anyone would want in their foxhole.” Alexander Vindman retweeted it. On CNN Sunday, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) acknowledged what Trump did, calling it “very sad.” “There are many people who would like to ignore that…This was Zelensky, now a world hero, asking for weapons. And it was an American president slow-walking the provision of those weapons,” he said. Johnson’s comments are in line with what many other Republicans are saying in response to Putin’s aggression. On one hand, they condemn what the Russian leader is doing ― while saying that Biden and Democrats bear responsibility for being so weak. Trump himself has repeatedly said that the invasion of Ukraine is happening only because of the “rigged election” ― his lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. Other Republicans have blamed everything from Biden’s energy policies to his withdrawal from Afghanistan for opening the door to Putin.",5.175493012182465,5.750959986213172,-0.5754669740307072,16

The move is the most drastic financial sanction yet on Russian President Vladimir Putin over his brutal, ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine. The statement said the U.S., top European economies, Britain, and Canada would disconnect selected Russian banks from SWIFT, which will severely hurt their ability to operate internationally, and prevent Russia’s central bank from using its foreign currency reserves to evade Western sanctions. The pro-Ukraine countries will also make it harder for wealthy Russians to obtain Western citizenship and launch a task force to freeze the assets of Russian elites — a bid to pressure Putin by hurting his friends. “We stand with the Ukrainian people in this dark hour,” the statement continued. “Even beyond the measures we are announcing today, we are prepared to take further measures to hold Russia to account for its attack on Ukraine.” In a call with reporters later in the day, a senior Biden administration official said that between the new measures and previously announced sanctions, “Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah.” The U.S. expects the move to cause “most banks around the world [to] simply stop transacting altogether with Russian banks that are out of SWIFT,” the official added, saying the list of affected banks would be released soon and will ultimately be determined by the European Union because Belgium administers the SWIFT system. The official noted that China, from which Russia has sought support despite the Chinese leadership’s uncertainty about Putin’s plans, “has tended to respect the force of U.S. sanctions.” While much of the international debate has recently focused on SWIFT, the steps against the Russian central bank and rich Russians could be even more striking and painful for Moscow. “We’ll go after their yachts, their luxury apartments, their money and their ability to send their kids to fancy schools in the West,” the official said. “The ruble will fall even further, inflation will spike and the central bank will be left defenseless.” The announcement came as Russian forces continued to try to capture Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv and strategic targets elsewhere in the country. It represents a significant escalation by America’s European partners, many of whom worry about the economic toll their own countries will experience if they cut off ties with Russia. Earlier in the day, Germany — a key holdout on the SWIFT sanctions — signaled a harder position against Putin by sending anti-tank weapons to the Ukrainians and lifting a hold on the Netherlands doing so with German-made arms. “The Russian invasion marks a turning point. It is our duty to support Ukraine to the best of our ability in defending against Putin’s invading army,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. The Biden administration official emphasized that the ultimate goal of the U.S. and its allies is to stop the fighting ― not to continue punishing Putin and Russians. “This is a sad outcome, this is not where we wanted to be,” the official said. “Only Putin can decide how much more cost he is willing to bear.”",3.6847771614455636,2.872321233069749,0.8124559283758144,25

International aid groups and foreign governments are rushing to address what could become Europe’s worst humanitarian crisis in decades. Supporters of the Ukrainians have been preparing to help for weeks as Russian troops have amassed along Ukraine’s borders ― but it’s impossible for them to know exactly how desperate the situation will become, what resources they will need and how their ability to help may be limited. “We already know from the 2014 incursion what the in-demand services are for people that are displaced ... receiving them at bus and train stations, providing information and referrals for things like where the closest pharmacy is, and providing a meal and a place to rest,” said Britton Buckner of the group Catholic Relief Services, which works with a network of Catholic charities called Caritas. “Coordinating with local governments and finding gaps has been taking place ... In parallel, we’re also doing robust volunteer mobilization in 3,500 parishes.” Russia began intervening in neighboring Ukraine in 2014 by supporting separatist fighters, who took over parts of the country’s east and fought Ukrainian government forces backed by the U.S. and Western nations. Before the 2022 invasion, that conflict had already killed more than 13,000 people and displaced nearly a million. “The situation now is very fluid ... The initial phase of displacement is people who have the means to move. As the situation unfolds, we will see where the safe havens are” for others who are forced to leave home, Buckner said. She noted that within Ukraine, cash and fuel are already in short supply and many shops are running low on goods. At Ukraine’s border with Romania, Buckner saw people coming across by foot and in taxis on the first day of the Russian assault, and in Moldova, her organization helped some families who were able to arrive by air before Ukraine ended commercial flights. On Saturday, United Nations refugee chief Filippo Grandi said more than 150,000 Ukrainians had now entered those two countries and neighboring Poland and Hungary. “Displacement in Ukraine is also growing but the military situation makes it difficult to estimate numbers and provide aid,” Grandi tweeted. European leaders say they are ready and willing to shelter Ukrainians. In nations like Romania, Ukrainians can count on minority Ukrainian populations who share their language and may be especially keen to help, Buckner said. And some countries are unveiling new programs for the refugees: Slovakian official Livia Vasakova said her country will offer a special status that includes free health care, public transport and the legal right to work, for example. Russia’s recent pressure against its neighbors has given relief groups on the continent experience in helping not just Ukrainians but others ― like people fleeing Belarus, whose Russian-backed ruler cracked down on his population in 2020 and 2021, Jonathan Katz, a former official at the U.S. Agency for International Development, told HuffPost. “There would be an expectation, from the European Union aid mechanisms to U.S. and international systems, that... help would be needed,” said Katz, who is now with the German Marshall Fund, a think tank. The Biden administration has directed American troops in Poland to help open refugee processing centers, and has sent disaster specialists to the country. The White House is also asking Congress to approve $2.9 billion in funding for emergency humanitarian assistance for Ukraine ― a step that experts say is important because there are so many other global crises that the U.S. has already committed to addressing. Some commentators have noted there’s a stark difference between the broad solidarity being shown to Ukrainians and the xenophobia and resistance that European governments like Hungary and Poland displayed toward people displaced by other conflicts, like the Syrian civil war. Inside Ukraine, the ongoing fighting and broader disruption are making life harder for Ukrainians as they struggle to keep their country independent. Doctors Without Borders has suspended its operations, and other aid groups are wary of getting caught in the crossfire, particularly since U.S. intelligence suggests Russia will target prominent figures in civil society to try to weaken Ukraine. Buckner said her Ukrainians colleagues are “patriots” who are balancing their desire to be safe with their commitment to helping others. “We’re all living with fears that there would be targeting of many kinds, but that’s one of the elements of a faith-based humanitarian organization: It’s really a cause, it’s really a calling,” she said. “That doesn’t make it easier, but it makes it more livable.” Many Ukrainians have not yet received their salaries for the month of February, she noted, worsening the economic toll of the war. Analysts say the most important humanitarian assistance is cash, because trying to buy and ship food, for instance, incurs administrative costs and threatens already dysfunctional supply chains. Meanwhile, thousands of families are facing the difficult decision of whether to separate or try to stay together. Ukraine is not allowing men between the ages of 18 and 60 to leave, saying they must stay to defend their nation. It is widely expected that Russia’s assault will only become more brutal. Despite Moscow’s claims that it is only attacking military targets, The New York Times verified an instance of a missile hitting a residential building in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, and on-the-ground reports say combat is taking place in civilian neighborhoods. Russian forces repeatedly hit civilians and facilities like hospitals in their recent offensive in Syria. “I presume everyone understands we have not yet seen real war in Ukraine,” Artyom Lukin, an international relations scholar at the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, Russia, tweeted on Saturday. “It’s obvious the Russian military is under the order not to harm civilians and the infrastructure. Real war begins once this self-restraint is lifted. I fear to think what follows after this.”",2.9836248827931597,3.1386978353364,-0.15507295254324038,3

The former “Daily Show” host discussed Zelenskyy with writers Robby Slowik and Rob Christensen on his new show, “The Problem With Jon Stewart.” “We are comedians, and we know the general brand of cowardice that runs through our business,” said Stewart. That, he said, was in stark contrast to the actions of Zelenskyy, who has emerged as a strong wartime leader during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Zelenskyy has posted videos expressing his resolution to stay in Kyiv, the country’s capital, and fight, despite threats to his life. When the United States offered to evacuate Zelenskyy from the city, he reportedly said, “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.” In a new video on Feb. 26, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pushes back on what he says is misinformation: “We aren't going to lay down our arms. We are going to defend our nation.”  “We’re watching Shecky Greene transform into Churchill,” Stewart said, a reference to the nightclub comedian who was a frequent guest on Johnny Carson’s “Tonight Show,” and former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who led the United Kingdom during World War II.

Earlier this week, Trump praised Putin as “savvy” and a “genius” for seizing an entire country and suffering only “two dollars’ worth of sanctions.” Thirteen months after leaving office, Trump remains the most influential voice in the Republican Party, particularly among the sorts of activists drawn to events like CPAC. Hundreds of attendees wore “Make American Great Again” caps, “Trump 2024” T-shirts and “Trump Won” buttons. The biggest, busiest vendors in the exhibit hall were the ones selling Trump gear. From the stage, the one person getting the most shout-outs and praise was the president who tried to overthrow the republic in his attempt to remain in power despite losing his election by millions of votes. “This is Donald Trump’s party, and I’m a Donald Trump Republican,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, a few hours before Trump’s arrival. Saturday night, Trump continued his attacks on U.S. and NATO leaders, blaming President Joe Biden, a Democrat, for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “They’re not so smart. They’re looking the opposite of smart,” Trump said. “Putin is playing Biden like a drum, and it’s not a pretty thing.” Trump repeatedly praised Putin for at least a decade prior to running for president as he tried to build a condominium tower in Moscow. In a 2007 letter, he told Putin he was “a big fan.” Trump continued to push his “Trump Tower Moscow” project even as he ran for president in 2015 and 2016, and publicly praised Putin as a better leader than then-President Barack Obama. In 2016, Trump openly asked for Russia’s help as he ran against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He subsequently used material stolen by Russian spies to attack Clinton every day in the final stretch of the race, even though he knew it had been stolen by Russian spies. Once in the White House, Trump repeatedly attacked NATO and the European Union ― actions that aligned with Putin’s long-term objectives of weakening or destroying both institutions. He falsely claimed that the military alliance created by the United States after World War II and the free-trade zone were somehow cheating Americans. He mused about withdrawing from NATO entirely, and reportedly intended to do so in a second term. Trump also continued to praise Putin and defend him, even telling the world in 2018 that he believed Putin over his own intelligence agencies regarding Putin’s work to get Trump elected. A year later, he tried to have Russia readmitted to the G7 group of large democratic economies, from which it was expelled for invading and annexing Crimea in 2014. Trump said he understood Russia’s need to keep the Crimean Peninsula because it had built a base there for its “large and powerful submarines.” Also in 2019, Trump tried to extort Volodymyr Zelenskyy, then the newly elected president of Ukraine, into smearing Biden, at the time the Democrat he most feared as a 2020 opponent, using $391 million in congressionally approved military aid as leverage. The aid was released only after a whistleblower complaint about it became public, and the episode was the basis of the first of Trump’s two impeachments. Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol ― his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― killed five people, including a police officer. The attack also injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides. Trump is now under investigation by federal and state officials in multiple jurisdictions. New York state Attorney General Letitia James has been conducting a civil probe of his family business, while the district attorney in Manhattan has been running a criminal investigation. Meanwhile, the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, has impaneled a special grand jury to focus on Trump’s attempt to coerce state officials to “find” enough votes to overturn his loss of that state to Biden in 2020. And the House Jan. 6 committee has been subpoenaing more and more former and current Trump aides to determine his precise role in that day’s events, while the Department of Justice has confirmed that it is investigating at least one element of Trump’s scheme to remain in power: the submission of fake Trump “electors” in states that Biden won. At a Jan. 29 rally, Trump asked his followers to stage “the biggest protests we have ever had in Washington, D.C., in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere” if prosecutors come after him, “because our country and our elections are corrupt.” Despite this, Trump continues to dominate his party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.",5.722700913265427,4.702046761694184,1.020654151571243,12

For this year, anyway. The annual contest was set to take place in Turin, Italy, from May 10-14. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organization that puts on the event, announced Friday that no Russian act will be participating this year. “The decision reflects concern that, in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this year’s Contest would bring the competition into disrepute,” the statement read. The EBU said it remains “dedicated to protecting the values of a cultural competition which promotes international exchange and understanding, brings audiences together, celebrates diversity through music and unites Europe on one stage.” Russia’s entry last year, Manizha, came in 9th with “Russian Women.” Many Russians objected to her appearance because of her support for women’s rights and the LGBT community. Ukraine is still participating and will be represented by a rap group called Kalush Orchestra. Although the EBU describes itself as an apolitical member organization of broadcasters committed to upholding the values of public service, Eurovision has gotten political at times.

Now, the former star of last decade’s “90210” reboot is explaining why she chose to step into a serious geopolitical conflict with a message that if she had been his mother, he would have been loved so much he’d never think of invading sovereign nations like Ukraine. The 34-year-old McCord told BuzzFeed that she herself could have become a tyrant if she’d had different life experiences. “I know how I could easily have moved in the direction of becoming a dictator myself,” McCord said. “If certain circumstances of my life were different, were I a little less bent toward healing and more toward vindication, I could have been a darkly powerful person.” In the now-viral 2-minute, 20-second video, McCord explains in partial rhyme that if Putin had been her child, “The world would have been warm / So much laughter and joy / And nothing would harm.” She told BuzzFeed she was inspired to record the Putin poem after waking up “in anguish” over “the children of the war.” McCord said she sympathizes with “children who grow into adults and become people who do historically horrifying things” because she personally understands “early life trauma.” Though the video was directed at Putin, McCord told BuzzFeed that her mission is raising awareness about the changes needed within “education systems” to “protect children and stop creating dictators and abusers and enslavers and rapists and bullies.” BuzzFeed also revealed that McCord recorded a longer version of the video that she has only released on Vimeo, where she implores Putin to consider how a war could lead to more motherless children who grow up to be “cruel.” You can see that version of the video below:",4.730699614258367,4.682765369252527,0.047934245005840204,28

Republicans have turned Vladimir Putin’s invasion into a political opportunity for the party, claiming that Biden’s weakness is the reason Putin went forward with his war. Some GOP candidates have even started fundraising off the Russian invasion. Erik Aadland, running for Congress in Colorado’s 7th District, quickly sent an email Wednesday night saying Putin was “walking all over Joe Biden just like China and Iran” and asking supporters to donate to his campaign to take the House back from Democrats. Virginia state Sen. Bryce Reeves, also running for Congress, sent a similar email saying Putin invaded because America’s enemies “know that Joe Biden is weak and depends on the support of the Woke Democrats for his political survival.” “Joe Biden’s weakness has helped bring the world to this point,” added Florida congressional candidate Brian Mast in his own fundraising pitch. But as Faith Hillis, a professor of Russian history at the University of Chicago said, “What matters is that Putin denies a sovereign state’s right to exist and to make its own domestic and foreign policy. And he invaded completely unprovoked (and even without the staged provocation that many expected). This is akin to Hitler’s invasion of Poland. That’s it.” Here are some of the GOP’s excuses for Putin’s deadly, provoked land grab: Leading the way, not surprisingly, has been former President Donald Trump, who is a longtime admirer of the Russian president and his grip on the country. Trump has said Putin’s invasion was “pretty smart” and “savvy,” even claiming that the Russian leader was going into Ukraine to be a “peacekeeper.” And of course, Trump hasn’t been able to resist the opportunity to tout his big lie that Democrats stole the presidential election from him through fraud. In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday night, Trump claimed that this whole situation in Ukraine is happening because of the 2020 outcome. “He sees the weakness and stupidity of this administration,” Trump said of the Russian president. “As an American, I am angry and saddened. It happened because of a rigged election.” These three things don’t really seem related, but for Republicans, they all go together into one big reason why Putin invaded Ukraine. “Putin is a thug, and he has been empowered and emboldened by Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and his approval of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline while killing America’s Keystone XL pipeline,” Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) tweeted Thursday. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) also argued that Putin “knew that during President Trump, he could not do this.” “They watched what happened in Afghanistan. They watched the debacle that took place there. ... They have watched Joe Biden as he’s made decisions like stopping the Keystone, ending drilling on federal land. Things that really hindered the U.S. and caused this inflation,” Blackburn said Thursday on Newsmax TV. Biden has not ended drilling on federal land. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) tweeted Wednesday that Biden’s “pathetic energy policies” are “essentially funding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by forcing Europe to rely on them for their energy needs.” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) ― the former football coach who didn’t know why the United States fought World War II ― told 1819 News this week that Putin was invading Ukraine simply to get more farmland. “He can’t feed his people,” Tuberville said. “It’s a communist country, so he can’t feed his people, so they need more farmland.” It’s hard to debunk something that’s just so off the mark, but there is absolutely no truth to this being the cause of the invasion. Russia has also not been “a communist country” for 30 years.",4.646954049687584,5.266230109073997,-0.6192760593864133,24

Speaking at the U.N. Headquarters in New York on Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a country of 44 million, could “create a new refugee crisis, one of the largest facing the world today,” displacing up to 5 million people. “Russia’s actions could cause a spike in food prices and lead to even more desperate hunger in places like Libya, Yemen and Lebanon,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “The tidal waves of suffering this war will cause are unthinkable.” U.N. Human Rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani gave an account of the human toll of the attack on Friday, saying there have been at least 127 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 25 people killed and 102 wounded as a result of “shelling and air strikes.” Shamdasani noted that this could be an underestimate. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said the agency is monitoring reports of people fleeing their homes. He emphasized that civilian lives must be protected in accordance with international law. “The humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating,” Grandi said in a statement Thursday. “There are no winners in war, but countless lives will be torn apart.” Romanian Interior Minister Lucian Bode said more than 10,000 Ukrainians have sought refuge in Romania over the past 24 hours, according to Reuters. Speaking to Euronews from Poland, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said Thursday that the European Union is “well prepared” in the event of a massive influx of Ukrainian refugees. “Poland is, of course, a key country here,” Johansson said. “I’m quite convinced about that contingency plans that they have. And I must say, of course, nobody knows exactly if this will be enough or not. But I think that they [Poland] are quite well prepared and this is good.” CNN’s Scott McLean reported Friday that 29,000 Ukrainians have entered Poland since Russia’s invasion began. According to a BBC report, at least 1,000 Ukrainians arrived overnight by train in the Polish city of Przemysl alone. U.S. troops in Poland have been tasked with helping the country open up three refugee processing centers near the Poland-Ukraine border, according to The New York Times. Nearly 6,000 U.S. soldiers arrived in Poland this month. “We have been preparing for several weeks for a wave of refugees that might occur,” Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski told the Times. “We will do everything to provide safe shelter in Poland for everyone who needs it.” This is not the first time Europe has had to coordinate a response to refugees. In 2015, more than 1 million people sought asylum in the EU, Norway and Switzerland, with fully half of those asylum claims arising from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, according to a Pew Research report. The massive influx of migrants in 2015 contributed to political tensions across the bloc in the subsequent years, with far-right political parties gaining prominence across Europe, in part by stoking xenophobia and using anti-immigrant rhetoric. Meanwhile, charities in the U.K. have called on their government to lead the international effort to support displaced populations from Ukraine. World leaders have spoken out in stark terms against Russia, vowing that Russian President Vladimir Putin will pay a price for his actions, as CNN reported that U.S. intelligence chiefs are “concerned Kyiv could fall to Russia within days.” On Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden announced further measures targeting Russia’s currency and banks. “Putin is the aggressor,” Biden said. “Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.”",3.908904361149947,3.298776279400309,0.6101280817496382,3

A group of Ukrainian border guards were stationed on Snake Island, in the Black Sea south of Odessa, when a Russian warship ordered them to surrender under threat of attack. Their response: ""Russian warship, go fuck yourself.""They held their ground. All 13 were killed.  Zelenskyy said in an address that the guards had attempted to protect the island, resisting demands from Russian forces to lay down their arms. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, posted audio to Facebook in which Russian forces can be heard telling the soldiers to surrender and “avoid bloodshed,” according to a translation by The Washington Post. The garrison refused, with one soldier saying, “Russian warship, go fuck yourself,” and were all killed in an artillery strike. Zelenskyy said the 13 soldiers would be honored posthumously with the Hero of Ukraine award. Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years. As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history. 🇷🇺 has embarked on a path of evil, but 🇺🇦 is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks. Snake Island, also known as Zmiinyi Island, is about 30 miles off the coast of Ukraine and is less than 42 acres. The Post noted that the island marks the edge of Ukraine’s territorial waters and serves as a strategic post in the Black Sea. Zelenskyy said at least 137 people have been killed in Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s invasion and hundreds had been wounded. That tally was expected to climb as Russian forces closed in on the capital, Kyiv, and Zelenskyy said in his address that “the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.”",4.411502938409756,4.188552971011592,0.22294996739816408,22

He warned in a subsequent message that the fighting could soon become severe, with Russian troops attacking the city in a “vile, cruel and inhuman” manner. “We have to persevere tonight. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now. The night will be hard, very hard, but there will be a morning,” Zelenskyy said, according to a translation by Financial Times reporter Max Seddon. Zelensky warns Russia will storm Kyiv tonight in “vile, cruel and inhuman” fashion.“We have to persevere tonight. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now. The night will be hard, very hard, but there will be a morning,  Russian troops are believed to be hunting for the Ukrainian leader, who has been in hiding since troops converged on Kyiv. Zelenskyy said Thursday that he is “target No. 1” for the Russians, but has declined offers from the United States to help evacuate him to safety. In the social media video, apparently filmed on a city block lit by streetlights, Zelenskyy said his party’s leader and the country’s prime minister numbered among the four men surrounding him. “Our troops are here, citizens are here,” he said, according to a translation by The Telegraph. “All of us are here protecting the independence of our country, and it will continue to be this way.” Thursday evening, Zelenskyy reportedly told European Union leaders on a conference call, “This might be the last time you see me alive.” He has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a special task force to find and likely kill him and his family members, along with other top government officials. A U.S. State Department spokesperson concurred, telling CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer on Friday that Zelenskyy “does, in many ways, represent ― even personify ― the democratic aspirations and ambitions of Ukraine, of the Ukrainian people.” He would therefore be “a prime target for Russian aggression,” the spokesperson said. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told The Washington Post that American officials have been advising Zelenskyy on the evolving security threat against him for weeks. “We stand ready to assist him in any way,” Schiff said, adding, “I’m deeply concerned with the threat to his life and well being.” Russia’s slow-burning encroachment on Ukraine’s eastern border escalated into a full-scale invasion this week, with more than 100,000 troops attacking by land, air and sea. Bombings have been reported in cities all across the country. U.S. officials are reportedly worried that Kyiv could fall into Russian hands within days. President Joe Biden managed to speak with Zelenskyy from his hideout on Friday, directly following a meeting between NATO leaders, the White House confirmed. The American leader commended “the brave actions of the Ukrainian people” fighting to defend their country and pledged “economic, humanitarian and security support” from the United States.",3.0870626758152073,3.250705395532515,-0.16364271971730782,3

Anti-war demonstrations broke out in major cities across the country, including Moscow, where videos show a significant security force deployed to quell dissent, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hometown of St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Yekaterinburg. The Kremlin took aggressive action to stifle the protests. Videos shared on social media show police officers almost immediately arresting anyone participating. Some 1,745 people in 54 Russian cities were detained Thursday, at least 957 of them in Moscow, according to The Associated Press. “I know that right now many of you feel desperation, helplessness, shame over Vladimir Putin’s attack on the friendly nation of Ukraine. But I urge you not to despair,” human rights activist Marina Litvinovich said in a video statement on Facebook, calling for mass protests Thursday evening. “We, the Russian people, are against the war Putin has unleashed. We don’t support this war, it is being waged not on our behalf.” Russian police detained Litvinovich soon after as she left her Moscow apartment. “I am embarrassed for my country. To be honest with you, I am speechless. War is always scary. We don’t want this,” Nikita Golubev, a 30-year-old teacher, told The Guardian in Moscow. “Why are we doing this?” Russians who participate in “unsanctioned protests” such as these do so at significant personal risk, including jail time and substantial fines. The Telegraph’s Russia correspondent Nataliya Vasilyeva said protesters have been taken away “indiscriminately” and that she was briefly detained despite repeatedly saying she was a journalist. The vibe in Moscow   Pushkin Square, maybe less than 1000 meters from Red Square and the Kremlin, is the cite of a significant protest. These people know the risks of challenging the regime. They’re on the street in-spite of major personal costs.  Leaving Pushkin, we saw small groups of protesters around downtown Moscow, some briefly chanting ""no to war"" before police find them. 523+ arrested. But probably not more than a few thousand came out in a city of 15 million. There's no speech without fear now. (Vid @AvtozakLIVE)  Scattered groups of protesters. Several hundred now.

The Weeknd was by no means the only celebrity to publish social media posts that came off as insensitive or oblivious to the invasion as news about it was unfolding.

Their complaints have targeted Biden’s energy policies ― accusing his administration of making the U.S. more reliant on foreign oil and gas ― as well as the first wave of U.S. sanctions on Russia and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. There have also been vague gripes about Biden’s “weakness” on the world stage. As Russian tank columns and helicopters streamed deep into Ukraine on Thursday, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) issued a statement pledging U.S. support for the Ukrainian people “in the face of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin’s barbaric aggression.” Scalise, the House minority whip, then pivoted to bashing Biden, claiming the president “wasted too much time appeasing Putin while shutting down energy exploration and production here in America.” The thrust of the complaint appeared to involve Biden’s decision to cancel construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) piled on, claiming that Biden’s “weakness helped lead to this crisis.” “President Biden said he could go ‘toe to toe’ with Putin but instead he has chosen to play footsie,” Mace said in a statement. “Biden slow-walked lethal aid to Ukraine, waived sanctions on Nord Stream 2, and chose toothless sanctions against a few rich Russians.” Pray for the people of Ukraine; their country is under attack.Pray for the United States; we have no leader in the White House. Republicans in the Senate also took aim at Biden’s handling of the situation. Speaking in Kentucky on Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell argued, as he has before, that Putin would not have moved on Ukraine had Biden left U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), meanwhile, called Putin a “tyrant” who needed to be confronted, then criticized Biden’s words as “ineffective, too late, and too passive for the current situation.” The idea that “politics stops at the water’s edge” hasn’t really held true in recent decades, with partisans often taking shots at presidents of the opposing party during instances of military conflict abroad. While some GOP voices have stressed the need to project unity in the face of a mobilization of troops not seen in Europe since World War II, others have eagerly mocked Biden and even praised Putin as “smart” and his moves against Ukraine as “genius,” as former President Donald Trump said this week. This is what weakness on the world stage looks like.  Although Republicans say Biden should have imposed harsher sanctions on Putin sooner ― a step they argue could have discouraged Putin from invading Ukraine ― they agree with Biden’s position that U.S. troops should not be put in harm’s way in Ukraine to help defend the country from Russian aggression. Some GOP lawmakers did refrain from directly attacking Biden in their responses to the Ukraine situation on Thursday. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), the top Republican in the lower chamber, notably issued a forceful statement condemning Putin’s invasion as “reckless and evil.” Unlike most of his colleagues, McCarthy kept the president out of it (although in an earlier statement this week, he did accuse Biden of contributing to the “appeasement” of Russia). “The United States stands with the people of Ukraine and prays for their safety and resolve,” McCarthy said in his Thursday statement. “Putin’s actions must be met with serious consequence. This act of war is intended to rewrite history and more concerning, upend the balance of power in Europe. Putin must be held accountable for his actions.” Biden on Thursday announced a severe round of further sanctions against Putin and his allies, as well as additional U.S. troop deployments in Eastern Europe to bolster NATO countries in the region. After speaking with leaders of the other so-called G7 nations, Biden tweeted Thursday that he and the other heads of state had “agreed to move forward on devastating packages of sanctions and other economic measures to hold Russia to account.” “We stand with the brave people of Ukraine,” Biden wrote.",3.971292929487165,3.1404309931446464,0.8308619363425187,24

CNN anchor Jake Tapper interviewed John F. Kelly on Thursday and asked the retired Marine general his opinion of comments by Trump and other Republicans that seem to support Putin’s decision to invade the neighboring nation. Trump himself said Wednesday night that invading Ukraine was “pretty smart” of Putin. Kelly has criticized his former boss’s ethics before, and Tapper asked him how he feels now about prominent Republicans praising Putin and even calling the Russian leader a “genius.” “What’s your response when you hear that?” Tapper asked Kelly. “Disbelief,” Kelly said, as shown in the video below. Putin is a tyrant, he added. “He’s a murderer. He has attacked an innocent country whose only crime is that they want to be free and democratic, and they’re working in that direction and have been working in that direction.” Kelly pointed out that Ukraine has been a good partner to the West in the last three decades. “They have been a cooperative country,” he said. “They gave up, on our word, the nuclear weapons that the old Soviet Union left behind. They participated with other U.S./NATO allies. They participated in operations — peacekeeping operations in Africa and Afghanistan, places like that. They were part of the partnership for peace. Although not members of NATO, they worked alongside NATO in these various good operations.” Kelly had a hard time praising Putin’s intellect under the circumstances. “You know, is Putin smart? Yes. Tyrants are smart. They know what they’re doing,” Kelly said. “But that’s — I can’t imagine why someone would look at what’s happening there and see it as anything other than a criminal act. I don’t get it, Jake.”",3.765615679287707,3.8092806063180906,-0.043664927030383716,24

A very silly commercial by the popular restaurant chain aired alongside CNN’s bleak coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, which created a cutaway so jarring that a clip of the moment has now gone viral. WW3 sponsored by Applebees. We’re living in an episode of South Park.  Applebee’s has told several news outlets that it is “disappointed” the network transitioned from footage of air raid sirens blasting throughout Kyiv to their lighthearted ad featuring frothy beer and a man in a cowboy hat shaking his butt to Zac Brown Band’s “Chicken Fried.” “We are deeply concerned about the situation in Ukraine,” Applebee’s said in its statement. “When we were made aware that our ad was placed in this manner, we immediately reached out to CNN to pause our advertising on their network. It never should have aired, and we are disappointed in the actions of the network.” HuffPost reached out to CNN for comment but did receive an immediate response. What made the moment even more inappropriate and yet unintentionally amusing was that the entire time the ad played it was on a split screen with the Ukraine footage in a small box on the left with a headline reading, “Russia Invades Ukraine.” This split-screen setup, in which content and a commercial are playing simultaneously, is called a “squeezeback” ad. A spokesperson for WarnerMedia, which owns CNN, told HuffPost via email that “squeezeback advertisements have been removed from the coverage.” Folks on Twitter couldn’t help but poke fun at the hiccup.  applebees execs right now  Applebees couldn’t get a Super Bowl commercial, so they took the WW3 CNN slot.

Instead, they wanted to talk about the U.S.-Mexico border. “We are in the process of getting money from the legislature so that if Biden is dropping illegal aliens into Florida from the southern border, I’m rerouting them to Delaware,” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom many see as a likely GOP candidate for president in 2024. DeSantis, Thursday’s headliner, didn’t mention Ukraine once during his 20-minute speech, which took place in a huge convention hall as President Joe Biden addressed the nation on sanctions to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin. But DeSantis talked plenty about “woke” culture and critical race theory, all red meat tossed out liberally to a hungry GOP base. He also complained that Biden “hates” Florida, a state he said represents freedom from coronavirus mandates. “He is always criticizing us, always trying to take potshots at Florida. ... He doesn’t like Florida and he doesn’t like me because we stand up to him,” said DeSantis, who didn’t address his 2024 plans at the convention. When Ukraine did come up, it was usually in comparison to undocumented immigration at the southern U.S. border, where former President Donald Trump directed national resources to building a fence. The focus on the border, even in the face of a more immediate and deadly crisis, shows that Republicans plan to make it an issue in the midterm elections. Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and radio host, told the audience that insecurity at the southern border is a bigger threat to the U.S. than Russian aggression in Europe. “The southern border is a lot more important than the Ukraine border,” Kirk said, calling Russia’s assault on Ukraine, the most violence that Europe has seen in decades, “a dispute 5,000 miles away in cities we can’t pronounce and places we can’t find on a map.” Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, speaking on a panel about the “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border, said Biden hasn’t been effective on either that issue or Ukraine. “Everybody is focused on the invasion of Ukraine, as they should be. That’s critical,” he said. “But as little as the administration has done to deter the invasion in Ukraine, they’ve done even less to deter the invasion of the southern border.” Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, was one of the only major officeholders to address the crisis — and it was just for a quick moment. “Their foreign policy is a war zone,” Blackburn said, referring to Democrats. “Oh, how we pray for Ukraine and the people of Ukraine.” While Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sidestepped Ukraine altogether, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) blasted Biden on the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and blamed the president for projecting weakness on Russia. “Now you look at what’s happening in Ukraine. Talk about the weakness of Joe Biden,” Hawley said. “He comes to office and what does he do? He shuts down American energy production and greenlights Russian energy production. ... Is it any wonder that Vladimir Putin feels emboldened to do whatever the heck it is he wants to do?” Other Republicans in Congress have piled on Biden for supposedly setting the stage for Russia’s actions with his domestic energy measures and his purported “weakness” on the world stage. On Thursday, Biden called Putin “the aggressor” in the war and pledged measures to punish Russia economically. The invasion of Ukraine killed at least 137 people in its first day. Russian forces also captured Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. Trump, who’s speaking at CPAC on Saturday, blamed Putin’s attack on supposed U.S. election fraud in 2020 — one falsehood on top of another. He also praised Putin as “smart” and a “genius” in comments this week. “He sees the weakness and stupidity of this administration,” Trump said of Putin on Fox News Wednesday. “It happened because of a rigged election.” The conference did dedicate a panel Thursday to foreign policy. It featured K.T. McFarland, who served as deputy national security adviser in the early months of the Trump administration. McFarland said she was skeptical that Biden’s Russia sanctions weren’t just a “slap on the wrist” and that he is doing enough to advance U.S. oil and gas interests. “Forty-eight hours from now will determine what happens in Ukraine,” McFarland said.

Posting from Kyiv, the “Dancing With The Stars” performer suggested he probably should have left the city “a while ago” but had not expected the war. “Everyone was hoping that the finality of the situation would be averted,” he said, as an ambulance siren was heard in the street below him. “That there was not going to be this kind of aggression.” “I’m uneasy, I’m very scared,” he added. The professional dancer has been in Ukraine working on a reality series, “World of Dance UA,” his representative told CNN. He was born in the Ukrainian city of Odesa and immigrated to the United States in 1994. A post shared by Maksim Chmerkovskiy (@maksimc) In a second clip, he showed an ambulance and a military truck speeding down a city street within his view. “I want to go back home,” he told followers, choking up. “I realize that I have the way to, I have a different passport and my family is far away. What I’m realizing is that my friends whose kids are here ... they can’t just escape.” He said he was about to go to a bomb shelter. Residents of the city have flocked to underground subway stations as well as basements and purpose-built bunkers to shelter as the city faced what Ukrainian officials said were missile and airstrikes. Chmerkovskiy’s wife, Australian dancer Peta Murgatroyd, asked her social media followers to pray for her husband. “Please pray that he comes home soon,” she said. “Please pray that he has a swift, safe exit.” “Please pray for Ukraine and the innocent civilians who’s lives are being greatly uprooted,” she added. “I grew to love this country the couple of times I visited and they’re in an unfathomable situation.” The two live in Los Angeles with their 5-year-old son, Shai.

Tulsi Gabbard wrote late Wednesday night, as Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor began. “Which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia’s border.” “She fits in perfectly with where this truth-denying, democracy-hating, authoritarian-embracing cult is today,” said Joe Walsh, a former GOP congressman from Illinois. “I know for certain that Reagan himself wouldn’t attend and wouldn’t at all be happy.” Gabbard’s appearance during what was once a coveted speaking slot for ambitious Republicans is just one example of the new Putin-friendly stance of modern conservatism on display at the four-day Conservative Political Action Conference. Another featured speaker is Nigel Farage, a champion of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union ― which Putin also supported in his long effort to weaken Western Europe. Farage, who is to speak Friday afternoon, also blamed the U.S. and Western Europe for the invasion, calling it “a consequence of EU and NATO expansion, which came to a head in 2014” in a Thursday tweet. “It made no sense to poke the Russian bear with a stick,” he added. Yet the most powerful pro-Putin voice at CPAC will again be that of former President Donald Trump, who after years of admiring Putin from afar spent four years in the White House advancing Putin’s most important goals: weakening NATO and the EU. Trump ― who in 2007 wrote Putin a letter telling him, “I am a big fan of yours!” ― mused about withdrawing from the defense treaty alliance created by the U.S. following World War II. He frequently lied about how the group functions, claiming, falsely, that other nations “owed” the U.S. years of missed dues. He also attacked the EU, claiming, also falsely, that the free-trade bloc had somehow cheated the U.S. During his years in office, Trump also repeatedly took Putin’s side over his own intelligence agencies’ regarding Putin’s work to get Trump elected in 2016, including at a post-summit news conference in Helsinki in 2018. A year later, Trump actually defended Putin’s invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014 because Russia had subsequently built a base for its “large and powerful submarines” there. Trump’s praise for Putin continued even after he began moving troops into Ukraine this week. On Tuesday, after Russian forces had crossed into the Donbas region, Trump called Putin a “genius” for annexing an entire country for “$2 worth of sanctions.” As has been the case since Trump began his 2016 presidential campaign, however, his supporters continued to defend him, making excuses for his statements or claiming they meant something else entirely. “Trump was able to keep Putin in line,” said Linda Memmesheimer, a 68-year-old natural health activist from the Chicago suburbs who is attending the conference. Gary Adkins, a GOP candidate for Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, blamed Democratic President Joe Biden for the invasion, claiming that Putin and China’s Xi Jinping likely agreed to take advantage of Biden when they met earlier this month. “They sensed the weakness that was exuding from the White House,” he told HuffPost. As to Trump’s many pro-Putin statements: “Trump has his own way of putting things.” Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee also blamed Biden during her remarks on the conference’s opening day. “Their foreign policy is now a war zone,” she said. “Oh, how we pray for the people of Ukraine.” Many of the speakers, though, took a different approach: ignoring the invasion entirely, even as it dominated news coverage. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, while boasting of his anti-mask, anti-vaccine mandate policies and bashing “woke” culture, critical race theory and other favorite boogeymen of the right, mentioned neither Ukraine nor Russia once in his 20-minute speech. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, while praising the Canadian truckers protesting vaccine mandates, podcaster Joe Rogan and cryptocurrency, similarly failed to bring up Putin’s invasion during his 18 minutes onstage. Mark Robinson, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina, extolled gun rights and told the audience: “I bet there’s lots of people around the world who wish they had a Second Amendment in their constitution.” He was, however, not talking about Ukraine, but Australia and Canada, because of their strict COVID-19 control measures. Trump, despite losing the 2020 election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol ― his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― killed five, including one police officer, injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides. Despite this, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.

It begins with McCord saying, “Dear President Vladimir Putin,” while subtitles in English (not Russian) appear below.

I regret to inform you the celebrities are at it again. what the fuck is this?90210- come get your girl!! there's no fucking break from this world at all Boy this really nails the zeitgeist, and that's pretty terrifying. The new Anthropologie ad campaign is really something So far, there is no word if Putin has seen McCord’s video, but one person predicted his reaction to it. IF (and that's a big if) Putin sees this, he's probably laughing his ass off. And, yes, many people couldn’t help but be reminded of another celebrity gaffe: Gal Gadot’s “Imagine” video from the beginning of the pandemic. This is up there with when they all sang Imagine during the start of lockdown Did y'all learn NOTHING from Gal Gadot's ""Imagine"" disaster?!?!? we did it boys, we waited and we got our new ""imagine"" courtesy of a star of the CW's 90210 reboot",2.8173530466524888,4.589594887494717,-1.772241840842228,29
2022-02-24,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/russia-ukraine-energy_n_6217c852e4b0d1388f117979,"Russia May Be A ‘Big Gas Station,’ But It’s Also A Key Supplier For Clean Energy","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could delay the global shift away from fossil fuels, analysts said Thursday, a perhaps counterintuitive impact of what’s likely to be the largest land war in Europe since World War II. The price of crude oil surged to $105 on Thursday for the first time in years, a reflection of Russia’s vast oil and gas exports that are also the source of its modern economic might. Earlier this week, Harvard economist Jason Furman, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, dismissed Russia to The New York Times as “basically a big gas station,” saying the country was “incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas.” Bill McKibben, founder of the environmental group 350.org, said in a tweet on Tuesday that “Russia can only afford to fight because of its oil and gas… so it might be wise to stop using oil and gas now.” But analysts say even if the world magically moved away from fossil fuels, Russia would still remain a big player in the global energy supply chain. That’s because, as E&E News mining reporter Jael Holzman first noted, Russia is a major source of key metals that batteries and clean electricity depend on, such as nickel and aluminum, as well as a top exporter of nuclear reactor technology. “Initially, this could slow the energy transition,” said Julian Kettle, an analyst and senior vice president at the British energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “We can’t pull metal out of the ground fast enough” to produce the renewables needed to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, he added. Russia produces roughly 7% of the world’s mined nickel. However, it generates 20% of the global supply of Class 1 nickel, the grade of the metal most commonly used in lithium-ion batteries to increase how much energy they hold and how long they stay charged. When nickel prices rose about 21% last year, Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of the electric auto and battery giant Tesla, called nickel supplies “our biggest concern for scaling” battery production. While electric vehicle sales spiked by more than 80% last year, a “minuscule” number of those cars were powered by no-nickel batteries. On Thursday, the price of nickel climbed to more than $25,000 per ton, the highest it’s been since 2011. “Any sanction leading to an export ban would likely have further impact on the nickel price, which is already at decadelong highs,” said Caspar Rawles, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a London-based research firm that specializes in lithium-ion batteries. Even after the West sanctioned key Russian industries following the invasion of Crimea in 2014, metal producers largely avoided such penalties. There was one notable exception: the aluminum maker Rusal, which the United States sanctioned in 2018 in a bid to punish its billionaire founder, Oleg Deripaska, in connection with Crimea and various other fights with Russia. The sanctions, which were lifted in 2019 when Deripaska relinquished control of the firm, sent the price of aluminum up 35% in a matter of days, according to Reuters. Today Russia supplies around 6% of the world’s aluminum, the price of which shot up to a record high of $3,450 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Thursday. Far more than just the main source of the kitchen foil mainstay, aluminum is so key to building solar panels that a January study in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Sustainability found that solar energy, at its current rate of growth, could eat up half the world’s supply of the metal by 2050. It’s also used to make the high-voltage power lines needed to carry solar and wind energy from where it’s available to where it’s needed. One problem with aluminum is that it normally requires large amounts of fossil fuels to smelt. But even there Russia has an advantage as companies like the Anglo-Russian En+ Group, which has ties to Rusal, build low-carbon smelters in Siberia that use hydropower made increasingly abundant through melting ice. And sanctions, particularly for metals, are not necessarily effective because Russia could redirect its sales to China, which is importing metals to fund its energy transition and could process the raw materials and sell them to buyers in the very countries in the West seeking to limit Russia’s access to markets as punishment for the invasion of Ukraine. Even nuclear energy — the zero-carbon electricity source that skeptics of renewable energy favor — is a key asset for Russia. The nation’s state-owned nuclear company Rosatom became the world’s leading supplier of reactors in 2017, cutting deals to build new plants in countries such as Bangladesh, China and Egypt. ​​ Russia also produces about 2% of the world’s cobalt, the metal used in various battery chemistries, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and Russian mercenaries have played a notable role in developing mining supply chains in sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the world’s supply comes from. China still enjoys a near-monopoly on the production of rare earth minerals, a group of 17 metals with unique magnetic properties that make them crucial for making batteries and other electronics. But Russia boasts the fourth-largest known reserves of these minerals. In August 2020, the country announced plans to invest $1.5 billion into boosting the production of rare earth minerals, with an aim of becoming the No. 2 supplier after China by the end of this decade. The Biden administration is seeking to counter its geopolitical rivals’ dominance in the clean energy supply chain. China’s control over flows of lithium and rare earths in particular has become a sticking point that pro-fossil fuel opponents of decarbonization policy have used to argue that reducing use of oil, gas and coal poses risks to the United States’ national security. On Tuesday, the White House announced plans to invest $35 million in the United States’ lone rare earths producer, the California-based miner MP Materials, as part of a plan to increase domestic output of metals needed for decarbonization. “China controls most of the global market in these minerals,” President Joe Biden said in a speech Tuesday. “We can’t build a future that’s made in America if we ourselves are dependent on China for the materials that power the products of today and tomorrow.” The same could be said of Russia, if to a lesser degree.",5.19823585314855,3.5220431339130243,1.6761927192355262,14

Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the most influential voice on the network, suggested Tuesday that maybe Putin isn’t actually as bad a guy as the West makes him out to be. Carlson claimed President Joe Biden is actually the aggressor, and that he’s secretly setting up a conflict with Russia to “make a play against fossil fuels.” Tucker: It may be worth asking yourself… why do I hate Putin.. Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?  Right-wing author and commentator Candace Owens, another Trump acolyte, agreed, tweeting: “WE are at fault.” She urged her followers to read Putin’s remarks from earlier this week, in which he painted a distorted picture of Western aggression. Some observers saw the speech as an effort to sell a further invasion of Ukraine to the Russian public. Meanwhile, Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and radio host, dismissed the crisis as a “family dispute between two countries.” “Who cares?” Kirk asked on his show. It’s not just media figures downplaying the Ukraine crisis. Ohio GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance has argued the U.S. border with Mexico is more important to voters, drawing attacks from Jane Timken, another candidate in the race who has strongly condemned Putin’s aggression. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is widely thought to be preparing a run for president in 2024, heaped praise on Putin as “very shrewd,” adding that he has “enormous respect” for the Russian leader. Not to be outdone, Trump himself appeared in awe of Putin during an interview on Tuesday, calling his deployment of troops into Ukraine “genius.” “I said, ‘How smart is that?’ And he’s going to go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s the strongest peace force,” Trump said. Trump and his allies complimenting Putin is nothing new, of course. Throughout his four years in office, the former president repeatedly praised Putin and other autocrats across the world for being “tough,” unlike leaders in America. Establishment voices within the GOP ― what’s left of them, anyway ― are responding to the situation in Ukraine very differently. Republican senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.), are urging Biden to go even further by imposing harsher sanctions directly on Putin and his allies, and faulting the president for not doing so earlier. “President Biden is the president of the United States, and to the extent that I can help him push back against Putin and bring stability to the world, I will gladly do so,” Graham said Tuesday in South Carolina. “I will not be part of an appeasement movement that will lead to further conflict,” he said, in an apparent reference to Republicans who have declined to oppose Putin. But with the GOP’s response to Ukraine fractured, and Trump unwilling to condemn Putin directly, widespread Republican support for tougher U.S. measures in response to Russian aggression may prove hard to find. “This is the Republican mainstream,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) tweeted on Wednesday, referring to GOP candidates downplaying Putin’s sending of troops into Ukraine. “People like Graham and McConnell are the outliers.”",3.068257941091432,3.211115044893226,-0.14285710380179406,24

Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine,” Blinken told NBC’s Lester Holt. “I can’t put a date or an exact time on it, but everything is in place for Russia to move forward.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the Russia-Ukraine crisis: “Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine,” he tells @LesterHoltNBC.  His comments were undergirded Wednesday by Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, who said Russia was “ready to go” and could “attack at any time … with a significant military force.” Blinken said the Biden administration was still prepared to turn toward diplomacy, but warned that the U.S. — alongside its European allies — was prepared to hit Russia with even more sanctions and make the nation pay for its decision for a “long, long time.” “I think there’s still an opportunity to avert a major aggression. Yesterday, when they began this invasion of Ukraine, we hit them hard, not just us, but in unison with Europe, going against major financial institutions, taking out a major project, the so-called Nord Stream 2,” Blinken said. “We’ve said very clearly that if Russia continues to escalate, so will we.” He added: “At the end of the day, if that doesn’t’ stop President Putin, we’ve made very clear … that there will be massive consequence going forward, a price that Russia will have to pay for a long, long time.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a direct appeal to Russia on Thursday morning in Kyiv, saying his nation wanted peace and was “doing everything it can to build it.” “Neighbors always enrich each other culturally,” Zelenskyy said in a televised address. “However, that doesn’t make them a single whole. It doesn’t dissolve us into you. We are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies.

I’d say that’s pretty smart,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, according to New York Times reporter Shane Goldmacher and video footage obtained by the pro-Democratic group American Bridge. “He’s taking over a country, really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people, just walking right in.” The former U.S. commander in chief added, “This would have never happened, ever in a million years,” and said he understands Putin, seemingly suggesting that President Joe Biden is mismanaging the situation in Ukraine, where Putin has decided to support Russian-backed separatists’ bid to break up the country and has dispatched Russian troops. Biden this week imposed sanctions on Russian institutions and officials and warned far tougher action could follow. “Now they laugh at us,” Trump said of U.S. adversaries, according to Goldmacher. When Trump was president, he suspended military aid to Ukraine ― despite the Ukrainian government’s ongoing fight against the separatists ― to force the country to seek incriminating information about Biden’s son Hunter. He also told fellow world leaders that he recognized Russia’s claim to the Ukrainian region of Crimea, which Putin invaded in 2014 in a move that most countries view as a violation of international law, according to a BuzzFeed News report. And Trump repeatedly rejected U.S. intelligence reports that said Russia aided in his 2016 election victory, saying he believed Putin’s denial of any such plan. Trump and many of his right-wing allies have repeatedly praised Moscow in recent days, blaming the Biden administration for the uptick in tensions in Europe. “He’s taking over a country, really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people, just walking right in.” Most national security experts instead identify the roots of the crisis in Putin’s decision late last year to begin amassing his troops along Ukraine’s border ― a policy that has now led to the buildup of more than 150,000 Russian forces. On Tuesday, Trump called the Russian strategy “genius” and described the deployment as “the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen,” referring to Putin’s claim that he is sending Russian soldiers in to maintain peace in Ukrainian areas that are controlled by pro-Russia rebels. While most powerful GOP lawmakers have pushed the party’s traditional hawkish line in responding to the Ukraine-Russia flare-up, conservatives have struggled to craft a coherent narrative on the issue because of the growing strength of pro-Russia sentiments within the Republican movement. Amid the stateside debate, dozens of foreign policy analysts spent Wednesday night tracking Russian troop movements toward Ukraine, and Ukrainian commentators said they were too nervous to sleep as they faced the threat of an all-out conflict over their country’s independence. “We believed, we had a dream, we lived for it,” tweeted Kyiv Independent reporter Illia Ponomarenko. “If the world closes its eyes on yet another grand act of aggression for the sake of false stability, it will be a warm welcome for an even greater war. Very soon.” Once Putin confirmed that a military operation was beginning in Ukraine, Trump made further comments on Fox News that deflected blame from the Russian leader. The fighting “all happened because of a rigged election,” Trump said, again promoting the lie that Biden did not legitimately win the presidency. Putin “sees the weakness and the incompetency and the stupidity of this administration,” he continued, before Fox News host Laura Ingraham cut away from her call with Trump to broadcast an urgent United Nations session on the Ukraine crisis.",3.010957093140989,2.823057638264302,0.18789945487668724,24

The president said the sanctions would hit two major Russian banks and make it harder for Moscow to raise money by selling its sovereign debt. Meanwhile, the U.S. will send U.S. soldiers from elsewhere in Europe to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union but have since become democracies and U.S. allies as part of the NATO military alliance. “We have no intention of fighting Russia,” Biden said. “We want to send an unmistakable message, though, that the United States and our allies will defend every inch of NATO territory.” The U.S. views Putin’s move to bolster Russian-backed breakaway regions in Ukraine as an invasion. Washington and its friends plan to soon unveil further steps to punish Russia and deter further escalation. “As Russia contemplates its next move, we have our next move prepared as well,” Biden said, adding that he believes Putin plans to escalate his incursion. “The United States will continue to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine.” Washington is also placing sanctions on influential Russians close to Putin and their family members, the president added. The group includes Russian spy chief Alexander Bortnikov, Putin aide Sergei Kiriyenko and three well-connected businessmen. Biden’s remarks came after Putin said the separatists should control a much larger portion of Ukraine than they already do, possibly signaling that Russian troops will fight the Western-backed Ukrainian army to capture new territory and set off a longer, bloodier conflict. Russia has also begun evacuating its diplomatic facilities in Ukraine. The U.S. is not obligated to defend Ukraine, but American officials and national security experts say a Russian-led upheaval of the status quo in Europe would endanger NATO states and would drive long-term instability. As Putin has amassed over 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders in recent months, NATO members have sent military support to Ukraine and reinforced their own forces in Russia’s neighborhood. Russia says NATO must withdraw from countries on its periphery — despite their independence — and promise to never accept Ukraine as a member. Earlier in the day, NATO member Germany said it would halt a pipeline project that would have let Russia earn millions of dollars by pumping gas across Europe. Berlin’s move vindicated the Biden administration’s strategy of warm, close cooperation with U.S. allies — undercutting Republicans’ claims that the president must intensely pressure European nations like Germany. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Tuesday that her country wants to remain united with its friends and show “a stop sign” to Russia. In a call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon, a senior Biden administration official called the pipeline, known as Nord Stream 2, “a cash cow” for Putin and said the pause represented “a major turning point in the world’s energy independence from Russia.” The U.S. will continue “to reduce Europe’s addiction to Russian gas,” the official added, and is ready to impose broader, more painful measures like targeting Sberbank, Russia’s largest financial bank, and cutting Moscow off from the SWIFT financial system. Western governments still hope that diplomacy can tamp down tensions on the continent, Biden said. The administration official noted that simply placing the maximum of sanctions on Russia is not America’s goal: “Sanctions are meant to deter and prevent. We want to prevent a large-scale of invasion of Ukraine,” the official said. And the president notably did not mention the possibility that he will hold a summit with Putin, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken did later cancel a planned meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. For now, “we still believe Russia is poised to go much further,” Biden said.",3.1270112941459907,1.8629364267617519,1.2640748673842388,25

Trump appeared in awe of Putin during an interview on a right-wing talk radio program broadcast from Tennessee. He described watching the Monday evening news after Putin declared two sections of Ukraine to be independent and ordered Russian troops to storm the regions for alleged “peacekeeping” purposes. “I said, ‘This is genius,’” Trump recalled. “Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine, of Ukraine ― Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful.” “So, Putin is now saying, ‘It’s independent.’ A large section of Ukraine. I said, ‘How smart is that?’ And he’s going to go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s the strongest peace force,” Trump said. “We could use that on our southern border,” he added, before continuing with his praise. “That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re going to keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy.” “I know him very well. Very, very well,” Trump said. The fondness that Trump displayed for the Russian strongman over the course of his presidency and beyond has continued to baffle even some in his own party. The White House explicitly called Putin’s move an “invasion” on Tuesday after weeks of tension between Russia and Ukraine and its Western allies. Russia began chipping away at Ukraine’s borders in 2014, and more than 14,000 people have died ― including about 3,300 civilians ― since Russian-backed separatists began clashing with Ukrainian forces. President Joe Biden said his administration would be imposing serious sanctions on Russia in response to its latest military activity. “Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territories that belong to his neighbors?” Biden said from the White House. Trump, after heaping praise on the Russian leader, claimed that he would have somehow been able to prevent the buildup of military forces from escalating into action. “By the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office ― not even thinkable. This would never have happened,” he said, having already repeated his false assertion that the 2020 presidential election was “rigged.” Putin has said that pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine should control a much larger part of the country than they already do, offering a hint at his intentions in the region.

A White House national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, told CNN that “the beginning” of Russia’s “latest invasion” was underway and that Biden would be rolling out new sanctions against Russia “in a matter of hours.” ""An invasion is an invasion and that is what is under way,"" says WH Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer as Putin orders troops into Eastern Ukraine.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he sees parts of eastern Ukraine that are controlled by separatist militias as independent countries and wants to redraw European borders for the first time in decades ― a violation of international law. The Kremlin previously published decrees ordering Russia’s defense ministry to deploy what it called “peacekeeping” forces in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the two Russia-backed separatist territories. At the time, it wasn’t immediately clear whether or when Russian troops would enter Ukraine and choose to fight the Western-backed Ukrainian military. The invasion comes after an increasingly tense crisis between Russia and Ukraine, which has been trying to escape Russia’s grip by moving closer toward becoming a democracy and aligning itself with the West. Russia has been building up its military along its 1,200-mile border with Ukraine since 2014, but recently accelerated its moves to try and force the U.S. and its allies to promise to keep the smaller nation out of the NATO military alliance. Russia’s buildup of more than 150,000 troops along the Ukrainian border allows for the international superpower to launch a combined-arms assault from multiple directions if it chooses to do so. Putin’s support of the Donetsk- and Luhansk-based separatists ― which he first revealed to his French and German counterparts ― threw away a yearslong diplomatic effort by the two countries to end fighting between Ukraine and the Russian-backed separatists. The Biden administration and its allied countries have warned that a massive war could break out should Russia invade the Ukrainian regions, causing widespread instability and violence in Europe. The White House has repeatedly said that U.S. troops will not fight Russians on behalf of Ukraine, but has sent thousands of American soldiers to European ally countries that have their own safety concerns related to Russia’s actions. The U.S. has also sent Ukraine military aid, and has promised to impose severe sanctions on Russia in response to further action. In response to Putin’s announcement recognizing two eastern Ukrainian regions as independent countries, the White House said that Biden would issue an executive order banning new investment, trade and financing by Americans “to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine.” “This E.O. will also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. “To be clear: these measures are separate from and would be in addition to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in coordination with Allies and partners should Russia further invade Ukraine.” Germany on Tuesday said it would pause a pipeline that would have dramatically increased its imports of Russian gas. The U.S. and the United Kingdom have also been arming Ukraine, as have the Baltic states. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had been working to negotiate with Putin to de-escalate the border crisis, suggesting they do not see Ukraine as a potential NATO member and offering to recognize Russia’s stature and interests. “We believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling, and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday on CNN. Those efforts appear to have failed. In mid-February, Putin claimed that Russia had begun a partial pullback in its military presence near the Ukraine border. However, U.S. officials denied that claim and instead accused Russia of increasing the number of troops at the border by 7,000. Ahead of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked to meet with Putin in hopes of reaching a “peaceful settlement.” To try to help prevent escalation into an attack on Ukraine, Biden held a virtual summit with Putin on Dec. 7. Then, from Jan. 10 to Jan. 12, three discussions took place: one between the U.S. and Russia, one between NATO countries and Russia, and one among members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). None ended with a solution. On Jan. 21, Blinken tried to renew the efforts by meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, Switzerland. That meeting also resulted in an impasse. During talks, Russia gave a series of demands in order to agree to a more peaceful approach. Some of the demands are automatically off the table with U.S. and NATO allies, such as Moscow wanting guarantees NATO would not expand eastward, including to Ukraine, and a rolling back of military deployment to some former Soviet states. The demands are “a Russian attempt, not only to secure [Putin’s] interest in Ukraine, but essentially re-litigate the security architecture of Europe,” Michael Kofman, the Russia studies research director at analysis organization CNACNA, told Vox. NATO allies released a statement during the 2008 summit in Bucharest saying they look forward to eventually welcoming Ukraine and Georgia as members. This heightened concerns for Russia, which already opposed the alliance’s decision to admit 14 new members after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. While the alliance is currently divided on admitting Ukraine and Georgia, it still insists on keeping its door open to new members. Nations can join only if all existing members agree to allow them in. Because NATO is considered a defensive military alliance, Russia views Ukraine joining the alliance as a security issue, considering the vast border it shares with the country.",1.9968423170892857,1.8823875722009777,0.11445474488830798,15

They will continue to support the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government, coordinating on diplomatic efforts.” Blinken went on to say the decision did not undermine the U.S.’s position on Ukrainian sovereignty, which remained “unwavering” amid the threat of a Russian incursion. “The fact that we are taking prudent precautions for the sake of the safety of U.S. government personnel and U.S. citizens, as we do regularly worldwide, in no way undermines our support for, or our commitment to, Ukraine,” he said. “Our commitment to Ukraine transcends any one location.” The U.S. temporarily moved its Ukraine embassy from Kyiv to Lviv last week, citing the “dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces.” Many non-essential embassy staff had already been ordered to leave the country, but key diplomats have remained. The State Department has urged American citizens to leave the country, and Blinken stressed Monday that any military operations could hamstring commercial air travel and threaten the safety of anyone regardless of nationality. Those threats only grew Monday after Putin ordered Russia’s Defense Ministry to sent troops to two separatist territories in Ukraine, escalating the conflict while saying the military movements were operating under “peacekeeper functions.” The move prompted an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, and the Biden administration said it would impose sanctions on the breakaway regions, but not on Russia for now. The U.S. has warned a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any moment, although world leaders have pushed for last-minute diplomatic solutions.",2.9117859558956813,2.6749959294570833,0.23679002643859803,3

The European Union and its partners “will react with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine,” European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen tweeted, accusing Moscow of derailing negotiations between Ukraine’s government in Kiev and pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country. Putin said Monday that the separatist-controlled regions should now be treated as independent of Ukraine. He is widely expected to send Russian forces into the area ― known as the Donbas ― in the coming days and has amassed tens of thousands troops near other parts of Ukraine. In a statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration will bar Americans from supporting the separatists and sanction people who do. She noted that the U.S. is separately considering major sanctions on Russia if it ramps up its interference in Ukraine, where it has been supporting the insurgency since 2014. A White House official later told reporters the administration would announce additional actions on Tuesday. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said her nation would also unveil new sanctions that day. National security experts worry that intense fighting will soon break out, and Western intelligence suggests Putin will claim that the Ukrainians have initiated it. Alar Karis, the president of Estonia, tweeted, “Moscow is not serious about diplomacy but is looking for casus belli,” referring to a justification for war. “Moscow continues to fuel the conflict in eastern Ukraine by providing financial and military support to the separatists. It is also trying to stage a pretext to invade Ukraine once again,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday. The Donbas conflict has already killed more than 13,000 people. Ukraine is not a U.S. treaty ally, and neither American nor European forces are expected to engage in any fighting with Russians or their partners. But Kiev has received significant Western military support, and President Joe Biden has deployed U.S. forces to neighboring allied countries like Poland and Romania to signal unity against Putin’s bid for greater regional influence. Russia has urged Washington to withdraw military support from those states ― despite their independent status and longstanding membership in the NATO alliance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with Biden on Monday and tweeted that he is gathering his top national security aides and reaching out to other global leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Putin announced his position in a televised address in which he questioned whether Ukraine and other nations that emerged from the Soviet Union should be independent and accused Western governments of threatening Russia. He later ordered Russian troops to the Ukrainian regions. The Russian leader’s move dramatically escalates the security crisis in Eastern Europe, where he has posted 150,000 troops in recent weeks and the U.S. has warned that a devastating all-out war could break out. Putin first revealed his decision in a call to his French and German counterparts on Monday evening ― scuttling a yearslong diplomatic process by their two countries to end fighting between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists. “We are not afraid of anyone,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the nation after Russia recognized the separatist regions’ independence. President Joe Biden has repeatedly said American troops will not fight Russians on behalf of Ukraine. But he has sent the Ukrainians military support and posted thousands of U.S. soldiers in European ally countries that worry Moscow will prompt regional chaos or threaten them. Biden met with his national security team, including the secretaries of state and defense, as Putin was speaking, according to a White House statement. The president also spoke with Zelenskyy. Officials in the U.S. and its allied countries say allowing Russia to force changes in other countries against their will risks instability and widespread violence. They have promised to slap aggressive sanctions on Putin for a further incursion into Ukraine. From Moscow’s point of view, the Ukrainian government in Kyiv has grown alarmingly close to the West since Ukrainian demonstrators toppled a Putin-linked ruler in 2014. In his speech, Putin claimed that Western officials now run the country and their Ukrainian partners are mismanaging post-Soviet institutions down to the postal service and trying to quash their people’s historic ties to Russia. Russia has sought to retain influence over neighboring countries like Ukraine and challenged their bids to explore other partnerships such as the NATO military alliance. As Putin has built up his deployment along Ukraine’s borders, he has urged Western leaders to promise to never let the country join NATO and issued other demands such as a NATO withdrawal from the Baltic countries of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia — democratic treaty allies of the U.S. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have tried to negotiate with their Russian counterpart by hinting that they do not see Ukraine as a candidate for NATO membership and offering to recognize Russia’s stature and interests. On Sunday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an emailed statement that Biden was willing to hold a high-profile summit with Putin “if an invasion hasn’t happened.” “We are always ready for diplomacy,” Psaki said. “We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war. And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.” Josep Borrell, the foreign policy chief for the European Union, said Monday that Russia would face EU sanctions over recognizing the Ukrainian rebels’ claim to sovereignty. Analysts are now watching how far Russia will go to support the independence of the Ukrainian separatists: whether Putin tells Russian troops to fight the Western-backed Ukrainian military and whether the conflict expands beyond the borders of the breakaway Ukrainian regions, which are collectively known as the Donbas. “The best-case scenario ― from a human life standpoint ― is that it all ends at the current line of control: if Russian troops go in and Ukrainian troops fortify but don’t try to push the [line] forward,” Sam Greene, a professor at King’s College London, tweeted on Monday. Some of his colleagues foresee a more dreary result. To Michael Kofman of the CNA think tank, the size of the Russian deployment suggests Putin has greenlit an operation that extends beyond the Donbas “to impose regime change” in Ukraine. For the Biden administration and its partners, the coming days will involve complex diplomacy and likely pressure on Moscow ― though officials and experts have struggled to craft an effective strategy given Putin’s focus on the matter and frequently shifting narrative of the crisis. “It’s hard to listen to this speech and believe that any of the partial concessions that have been suggested - withdrawing the possibility of NATO membership from Ukraine in particular - would have made any difference,” national security commentator Cheryl Rofer tweeted amid the Russian leader’s remarks.",1.8189084225114887,3.474564446353746,-1.6556560238422573,15

The official said that Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s decision to offer military protection to pro-Russian separatists would get a further response Tuesday, beyond the sanctions the White House announced Monday to punish anyone doing business with the two enclaves. “We will take further action tomorrow to hold Russia accountable,” the official said. He would not specify further about what the action would be. Russia has for years denied that it had forces in eastern Ukraine, but now appears to be doing so openly, the official said. “There have been Russian forces in these areas throughout,” the official said, adding the United States would be monitoring events in the coming hours to see how far Putin goes. “We will observe and assess what actions Russia actually takes and respond.” In a lengthy speech on Monday, Putin announced his decision to recognize Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states ― an action the Biden administration considers an escalation of the Russian leader’s moves to surround Ukraine by some 190,000 forces in recent weeks. “This was a speech to the Russian people to justify war,” the official said. “This is Potemkin politics, President Putin accelerating the conflict that he created.” In 2014, Putin also invaded and annexed Crimea from its neighbor, which gained independence during the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.",1.269992974227414,4.660985512048488,-3.390992537821074,15

Shcherbakova performed a less-athletic routine in the long program, but was already ahead of Trusova from the short program.

He also warned that should an invasion take place, there would be economic consequences in the United States, including higher gas prices. “I will not pretend this will not be painless,” he said, adding that he would try to alleviate such pain as best he could. Nevertheless, he said that in the event Russia invades, a response would be necessary. “If we do not stand for freedom where it is at risk today, we’ll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow.” Biden also at one point spoke directly to Russian citizens. “We’re not targeting the people of Russia,” he said. “We do not seek to destabilize Russia. To the citizens of Russia, you are not our enemy. And I do not believe you want a bloody, destructive war against Ukraine, a country and a people with whom you share such deep ties of family, history and culture.” Hours earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin, following a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, had indicated that he was ready for talks regarding Ukraine and military transparency. Prior to that, a Russian defense official had said some Russian troops would be leaving the area. Biden has spent much of his time in recent weeks working to dissuade Putin from further aggressive action toward Ukraine, and urging allies in Western Europe to present a common front. Last week, with Scholz at his side in the White House, he declared that a lucrative natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany would never become operational if Putin moved further into Ukraine. “There will no longer be a Nord Stream 2,” Biden said. “We will bring an end to it.” Since then, he has again spoken to Putin, as well as to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, from Camp David. Putin has amassed more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s border in recent months, raising fears of another invasion. In 2014, he invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine, which gained independence during the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. He later moved into the eastern part of the country as well. In order to pressure Putin, Biden’s administration has relied on the strategy of releasing intelligence assessments about Russia’s preparations and its likely intentions. Last month, for example, the administration made public indications that Russia intended to release a video depicting a fake Ukrainian attack on its forces ― including actors playing corpses ― to justify an incursion.",4.290811930998709,2.984884474514517,1.3059274564841918,25

The U.S. recently announced plans to evacuate most of its diplomatic staff from Kyiv and ordered 3,000 troops to Poland on top of the 1,700 who are on their way there in demonstration of American commitment to worried NATO allies. At a press conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that “the best friend for enemies is panic in our country. And all this information helps only to create panic. It doesn’t help us.” When asked whether the U.S. is dangerously sparking panic in Ukraine, Sullivan said the White House is trying to “be transparent to American citizens that they should leave Ukraine immediately, because there will not be a military evacuation in the event of an invasion.” “Only one country has amassed more than 100,000 troops on the border of Ukraine. It’s not the United States. It’s Russia. That is the source of the alarm,” Sullivan said. “And we are trying to tell Ukrainians to prepare and be ready for this as well, as well as coordinate with our NATO allies and partners, so that we are able to defend NATO territory and deter any further Russian aggression should they move on Ukraine.” “But fundamentally, our view is that we’re not going to give Russia the opportunity to conduct a surprise here, to spring something on Ukraine or the world,” he continued. “We are going to make sure that we are laying out for the world what we see as transparently and plainly as we possibly can, and share that information as widely as we can. That’s what we have done. That’s what we will continue to do.” Sullivan recently also warned that U.S. intelligence shows that Russia could invade Ukraine within days, and before the Winter Olympics in Beijing end on Feb. 20. The national security adviser told reporters on Friday that intelligence shows military action could start with missile and air attacks, followed by a ground offensive. Russia has continued to deny that it plans to invade, despite its continued buildup of firepower on three sides of Ukraine. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan tells @JakeTapper that Russian forces are in a place where an invasion could take place before the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics.“A major military action could begin by Russia in Ukraine any day now,” he says. #CNNSOTU  “The hysteria of the White House is more indicative than ever,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, according to The Associated Press. “The Anglo-Saxons need a war. At any cost. Provocations, misinformation and threats are a favorite method of solving their own problems.” The Defense Department has publicly warned that Russian operatives were planning a false-flag operation, a plan in which the country would stage a fake attack on itself to have an excuse to intervene in Ukraine. Earlier this month, intelligence officials alleged there is a Russian plot to fabricate a graphic video ― allegedly staged with explosions and corpses ― as pretext for an attack on Ukraine. The claim received scrutiny from some reporters who called out the White House for not providing evidence for such a strong allegation. “First, we’re not putting forward this intelligence to start a war, which has happened in the past, Jake. We are putting forward this intelligence to stop a war. And I think that fundamentally gives it, at the outset, a different level of credibility,” Sullivan said Sunday, adding that a false-flag operation is “consistent with the Russian playbook.” Russia indeed has a history of using false-flag operations, one example being in 1968 when the Kremlin used its intelligence service to create false-flag incidents to justify Soviet military intervention in Czechoslovakia. “And then, third, if you look at Russian media, they are laying the groundwork for a potential pretext by raising the possibility of attacks by Ukrainian forces on either Russians themselves or Russia’s proxy forces in the Donbass,” he continued. “And then, finally, what we have said, stood at the podium and shared with our allies that we have information that we have gathered through intelligence that indicates that there is active planning for this. And it’s not just the United States saying it. We have our NATO allies stepping out and saying it as well, because they have been able to review that intelligence, assess its credibility and reach the same conclusion we have reached. So, I do think the world should be prepared for Russia staging a pretext and then launching a potential military action,” he said. On Saturday, President Joe Biden held an hourlong call with Vladimir Putin in which the White House said he told the Russian president that invading Ukraine would cause “widespread human suffering” and that the West was committed to diplomacy to end the crisis but “equally prepared for other scenarios.” “There was no fundamental change in the dynamic that has been unfolding now for several weeks, but we believe that we have put ideas on the table that would be in our and our allies’ interest to pursue, that would enhance European security, and that would also address some of Russia’s stated concerns, just as we have been clear that we are committed to upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and the rights of states to choose their own security arrangements,” said a senior administration official who briefed reporters about the call. “But it remains unclear whether Russia is interested in pursuing its goals diplomatically as opposed to through the use of force,” the official said. Russia has been in aggressive conflict with Ukraine since 2014, when the latter nation’s Kremlin-friendly leader was ousted by a popular uprising that has demanded a democracy more aligned with the West. Moscow responded by annexing the Crimean Peninsula and backing a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, where fighting has killed over 14,000 people. France and Germany helped broker a 2015 peace deal that helped halt large-scale battles. However, regular clashes have continued with efforts to reach a political settlement having stalled. The current tensions with Russia come as NATO countries deliberate whether to allow Ukraine to enter the alliance ― a move Russia sees as a major security threat due to its shared borders with Ukraine.",3.7962947124508655,3.210351008706917,0.5859437037439483,15

Exhibition curator Anna Reshetkina told Russian website ura.ru that it was the guard’s first day on the job, the BBC reported . “His motives are still unknown but the administration believes it was some kind of a lapse in sanity,” she said. The painting, which was reportedly insured for roughly $1 million, was sent to Moscow for restoration. The center said the damage can be repaired.

Russian newspapers RBC and Kommersant said the teen tested positive for trimetazidine, a drug typically used to treat chest pain. USA Today and Reuters also confirmed the report. Kamila was part of the Russian Olympic Committee’s six-person team that dominated the three-day figure skating team event during the Winter Games in Beijing, coming in first on Monday ahead of the United States and Japan. The three teams were honored on the ice right after the competition, in which Japan placed third, the U.S. second and the ROC first. But Tuesday night’s medal ceremony was delayed after news of the Russian teen’s positive drug test. The ROC did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. The 15-year-old Russian skating prodigy, heavily favored to win individual gold at the Olympics, delivered one of the major highlights of the Games thus far when she became the first female competitor to land a quadruple jump. The historic first occurred during her free skate, which helped the ROC win the team competition. “I do feel this burden a bit, this pressure, because this is my first season among adult skaters,” she told The Associated Press. “I believe that I’m coping with this pressure, and sometimes it even pushes me forward. It helps me.” Trimetazidine, or TMZ, is an anti-coagulant that increases blood flow to the heart and limits rapid swings in blood pressure. The drug is not approved for use in the U.S. and has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of prohibited substances since 2014. Dr. Sadiya Khan, a cardiologist with Northwestern Medicine, told Reuters that the theory behind using TMZ in athletics is that it can enhance blood flow in a healthy person. “The idea behind it would be potentially if you enhance blood flow, you could improve somebody’s ability to exercise longer or exercise more efficiently by allowing the heart to respond super-normally,” Khan told the outlet, adding that there’s “no strong evidence” the drug gives a performance-enhancing benefit. On Tuesday, International Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams said that the medal ceremony did not happen due to an ongoing legal issue with the International Skating Union. Adams said that the committee will give an update soon. “We have athletes that have won medals involved,” he said. According to Russian media, Kamila’s test sample was obtained before she won the European championship last month in Estonia, where she soared in her performance and led Russia’s group of elite female figure skaters headed to Beijing. The positive test could cost the ROC its gold medal for the team competition and threaten Kamila’s chance to win the individual competition. According to the AP, the most famous case of TMZ in sports doping involved Chinese star swimmer Sun Yang, a three-time Olympic champion who ended up facing a three-month ban in 2014. Russian bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva tested positive for TMZ at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, was disqualified from the two-woman bobsled event and faced an eight-month ban. Russian athletes are competing in Beijing as the ROC and not under the Russian flag due to a state-sponsored doping scheme at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.",4.3113700478792385,5.806587783321092,-1.4952177354418534,1

In 2014, he invaded and annexed Crimea from its neighbor, which gained independence during the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. Biden said that Putin still has the option of ending the crisis through diplomatic means, but that he cannot predict what Putin will do. “I don’t know that he knows what he’s going to do,” Biden said, adding that Putin and Russia will suffer if he goes ahead and invades. “We will impose the most severe sanctions that have ever been imposed.” Scholz, who in December took over from longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel, agreed that a new invasion would be severely punished. “There will be a high price for Russia,” he said. “Even Russia has understood the message now.” Scholz, though, did not specifically repeat Biden’s language about Nord Stream 2, despite attempts from reporters to have him clarify his position. He did say that Germany and the United States are in full agreement on the sanctions. “We will be united,” he said. “We are absolutely together.” The Biden administration has already adopted the strategy of releasing intelligence assessments about Russian preparations in order to pressure Putin not to invade. Last week, it made public indications that Russia intended to fake an attack on its forces by Ukraine — including actors playing corpses — to justify an incursion. White House press secretary Jen Psaki at Monday’s daily press briefing said Russia had a history of using such “lies” as a prelude to its aggressive behavior. “We have seen where they have used these tactics in the past,” she said. The natural gas pipeline — not yet operational — had become a sticking point in the discussions. Germany had resisted including it in the package of sanctions threatened against Russia should it invade, but in recent days has signaled that it would support scuttling the project entirely in the event of an invasion. Such a move would significantly damage Russia’s already hurting economy. “Russia needs to be able to sell that gas,” Biden said. Scholz, when asked how Germany would replace Russia’s gas, said his country has been aggressively moving away from fossil fuels to fight climate change, and this would hasten the work to switch to wind, solar and hydrogen. “We are focusing on renewable energies,” he said. “We will make sure that this is the profitable future.”",3.7577936312126723,3.804695367521532,-0.04690173630885974,15

During a briefing providing the press updates on escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, State Department spokesman Ned Price referenced a report by intelligence officials last month that said Russia was attempting to create a pretext for its troops to invade Ukraine. On Thursday, Price said the U.S. had intelligence suggesting Russia was planning a “false flag operation” propaganda video to justify an invasion. Associated Press reporter Matt Lee asked: Where’s the evidence? MUST WATCH: Heated exchange between @APDiploWriter Matt Lee and @StateDeptSpox Ned Price on recently declassified information from the US government that reveals Russia's ongoing propaganda tactics.  In a heated back and forth, Price repeated that Russia was planning to conduct a false flag operation in eastern Ukraine, citing a previous briefing where the plan had been discussed. “What is the evidence that the plan — I mean, this is like crisis actors, really?” Lee asked. “This is like Alex Jones territory that you’re getting into now. What evidence do you have that there is some propaganda film in the making?” Price said his comments were “derived from information known to the U.S. government,” again prompting Lee to press him for evidence. “I would like some proof that the Russians are doing this,” Lee said. Later in the more than five minute back-and-forth, Price suggested Lee’s questioning of the U.S. government was playing into Russia’s plans. “If you doubt the credibility of the U.S. government, of the British government, of other governments and want to, you know, find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do,” Price said. Lee would be right to, as Price puts it, “doubt the credibility” of a government that has historically been known to lie. For instance, officials lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a pretext to invade the country in 2003. And the U.S. has a record of lying about civilian casualties, something White House press secretary Jen Psaki was reminded of by a reporter on Thursday. After the White House announced Thursday that a top ISIS leader had been killed, Psaki took questions aboard Air Force One, where she was pressed for details about the operation that left 13 people dead, including six children and four women. Earlier, President Joe Biden said top ISIS militant Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi detonated a suicide bomb that killed himself, his wife and his children during the raid. NPR White House Correspondent Ayesha Rascoe again asked a question reporters often ask: Can you show evidence? “Jen, will there be any, like, evidence or, like, release to support the idea ― I mean, I know the U.S. has put out its statement that, you know, [ISIS] detonated the bomb themselves,” Rascoe said, according to a press pool transcript of the conversation. “But will the U.S. provide any evidence? Because there may be people that are skeptical of the events that took place and what happened to the civilians.” Here’s how the rest of the exchange unfolded: PSAKI: Skeptical of the U.S. military’s assessment when they went and took out an ISIS terror ― the leader of ISIS? RASCOE: Yes. PSAKI: That they are not providing accurate information ― RASCOE: Yes. PSAKI: — and ISIS is providing accurate information? RASCOE: Well, not ISIS, but, I mean, the U.S. has not always been straightforward about what happens with civilians. And, I mean, that is a fact. PSAKI: Well, as you know, there’s an extensive process that the Department of Defense undergoes. The president made clear from the beginning, at every point in this process, that doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties was his priority and his preference. I just reconfirmed, and I think our national security colleague who did a briefing this morning also reiterated that the individual who was the target detonated himself, killing his entire family. Given these events just happened less than 24 hours ago, we’re going to give them time to make a final assessment. And they’ll provide every detail they can. When Roscoe said the U.S. “has not always been straightforward about what happens with civilians,” she could have been referring to any number of times the U.S. has killed foreign civilians and attempted to hide it. When the U.S. government makes a claim, it’s a reporter’s job to ask for evidence.

But conservatives just can’t agree on what Biden is doing wrong. The party’s most powerful elected figures, like top House Republican Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), say Biden is too weak. They want him to take tougher actions to frighten Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has deployed more than 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s borders in recent weeks in apparent plans to invade. Biden has shipped military equipment to Ukrainian forces, threatened Putin with unprecedented sanctions and rejected Moscow’s demand to forswear new alliances with countries such as Ukraine that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. But Biden has emphasized that he wants to defuse tensions diplomatically, offering to make concessions on Russian concerns, including U.S. deployments in Europe, and supporting European allies’ efforts at negotiation between the Russians and Ukrainians. Still, conservative luminaries (and GOP power brokers) Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham of Fox News say Biden is moving toward an all-out nuclear war with Russia to aid the hawkish military-industrial complex and argue Ukraine is irrelevant to Americans. Some of their far-right allies, notably commentators Candace Owens and Benny Johnson, claim the flare-up in Europe is being driven by shadowy elites, including Biden’s own family, whom Republicans have baselessly accused of profiting off U.S. policies in Ukraine. “There is quite literally no Russian threat. Biden crime family is trying to expand their business empire in the region,” Owen tweeted on Monday. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) endorsed that theory on Tuesday, saying Biden wanted to spark a war ― as Moscow carried out fresh military exercises. Adding to the confusion, some Republicans want to have it both ways. According to Donald Trump Jr., Biden is both too feeble to deter a Russian invasion and too eager to start a war for his own corrupt reasons. The GOP’s mess is the latest result of its ongoing identity crisis. That Republican dilemma could help Democrats shed their fear of being seen as soft on national security, allowing them to offer a strong alternative message, and could change the shape of the U.S. foreign policy debate for good. Breaking with Republican orthodoxy, former President Donald Trump slammed America’s traditional claim to global leadership and its longstanding allies, instead frequently trying to withdraw from international involvement and endorsing the narratives of rivals, particularly Putin. That approach bolstered the minority in the party, chiefly libertarians, who want the U.S. to be more restrained abroad, and Trump’s constant repetition of those ideas highlighted them for GOP voters. Today, Trump still dominates the GOP. And whether from personal conviction or simply for ambition, some conservatives are still pushing ideas that echo his ― often in shocking ways. According to The Washington Post, one Republican lawmaker serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee recently outraged their colleagues by texting a group chain about an article on arms supplies for Ukraine’s defense and asking, “Why is Biden being allowed to provoke Russia?” Conservatives are creating sympathy well beyond Washington for Moscow’s viewpoint, which overlooks the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and Russian support for Ukrainian separatists to instead portray Ukraine and its Western partners as threatening Russia. On Monday, multiple people called the office of Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) to urge him to support Russia’s position. Some callers said they learned about the situation from Carlson’s Fox News show, Malinowski told HuffPost in a Tuesday interview. “Callers are being spun up to believe… that we’re about to go to war with Russia for Ukraine, and of course that’s not true,” Malinowski said. “We’re taking Ukraine’s side appropriately and mobilizing our allies to impose sanctions against Russia while giving Ukraine arms and ammunition to defend itself. That said, it’s been America’s policy in the world since World War II to try to prevent dictatorships from changing borders with tanks.” There is no obligation that could force the U.S. to enter a war to defend Ukraine. But, according to Carlson, who has millions of viewers, a conflict could occur due to American hubris and lobbying by Ukrainian politicians and U.S. defense firms. In his telling, Americans should not see any difference between Ukraine and Russia ― or any Russian responsibility for potential bloodshed. Ingraham, who follows Carlson on Fox News’ daily broadcast schedule, is telling her fans that the U.S. risks “another hopeless crusade” and Republicans must “resist the war machine’s temptation.” Ironically, it was during Trump’s presidency that the U.S. most recently neared the kind of “extinction level confrontation” that conservatives now pin on Biden. In mishandling the complex U.S. relationships with Iran and North Korea, Trump flirted with major wars at least twice while elsewhere encouraging more brutal American military action abroad and impunity for violence by America’s partners. Most elected Republicans have an entirely different narrative on Ukraine. Casting Biden as feckless, they are pushing for immediate new sanctions on Russia ― an escalation before an invasion rather than the threat of punishment if Moscow does interfere further in Ukraine. But it’s bizarre for the GOP to claim it is the party of standing up to Putin after Trump broke the law to blackmail Ukraine for his reelection campaign and told his foreign counterparts he believed Moscow was correct to claim Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it seized in 2014. “Most congressional Republicans agree with Democrats on the fundamental principle that we should be on Ukraine’s side and what Putin is doing is dangerous and wrong, but there is this strain in their party ― that Tucker Carlson is encouraging and that the former president was obviously sympathetic to ― that asks, ‘Why can’t we be friends with Russia? Why do we need troops in Europe? Why can’t the big countries just get together and carve up the small countries?’” Malinowski said. “A lot of my Republican colleagues, even those who are very strong on Ukraine, are in denial about the power of this strain in their party.” Dan Caldwell of Stand Together, a nonprofit group that often works with conservatives, sees the shift in Republican thinking on national security policy as generational and likely to continue. “It’s more complicated than this just being a Trump phenomenon; it’s a broader questioning across the right of American foreign policy over the past 30 years,” said Caldwell, the vice president for foreign policy at the organization, which is backed by longtime GOP donor Charles Koch. He pointed to a survey that his group conducted in December in partnership with the well-respected polling group YouGov. In asking Americans their view of a possible war with Russia to defend Ukraine, they found that 55% of Trump voters opposed that idea, compared with only 44% of Biden voters. “It’s another example of how often Republicans in Washington are out of step with their base on these issues,” Caldwell said, adding that GOP lawmakers could instead say the U.S. should not take on more security commitments or reflexively oppose Russia. Shifting in that direction could align them on some issues with antiwar progressives, who, on issues like the U.S. role in the devastating civil war in Yemen, have worked with conservatives to force changes. Caldwell believes the split will become a major factor in the party’s selection of its presidential candidate for the 2024 election ― and Republicans could then finally settle on a united direction on global affairs. For now, as Biden tries to defuse the tension in Europe and bolster his standing at home, the clear divide weakens Republicans’ attacks on his policy of diplomacy and limited support for Ukraine. It’s not often that a Democratic president can tout that conservative thinker Sohrab Ahmari is boosting him in the pages of The Washington Post, arguing: “Ignore the hawks, Mr. President. You’re right on Ukraine.”",3.794446155032213,4.138656076273626,-0.3442099212414127,25

Now He Says He'd Be Better At Helping It Resist Russia.,"WASHINGTON — Three years after trying to extort Ukraine using $391 million in military aid as leverage and two years after being impeached for it, former President Donald Trump claimed on Monday that Russian aggression against the country would never have happened on his watch. “What’s happening with Russia and Ukraine would never have happened under the Trump Administration. Not even a possibility!” he said in a statement released by his political committee. The statement made no reference to the scandal that led to Trump’s first of two impeachments, in which he held up delivery of U.S. military aid while demanding that Ukraine’s new president announce an investigation into Joe Biden, then the Democratic primary candidate Trump feared most as a 2020 challenger. The military hardware was released when the scheme became public. In addition to using U.S. aid intended to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine for his own benefit, Trump made a practice during his presidency of taking Russia’s side in the dispute between the two nations. For several years, he lobbied fellow leaders of the G-7 group of major economic powers to readmit Russia, even though it had been thrown out because of the invasion and annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. At the G-7 summit in 2018, Trump told his counterparts that Crimea should belong to Russia because the people there spoke Russian — repeating comments he’d made as a presidential candidate. “But you know, the people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,” he told ABC News in 2016. In 2019, during a news conference following the G-7 meeting in Biarritz, France, Trump rationalized Russia’s insistence on retaining Crimea by saying it had built a military base there. “That is where they do their submarine work and that is where they dock large and powerful submarines, but not as powerful as ours and not as large as ours, but they have their submarines,” he said, while also blaming his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, for having been “outsmarted” by Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine and take the region by force. While the U.S. government as a whole did try to punish Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, much of that was due to bipartisan majorities in Congress or career staff at executive branch agencies enacting sanctions. Other actions were largely symbolic. While the United States did supply Ukraine with anti-tank Javelin missiles, for example, they were provided under the condition that they not be deployed in areas where they actually could have been used against pro-Russian forces. Russian ruler Vladimir Putin, whom Trump repeatedly praised both before and after he took office, has amassed more than 100,000 troops along his border with Ukraine. Biden, now the U.S. president, has warned Putin that another invasion would be met with severe consequences, including harsh new economic sanctions. He has also been considering redeploying thousands of U.S. troops to Eastern Europe. In 2016, Trump accepted Putin’s help to win the U.S. presidency by using documents that Russian spies stole from the Democratic Party and the campaign of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, even though he had been informed by U.S. intelligence officials that Russian spies had stolen them. Four years later, despite losing the 2020 election by 7 million popular votes and by 306-232 in the Electoral College, Trump became the first U.S. president in more than two centuries to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol – his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― killed five, including one police officer, injured another 140 officers, and was followed by four police suicides. It resulted in his second impeachment just a week before he left office. The former National Security Council staffer who testified against Trump during his first impeachment said Monday that Trump’s incitement of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol probably led to Putin’s renewed aggression. “What’s happening in Ukraine is the direct result of Trump’s attack on democracy. Absent January 6th, Putin would likely not be preparing to launch the largest offensive in Europe since WWII,” said Alexander Vindman. “Putin’s sense of American weakness emanates from Trump-incited hyper polarization. Trump’s fondness for Putin infected the far right media echo chamber.” Despite Trump’s two impeachments and his literal attempt to overthrow American democracy, he remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.",3.347614758619215,4.538490700191465,-1.19087594157225,12

In fact, it was his dad who bragged as president about his friendship with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, the clear aggressor in the Ukraine situation, and who accepted Putin’s denials of Kremlin interference in the 2016 U.S. election despite the findings of his own intelligence officials. Former President Donald Trump also denounced Ukraine — and was impeached for threatening to withhold vital military assistance to stave off a Russian incursion unless Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, launched a baseless investigation into presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son Hunter. Hunter Biden was on the board of directors of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma, for five years, ending in 2019. The Trump campaign tried to paint Hunter Biden as a schemer who hoped to leverage his father’s possible influence, but no connections to corruption ever surfaced, and now a connection to a possible Russian invasion appears even more outlandish. Even Florida businessman Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-born American linked to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, reminded Donald Jr. that it was his father who was “impeached because he held back military aid to Ukraine.” Parnas has admitted working with Giuliani to try to pressure Ukrainian officials to launch an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden in 2019. Parnas, who has said Donald Trump knew everything they were doing, was convicted last October of illegally funneling money from a Russian financier to Republican politicians in the U.S., among other charges.

The stunning eagle first turned up last week along the Taunton River, east of Providence, Rhode Island, and is believed to be the same bird that was previously observed in Alaska and Canada, according to a Facebook post from the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Steller’s sea eagles can weigh up to 20 pounds and have a 6- to 8-foot wingspan. They have large, cartoonish orange beaks and distinctive white plumage along their upper wings that resembles a splattered snowball. News of the sighting sent birders flocking to the area. One of them, Nick Lund, the advocacy and outreach coordinator for Maine Audubon, blogged about the experience on his website, called “The Birdist.” Lund had been participating in a Christmas bird count in southern Maine when he received a text from a colleague that said “Steller’s was just found.” Lund abandoned the organized bird count, hopped in the car with some fellow birders and drove the two hours south. “We pull up to the tiny, private beach where the bird was last seen to the dreaded ‘you just missed it!’” Lund wrote on his blog. “A birder’s nightmare. It flew upriver somewhere and no one knows where it is.” With their car nearly out of gas, the group drove off in hopes of catching a glimpse. Eventually, they received word that the bird had been spotted at Dighton Rock State Park. “We go, park haphazardly, and there it is, across the river with a bunch of Bald Eagles. Holy shit. We’re screaming,” Lund wrote. “An absolute dream to be all of a sudden standing in this random park in southern Massachusetts looking at a wild, rare Russian monster.” On their way home, the group stopped to purchase a bottle of Russian vodka to “honor our visiting Russian comrade.” HOOOOOLLLYYY SHIIIITTTTTTT  This bird of prey’s odyssey thousands of miles from home has captivated scientists and enthusiasts. As The New York Times reported in November, the lost eagle has been slowly makings its way east across North America. It was first spotted along the Denali highway in southeastern Alaska in August 2020, and more recently in eastern Canada. It is even believed to have been sighted in Texas in the spring. “We’ve never had one here in this area of the world: the Northeast coast of North America or Massachusetts,” Andrew Vitz, a state ornithologist, told The Boston Globe. “This is like the bird of the decade for people around here.” Birds turning up outside their normal range, known as avian vagrancy, is relatively common, often the result of an animal getting lost or blown off course in a storm. Vitz told the Globe that the eagle appears to be in good health and there is no plan to tag or capture it. “It’s probably trying to find some familiar faces out there — others of its own species,” he said. The total population of Steller’s sea eagles is estimated at 4,000 to 7,000 individuals. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the bird as “vulnerable.”",4.903101510641984,4.467499666110423,0.43560184453156126,13

In a statement, U.S. Space Command (which is different than Space Force) confirmed “a debris-generating event” occurred, but notably declined to mention the cause or Russia. Two U.S. officials told CNN that Russia carried out an antisatellite test over the weekend, and one suggested a link to the debris. That scenario is bolstered by a report from Seradata, a private space data and analysis company that tracked a suspected ground-launched antisatellite missile strike from Russia. The missile struck a defunct Soviet-era intelligence satellite that had been in orbit since 1982 and scattered at least 14 pieces of debris large enough to be tracked, according to Seradata. If confirmed, it would be Russia’s fourth such antisatellite test. The seven astronauts aboard the ISS had to repeatedly take safety measures Monday, sheltering in their docked capsules while the station passed the orbiting junk. “We are actively working to characterize the debris field and will continue to ensure all space-faring nations have the information necessary to maneuver satellites if impacted,” U.S. Space Command said. “We are also in the process of working with the interagency, including the State Department and NASA, concerning these reports and will provide an update in the near future.” Last week, the ISS had to alter its orbit after a chunk of an old Chinese satellite ― created by an antisatellite missile test by the Chinese in 2007 ― came close to the station. Even tiny bits of space debris can be disastrous for the space station. In June, a 5mm (0.20-inch) wide piece of junk traveling at 17,500 mph punched a hole through a thermal blanket wrapped around the station’s 60-foot robotic Canadarm2.",4.984930008387561,4.624749752666026,0.3601802557215352,1

The prestigious awards were given “based on the false reporting of a non-existent link between the Kremlin and the Trump Campaign,” Trump baselessly wrote in his appeal to the interim administrator of the Pulitzer awards, Bud Kliment. The former president called the coverage a “politically motivated farce.” He argued that the reporting was “based on shoddy, dubious, and manifestly false reporting,” and that Pulitzer officials must now “act accordingly.” The staffs of the New York Times and The Washington Post were awarded National Reporting Pulitzers for their work in 2018. The prizes were granted for “deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration,” the Pulitzer board noted. Trump claimed in his letter that he was “exonerated” by the investigation into Russian campaign interference in 2016. That assertion is false. After a lengthy investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and links to the Trump campaign, then-special counsel Robert Mueller noted pointedly in 2019 that the probe did not exonerate Trump. But he explained that under federal law, charging Trump, then a sitting president, was “not an option.” Mueller emphasized: “If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” which the investigative team did not. The report found that the Kremlin’s interference on behalf of Trump in the 2016 election was “sweeping and systemic.” Actions included a social media “information warfare” campaign that “favored” Trump, and the hacking of campaign-related related databases linked to rival Hillary Clinton. The hacked information was widely disseminated via Wikileaks. The investigation also detailed multiple interactions between representatives of the Kremlin or Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Trump campaign and Trump associates during the race for the presidency. The report noted that Trump’s associates repeatedly lied to investigators about their contacts with Russians, and Trump refused to answer questions concerning any of his efforts to influence witnesses or impede the investigation. Trump’s hand-picked Attorney General William Barr came under attack for failing to file charges against Trump, particularly for obstruction of justice. He downplayed the report’s findings in a statement about the investigation’s conclusions. Trump has called the investigation the “single greatest witch hunt in American history.” A spokesperson for the Pulitzer board could not immediately be reached for comment. The former president’s two-page letter to Kliment was posted by his aide Liz Harrington on her Twitter account. Trump has been banned from the platform for inciting the Jan. 6 riot. Twitter bars other accounts that serve as proxies for banned users, according to its policies, but apparently not in Trump’s case. Harrington has been posting all of Trump’s website statements on her Twitter account since she was hired in June.",4.70488425427275,4.917064435182511,-0.21218018090976098,12

The grand jury indictment accuses Sussmann of lying when he “stated to the General Counsel of the FBI that he was not acting on behalf of any client in conveying particular allegations concerning a Presidential candidate, when in truth, and in fact, as the defendant well knew, he was acting on behalf of specific clients, namely, Tech Executive-1 and the Clinton Campaign.” The indictment, as The New York Times reported yesterday, was sought by John Durham, whom the Trump administration named special counsel to investigate the Russia probe. The indictment was returned just before the five-year statute of limitations expired. In a statement to the Times ahead of the indictment, Sussmann’s attorneys said he “has committed no crime” and that a prosecution “would be baseless, unprecedented and an unwarranted deviation from the apolitical and principled way in which the Department of Justice is supposed to do its work.” “We are confident that if Mr. Sussmann is charged, he will prevail at trial and vindicate his good name,” they said.

Putin is afraid, Biden surmised, that “his credibility worldwide shrinks” as Russia’s human rights abuses, attacks on the free press and reputation for meddling in foreign elections increasingly define how the rest of the world regards the country. “How would it be if the United States were viewed by the rest of the world as interfering with the elections directly of other countries and everybody knew it?” Biden asked, referring to U.S. intelligence findings that Russia attempted to meddle in the last two U.S. presidential elections. “What would it be like if we engaged in activities that he’s engaged in? It diminishes the standing of a country that is desperately trying to make sure it maintains its standing as a major world power.” Biden, speaking before reporters in Geneva shortly after Putin held his own press conference, said they had a productive conversation about avoiding conflict, agreeing to arms control measures, consequences of human rights abuses and the detainment of two American citizens in Russia ― Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed. But moving forward on those issues requires a wait-and-see approach, Biden admitted. “We’ll find out within the next six months to a year whether or not we actually have a strategic dialogue that matters,” the president said. “We’ll find out whether we work to deal with everything from the release of people in Russian prisons or not. We’ll find out whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order.” But Putin, by Biden’s own admission, is far from a reliable negotiator. Biden confessed in 2014 that he once looked Putin in the eyes and told him, “I don’t think you have a soul.” However, Biden bristled when reporters asked how he could trust Putin. “This is not about trust,” he said. “This is about self-interest and verification of self-interest.” The president grew visibly upset near the end of his press conference as reporters continued to challenge him on the matter, particularly when CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked how he could be “so confident [Putin] will change his behavior” when the Kremlin’s leader just spent his press conference denying Russia’s role in any cyber attacks, downplaying the country’s human rights abuses and refusing to acknowledge Alexei Navalny, an outspoken Putin critic currently imprisoned in Russia. Biden snapped at the characterization. “I am not confident he will change his behavior. Where the hell ― what do you do all the time? When did I say I was confident? ... I said what will change their behavior is if the rest of the world reacts to them and it diminishes their standing in the world. I am not confident of anything. I am just stating the facts.” Biden later apologized in front of reporters before boarding Air Force One. “I owe my last questioner an apology,” he said. “I shouldn’t have been such a wise guy for the answer I gave.”",5.582298304869892,3.8640483941369594,1.7182499107329323,25

Richard “Bigo” Barnett, 60, appeared in an interview that aired Sunday complaining about jail after his arrest on charges linked to the attempted overthrow of the presidential election, The Daily Beast first reported. The segment aired just days before President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet for the first time in Geneva on Wednesday. Special correspondent Valentin Bogdanov of Russian TV channel Rossiya-1 interviewed Barnett, a self-described white nationalist from Arkansas, via FaceTime. He described Barnett as “colorful” — a word Putin has used to characterized Donald Trump. Bogdanov also falsely referred to the 2020 U.S. presidential election as “stolen,” a claim that has no basis in fact. Barnett has been charged with several crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon (a stun gun), and theft of government property. He allegedly took a piece of Pelosi’s mail and left her a note, apparently calling her a “bitch,” though he misspelled the word. Hello from Judge Chris Cooper's virtual courtroom, where arguments are starting soon on Richard Barnett's motion for release — he's the one who told reporters he left Pelosi a note that said, ""Nancy, Bigo was here, you bitch"" (looks like ""bitch"" was misspelled on the actual note)  “I exercise my First Amendment rights every hour, every minute, and every day, and I will never stop,” Barnett boasted to Bogdanov. Barnett was released to home detention in April after complaining that being held behind bars wasn’t “fair” when other Capitol suspects were allowed to return home following their arrests. “They’re letting everyone else out,” Barnett yelled during his hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Christopher R. Cooper, the Daily Beast reported. “I’ve been here a long time. It’s not fair. This has been a bunch of crap.” A judge had turned down an earlier request, ruling that Barnett’s “entitled behavior ... shows a total disregard for the law ... and the Constitution.” Barnett is due back in federal court for a hearing on Tuesday.",3.872964281319233,3.778373525985756,0.09459075533347683,4

In an interview with NBC News, excerpts of which the outlet posted Friday, journalist Keir Simmons noted that Biden was asked earlier this year whether he thought Putin was a “killer” and Biden said, “I do.” Simmons then asked Putin directly if this is true, to which Putin laughed and said: “Over my tenure, I’ve gotten used to attacks from all kinds of angles and from all kinds of areas, under all kinds of pretext and reasons, and of different caliber and fierceness, and none of it surprises me.” Simmons pressed further, naming political opponents of Putin’s who’ve been killed, and Putin responded: “Look, you know, I don’t want to come across as being rude, but this looks like some kind of indigestion except that it’s verbal indigestion. You’ve mentioned many individuals who indeed suffered and perished at different points in time for various reasons, at the hands of different individuals.” .@KeirSimmons asks Vladimir Putin if he’s a killer 👇🏻 Over the years, a number of Putin critics have been killed or sickened or have died in mysterious ways. British intelligence linked Russia to the 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in a bold attack on foreign soil. In the interview with NBC, Simmons asked Putin to compare Biden to former President Donald Trump — whom critics accused of being soft on Russia — and Putin replied by calling Trump “talented” and “a colorful individual.” Biden is “radically different from Trump,” Putin said, because he is a “career man” who “spent virtually his entire adulthood in politics.” “It is my great hope that yes, there are some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements on behalf of the sitting U.S. president,” Putin said. Biden and Putin are expected to meet in person at a summit in Geneva on June 16 amid heightened tensions between the two countries. The Biden administration has sanctioned Russia in response to the Russian government’s interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as well as its alleged role in the SolarWinds cyberattack, in which hackers accessed the data of several U.S. agencies and dozens of private companies. The Biden administration has also criticized Russia over its alleged poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is now imprisoned. Just weeks after taking office earlier this year, Biden said that he’d communicated to the Russian president in a call that the U.S. would not be “rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyber-attacks, poisoning citizens.” Trump was often called out for being too friendly with Putin, even as U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in an effort to aid Trump’s win. Biden is currently in Britain for a meeting with the Group of Seven leaders, including U.S. allies Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.",4.195507968600434,4.150816133586338,0.04469183501409546,24

Scientists have revived a handful of tiny, multicellular, freshwater creatures known as bdelloid rotifers after they spent 24,000 years frozen in Siberian permafrost. The findings, published Monday in the journal Current Biology, indicate the creatures can survive in a state of crytobiosis — where an animal responds to environmental stresses by essentially drying itself out and entering a dormant state — much longer than previously known. Earlier studies found bdelloid rotifers could survive extreme cold in a cryptobiotic state for at least six to 10 years. “Our report is the hardest proof as of today that multicellular animals could withstand tens of thousands of years in cryptobiosis, the state of almost completely arrested metabolism,” Stas Malavin, a co-author of the study and a researcher at Russia’s Institute of Physicochemical and Biological Problems in Soil Science, said in a press statement. For this new study, scientists took 11.5-foot-deep core samples from the Alazeya River in northeastern Siberia, where isolated microbes, including rotifers, were found frozen and dormant. Carbon-dating of the core indicates the rotifers were around 24,000 years old and had been trapped in the frozen soil since the Pleistocene epoch, which ended roughly 11,700 years ago. Once thawed, the creatures came back to life and began reproducing via parthenogenesis, an asexual process that creates clones of the original. “We revived animals that saw woolly mammoths,” Malavin told The New York Times, “which is quite impressive.” Although there’s no doubting the durability of the rotifer, the title of longest nap goes to the nematode. In 2018, scientists revived some of the microscopic worms ― also yanked out of the Siberian permafrost ― that had been frozen for 42,000 years.",4.829584663058703,5.490200641927433,-0.66061597886873,5

CNN said Monday it obtained audio of the July 2019 phone call between Giuliani and U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker, and Andriy Yermak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The audio shows how aggressive Giuliani, who was serving as President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, was in trying to secure the Ukrainian leader’s support for a bogus investigation into then-Democratic presidential candidate Biden. “All we need from the president [Zelensky] is to say, ‘I’m gonna put an honest prosecutor in charge, he’s gonna investigate and dig up the evidence, that presently exists and is there any other evidence about involvement of the 2016 election,’ and then the Biden thing has to be run out,” Giuliani said. ” ... Somebody in Ukraine’s gotta take that seriously.” Listen to the audio on CNN here. The 40-minute call took place just days before the discussion in which Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to “do us a favor” and announce an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had been on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The call with Zelensky became central to the House’s first vote to impeach Trump for attempting to pressure Ukraine to come up with dirt on his political rival in exchange for the release of U.S. military aid. Some details from the call were made public after Time magazine published a transcript earlier this year, but CNN’s audio stresses the extent of Giuliani’s pressure campaign. BuzzFeed News also published transcripts in April. “That would clear the air really well,” Giuliani says at one point to Yermak about an announcement of an investigation. Zelensky had been hoping for a diplomatic visit to the U.S., which Giuliani said could be fast-tracked with the Ukrainian’s support. “And I think it would make it possible for me to come and make it possible, I think, for me to talk to the president [Trump] to see what I can do about making sure that whatever misunderstandings are put aside ... I kinda think that this could be a good thing for having a much better relationship,” Giuliani says in the call. Despite the end of Trump’s presidency, Giuliani has remained at the center of federal investigations. The New York Times reported last month that prosecutors were looking into whether Ukraine meddled in the 2020 presidential election in part by funneling misinformation through the attorney (Giuliani has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but he was a major spokesman for Trump’s attacks on Biden and his son during the campaign).

The Michigan-born “Under Siege” star, a friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Saturday announced he’d joined the A Just Russia — Patriots — For Truth party. Seagal, 69, revealed his party membership at a news conference, where he called for a crackdown on companies “defiling the environment.” “Without being able to arrest people, when we just fine them, they are probably making more money off the production of the things that are defiling the environment,” Seagal said, according to Reuters. Putin granted Seagal Russian citizenship in November 2016. Since 2018, he’s has been Moscow’s goodwill ambassador to the U.S. The unpaid role assists “the development and implementation of various projects for bilateral cooperation in the field of culture, arts, science, education, sports, public and youth exchanges,” according to Russian’s Foreign Ministry. Seagal is also involved “in the preservation of memorial sites in the US that are somehow connected with Russia” and “research into and the promotion of the Russian America legacy,” the ministry said in 2018. Seagal previously denied Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, saying anyone who believes it happened is “stupid.” U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Putin directed Russian efforts to get Donald Trump into the White House.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tweeted a Russian military video in a highly controversial message last week that has been traced by a propaganda expert to Hungary’s extreme right-wing. It was also circulated among American white supremacists before Cruz took it mainstream a week after its birth, Alexander Reid Ross told Business Insider. Ross is a fellow at the British Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right who specializes in mapping the spread of far-right propaganda. Cruz last week posted a video extolling Russia’s brutish he-man troops that was juxtaposed against a U.S. Army recruitment video featuring a woman. “Holy crap,” snapped Cruz. “Perhaps a woke, emasculated military is not the best idea,” he tweeted in a pointed dig at American troops. He later tweeted that U.S. troops were at risk of becoming “pansies.” Holy crap.Perhaps a woke, emasculated military is not the best idea.... Cruz’s message, illustrated by the melded video uploaded to TikTok, was strikingly similar to a message that first surfaced in Hungary earlier this month, Ross pointed out to Insider. Twitter account Koskovics Zoltán, belonging to Zoltán Koskovics, an analyst at the Center for Fundamental Rights in Budapest, posted two tweets comparing the Russian and U.S. military films, slamming the American film, just as Cruz did, as “woke.” The “Fundamental Rights” center is linked to the far-right government of Hungary’s strongman Prime Minister Victor Orban, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “None of this fills me with any optimism regarding the West’s future,” Koskovics tweeted May 13. This is the woke US Army ad. If you havent seen it yet, do. Decent artwork. This is a Russian Army recruitment ad. Compare it with the new American Army commercial. None of this fills me with any optimism regarding the #West's future. The tweets were picked up by Russian outlet Krasnava Vesnva and the conservative U.S. blog Red State, Insider reported. The two videos were also discussed by Gavin McInnes, founder of the violent right-wing Proud Boys, on his YouTube channel May 15. The two films were finally melded in the TikTok post that Cruz boosted to the mainstream in his May 20 tweet after it made the rounds of U.S. white supremacist forums on Telegram and among international extremists including Russia’s ultra-nationalist National Bolsheviks, according to Insider. After a furious reaction to Cruz’s disdainful dismissal of the U.S. military from American veterans, citizens and active-duty service members, the senator insisted in a tweet that Americans were the “finest fighting force on the face of the planet.” As for complaints on Twitter that he was being a shill for Putin after helping promote Kremlin propaganda about its mighty forces, Cruz (who never served in the military) responded: “I hate Communists.” Neither Russia nor Hungary are communist nations. Russia is Communist now? Ted, what year do you think it is?You're being accused of being a stooge for right-wing authoritarians. ""I hate communists"" isn't exactly germane. Ross told Insider that the core message of the video is that liberalism is making the U.S. weak, in comparison with the strength of Putin’s traditionalist, and authoritarian, Russia. “The U.S. far-right picks up on pro-Kremlin propaganda, because it agrees with efforts to undermine liberalism,” Ross said. HuffPost has reached out to Cruz for comment. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified the platform where people were sharing the videos.

Journalist Raman Pratasevich was arrested Sunday after Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko ordered a fighter jet to intercept the 123-person passenger plane Pratasevich was traveling on. The government forced it to land in the Belarusian capital of Minsk, where Pratasevich and his girlfriend were taken into custody. Belarusian authorities claimed a bomb threat had been made about the plane, forcing its landing, but officials found no explosives. European Union leaders quickly agreed to place sanctions on Belarus ― including banning the country’s airlines from using EU airspace. President Joe Biden also joined international leaders in calls for sanctions against Belarus. “The United States joins countries around the world in calling for his release, as well as for the release of the hundreds of political prisoners who are being unjustly detained by the Lukashenko regime,” Biden said. But as the U.S. and European countries have made promises not to travel into Belarusian airspace, Russia ― a key ally of Belarus ― has started denying entry to its own country if flights have avoided Belarus to get there. On Wednesday, Air France cancelled multiple Paris-Moscow flights after Russia declined to approve new routes that would have bypassed Belarus. Austrian Airlines also had at least two flights cancelled after Russia denied it entry over an updated flight plan that would have skipped Belarus.

The Times, which was the first to report on the investigation, said prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn opened a criminal investigation into the matter during the last months of the Trump administration. At its center, investigators are trying to determine if current and former Ukrainian officials spread claims of corruption about then-candidate Joe Biden during the 2020 campaign in an attempt to bolster Trump’s reelection bid. It’s unclear if any Ukrainians will be charged as part of the investigation. Giuliani was one of Trump’s megaphones during his reelection campaign, and the former New York mayor regularly accused Biden and his son Hunter of corruption. The attacks became key elements of Trump’s campaign. The investigation is separate from the one in the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, which is focused on Giuliani’s work for the Trump administration and if he lobbied to remove Marie Yovanovitch from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in 2019 because officials in Kyiv wanted her fired. The FBI executed search warrants at Giuliani’s home and office in April, seizing his computers and cellphones in a dramatic escalation in their investigation. Giuliani has not been accused of any wrongdoing in that investigation and has denied any impropriety. The Times added that he is also not the subject of the Brooklyn probe. Ukraine is an ongoing flashpoint in the 2020 race and a cloud over Trump’s tenure in the White House. He was impeached for the first time over his efforts to pressure the country into investigating the Bidens in exchange for the release of U.S. military aid.

Holy crap.Perhaps a woke, emasculated military is not the best idea....

In an Instagram post on Friday afternoon, the 24th day of his hunger strike, Navalny said he will continue to demand a visit from his doctor to address a loss of sensation in his legs and arms ― the main demand the politician announced when launched his hunger strike. But he said he would stop the strike after having been examined by non-prison doctors, something he called “a huge progress.” “Thanks to the huge support of good people across the country and around the world, we have made huge progress,” Navalny said in his message. “Two months ago, my requests for medical help were prompting smirks. I wasn’t given any medications....Thanks to you, now I have been examined by a concilium of civilian doctors twice.” Navalny said he would start “coming out of the hunger strike” on Friday and the process of ending it will take 24 days. The 44-year-old politician, who was arrested earlier this year and is serving a 2 ½-year sentence, began the hunger strike on March 31 to protest prison authorities’ refusal to let his doctors visit after he developed severe back pain and numbness in his legs. Officials insisted Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs, but Navalny said he received effectively no treatment. On Wednesday night, another round of mass protests demanding his freedom swept across Russia. A top aide said Wednesday night’s protests seemed to have brought a compromise from Russian authorities on getting Navalny the medical help he had demanded when launching the hunger strike. Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin’s most well-known critic, was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin — accusations that Russian officials reject.",5.6217439438446375,3.3890909419110256,2.232653001933612,8

The head of a doctors alliance posted the results of Navalny’s blood tests on Twitter, saying they indicate kidney damage that could lead to heart failure, Bloomberg reported. Navalny, 44, returned to his home country in January after he was treated in a German hospital for nerve-agent poisoning, believed by American intelligence to have been carried out by Russia’s Federal Security Service. Navalny was immediately detained and sentenced to 30 months in the notorious IK-2 prison camp for breaking parole by pursuing medical treatment in Germany. Tens of thousands of Russians protested his imprisonment, leading to the arrest of some 11,000 supporters. After he began suffering mysterious new leg and back pain behind bars that he feared may have been linked to his poisoning, he went on a hunger strike March 31 in a desperate bid to pressure officials to allow trustworthy medical care from outside the prison system and President Vladimir Putin’s control. “What else could I do?” he wrote at one point. “I have declared a hunger strike demanding that they allow a visit by an invited doctor in compliance with the law.” Russian prison officials have insisted that Navalny has received all necessary treatment. Alexey @Navalny’s team is ringing the alarm bells today, saying that his health has deteriorated so much from an 18-day hunger strike that “he could die at any moment.” They are begging people not to be silent.  Heartbreaking, from daughter of @navalny Navalny's life is in Putin's hands right now. If Putin allows Navalny to die in prison, no believer in human rights -- no believer in right and wrong -- should ever meet with Putin again. Period.

2021-04-15,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paul-manafort-russian-agent_n_6078b5d9e4b001abc4d9d005,Russian Agent Crony Of Ex-Trump Campaign Boss Paul Manafort Fed Poll Data To Moscow,"A longtime associate of Donald Trump’s former campaign manager and convicted felon Paul Manafort was a Russian agent who fed election data on U.S. citizens to the Kremlin, the Treasury Department announced Thursday. Konstantin Kilimnik, a “known Russian Intelligence Services agent,” was one of 16 individuals and 16 entities sanctioned Thursday by the Biden administration for carrying out “Russian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election,” according to a White House fact sheet. During the 2016 presidential election, Kilimnik also provided the Russian Intelligence Services with “sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy,” noted the Treasury Department statement. To distract attention from the true culprit, he promoted the false narrative that Ukraine — not Russia — had meddled in the election, according to officials. The new economic sanctions are also aimed at punishing Moscow for the massive SolarWinds cyberattack on U.S. government agencies and major companies, and its ongoing occupation and “severe human rights abuses” in Crimea. But the statement on the sanctions was the first time officials have drawn a line directly from the Trump campaign to Russian intelligence. “So much for the ‘Russian hoax’ hoax,” noted a headline in The Washington Post, referring to former President Donald Trump’s repeated claim that any such connection was fake. The FBI is currently offering a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to the arrest of Kilimnik. He’s believed to be in Russia. Kilimnik, whose employment as a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant served as cover, worked for years with Manafort, a longtime U.S. Republican political operative and consultant who was Trump’s onetime 2016 campaign manager. Kilimnik was variously described as a fixer, office manager and translator in his work with Manafort. Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, accused Manafort of lying about providing election data to Kilimnik to feed to Russian intelligence. Trump denied knowing of any such arrangement. Kilimnik was indicted in 2017 with Manafort on U.S. federal charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice regarding lobbying work. That work was related to Kilimnik and Manafort’s efforts to restore former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, who was backed by the Kremlin, to power. Manafort was later convicted of eight felonies, including bank and tax fraud, and was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. Trump pardoned him in December, declaring him an innocent victim of “perhaps the greatest witch hunt in American history.” The U.S. statement on sanctions said the Russia Foreign Intelligence Department was responsible for the SolarWinds cyberattack, which managed to access some of Microsoft’s source code. Besides the 32 entities and individuals sanctioned for links to Kremlin-directed meddling in the 2020 election, six Russian tech companies are also being sanctioned for supporting the Russian Intelligence Services’ cyber program. Another eight individuals and entities are being sanctioned for repression in the Crimea. As part of the U.S. action, 10 Russian diplomats in Washington will be expelled and will have 30 days to leave, sources told CNN.

He was 23 years old. It was August 2014, and he’d returned home from Russia, where he was living and working, for his upcoming wedding. One day while out shopping, he was stopped by the Tajik KGB, who brought him in for questioning. At their offices, Muhammad says, he was interrogated for nearly six hours, verbally abused and accused of being an anti-government extremist, simply because he was Muslim. The men set fire to his beard. They visited Muhammad a few months later at his home, he says, where they again accused him of being an extremist. He was beaten, slapped in the face and threatened with arrest on religious extremism charges. From there he fled to Russia, where he encountered yet more anti-Muslim harassment. In 2020, Muhammad ― along with his wife, Aida, and their children ― eventually made it to Mexico, where he hoped they could gain entry to the United States and seek asylum there. But he found himself detained again and separated from his family, this time by the Trump administration’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Muhammad” and “Aida” are pseudonyms; the immigration advocacy group RAICES has shared Muhammad’s full name with HuffPost for the purposes of our investigation. HuffPost has agreed to use aliases in light of the fact that the family’s asylum case is still ongoing. Earlier this month, President Joe Biden issued an executive order to increase refugee admissions to 125,000, a group expected to include many people fleeing violence, humanitarian crises and persecution ― people like Muhammad and his family. The order is Biden’s first step in rebuilding the country’s refugee program after a series of blows implemented by former President Donald Trump, who spent years demonizing refugees and who cut admissions to a record low cap of 15,000. Some experts and advocates have applauded Biden for taking the first step to restoring admissions, but he still faces a series of challenges to undo the years of damage. It is unclear how many Muslims like Muhammad are currently in detention, as ICE does not keep track of immigrants based on religion. However, Muslim detainees across the country have reported and sued over religious maltreatment, including being forced to eat pork and being denied prayer services or the right to head covering. In June 2020, Muhammad and his family presented themselves at a U.S. port of entry, seeking asylum. They were apprehended by immigration authorities and processed at Karnes County Residential Center in Texas, Muhammad told HuffPost via a translator in January. The family was interviewed by an asylum officer who determined they had a positive credible fear, the first step needed in an asylum application to establish that an individual faces persecution or torture back in their country of origin. The family was due to be released after the findings, but immigration officials only released Aida, who was pregnant at the time, and their children. Muhammad was denied release and transferred to an adult detention center in Laredo, Texas. Officials told him they needed to verify more information. But according to his lawyers, immigration officials suspected Muhammad of posing a danger to the community for the same reason he was persecuted to begin with: He was Muslim. The pervasive influence of Islamophobia in the American immigration system has compounded into a series of challenges for Muslim immigrants like Muhammad, who say they are not given a chance to prove their asylum cases because of preconceived notions about their faith. For decades, Muslim immigrants have been targeted by structural and institutional barriers implemented through immigration laws, which were only amplified in the post-9/11 era. Issues of racial profiling and religious discrimination were further exacerbated from 2017 onward, as Trump put anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment at the center of his presidency. And while Biden has taken the first steps to reverse many of Trump’s anti-immigrant policies, researchers and experts say the damage has already been done, and may take months if not years to undo. “Islam is viewed as inherently inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, which means that Islam is not viewed as a religion or a faith, but as a race and a hostile political ideology, rather than the diverse ethnic and racial identities that Muslims hold,” said Nahid Soltanzadeh, a digital organizer at MPower Change, a grassroots Muslim-led advocacy organization. Muslim immigrants are automatically seen as potential risks, rather than human beings fleeing persecution, Soltanzadeh said, making it more challenging for immigrants like Muhammad to contend with a system that is biased against them. “[Immigration officials] decided that the persecution that he suffered made him a national security threat and a potential terrorist threat ― which was very, very alarming, because that was the abuse that he was suffering and that was how they were persecuting him as a young Muslim man,” said Nicole Morgan, associate attorney in the family detention division of RAICES, who is representing the family. The excess of misinformation concerning immigration and Islamophobia, particularly under the Trump administration, made it nearly impossible for asylum-seekers to have a fair chance in immigration court and with the public, Morgan said. Meanwhile, the increased power granted to ICE and immigration authorities allowed them to act on preconceived notions with impunity. “The average American doesn’t even know who these people are, because they’re being fed a lie and a misrepresentation of our clients,” Morgan said. “If they met them or even heard a tenth of their story, they would open their homes to them, let alone our country.” Human rights and religious freedoms have had a volatile history in Tajikistan since the collapse of the Soviet Union, involving issues of media censorship, a crackdown on government critics and the country’s uneasy relationship with its own Islamic roots. Over the years, the government has made various attempts to restrict religious practice. In 2009, the government passed a law formalizing a ban on female students wearing the hijab. In 2011, authorities banned anyone under 18 years of age from attending any kind of religious service. The government began to close down unregistered mosques throughout the country. According to the State Department’s 2019 Report on International Religious Freedom, the U.S. government has recognized the pervasive harassment Muslims face in Tajikistan and the curtailing of religious freedoms there. In 2016, the report designated Tajikistan a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act, a status it has held through the publication of the 2019 report, the most recent. The State Department’s report for Russia is no better, noting that the Russian government has the power to prohibit the activity of religious associations for “violating public order or engaging in ‘extremist activity.’” The human rights situation in Tajikistan took a turn for the worse after the government banned an opposition party in 2015 and declared it a terrorist organization without credible evidence, according to Human Rights Watch. The government perceived devout Muslims as being associated with political groups that threatened the power of the current government, said Syinat Sultanalieva, the Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. Authorities harassed women wearing hijabs and men with beards. Mosques and religious centers were subjected to police raids, surveillance and forced closures ― an attempt by government officials to regulate Islam for extremist activities, despite outcry from critics that such regulations were politically motivated and a clear violation of personal religious freedoms. Once Muhammad heard rumors that the government was targeting his local mosque amid its crackdown, he stopped going, fearing retaliation. In 2013, those rumors were proven true after police raided his sister’s home, arrested his sister and her husband, and shut down their center. By then, Muhammad had just moved to Russia, where he was a dual citizen, looking for safety and work. In November 2014, Muhammad and Aida moved to Russia, but even there the harassment by the Tajik officials didn’t stop. Muhammad says the men frequently visited his parents’ home, demanding they call their son and coerce him back to Tajikistan. But Muhammad couldn’t return. He knew he’d be arrested immediately, he said. He changed his number to evade the Tajik security forces’ calls and threats. He found work as a delivery driver in 2015 for a dairy company. Aida gave birth to a daughter in October 2015, and a son in October 2017. For a while, life became normal again. One November evening in 2017, Muhammad and Aida held an Islamic baby shower, a welcoming ceremony traditionally held after a birth, with close friends and family. Two hours into the celebration, Russian police officers showed up and told them their religious ceremony was against the law. The officers searched the house and the guests and arrested Muhammad and Aida. The couple was interrogated. Aida, who did not speak Russian, was forced to sign a document admitting she violated public order. She was released, but Muhammad was held several more days and interrogated about his Islamic beliefs. Russian police confiscated his Quran as supposed evidence of his extremism, an allegation that Muhammad found astonishing. Muhammad says he was slapped, shocked with a stun gun and deprived of sleep over the course of three days by Russian authorities who accused him of wanting to join and recruit for ISIS ― all of which he vehemently denied. He handed over his cellphone and social media login information, in hopes that the police would clear him of wrongdoing. Eventually, Muhammad signed papers he was not allowed to read, and was released. But the harassment didn’t stop. He says Russian police tracked him everywhere he went, calling every month demanding to know his whereabouts. They showed up at his house and searched it without a warrant. Law enforcement and members of the Russian government stopped him in the streets and asked him who he was visiting. They were always watching, they told him. In March 2018, Muhammad says, he was taken again to the police station, where he was handcuffed with other men who he assumes were also Muslim. He watched the police beat these men and drag them out of the room. He never saw the men again. Muhammad was also beaten and shocked several times, he says. The officers accused him again of being an ISIS member. Muhammad denied the accusations and told them he denounced extremism in all forms. After days of interrogation and torture, Muhammad was coerced into signing more paperwork and was eventually released. Deniz Yuksel, Turkey advocacy specialist at Amnesty International USA, told HuffPost that the Russian government has persecuted religious minorities like Muslims and Jehovah’s Witnesses, and that Muhammad’s case dovetails with what is known about the deterioration of religious freedom there. The crackdown on religious minority groups is “part of a broader attack by the government on communities and ideologies that they believe are either in opposition to them directly politically, or opposition to the traditional Orthodox Christian values,” Yuksel said. The police never stopped harassing and torturing Muhammad, who tried to clear his name each time he was apprehended. He says he filed a complaint against the officers who tortured him, without any success. Instead, the harassment escalated. The police continued to search his home unexpectedly. He began to receive calls from unknown numbers, from people who spewed Islamophobic insults at him and mocked his Tajik background. “They never left us to live peacefully. Always calling, always watching,” said Aida, who told HuffPost she knew they were targeted due to their Muslim faith. “Especially because we were practicing Muslims. My husband had a beard and I wore a scarf, so you can clearly see that we are practicing Muslims,” she said. She was worried that any day her husband would be taken away and unfairly jailed. In August 2018, Aida’s Russian residency was canceled, and was only reinstated after the couple hired a lawyer. They moved to a new city, hoping to evade police, but were eventually found. During the last round of threatening calls and visits, members of law enforcement told Muhammad that sooner or later, he was going to be put in jail for extremism ― in retaliation for the complaint he’d filed against them. It was at that moment that Muhammad realized he couldn’t stay in Russia any longer. In August 2019, Muhammad, Aida and their two children abandoned everything they had and began their journey to Mexico ― and to their final destination, America. Although most migrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border are from Central America or Mexico, there has been an increase of migrants from other continents. According to numbers gathered by the Mexican government, more than 670,000 migrants from Asia entered Mexico through legal ports of entry in 2019. Most extra-continental migrants arrive in Central and South American countries due to their lax visa requirements, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration think tank. Muhammad and his family arrived in Mexico in August 2019, where they were detained by Mexican immigration for three months. Via a translator, Aida told HuffPost the conditions in the detention facility were unbearable for her and her children. She was separated from her husband, and one of her children got sick from the lack of heat and hot water, she says. After they were released from detention, they rented an apartment for six months and worked to save money. In June 2020, they crossed into America at the Calexico Port of Entry, seeking asylum. The family was processed at Karnes County Residential Center in Texas, and a month later, Aida and the children were released. Muhammad, however, was detained and transferred to the Laredo Detention Center. Suffering from kidney malfunction and stomach pains, Muhammad’s health grew worse in detention. He was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, diabetes and a possible autoimmune disorder, according to his lawyers. His kidney pain became more severe, and he dealt with urinary incontinence, weight loss and bladder pain. Each time, he was only given painkillers and not treated for the underlying conditions. In July, Muhammad tested positive for the coronavirus. “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is committed to ensuring the welfare of all those in the agency’s custody, including providing access to necessary and appropriate medical care,” an ICE spokesperson told HuffPost in an emailed statement. “Comprehensive medical care is provided to all individuals in custody.” Detainees with medical conditions “can expect timely and appropriate responses to emergent medical requests, and timely medical care appropriate to the anticipated length of detention,” the spokesperson wrote. Muhammad told HuffPost that he was served pork ― which many Muslims don’t eat, in accordance with their faith ― and denied halal food, often forcing him to go without a meal, which exacerbated his health conditions. “Him being a young Muslim man and the Islamophobia that has just permeated our politics and our immigration system, he is absolutely suffering from that,” said Morgan, the RAICES attorney. “[The U.S. government] has no evidence or even a credible reason to believe he’s a threat to the United States, but yet they’re treating him with such hostility.” The ICE spokesperson told HuffPost that people “held at the centers receive three meals daily using menus developed by a registered dietician, who ensure individual unique health (included allergies), dietary, and religious needs are met.” Muhammad was denied parole four times in 2020 ― once in July, twice in October and again in December. Aida was worried constantly. “We thought this would be the safest place where we could come and find our protection,” she told HuffPost. The couple spoke on the phone nearly every day, Muhammad from detention and Aida from a San Antonio church that was sponsoring her and her children and giving them a place to stay. In January, Aida gave birth to their third child, a baby girl, without her husband by her side. Their 5-year-old daughter and their 3-year-old son asked their mother every day where their father was. She didn’t know how to answer them, so the children started to ask members of the church. “My kids are suffering. It’s stress and constant torture to not know where their father is,” Muhammad said. “It’s painful for me to know that my kids think I’ve disappeared.” On Friday, Feb. 5, Muhammad received a note telling him to call his lawyer. His heart sank. He thought something was wrong ― either with his case or his family. But his lawyers had good news: He was being released. At first, he couldn’t believe what he’d heard. The news shocked him to the point where he was physically unable to speak and his lawyer thought the line had disconnected. Instead of talking, Muhammad broke down in sobs. A few days later, Muhammad was released and made his way to the San Antonio shelter to reunite with his family. As he approached, he saw his son playing with toys, but his son didn’t recognize him. Soon, Aida came sprinting over. The couple embraced for the first time in months. Neither of them spoke between the hugs and kisses. They couldn’t find the words. Between congratulations from members of the church and shelter, and after downing a glass of fruit juice, Muhammad met his newborn daughter for the first time. He held her in his arms and apologized tearfully to her, over and over, for missing her birth. He swore to her, and the rest of his children, to make up for the lost time. He promised his elder daughter he would teach her how to draw and paint ― a new hobby she has picked up. He promised Aida he would never leave her side again. ICE confirmed to HuffPost that Muhammad was released on Feb. 8, but did not elaborate on his case or explain what prompted the sudden change. Muhammad, now 30, said he hopes immigration officials will finally view his faith as a religion like any other and not believe the xenophobic stereotypes. After all, he said, it was his faith that kept him hopeful during his time in detention. “We’re glad that pressure from the public and a coalition of advocates in support of [Muhammad] has forced ICE to make the right decision and release him to be with his family,” said Laila Ayub, the special projects attorney at RAICES’ family detention services program. “Nonetheless, [Muhammad]’s case is an example of the xenophobia, Islamophobia, criminalization, and family separation inherent to immigration enforcement,” Ayub said. “The immigration system, even under the Biden administration, permits ICE to justify the detention of someone like [Muhammad] under the guise of national security. ICE’s analysis of public safety and national security is a superficial one rooted in white supremacy, and people like [Muhammad] are still at risk of detention and deportation even under the Biden administration’s new enforcement policies.” For now, Muhammad says he feels “bottomless gratitude” for his lawyers, the church members who cared for his family, and others. He wants to thank them “for giving me my life back and giving my children their father back.”",4.2770135669632845,4.650545568378796,-0.37353200141551124,5

An investigation by Bellingcat, CNN and Navalny himself found that members of the Russian FSB security service sneaked into Navalny’s hotel room in August and applied a lethal nerve agent to a pair of his underpants. (Russia has denied the claim.) Navalny, 44, repeatedly returned to the poisoning in his remarks, according to an English translation provided by the Russian news outlet Meduza. “I mortally offended him by surviving,” Navalny said. “And then I committed an even more serious offense: I didn’t run and hide.” “[Putin will] go down in history as nothing but a poisoner. We all remember Alexander the Liberator and Yaroslav the Wise. Well, now we’ll have Vladimir the Underpants Poisoner,” Navalny continued, referring to Alexander II, a 19th-century czar of Russia, and Yaroslav I, an 11th-century grand prince of Kiev. Massive protests swept Russia following Navalny’s arrest, spurred in part by a video investigation released by his organization that disclosed a secret billion-dollar palace Putin has allegedly built for himself on the Black Sea. Police detained more than 5,750 people this past Sunday. More than 1,900 of those were in Moscow, the most since the Soviet era, according to the Associated Press. Under Putin, Navalny said, “lawlessness and tyranny [have] become the essence of a political system.” “I hope very much that people won’t look at this trial as a signal that they should be more afraid,” he added, encouraging Russians to continue to protest. “This [trial] isn’t a demonstration of strength — it’s a show of weakness. You can’t lock up millions and hundreds of thousands of people. I hope very much that people will realize this. And they will. Because you can’t lock up the whole country.” Navalny was originally arrested at the request of Russia’s penitentiary service for violating the terms of a probation agreement from a 2014 money-laundering conviction he says was politically driven. His legal team argued that he was justifiably unable to satisfy the requirements of his probation, including registering in person with authorities, while he was lying in a coma in Germany recovering from the poisoning.",3.6334286658024992,4.012657184180722,-0.3792285183782229,8
2021-02-02,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/russia-sputnik-v-vaccine-effective-covid-19_n_601965bac5b6bde2f5c31158,"Russia's Sputnik V Vaccine 92% Effective In Fighting COVID-19, Study Says","MOSCOW (Reuters) — Scientists gave Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine the green light on Tuesday saying it was almost 92% effective in fighting COVID-19 based on peer-reviewed late-stage trial results published in The Lancet international medical journal. Experts said the Phase III trial results meant the world had another effective weapon to fight the deadly pandemic and justified to some extent Moscow’s decision to roll out the vaccine before final data had been released. The results, collated by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow that developed and tested the vaccine, were in line with efficacy data reported at earlier stages of the trial, which has been running in Moscow since September. “The development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticized for unseemly haste, corner-cutting, and an absence of transparency,” said Ian Jones, professor at the University of Reading, and Polly Roy, professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated,” the scientists, who were not involved in the study, said in a comment shared by The Lancet. “Another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of COVID-19.” The results were based on data from 19,866 volunteers, of whom a quarter received a placebo, the researchers, led by the Gamaleya Institute’s Denis Logunov, said in The Lancet. Since the trial began in Moscow, there were 16 recorded cases of symptomatic COVID-19 among people who received the vaccine, and 62 among the placebo group, the scientists said. This showed that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine — two shots based on two different viral vectors, administered 21 days apart — was 91.6% effective against symptomatic COVID-19. The Sputnik V vaccine is the fourth worldwide to have Phase III results published in leading peer-reviewed medical journals following the shots developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca. Pfizer’s shot had the highest efficacy rate at 95%, closely followed by Moderna’s vaccine and Sputnik V while AstraZeneca’s vaccine had an average efficacy of 70%. Sputnik V has also now been approved for storage in normal fridges, as opposed to freezers, making transportation and distribution easier, Gamaleya scientists said on Tuesday. Russia approved the vaccine in August, before the large-scale trial had begun, saying it was the first country to do so for a COVID-19 shot. It named it Sputnik V, in homage to the world’s first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union. Small numbers of frontline health workers began receiving it soon after and a large-scale roll out started in December, though access was limited to those in specific professions, such as teachers, medical workers and journalists. In January, the vaccine was offered to all Russians. “Russia was right all along,” Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is responsible for marketing the vaccine abroad, told reporters on Tuesday. He said the results supported Russia’s decision to begin administering Sputnik V to frontline workers while the trial was still underway, and suggested skepticism of such moves was politically motivated. “The Lancet did very unbiased work despite some of the political pressures that may have been out there,” he said. The number of people vaccinated in Russia has remained low so far. Authorities have pointed to some early issues with scaling up production while polls have shown low demand among Russians for the vaccine. Russia has already shared data from its Phase III trial with regulators in several countries and has begun the process of submitting it to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for approval in the European Union, Dmitriev said. The data release comes as Europe scrambles to secure enough shots for its 450 million citizens due to production cuts by AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The U.S. roll-out, meanwhile, has been hampered by the need to store shots in ultra-cold freezers and uneven planning across states. There were 2,144 volunteers over 60 in the Sputnik V trial and the shot was shown to be 91.8% effective when tested on this older group, with no serious side-effects reported that could be associated with the vaccine, The Lancet summary said. RDIF’s Dimitriev also said the Gamaleya Institute was testing the vaccine against new variants of COVID-19 and the early signs were positive. The vaccine was also found to be 100% effective against moderate or severe COVID-19, as there were no such cases among the group of 78 participants who were infected and symptomatic at 21 days after the first shot was administered. Four deaths of participants occurred, but none was considered associated with vaccination, The Lancet said. “The efficacy looks good, including in the over 60s,” said Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London. “It’s good to have another addition to the global arsenal.” The authors of the study noted that because COVID-19 cases were only detected when trial participants reported symptoms, further research was needed to understand Sputnik V’s efficacy on asymptomatic cases and transmission. Sputnik V has been approved by 15 countries, including Argentina, Hungary and the United Arab Emirates and this will rise to 25 by the end of next week, the RDIF’s Dmitriev said. The sovereign wealth fund also said vaccinations using Sputnik V will begin in a dozen countries including Bolivia, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Iran. Hungary was the first member of the European Union to break ranks and unilaterally approve the vaccine last month. It is set to receive a first batch of 40,000 doses on Tuesday. Germany has said it would use Sputnik V if it is approved by Europe’s drug regulator while France has said it could buy any efficient vaccine. However, large shipments of the shot have only been sent so far to Argentina, which has received enough doses to vaccinate about 500,000 people. “Now all doubts are cleared up,” Argentine Science Minister Roberto Salvarezza told local radio station La Red, citing “the confirmation in a prestigious scientific publication.” Production for export will primarily be done by RDIF’s manufacturing partners abroad, the fund has said. On Tuesday, Dmitriev said production had started in India and South Korea, and would launch in China this month. Trial doses have also been produced by a manufacturer in Brazil. Russia is conducting a small-scale clinical trial of a one-dose version of the vaccine, which developers expect to have an efficacy rate of 73% to 85%.

The White House did not immediately confirm the Kremlin’s announcement but said President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed the issue by telephone and agreed that their teams work urgently to complete the extension by Feb. 5, when the treaty expires. Signed in 2010, the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) is a cornerstone of global arms control. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads deployed by the United States and Russia to 1,550 each as well as the number of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers that deliver them. The Kremlin declared the breakthrough, which was widely anticipated, in a statement announcing that Putin and Biden had spoken for the first time since Biden took office on Jan. 20. Moscow and Washington had failed to agree an extension under former U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration had wanted to attach conditions to a renewal that Moscow rejected. The Kremlin said Putin and Biden “expressed satisfaction” that diplomatic notes between the two nations had been exchanged earlier on Tuesday confirming the pact would be extended and that procedures required for the pact to come into force before it expires would be completed in the coming days. The White House, in its description of the call, did not say that an agreement had been reached or that diplomatic notes had been exchanged, though its tone was upbeat. “They discussed both countries’ willingness to extend New START for five years, agreeing to have their teams work urgently to complete the extension by Feb. 5,” the White House said. “They also agreed to explore strategic stability discussions on a range of arms control and emerging security issues.” A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the plan was for the exchange of notes to occur on Tuesday. Asked why Washington had not explicitly said an agreement had been reached, a second U.S. official, also on condition of anonymity, said some steps were needed, including approval by the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament. The treaty itself does not require legislative approval for an extension. The White House said last week Biden would seek a five-year extension. In its statement, the Kremlin said that Putin had told Biden a normalization of relations between Moscow and Washington would be in both countries’ interest. It said the two leaders had also discussed the U.S. decision during Trump’s administration to exit the Open Skies treaty. Putin and Biden also talked about Iran’s nuclear program and the conflict in Ukraine. The White House stressed that it will raise matters where it disagrees with Russia, and said Biden had reaffirmed the United States’ “firm support for Ukraine’s sovereignty”. Biden had raised “other matters of concern” including the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, the cyber hack blamed on Russia that used U.S. tech company SolarWinds Corp as a springboard to penetrate federal government networks, and reports that Russia offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill coalition forces in Afghanistan. “President Biden made clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of its national interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us or our allies,” the White House statement said.

Miller, appointed just two months ago by President Donald Trump, told reporters Thursday on a flight back to Washington that he had “professional respect for how they do things” in Russia. He said the nation had been dealt a “bad hand,” and played it “very, very well.” Miller added: “I kind of, you know, like, professionally, I’m like, wow, they’re doing pretty well, and they’re using a lot of irregular warfare concepts, information, all this stuff, in a way that, you know, like … good on them.” I can’t believe what I just read.The defense secretary actually said this about Russia:“Professionally I’m like, wow, they’re doing pretty well, and they’re using a lot of irregular warfare concepts, information, all this stuff, in a way that, you know, like... good on them.” Miller presumably was not referring to such matters as the poisoning of dissidents. But aggressive efforts by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government and its supporters to utilize social media and other means to sow political discord in the U.S. is a major concern that has been flagged by America’s intelligence community. Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to aid Trump documented by Special Counsel Robert Mueller proved a political drag on much of Trump’s term. The acting defense secretary, a hawkish Special Forces veteran and former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, also said he would have liked to deal with the delays and cost overruns that plagued the Pentagon’s F-35 joint strike fighter and the littoral combat ship programs. But he added: “I cannot wait to leave this job — believe me.” Still, Miller said a “part of me is, like, I would have loved to have gotten involved in the acquisition process and try . . . and you know, talk about wicked problem.” Miller’s thoughts became so mangled at one point the Defense Department’s transcript reads: “Blah blah bluh blah.” The Guardian’s world affairs reporter Julian Borger called it a “gobsmacking incoherent briefing.” Gobsmacking incoherent briefing from the US acting defence secretary, Chris Miller, today.Highlights include ""I cannot wait to leave this job, believe me.""""blah blah bluh blah"" (actual quote according to DoD transcript). contd.. Here’s another Miller nugget: ""The president, SecDef, me…I, whatever the correct English is, you guys can clean that up. Should have paid more attention in high school. My wife would be ashamed of me not knowing the proper preposition—and then, uh General VanHerck."" An unidentified Defense Department official explained Miller’s confounding comments by telling The Washington Post that he “often uses casual and humorous language with reporters ... during travel. That characteristic does not convey well in a written transcript, but was obvious to participants,” the source added. Miller and his entourage were returning from visits to Defense Department sites in Tennessee, Kentucky and Colorado. At some point, Miller is likely to be called on the carpet to answer reports that the Pentagon rebuffed requests for the National Guard to be quickly deployed to respond to the right-wing insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol last week and rampaged through offices hunting for politicians. Inspectors general of the Departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security, and the Interior have launched joint investigations into the Jan. 6 attack and the inadequate response to the dire threat, it was announced Friday. Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz announced today the initiation of a review.  Miller was named to his post in early November after Trump tweeted that he had “terminated” then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had gotten at cross purposes with the president. At the time, retired four-star U.S. Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey called Miller a “perfectly good, experienced combat soldier,” but said he is “unqualified for this office.” McCaffrey warned then that Trump was gearing up to seize the White House with the help of some Pentagon leaders. “There is some crazy thinking going on inside that White House,” he said. The crisis at the top of the Pentagon is just beginning - (DANGER. We are watching a slow moving Trump coup to defy the Biden election and refuse to leave office by diktat. Believe your eyes. This will be a test of our institutions.) Miller’s full comments can be read here.",4.114687192801723,3.3880070030332887,0.7266801897684343,29

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Thursday it was extraordinary that President Donald Trump hasn’t said a single word about the cyberattack on U.S. agencies believed to be orchestrated by the Kremlin. Nor has Trump apparently complained to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a tweet posted on Thursday, Romney called White House inaction and silence inexcusable:  “In this setting, not to have the White House aggressively speaking out and protesting and taking punitive action is really quite extraordinary,” Romney also told Olivier Knox on SiriusXM. The extensive cyberattack hit the U.S. Treasury, Commerce Department, State Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration, which maintains the American stockpile of nuclear weapons. The nation’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said the sophisticated attack raises grave concerns about U.S. safety. And officials said it could take months before the full extent of the attack was known. Romney said the operation exposes the nation’s cyberwarfare readiness as extraordinarily weak, and that Russia thinks “so little of our ability to fight back from a cyber standpoint that they do this with impunity. So our national security is extraordinarily vulnerable,” he added. When White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany was asked Tuesday about the massive hack, she said the White House was “taking a hard look into this,” CNBC reported. In contrast, President-elect Joe Biden put nations that would attack the U.S. on notice and said his administration would make cybersecurity a top priority. “Our adversaries should know that, as president, I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation,” Biden added.",4.589890184946795,3.7857164705462747,0.8041737144005205,3

There is concern within the U.S. intelligence community that the hackers who targeted Treasury and the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration used a similar tool to break into other government agencies, according to four people briefed on the matter. The people did not say which other agencies. Three of the people familiar with the investigation said Russia is currently believed to be behind the attack. Two of the people said that the breaches are connected to a broad campaign that also involved the recently disclosed hack on FireEye, a major U.S. cybersecurity company with government and commercial contracts. “The United States government is aware of these reports and we are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation,” said National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot. The hack is so serious it led to a National Security Council meeting at the White House on Saturday, said one of the people familiar with the matter. The Commerce Department confirmed there was a breach at one of its agencies in a statement. “We have asked the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI to investigate, and we cannot comment further at this time.” The breach presents a major challenge to the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden as officials investigate what information was stolen and try to ascertain what it will be used for. It is not uncommon for large scale cyber investigations to take months or years to complete. “This is a much bigger story than one single agency,” said one of the people familiar with the matter. “This is a huge cyber espionage campaign targeting the U.S. government and its interests.” Hackers broke into the NTIA’s office software, Microsoft’s Office 365. Staff emails at the agency were monitored by the hackers for months, sources said. A Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did a spokesman for the Treasury Department. The hackers are “highly sophisticated” and have been able to trick the Microsoft platform’s authentication controls, according to a person familiar with the incident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the press. “This is a nation state,” said a different person briefed on the matter. The full scope of the breach is unclear. The investigation is still its early stages and involves a range of federal agencies, including the FBI, according to three of the people familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said they have been “working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.” The FBI and U.S. National Security Agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Flynn was accused of “willfully and knowingly” making “materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements” in a Jan. 24, 2017, interview with FBI agents on topics including his past communications with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. He resigned from his post in February 2017, after allegedly also misleading top administration officials about his conversations with Moscow. Trump, limited in his pardoning power by his time left in office, said on Twitter that he pardoned Flynn with the hopes that he and his family “have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving.” It is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving! The former aide pleaded guilty on Dec. 1, 2017. He agreed to cooperate in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, hoping to avoid jail time. But Flynn filed to withdraw that plea earlier this year — after federal prosecutors accused him and his legal counsel of growing increasingly uncooperative and recommended that he serve up to six months in prison. In January, Flynn’s attorneys alleged that he was the victim of a “bad faith” investigation. “Mr. Flynn refused to lie for the prosecution. In pure spite, the government retaliated,” they claimed. “Justice is not a game, and there should be no room for such gamesmanship in the Department of Justice.” Attorney General William Barr ordered an outside prosecutor review of Flynn’s case in February, renewing questions about the Justice Department’s treatment of Trump’s allies. Flynn was the first person who served in Trump’s administration to be charged as part of Mueller’s investigation. Discussion about the limits of the president’s legal authority ― such as Trump’s ability to pardon himself if he were charged with a crime ― has continued since he tweeted about his “complete power to pardon” months after he took office.",4.3831188859947625,3.5004228840482465,0.882696001946516,19

That’s why, in this era of pandemics and closed borders, we’re applying for dual US-Russian citizenship,” Snowden said in a post on Twitter Monday. The 37-year-old, who has been living as a fugitive in Moscow since fleeing the U.S. in 2013, is expecting a child with his wife Lindsay in late December, Reuters reported, citing a Russian news agency. After years of separation from our parents, my wife and I have no desire to be separated from our son. That's why, in this era of pandemics and closed borders, we're applying for dual US-Russian citizenship. “Lindsay and I will remain Americans, raising our son with all the values of the America we love—including the freedom to speak his mind. And I look forward to the day I can return to the States, so the whole family can be reunited,” he added. Snowden has been wanted on espionage charges in the U.S. since leaking troves of secret files which revealed a mass surveillance operation being carried out illegally by the U.S. National Security Agency, where he worked as a contractor. An appeals court in September determined that the NSA’s surveillance program violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and that the U.S. intelligence leaders who had been publicly defending it were not telling the truth. Charges have not been dropped against Snowden, who has secured permanent residency rights in Russia. Though President Donald Trump called Snowden a “terrible traitor” and a “terrible threat” in 2013 and suggested that he should be executed, he said in August that he would “look at” potentially pardoning him. “I’m not that aware of the Snowden situation, but I’m going to start looking at it,” Trump told The New York Post in August. “There are many, many people ― it seems to be a split decision ― many people think that he should somehow be treated differently and other people think he did very bad things, and I’m going to take a very good look at it.” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking House Republican and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, immediately called that potential pardon “unconscionable” and accused Snowden on Twitter of “putting our troops and our nation at risk” when he released the classified information. Her father’s role in pushing the U.S. into the ongoing war in Iraq in 2003, which was based on a false narrative that there existed “weapons of mass destruction,” was not missed by those on Twitter, however.

Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said at a last-minute press conference on Wednesday that both Iran and Russia “had taken specific actions to influence public opinion relating to our elections.” Ratcliffe, a controversial former Republican member of Congress, claimed that Iran sent emails to “damage” President Donald Trump but didn’t specify that Russia was targeting Vice President Joe Biden. Ratcliffe did say that Russia had obtained voter information, just as it had in 2016. “We will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections,” Ratcliffe said. The press conference came after The Washington Post reported that the U.S. government believed Iran was behind threatening emails sent to Democratic voters that purported to be from the Proud Boys, a far-right, neo-fascist organization that has been supportive of Trump. FBI Director Christopher Wray didn’t specify which candidates were being targeted by which countries, but he encouraged Americans to seek information from reliable sources and be “thoughtful” consumers of online information. “You should be confident that your vote counts.

I know that from the briefers. Because he’ll explode and the whole thing will get derailed, because he has this weird affinity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.” Asked why Putin is such a touchy subject, Polymeropoulos said that Trump “wants Putin to like him.” “He doesn’t want to be embarrassed in front of Putin, that’s part of the dilemma,” he said. “Just look at how he behaves with the Queen. That’s how he behaves with everyone who has any glamour and cachet,” he continued, adding, “Putin has everything he doesn’t have.” The former official’s comments bolster a September report from Politico alleging that CIA Director Gina Haspel has been preventing intelligence about Russia from reaching the president’s ears to appease him. The former Soviet republic ran disinformation campaigns to tilt the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Trump’s favor, and Trump has been repeatedly criticized throughout his presidency for his dealings with Putin, which have included at least five secret meetings. Most recently, Trump allies have been accused of playing into the Russians’ hands by accepting and making political hay out of disinformation about Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his family. Ioffe’s in-depth reporting describes the lingering effects of a mysterious attack Polymeropoulos, a former CIA operative, withstood while staying at a Moscow hotel in December 2017. He believes he was hit with the same unknown device that has been aimed at U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China and is believed to be wielded by Russians. Some experts believe the device uses microwaves to target specific individuals or rooms, causing sudden and overwhelming nausea and dizziness. Some victims say the attacks were accompanied by either a high or low buzzing or grinding noise. According to Ioffe, the scope of the attacks is actually much larger than previously known to the public ― CIA agents all over the globe have suffered its effects, which include lasting brain damage ― and, under the Trump administration, the United States is not doing much to stop them. Polymeropoulos alleges that Russia knows Trump “is at war with our intelligence community” and thus feels emboldened to “kick them when they’re down.” The result has reportedly fueled frustration and anger within the U.S. intelligence community.",2.727181989355673,2.6734693452009597,0.05371264415471311,12

The charges involve alleged attacks on Ukrainian electrical power grids and American businesses, as well as hacking campaigns connected to the 2018 Winter Olympics and the 2017 French elections. The charges do not include allegations of attempts to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump has downplayed the threat that Russia poses to the United States, because Russian President Vladimir Putin backs Trump’s re-election. Putin has been supportive of Trump, and the CIA believes he is likely directing efforts to aid Trump’s 2020 campaign. U.S. intelligence officials have said that Russia is using a variety of measures to attack Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s campaign.

One of the members of the newly indicted group was previously indicted by Robert Mueller’s special counsel team.

The intelligence was based on sources and communications showing Giuliani interacted with associates of Russian intelligence in December 2019, when the former New York City mayor was on a trip to Ukraine attempting to gather information to expose supposed corruption by the now-Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, unnamed former officials told the Post. No credible information has surfaced to back the corruption allegations. After national security adviser Robert O’Brien warned Trump in a private conversation that Giuliani could be bringing back Russian misinformation from Ukraine, Trump reportedly dismissed the concerns and said, “That’s Rudy,” a former official told the Post. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said in a statement to HuffPost late Thursday: “National Security Advisor O’Brien and White House Counsel Cipollone meet with the President frequently on a variety of matters. Ambassador O’Brien does not comment on sensitive intelligence topics, or on the advice he provides President Trump. He can say that the President always treats such briefings with the utmost seriousness. The characterization of the meeting as described in this article is not accurate.” The New York Post this week published a thinly sourced article making unverified claims about Biden and his son, citing emails that the newspaper said had come from Giuliani and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The article appeared to have connections to a Russian disinformation campaign. Giuliani has repeatedly pushed unsubstantiated claims about the Bidens and corruption related to Ukraine. The Treasury Department earlier this year identified as a Russian “agent” a Ukrainian man, Andrii Derkach, who Giuliani had met with last year. Derkach was one of several agents attempting to influence U.S. elections, per Treasury. Last year, Giuliani said in an interview that there’s “nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.” The report issued last year by special counsel Robert Mueller detailed how the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election. It also described at least 10 instances in which Trump may have obstructed justice by trying to interfere with Mueller’s investigation. Last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray confirmed that Russia is currently meddling in the 2020 election, including by trying to “denigrate” Biden.",2.9764646861908237,2.956020127194348,0.02044455899647568,16

FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress last month that Russia is already interfering in the 2020 election by “actively” spreading propaganda through social media and friendly news outlets “primarily to denigrate (former) Vice President (Joe) Biden,” Trump’s Democratic challenger. What’s unclear is if that is the extent of the effort, or if something else is in the works for the campaign’s closing days. Four years ago, Russia was releasing emails stolen from Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign on a daily basis through its ally, WikiLeaks, and Trump was citing them at his rallies as proof of his opponent’s “corruption.” “We love WikiLeaks,” he said repeatedly. Taylor said that campaigns have gotten more careful about online security since 2016, but that it was possible Russia still plans some type of propaganda dump targeting Biden in the coming weeks. He said Putin could also be planning something to disrupt the election itself ― sabotaging key polling places in swing states, or taking down the power grid in a major city ― although something that dramatic was less likely. More important, Taylor said, is Trump’s attitude toward Putin. “There’s a concern that the president is passively welcoming that assistance from the Russians.” Trump has over the past four years repeatedly shown his willingness to receive foreign help to win and his unwillingness to tell Putin to stay out of U.S. elections. In 2016, he solicited help from Russia, and then centered his entire campaign during the final month on that material stolen by Russian spies ― even though he had been told it had been stolen by Russian spies. In 2018, Trump refused to warn Putin against interfering in the midterms, even though his top national security officials were asking him to do so. “He failed to do it. He actively declined,” Taylor said. And in 2019, Trump tried to extort Ukraine’s new president into smearing Biden ― the Democrat he feared most as a 2020 opponent ― based on a conspiracy theory being pushed by Russian intelligence. Trump wound up getting impeached for his actions, but all save one Republican senator voted to acquit him, letting him remain in office. An official at the Russian embassy in Washington denied that the country’s government had helped Trump in 2016, and claimed it was the U.S. that was interfering with Russia. “The time has come to stop poisoning the atmosphere of relations with baseless allegations,” the official said. “As Joe Biden has said for months, it is absolutely clear who Vladimir Putin wants to win this election — because Donald Trump's foreign policy has been a gift to the Kremlin” The White House did not respond to queries on the matter, continuing a pattern that began in 2017. No White House or Trump campaign official has ever provided an answer as to why Trump accepted Russian help, knowing that it was Russian help, with the exception of his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. He told HuffPost in 2018 that the stolen emails that Trump touted daily from Oct. 10 through 2016′s Election Day were “sort of like a gift.” One National Security Council official, who would speak only on condition of anonymity to defend Trump, said: “As the president has said, the United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our electoral processes and will respond to malicious foreign threats that target our democratic institutions.” The official claimed that Trump had said this during a March 2018 news conference. However, a review of Trump’s news conferences that month found only one in which Trump addressed the issue, on March 6 during a joint appearance with Sweden’s prime minister. Asked whether he was worried about Russia interfering in the coming midterms, Trump answered: “No, because we’ll counteract whatever they do. We’ll counteract it very strongly. And we are having strong backup systems.” Two months later, after the intelligence community found evidence that Russia was, in fact, trying to interfere in the November vote, national security officials urged Trump to specifically tell Russia to back off or face consequences. Not only did he refuse to do so, but he did the exact opposite in July, at a news conference in Helsinki standing beside Putin himself. Asked whether he believed his intelligence community about Putin’s 2016 involvement in his own election or Putin’s denials, Trump sided with Putin. “President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” he said. The Russians did wind up trying to interfere in the 2018 election against candidates it deemed unfriendly, leading to officials in the national security agencies ― sometimes under the radar of the White House ― to take action on their own, Taylor said. Sanctions were imposed by the Treasury Department in September 2019 against the operators of the “troll factory” that worked to influence the 2018 election. On one occasion, sanctions against Russians received Trump’s sign-off after a document that required his signature was inserted into a larger stack of paperwork he had to sign, Taylor said. The Treasury Department more recently sanctioned a Ukrainian lawmaker who had been working with Giuliani to spread unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Biden, describing Andrii Derkach as a Russian intelligence operative. Those claims had been the basis of Trump’s own groundless allegations against Biden, the pursuit of which ultimately led to his impeachment. “This president is even giving Russia impunity for offering bounties to terrorists for murdering American troops,” said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. “As Joe Biden has said for months, it is absolutely clear who Vladimir Putin wants to win this election — because Donald Trump’s foreign policy has been a gift to the Kremlin.”",2.163960267270547,2.0835910271031675,0.08036924016737945,12

The Senate Judiciary Committee hearing produced no new disclosures about the FBI investigation, and Democrats accused majority Republicans of politicizing the issue while failing to examine alleged Russian interference in this year’s presidential election. Senate Republicans say the FBI probe of Trump’s campaign, later handed off to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, was intended to undermine Trump’s candidacy and presidency, and the panel has been examining the roots of the investigation, known as “Crossfire Hurricane.” In December, a Justice Department watchdog found evidence of numerous errors but no political bias when the FBI opened the investigation. Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and other Republicans sought to pin some responsibility on Comey for the errors found in FBI applications for secret court warrants to monitor the communications of Carter Page, who briefly served as a 2016 Trump campaign advisor. “To me this is a stunning failure of the system to work,” said Graham, a staunch Trump supporter. Several Republicans cited the case of a former FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, who pleaded guilty in August to doctoring a CIA email submitted with an application so that it said that Page was not an agency source, when in fact, he was. “I know nothing about Mr. Kleinsmith other than what I’ve read,” Comey said. While the FBI director was “responsible for everything being done beneath” them, Comey said he was not responsible for ensuring the veracity of certifications he signed accompanying monitoring applications. He said he was “enormously” proud of the FBI’s work. Comey also was questioned over the FBI’s reliance in its monitoring applications on a report compiled for the campaign of Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, by Christopher Steele, a former British spy, alleging that Russia had compromising material on Trump. He said he was unaware at the time that the primary “sub-source” for the so-called Steele Dossier was a suspected Russian agent. Comey defended the FBI’s decision to launch the counter-intelligence investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. Among other reasons, he noted that former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was working with a man that U.S. officials deemed a Russian intelligence agent. The Senate Judiciary Committee is one of two Republican-led Senate panels investigating the origins of the Russia probe. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, is leading his own. That committee recently voted to move forward with subpoenas and depositions of dozens of Obama-era officials as part of an inquiry that Democrats say is intended to boost Trump’s re-election campaign. The Mueller probe found that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election to boost Trump’s candidacy and that the Trump campaign had numerous contacts with Russians. But Mueller concluded that the evidence did not establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Moscow.

The FBI chief testified before the House Homeland Security Committee during its annual hearing on worldwide threats, addressing election interference and domestic terror in the U.S. “We certainly have seen very active, very active efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020 through what I would call more the maligned foreign influence side of things ― social media, use of proxies, state media, online journals, etc. ― in an effort to both sow divisiveness and discord and ... primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden and what the Russians see as kind of an anti-Russian establishment,” he said. Wray added that the FBI has not yet seen evidence of Russia targeting election infrastructure, or “cybertargeting,” like the agency saw in the 2016 election. FBI Director Wray: ""We certainly have seen very active, very active efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020...to both sow divisiveness and discord and...to denigrate Vice President Biden.""Full video here:  The FBI director warned Congress back in July 2019 that Russia was still intent on trying to interfere in the 2020 presidential election despite U.S. efforts to combat such threats. Trump sidelined then-outgoing national intelligence director Joseph Maguire earlier this year after a member of his team briefed the House that Russia was trying to interfere in the election in Trump’s favor. The statements echo intelligence officials who in early August presented classified information to Congress and presidential campaigns about Russia’s efforts to influence the 2020 election and American democracy. In an Aug. 7 statement, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina said that Russia had targeted Biden in a scheme. “This is consistent with Moscow’s public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration’s policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,” Evanina wrote. “For example, pro-Russia parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption ― including through publicizing leaked phone calls ― to undermine former Vice President Biden’s candidacy and the Democratic Party. Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television.” Derkach was working with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and right-wing One America News network to push the conspiracy theory that Biden acted improperly when he worked to remove a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor while vice president so he could protect a company his son Hunter Biden was working for. Trump, who was impeached last year for trying to extort Ukraine’s new president into investigating Biden, has continued to push the smear despite officials in his own administration labeling Derkach’s work as part of an ongoing Russian effort to influence the upcoming election. OANN is trying to cover up its past relationship with Andrii Derkach, an active Russian agent involved in Moscow's anti-Biden meddling. OANN gave him tons of free airtime and promoted his wacko conspiracy theories. Just weeks after Evanina’s statement, newly appointed Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced that the intelligence community would halt in-person election security briefings to Congress and instead only provide written reports. The move enraged Democrats who said the hearings allow for questions and transparency to the American public, but Ratcliffe justified the decision by saying it would be easier to avoid leaks and prevent information from being “politicized.” Earlier this month, a senior Department of Homeland Security aide filed an explosive whistleblower complaint laying out a pattern of behavior by top Trump appointees ― like acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and his deputy Ken Cuccinelli ― to manipulate or block intelligence reports that could undermine the president’s political objects or reflect poorly on the leader who welcomes help from the Kremlin and far-right extremists. The complaint by Brian Murphy, former head of DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, shed new light on the Trump administration’s efforts to deceive Congress and suppress and distort intelligence about Russian political interference and the associated threat of white supremacy ahead of the election. Notably, Wolf did not appear Thursday to testify before the congressional committee created to help protect the U.S. from foreign and domestic threats. “Mr. Wolf may attempt to evade oversight and the Department may try silly stunts to distract from this hearing, but we will not waiver [sic]. The stakes are just too high,” committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said in a statement. “Indeed, former Department officials ― the Administration’s own political appointees ― are coming forward to sound the alarm that our Nation’s security is being compromised in favor of the President’s political interests.” Dan Coats speaks out; pay attention:“No American, and certainly no American leader, should want such an outcome. Total destruction and sowing salt in the earth of American democracy is a catastrophe well beyond simple defeat and a poison for generations.” Trump’s former intelligence director Dan Coats, who served from 2017 to 2019, penned an op-ed in The New York Times on Thursday on how the upcoming election will determine whether democracy in the U.S. can survive. “Our democracy’s enemies, foreign and domestic, want us to concede in advance that our voting systems are faulty or fraudulent; that sinister conspiracies have distorted the political will of the people; that our public discourse has been perverted by the news media and social networks riddled with prejudice, lies and ill will; that judicial institutions, law enforcement and even national security have been twisted, misused and misdirected to create anxiety and conflict, not justice and social peace,” Coats wrote. “If those are the results of this tumultuous election year, we are lost, no matter which candidate wins. No American, and certainly no American leader, should want such an outcome,” he continued. “Total destruction and sowing salt in the earth of American democracy is a catastrophe well beyond simple defeat and a poison for generations.” Check out HuffPost’s 2020 Election Hub here.",2.0196690554490466,2.0304538906964695,-0.010784835247422908,6

It’s not worth it. I can’t trust it. We’re not going to vote,‘” Gordon noted on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Trump has a particular responsibility to instill trust in the election, Gordon said. “I’m going to always hold the president more responsible than anybody else because he’s, well, the president, and his voice carries further, speaks louder,” Gordon said. Despite Trump’s repeated cries of election fraud and U.S. intelligence showing that Russia, China, Iran and other foreign interests are working to influence the 2020 vote, Gordon declared that the nation’s election infrastructure is “as well protected as it’s ever been.” Gordon said she believes that the “most significant strategic threat to America is if we end up not believing in ourselves — and I’ve shared this with the president.” Check out the clip up top.",2.9808579822124095,3.973797141672344,-0.9929391594599344,10

Politico was the first to report last week that HHS Assistant Secretary Michael Caputo has been orchestrating a pressure campaign on the CDC to alter agency reports — and even stop them — to fit Trump’s far more optimistic view of COVID-19. The president himself admitted that he lied when he presented a sunnier view of the pandemic. Caputo, a former top official of the Trump campaign who has no medical or scientific background, has claimed his actions are a defense against the imagined “deep state” out to get Trump. But reports of his CDC scheme have renewed fears about his history with Russia, which interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump. Did you see what Trump is doing to the FACTS from @CDCgov? I’m livid.Michael Caputo has zero experience in public health, his only qualification is he is a LYING Trump Loyalist with ties to Russia. If you can’t trust a professional propagandist who worked for Putin, who can you trust? 🙃 Caputo, who lived in Russia for six years, was an adviser to Boris Yeltsin from 1995 to 1999 and helped him get elected as president. He also served as an adviser to a subsidiary of the state-owned energy company Gazprom, and reportedly helped shore up Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reputation. Caputo’s Kremlin ties were so concerning that he became a target of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He was questioned but was not charged with any offenses. He also testified before the House Intelligence Committee that he had no contact with Russians while serving on the Trump campaign. Caputo has attempted to scrub his links to Russia in his Wikipedia bio — and insisted in an interview that his work doesn’t make him a “Putin stooge.” He told his hometown newspaper, The Buffalo News, that “at the time, Putin wasn’t such a bad guy.” Before he was appointed to his current role, Caputo also scrubbed nearly his entire Twitter history, which was riddled with graphic, offensive attacks, outlandish conspiracy theories, and racist comments about the Chinese. Caputo has slammed what he calls Trump’s “phony” impeachment and has spread baseless accusations concerning activities in Ukraine by Joe and Hunter Biden. A key source of that Ukrainian smear, Andrii Derkach, turned out to be a Russian spy attempting to interfere in the current U.S. election, the Treasury Department revealed last week. Caputo has claimed it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election. Caputo is also a long-time associate of political strategist Roger Stone, who was found guilty of seven felonies last year, including lying to Congress and tampering with witnesses in the investigation into Russian election interference. He was an aide to former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is also a convicted felon. Caputo admitted to Politico he has attempted to change CDC reports. He told the Buffalo News that amid the “good” work the CDC does are “sometimes stories which seem to purposefully mislead and undermine the president’s COVID response with what [other] scientists label as poor scholarship.” But Caputo’s efforts to manipulate scientific information have been roundly slammed. Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, called it a “new low for science in the U.S.” Gregg Gonsalves, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale University Medical School, characterized it as “thuggery, suitable for some tinpot dictatorship.” So this is thuggery, suitable for some tinpot dictatorship, where the great leader wants the science to say what he wants it to say. @SpoxHHS is a public health menace. #COVID19 MMWR is an essential way CDC communicates w/ world. A former campaign official & his team interfered for months to change its recommendations. Terrible new low for science in US. Leave CDC alone, let them use their expertise to help control this pandemic So Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong!“since Michael Caputo [Trump campaign official], was installed in April... there have been substantial efforts to align the [scientific] reports with Trump's...claims...about the outbreak.”These actions cause excess deaths!

2020-09-12,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-covering-for-russia-homeland-security-whistleblower-evidence_n_5f5be174c5b62874bc1cee63,Trump Is Covering For Russia. A Homeland Security Whistleblower Adds To The Evidence.,"An explosive whistleblower complaint filed by a senior Department of Homeland Security aide this week has shed new light on efforts by President Donald Trump’s administration to deceive Congress and suppress and manipulate intelligence about Russian political interference and the related threat of white supremacy in advance of the 2020 election. In the complaint, Brian Murphy, the former head of DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, laid out a damning pattern of behavior by top Trump appointees ― most notably Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and his second-in-command, Ken Cuccinelli ― to distort or block intelligence reports that could undermine Trump’s political objectives or reflect poorly on a president who has openly courted both the Kremlin and far-right extremists in America. Murphy’s complaint is a shocking document that would upend any other administration in recent memory. But it’s also just another data point in an incendiary emerging story: Russia is clearly trying to influence the presidential election, and the Trump administration has doggedly tried to keep both Congress and the public in the dark about those efforts. Democratic lawmakers have also tried to sound the alarm but have been handcuffed by what they say is the Trump administration’s unnecessary classification of election security intelligence, particularly with regard to the Russian threat. Last month, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) issued a dire warning in a Washington Post op-ed after reviewing classified material that he described as “more chilling” than anything special counsel Robert S. Mueller III turned up in his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. “The warning lights are flashing red. America’s elections are under attack,” Blumenthal wrote. “[T]the Trump administration is keeping the truth about a grave, looming threat to democracy hidden from the American people.” Murphy, a Marine veteran and former FBI special agent who said he was responsible for all intelligence activities at the Department of Homeland Security from March 2018 until being reassigned last month, has produced some of the strongest evidence to date that Trump has politicized elements of the intelligence community in ways that security experts and members of Congress say put the country at great risk. In his whistleblower complaint, Murphy stated that he filed two Office of the Inspector General reports that seemingly went nowhere about “attempted censorship of intelligence analysis.” He also made numerous other internal complaints. In March and April, for example, he said he submitted six internal complaints to Kash Patel, the acting deputy director for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, about the “improper administration of an intelligence program with respect to Russian disinformation efforts within the United States.” Patel, a former staffer for Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), played a key role in a Republican effort to discredit Mueller’s Russia probe and the FBI’s and Justice Department’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s Russia ties. It’s unclear if Patel responded to Murphy’s concerns. In May, however, Wolf told Murphy to “cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States,” according to the whistleblower complaint. Wolf told Murphy those instructions came directly from White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien, according to Murphy, who said he refused to comply because “doing so would put the country in substantial and specific danger.” Even before Murphy’s complaint, it was clear that DHS was suppressing intelligence about Russian election interference. In July, the agency withheld publication of a bulletin warning law enforcement agencies about a Russian disinformation plot to “denigrate” the mental health of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, according to a recent ABC News report. Trump and his propagandists were already belittling Biden’s health, and an hour after the bulletin was submitted to the agency’s legislative and public affairs office for review, DHS chief of staff John Gountanis intervened to stop publication. The bulletin never circulated. That incident is almost certainly the one described in Murphy’s complaint where he alleges that Gountanis directed him not to disseminate an “intelligence notification regarding Russian disinformation efforts” until clearing it with Wolf. On July 8, Murphy said, he met with Wolf, who told him that the intelligence notification should be “held” because it “made the President look bad.” After Murphy protested, according to his complaint, Wolf excluded him from meetings about the notification, a draft of which was ultimately produced that Murphy felt minimized the actions of Russia. In early August, intelligence officials presented classified information to Congress and presidential campaigns ― the material that “shocked” Blumenthal ― about Russia’s efforts to undermine the election and American democracy. Russia, the information indicated, had targeted Biden in a scheme the U.S. government’s chief counterintelligence official, William Evanina, hinted at in an “election threat update” he released Aug. 7. “We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment,’” Evanina said. Three weeks later, however, Trump’s newly appointed director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, announced that the intelligence community would halt in-person election security briefings to Congress and instead provide only written reports. Ratcliffe justified this decision by saying it would be easier to avoid leaks and prevent information from being “politicized.” The move was met with outrage by congressional Democrats. In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif) called it a “betrayal of the public’s right to know how foreign powers are trying to subvert our democracy. This intelligence belongs to the American people, not the agencies which are its custodian. And the American people have both the right and the need to know that another nation, Russia, is trying to help decide who their president should be.” John Cohen, a former undersecretary for intelligence at DHS, told ABC News that “by refusing to brief Congress on a significant threat facing this country, administration officials are placing this country at grave risk.″ Given Murphy’s allegations that Wolf and Cuccinelli ― whom the Government Accountability Office determined were illegally installed in their positions ― told him to manipulate written intelligence reports, the danger is likely worse than imagined. With less than two months to go until the Nov. 3 election, Russia continues to target Biden and undermine U.S. democracy, sometimes with Trump’s assistance. Beyond the warnings from Murphy and Blumenthal, several Russian efforts to disrupt the election have entered public view on their own. Facebook recently took down accounts and pages associated with a Russian influence operation posing as an independent news outlet. The operation published content that investigators at Graphika, a social media analytics firm, described as “an attempt to build a left-wing audience and steer it away from Biden’s campaign, in the same way that the original IRA [Internet Research Agency] tried to depress progressive and minority support for Hillary Clinton in 2016.” The Daily Beast broke news this week that the same Russian operation, patterned after the Russian-based IRA, an organization of professional trolls active in the 2016 election, tried and failed to infiltrate left-wing media outlets such as Jacobin, Truthout and In These Times. CNN reported Wednesday that journalist Bob Woodward revealed in his new book that “the NSA and CIA have classified evidence the Russians had placed malware in the election registration systems of at least two Florida counties, St. Lucie and Washington. While there was no evidence the malware had been activated, Woodward writes, it was sophisticated and could erase voters in specific districts.” On Thursday, Reuters reported that Microsoft recently alerted SKDKnickerbocker, one of Biden’s main election campaign advisory firms, that suspected Russian state-backed hackers had gone after the company with a failed phishing attack to obtain staff passwords and made other attempts at infiltration. The Washington-based firm has close ties with many prominent Democrats. Meanwhile, Trump and his associates are knowingly and openly participating in a Kremlin influence campaign to tarnish Biden and his son Hunter as being involved in corrupt dealings in Ukraine. Trump’s attempt last year to strong-arm Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky into announcing an investigation into the unfounded allegations against Biden led to Trump’s impeachment. In his Aug. 7 statement about election threats, Evanina, the intelligence community’s top election security official, issued a clear warning about the ongoing influence campaign against Biden. “[P]ro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption ― including through publicizing leaked phone calls ― to undermine former Vice President Biden’s candidacy and the Democratic Party,” Evanina wrote. A week later, Trump retweeted edited audio from one of the leaked tapes that U.S. intelligence officials had flagged as part of Derkach and the Russian government’s disinformation campaign. It was of a purported 2016 call between then-Vice President Biden and then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The tapes contain edited fragments of unauthenticated conversations. Poroshenko has rejected them as a fabrication by pro-Russian forces in Ukraine. Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who directed efforts to get Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden, has met at least three times with Derkach, an enigmatic political figure who graduated from a spy academy in Moscow in 1993 and whose father was a longtime KGB officer. On his podcast, Giuliani promoted Derkach’s claims about Biden, which seek to tie the presidential rival to George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist whose support for anti-corruption and pro-democracy initiatives in former Eastern Bloc countries has made him an enemy of the Kremlin. Republicans also consider Soros, who has spent millions of dollars on liberal causes, a political foe — so much so that in 2017, right-wing congressional Republicans such as Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Ted Cruz (Texas) joined forces with Russia-backed politicians in Eastern Europe to oppose Soros. Giuliani also worked closely with One America News, a pro-Trump propaganda network, to amplify the Derkach disinformation campaign. OAN conducted interviews with Giuliani and Derkach. And OAN propagandists, such as Jack Posobiec, a far-right protégé of Trump aide and convicted felon Roger Stone, generated additional material in an attempt to link Democrats to corruption in Ukraine and to Soros. The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday designated Derkach “an active Russian agent for over a decade” who has “close connections with Russian intelligence services” and placed sanctions on him for running an “influence campaign” against Biden. “Derkach waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election,” according to a Treasury Department statement. “Derkach’s unsubstantiated narratives were pushed in Western media through coverage of press conferences and other news events, including interviews and statements.” It can sometimes be hard to separate a Russian propaganda operation from Trump sowing discord for his own purposes. Often they are inseparable. Consider Trump’s “useful idiot” approach to far-right extremism in America. By appealing to racism, authoritarianism and conspiratorial thinking to rally his base, Trump has deepened divisions in the country and accelerated political radicalization. The Trump administration has also consistently whitewashed far-right extremist violence, which federal law enforcement considers the top domestic terrorism threat. Murphy alleges in his complaint that this dangerous practice was still happening at DHS only a few months before the 2020 election. From May through July of this year, he said, Wolf and Cuccinelli unsuccessfully pressured him and other officials to play down the threat of white supremacy in an important “homeland threat assessment” report and instead stoke unfounded fears about “antifa” and anarchists, a stance that lined up with Trump’s misleading “political rhetoric” about left-wing extremism, according to the complaint. But this also matched Russian disinformation designed to stoke chaos and polarization. At a press conference in August, for example, Chanel Rion, the chief White House correspondent for One America News, brought up antifa.com, a mysterious website whose owner had redirected it to point to Biden’s website. Rion used this as an excuse to ask Trump whether Biden should “publicly denounce the antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.” Trump leaped at the opportunity to change the subject from COVID-19 and instead fearmonger about leftist extremism. Yahoo News later traced the antifa.com site to Russia. Another OAN reporter, Kristian Brunovich Rouz, was on the Kremlin payroll and has falsely linked Democrats to antifa (a loosely organized movement of anti-fascist and anti-racist activists) and pushed disinformation about Soros, including accusing him of secretly financing migrant caravans. When Trump suggested in June that an elderly peace activist shoved violently to the ground by Buffalo, New York, police was a member of antifa, he was repeating a baseless conspiracy theory that Rouz broadcast on OAN earlier that day. After Murphy refused to alter his threat assessment to demonize anti-fascists for Trump’s far-right political purposes, Wolf and Cuccinelli tried to block the report, he said. But this was only the latest instance of Trump propaganda running alongside Russian disinformation efforts. Trump’s “white grievance” politics have frequently intersected with Russian disinformation during his presidency. Murphy also alleged that Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary from December 2017 to April 2019, lied repeatedly under oath to Congress about the number of “known or suspected terrorists” (KSTs) entering the U.S. from Mexico. Murphy put the tally at “no more than three individuals.” He had said Nielsen testified to Congress in December 2018 that DHS had prevented 3,755 KSTs from entering the U.S. via the southern border. However, Nielsen did not use that figure in her testimony. In a supplemental statement, Murphy alleged that she provided that number to Congress in other ways. In October 2018, Nielsen’s aides unsuccessfully pressured Murphy’s office to have intelligence assessments support a Trump administration “policy argument” that KSTs were pouring across the border. At the time, Nielsen was briefing Trump on the progress of a caravan of migrants headed toward the U.S. from Central America. While Trump ranted on Twitter about “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners” arriving, pro-Trump propagandists began spreading a conspiracy theory that Soros ― the lead bogeyman in anti-Semitic Russian disinformation schemes ― had financed the caravan. Posobiec, who works openly with neo-Nazis and has routinely downplayed Russian political interference while being heavily promoted by both the Russian government and Trump, implied on Twitter that Soros had rented RVs for migrants, according to a USA Today investigation. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who associates with a Holocaust denier who has participated in Russian election interference efforts, suggested on Twitter that Soros had given cash to caravan members. After Donald Trump Jr. retweeted Gaetz, the disinformation went viral. A few days later, 11 people were killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue. The man charged in the massacre is a neo-Nazi gunman who allegedly believed Soros and other Jews had organized the caravan to bring violent “invaders” across the border to kill white people. Four days after the massacre, Trump again suggested that Soros was financing the caravan. The caravan disinformation campaign kicked into high gear as the midterm elections approached in 2018. Two years later, as the country hurtles toward a momentous presidential election, antifa and the Black Lives Matter movement have become the designated foils for Trump and the Kremlin’s white fright propaganda. American voters still know far too little about how Russia is undermining democracy to benefit Trump. But they know enough now to know that Trump is along for the ride.",2.124945478513626,2.6833156629518835,-0.5583701844382576,6
2020-09-12,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/russia-election-interference-peace-data_n_5f58f45ec5b6b48507faa39b,I Was Unwittingly Recruited By An Alleged Russian 'Troll Farm.' Here's What Happened.,"The last thing I expected when I went to bed on Monday, Aug. 31, was to wake up to a slew of reporters requesting an interview with me. But that’s exactly what happened once news broke that the website Peace Data was connected to the notorious Russian-based and Vladimir Putin-linked Internet Research Agency. I had contributed an article to Peace Data in June, and once the shock wore off, I searched for information that might explain what happened. I soon learned that Facebook and Twitter had removed a number of profiles linked to Peace Data after receiving an FBI tip alleging the website was tied to the Internet Research Agency. The IRA was identified in 2016 and again in 2018 as a company employing numerous fake social media accounts in order to stir dissent among U.S. voters and influence American elections. The House Intelligence Committee refers to the IRA as a “Kremlin-linked ‘troll farm’” and Russia has been on Reporters Without Borders’ “Enemies of the Internet” list since 2014. Allegedly, Peace Data was working on behalf of the IRA to attract a left-leaning, progressive audience and divide it by promoting negative claims against the Democratic ticket in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Through additional research, I saw headlines calling the journalists who had written articles for Peace Data “gullible” and looking for “easy money.” I saw reports alleging the ways the freelancers learned of the opportunity, what they were told and how much they earned, all containing misinformation. Even some of the most well-researched articles from some of the most credible publications didn’t capture the full picture as I now know it. In June, I was contacted via LinkedIn by an “Alice Schultz.” While it’s not everyday that I receive a random contact from a potential client offering work, it wasn’t the first time it happened, and my longest client relationship was established in precisely that manner. Plus, LinkedIn is a place where I market myself ― the entire reason I am a member is to attract potential clients. The information on the user’s LinkedIn profile was thorough and checked out ― at the time. I even conducted a reverse image search to be sure it wasn’t a stolen identity, and the only instances of her photo were on her social media accounts and on the Peace Data website. Schultz explained she was reaching out on behalf of Peace Data, and she described it as a new online publication dedicated to telling stories that larger publications ignore. The articles I found on the site at that time supported that goal, and Peace Data stories conveyed a variety of positions. According to Peace Data’s website, it “focused on armed conflicts, corruption, environment crisis, abuse of power, activism and human rights.” In other words, a freelance journalist’s dream. The fact that the site was fairly new wasn’t too concerning to me. After all, some of the most popular online publications started out as small, independent websites in the not-so-distant past. The only question that remained unanswered was who funded the site, but Schultz assured me that it was financed through private donations. Journalistic writing is my passion, but it doesn’t pay the bills. Those earnings have traditionally come from online web content for both domestic and international businesses, and those jobs have all but ceased for me since the global pandemic began earlier this year. As a result, the opportunity to be paid to write about topics that really matter to me ― and the world ― was incredibly appealing. Schultz asked me my rate, and she agreed to my offer: an amount far more than the maximum $75 or $100 per article that Peace Data has been reported to pay. In fact, the rate was in line with my best-paying clients. Still, I spent a good deal of time constructing the article and wouldn’t call it anything close to “easy money.” Schultz asked me to write about a specific topic: the recent attacks on U.S. journalists. Schultz asked for the article to be objective and filled with facts ― not a request I would have expected from someone looking for propaganda. Had Peace Data presented as a publication pushing bias and rhetoric, I would not have become involved. In fact, the resulting product is an article I would stand by today if it appeared in a reputable publication. Peace Data published the article as written and even paid ahead of time. There hadn’t been a single red flag ... until after publication. Schultz had given wholly positive and enthusiastic feedback about my article, and she expressed interest in a pitch I’d offered. Then ... crickets. While we had been in steady contact before, she never replied to me again, and her LinkedIn profile was deactivated. I contacted Peace Data by messaging its primary Twitter account, asking about Schultz and the pitches I had submitted. I received a single reply from “Alex Lacusta” informing me that there was a known issue with Peace Data’s LinkedIn accounts, which they were working to resolve. He also said they had stopped accepting pitches for the present time, which seemed odd for a fledgling publication. Upon learning of the announcements from Facebook and Twitter that linked Peace Data to the IRA, I contacted Peace Data through its primary email address. I received a prompt reply expressing the editorial board’s shock and dismay. “These accusations are false, and the whole situation is nothing but a direct attack on free speech and independent journalism,” wrote the email’s author, who did not sign their name. Based on my concerns, they added, they removed my name from the contributors list. Oddly, I hadn’t requested that my name be removed, although I gladly accepted it. Even stranger, when I pulled up the “About Us” section of peacedata.net to confirm my name was removed, I saw the entire page had been taken down since I’d looked at it just a couple of hours earlier. The site no longer identified any of its principle players. When I replied to Peace Data’s email, I informed the recipient that I would love nothing more than to provide readers of the article I wrote for Peace Data proof that the allegations against the site were false. I asked who funds Peace Data, and I asked what happened to Schultz and the LinkedIn accounts. I received no further communication. The Peace Data team did provide an additional response to the allegations in a post to its website, which has since been removed. In it, the team said, “We perceive this is a declaration of an all-out war against Peace Data and we’re prepared to put up a fight.” The writer took to task Facebook’s head of cybersecurity, Nathaniel Gleicher, and even the FBI. The article characterized Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg as miserly, accumulating wealth amid a falling economy, and it accused him of unethical collaborations and prideful associations with “monstrous figures” like Donald Trump. It definitely wasn’t the response one would expect from an outlet claiming journalistic integrity. The post went on to attack several major publications that have covered the story, and accused the FBI of creating a “sham” in order to demonstrate its “hard work and justify millions of taxpayers’ dollars spent on the expensive actions of combatting foreign influence.” Peace Data even claimed it was “supported by our own finances,” as well as contributions from readers. I asked Peace Data to explain who “our” was, and again received no response. Likewise, the post offered no evidence backing any of its claims. New York-based network analysis firm Graphika, however, offered plenty of evidence that Peace Data was lying. In its Sept. 1 report “IRA Again: Unlucky Thirteen,” Graphika provided a full analysis of the website. According to Graphika: The personas of Peace Data’s editorial team, listed on its “About Us” page before it was taken down, were artificial-intelligence-generated profile pictures. Whereas stolen photos can be identified more easily through a basic search, the AI-generated avatars were far more convincing to the freelance writers contacted by Peace Data editors and recruiters. Graphika even acknowledged that this was the first time it has observed an IRA-linked account using generated avatars in this manner. Peace Data only began publishing in December 2019, and its Facebook profile was not established until May. The organization failed to gain significant traction, with many posts receiving only single-digit engagement figures. The Peace Data strategy built on the trend of IRA-associated groups using fewer yet more convincing accounts to accomplish its goals. While the IRA ran thousands of accounts between 2014 and 2017, the Peace Data operation relied on just 13 accounts and two pages on Facebook, and Graphika identified about the same number between Twitter and LinkedIn. The fake personas, such as Schultz, were maintained across platforms to amplify their legitimacy. Another of the fake personas included Alex Lacusta, mentioned above. The online personas had even accumulated their own friends and followers. While Peace Data allegedly existed to influence U.S. elections, very few of its posts ― only about 5% of all English-language articles on the site ― dealt with the U.S. election or its candidates. Many articles had no relation to U.S. politics at all. A Sept. 2 search of the entire site resulted in 20 pages of articles mentioning “Trump,” compared to just two pages of articles mentioning “Biden.” “Harris” was only referenced in six articles. Graphika then noted that Peace Data’s “English-language content on Biden and Harris was noteworthy for its hostile tone,” and pointed to a specific article that accused the Democratic nominees of “submission to right-wing populism.” The article I wrote, on the other hand, did nothing to support these goals. It since has been suggested that articles like mine were used to legitimize the site and give the impression it wasn’t biased. Later, however, the Peace Data team, whoever they are, took down all content from the site, save another unprofessional message on what was its homepage. Still, the entire situation left more questions than answers. As time went by, Peace Data’s explanations ultimately shined an entirely unprofessional light on its efforts. It has grown clearer by the day that the allegations against the website have far more support than any remaining defense. Even clearer, the IRA’s efforts to mislead have grown more sophisticated, and the freelancers involved were far from gullible for participating in the scheme. Just because we weren’t gullible, however, doesn’t mean I couldn’t have taken additional actions to verify the authenticity of the offer. I’m now aware that I’ll probably need to use more advanced detection methods as time passes. Instead of sticking to a basic investigation and moving ahead, I’ll need to keep up to date on the latest ways organizations like Peace Data and other “catfishing” type efforts are disguising their identities ― as should everyone else. But if this experience has taught me anything, it’s that even the best verification efforts can quickly become ineffective, and both content creators and content consumers will need to remain hypervigilant about attempts to mislead and misuse.

Derkach had been working with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and One America News network, which Trump has come to favor in the past year, to push the falsehood that the Democratic presidential nominee acted improperly when, as vice president, he worked to remove a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor, supposedly to protect a company his son, Hunter, had been working for. In fact, Joe Biden was advancing the consensus goal of the United States, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and others to rid Ukraine of corruption. Trump, who was impeached last year for his efforts to extort Ukraine’s new president into opening an investigation into Biden, has nevertheless continued to push that conspiracy theory. “Where is Hunter? — Where is Hunter? — I call him ‘Where is Hunter?’” Trump said at a White House news conference Monday. “He walked away with a fortune from Ukraine.” His own handpicked Cabinet members, however, on Thursday, issued statements that describe Derkach’s work as part of ongoing Russian attempts to sway the outcome of the coming election. “This action sends a clear signal: the United States will not hesitate to use all tools of national power to respond to foreign actors that seek to interfere in or otherwise influence our elections by any means,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that referred to a criminal indictment in federal court against the troll farm employees. “From at least late 2019 through mid-2020, Derkach waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 presidential election, spurring corruption investigations in both Ukraine and the United States designed to culminate prior to election day,” the Treasury statement said. “Derkach’s unsubstantiated narratives were pushed in Western media through coverage of press conferences and other news events, including interviews and statements.” “Between May and July 2020, Derkach released edited audio tapes and other unsupported information with the intent to discredit U.S. officials, and he levied unsubstantiated allegations against U.S. and international political figures. Derkach almost certainly targeted the U.S. voting populace, prominent U.S. persons, and members of the U.S. government, based on his reliance on U.S. platforms, English-language documents and videos, and pro-Russian lobbyists in the United States used to propagate his claims,” the statement said. One of those investigations was started by Republican Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, despite warnings from U.S. intelligence that the efforts to malign Biden were being pushed by Russia. A committee spokesman released a statement from Johnson and fellow Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, who has also supported the probes: “Foreign election meddling in all of its forms from any corner of the globe cannot be tolerated. We commend the Trump administration for holding accountable perpetrators of foreign interference.” The spokesman added that the committee had not received any information from either Derkach or Giuliani, who was actively disseminating it. Last month, however, Johnson defended the probe to a Wisconsin television station and would not rule out accepting material from them. “We are getting information from a variety of sources,” he said. Neither Giuliani nor Charles Herring, president of One America News, responded to HuffPost queries Thursday. OAN, which behaved as a fairly mainstream conservative news outlet during the 2016 primaries, quickly morphed into a pro-Trump propaganda channel after his election. The White House Correspondents Association board voted to ban it from the media’s shared workspace in the West Wing for repeatedly violating the group’s agreed-upon coronavirus guidelines this spring. But its White House reporter has continued to attend briefings at the express invitation of senior Trump aides. The outlet was deeply involved in Giuliani’s efforts to malign Biden, and heavily promoted video packages that featured him and his efforts to promote Derkach’s conspiracy theory. Trump was so heavily invested in that theory himself that he tried to extort Ukraine’s new president into smearing Biden publicly, using $391 million in congressionally approved military aid as leverage. He was exposed because of a whistleblower’s complaint, and was ultimately impeached for the offense. Trump, nevertheless, has ridiculed the impeachment after Republican senators — with the exception of Utah’s Mitt Romney — voted to allow Trump to remain in office despite his actions. Trump also continues to push those same groundless accusations against Biden. “What he’s done is so incredible. ‘I won’t give them the billion dollars,’ he says. ‘I won’t give them, unless they get rid of that prosecutor.’ And then, voila, they got rid of the prosecutor,” Trump said Monday. “And the press doesn’t even want to talk about it. You talk about quid pro quo. With me, there was none. With him, he’s right on tape, and you don’t want to cover it. You should be ashamed of yourselves. The press should be ashamed of themselves.” The new disinformation effort mirrors Russian dictator Vladimir Putin’s role in 2016, when emails stolen by his intelligence services from the Democratic National Committee and from a top campaign aide to nominee Hillary Clinton were released through WikiLeaks on a near daily basis in the final month before the election. Then-candidate Trump had been informed starting with an August intelligence briefing that Russia was behind the email thefts, and that connection was announced publicly on Oct. 7 by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Despite this, Trump began using the material anyway, starting with his Oct. 10 rally straight through Election Day, citing it in his speeches and news interviews as evidence that Clinton was corrupt.",2.062016477963115,2.851900376744652,-0.7898838987815369,12

The social media giant said 13 accounts and two pages were removed after Facebook received a tip from the FBI that they were tied to the Internet Research Agency. The group was highly active in 2016 on every major social media platform, targeting voters before and after the presidential election to bolster Donald Trump, but it has been far quieter during this election cycle. The accounts, meant to look like a progressive news company, were taken down before they were able to amass a large audience, but The New York Times notes it is the first public evidence Russia is trying to re-up its accomplishments from four years ago. Twitter also said Tuesday it had removed five accounts and would block any content affiliated with the disinformation effort. “Russian actors are trying harder and harder to hide who they are and being more and more deceptive to conceal their operations,” Facebook’s Head of Cybersecurity Policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, told NPR. “But there was very little attention paid to this operation.” New Report: Facebook takedown of Russian, IRA-linked operation targeting US and other countries that used AI-generated profile pictures, employed unwitting content creators, used carefully crafted accounts and used pinpoint precision: The Russian operatives were working to direct social media users to a fake news site called Peace Data that looked like a left-wing news site, going so far as to hire American freelance journalists to write for the website. The New York Times notes the group advertised for writers on an online job board. The social media analytics firm Graphika, which worked with Facebook to release a report on the fake news network, said Peace Data was crafted to target mainly progressive and left-wing groups in the U.S. and the United Kingdom and share “wholly negative” portrayals of key electoral issues. “The site paid particular attention to racial and political tensions,” Graphika said in a report released Tuesday. “This included substantial coverage of the protests that followed the murder of George Floyd and criticism of both President Donald Trump and his challengers, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris.” Graphika said the content appeared to be crafted to divide Democratic voters going into November, “an attempt to build a left-wing audience and steer it away from Biden’s campaign, in the same way that the original IRA tried to depress progressive and minority support for Hillary Clinton in 2016.” “The operation seemed designed to divide Democratic supporters and to depress support for Biden and Harris,” Camille François, Graphika’s chief innovation officer, told The Washington Post. Facebook and Twitter have faced ongoing scrutiny over their roles in the public discourse. Both sites have been associated with the spread of wild, but pernicious conspiracy theories and U.S. intelligence agencies said last month they believed Russia was already acting against Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The New York Times reported the latest Peace Data initiative was more covert than past efforts by Russia to misuse social media, and the fake news site appeared to be in its early stages before it was spotted. The pages were only followed by about 14,000 people.",3.332812099064634,4.939416263235274,-1.6066041641706401,7

Napolitano’s air time has dwindled as his criticism of Trump has increased over the last year. Barr’s meeting with Murdoch, the executive chairman of Fox News’ parent company, at his New York home was widely reported at the time, but its purpose was not revealed. One aim of the meeting was to shut up Napolitano, according to the book “Hoax: Donald Trump, Fox News, and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth,” written by CNN media reporter Brian Stelter. Trump “was so incensed” by Napolitano’s increasingly critical comments about him in Fox News broadcasts that he “implored Barr to send Rupert a message in person … about ‘muzzling the judge,’” according to the book, reported The Guardian, which obtained a copy. Trump “wanted the nation’s top law enforcement official to convey just how atrocious Napolitano’s legal analysis had been,” wrote Stelter, citing information from an unnamed source. Napolitano, a former New Jersey superior court judge, reportedly told friends early in 2019 that he was on Trump’s “short list” for the U.S. Supreme Court. But when news emerged later that year of Trump’s phone call pressing Ukraine’s president to launch an investigation into baseless accusations against Joe Biden, Napolitano called the president’s actions both “criminal and impeachable.” The judge also said that much of what was found in an investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller concerning Russian interference in the 2016 election was “also impeachable.” Barr’s words “carried a lot of weight” with Murdoch, Stelter reports, though it’s unclear how the pressure to silence Napolitano served taxpayers funding Barr’s salary. A daytime slot for Napolitano soon disappeared and he was carved out of coverage of Trump’s impeachment, Stelter noted. Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo would only book Napolitano to discuss non-Trump topics, because she would become too upset when he criticized Trump, a staffer told Stelter. Napolitano still appears on Fox News, though in a more limited role. He recently harshly criticized Trump for sending federal officers into Portland to snatch residents off the streets, calling it a dangerous slide into totalitarianism. “There is nothing lawful or orderly” about the aggressive tactics Department of Homeland Security officers are wielding against people protesting racism, he wrote in a Fox News opinion piece. The agents’ actions are “unlawful” and “unconstitutional,” he wrote. He has also blasted Barr as “Stalinistic.”",3.737343690288317,4.08008038962251,-0.34273669933419315,4

Navalny, 44, was in intensive care and on an artificial lung ventilator, spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on social media. A fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, Navalny started feeling ill when returning to Moscow from Tomsk in Siberia by plane on Wednesday morning, Yarmysh said. “We assume that Alexei was poisoned with something mixed into his tea. It was the only thing that he drank in the morning. Doctors say the toxin was absorbed faster through the hot liquid. Alexei is now unconscious,” Yarmysh said. She did not say who she believed may have poisoned Navalny, but said police had been called to the hospital. However, one of the doctors there said it was not certain that he had been poisoned. Doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko said “natural poisoning” was one of several diagnoses being considered and tests were being carried out. Navalny, a lawyer and anti-corruption activist, has served many stints in jail in recent years for organizing anti-Kremlin protests and has been physically attacked in the street by pro-government activists. He has helped investigations into what he has said are outrageous examples of official corruption. Russia holds regional elections next month and Navalny and his allies have been preparing for them, trying to increase support for candidates which they back. Tatyana Shakirova, a spokeswoman for the regional health ministry in Omsk, said: “We confirm that Alexei Navalny has been hospitalized in Omsk and that doctors assess his condition as serious...Doctors are doing everything possible to stabilize his condition.” “The poisoning version is one of several versions being considered. It’s not possible now to say what the reason was.” Passenger Pavel Lebedev posted an account of what he saw on social media. “At the start of the flight he went to the toilet and didn’t come back. He started feeling really sick. They struggled to bring him round and he was screaming in pain.” Navalny had drunk a cup of tea at a Tomsk airport cafe before boarding his flight, Yarmysh said. The Interfax news agency quoted the cafe’s owners as saying they were checking CCTV cameras to try to establish what had happened. Navalny’s plane later made an emergency landing in Omsk so that he could be rushed to hospital. Footage posted on social media by a fellow passenger showed a motionless Navalny being stretchered into an ambulance by medics. S7, the airline he was traveling with, said Navalny had started feeling very ill soon after take-off and the captain had decided to make an emergency landing at a nearby airport. He had not eaten or drunk anything on board, it said. Yarmysh drew a parallel with an incident last year in which Navalny suffered an acute allergic reaction that one doctor said could have resulted from poisoning with an unknown chemical. “Obviously the same has been done to him now,” Yarmysh said. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia’s arrests and detention of Navalny in 2012 and 2014 were politically-motivated and violated his human rights, a ruling Moscow called questionable.",5.141780189694517,5.924774387739606,-0.7829941980450892,8
2020-08-18,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-russia-collusion_n_5f3c44b2c5b61551404e7071,Senate’s Bipartisan Russia Report Refutes Trump’s Repeated ‘No Collusion’ Lie,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s often-repeated “no collusion” claim about the help he received from Russia to win the 2016 election was belied once again Tuesday, this time by the bipartisan Senate intelligence committee following a three-year investigation. Like U.S. intelligence services already concluded in 2017 and special counsel Robert Mueller reported in 2019, the committee found that Russia worked to hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and to help Trump — but further found that Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort was particularly dangerous to U.S. national security. “Manafort’s high-level access and willingness to share information with individuals closely affiliated with the Russian intelligence services … represented a grave counterintelligence threat,” the 966-page report found. The committee also concluded that Trump confidante Roger Stone — who along with Manafort and several others were convicted of felonies in Mueller’s probe — on the orders of Trump and his campaign sought to coordinate with WikiLeaks regarding the release of documents stolen from the Clinton camp. “At their direction, Stone took action to gain inside knowledge for the campaign and shared his purported knowledge directly with Trump and senior campaign officials on multiple occasions,” the report stated. Trump and his campaign, though, appeared to show little interest in addressing the specific findings of the report. “The Russia Collusion Hoax is the greatest political scandal in the history of this country,” campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement, repeating language Trump has used since the investigations began soon after he took office in 2017. “As this report proves, yet again, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.” That Trump was openly accepting Russian help to win the election was known even as it was happening in real time. Trump started receiving intelligence briefings in August 2016, when he was informed that Russian spy agencies had stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and others and were releasing them through WikiLeaks. That information was made public on Oct. 7, when the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence put out a joint statement naming both Russia and WikiLeaks. Despite this, Trump cited that Russian-stolen material almost daily between Oct. 10 and Election Day at his campaign rallies and in media interviews. “We love WikiLeaks,” he would say, urging his supporters and the news media to read the latest batch of stolen documents to be released. Many of the contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, as well as a detailed analysis of the Russian-stolen material disseminated in the campaign’s final month, were previously published in the Mueller report. But that document was effectively preempted by Trump’s handpicked Attorney General Bill Barr, who before the redacted report was released held a news conference claiming — falsely — that it had failed to find evidence of collusion or obstruction of justice. In fact, the report had plenty of evidence of both, but Trump and his allies have been claiming “exoneration” ever since. Indeed, Trump and Barr have launched investigations in an attempt to discredit Mueller’s probe by claiming the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation should have never been started in the first place. The Senate report found that Trump not only refused to turn over material to the committee from the time he was president, he also refused to hand over documents from the 10-week period between his election and inauguration using “novel and unprecedented potential executive privilege claims.” Committee vice chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said investigators found “a breathtaking level of contacts between Trump officials and Russian government operatives” and that he hoped Americans will read the report for themselves. “This cannot happen again,” Warner said. “As we head into the heat of the 2020 campaign season, I strongly urge campaigns, the executive branch, Congress and the American people to heed the lessons of this report in order to protect our democracy.” But Trump, having escaped any consequences from Congress or prosecutors for the 2016 collusion, in 2019 began seeking foreign assistance again for his reelection, this time from Ukraine and China. Starting within days of the release of the Mueller report in April 2019, Trump began trying to extort Ukraine’s newly elected president into announcing an investigation into the Democrat he most feared, Joe Biden. Trump ultimately was impeached for those actions, which involved using $391 million in U.S. military aid as leverage, but was allowed to remain in office by Republican senators, with the sole exception of Utah’s Mitt Romney. Trump also publicly called on China to investigate Biden while privately begging its dictator, Xi Jinping, to help him win reelection by buying lots of farm products from the United States, according to his own national security adviser at the time, John Bolton.",2.652815311076598,2.3393966670178536,0.31341864405874453,12

Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier on Tuesday claimed the country’s coronavirus vaccine, the first in the world, was ready for use ― even though it has not been subjected to a large-scale clinical trial. Fauci explained in the interview that National Geographic will broadcast in full online Thursday that the U.S. has “half a dozen or more vaccines” in development and could start administering them as soon as “next week” if “we wanted to take the chance of hurting a lot of people, or giving them something that doesn’t work.” “But, that’s not the way it works,” he said. “So, I hope, but I haven’t heard any evidence to make me feel that’s the case, I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective,” Fauci continued. “I seriously doubt that they’ve done that.” People should understand that the U.S. is not yet claiming to have a vaccine because “we have a way of doing things in this country where we care about safety and we care about efficacy,” Fauci added. Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who left his role in President Donald Trump’s administration in April 2019, echoed Fauci’s concerns on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Tuesday. “I wouldn’t take it, certainly not outside a clinical trial right now,” said Gottlieb. “They’re claiming that it’s fully approved, but it’s not fully approved.” “We certainly wouldn’t allow a vaccine to be used for mass distribution at this point based on the data we have at hand,” he added. “We just don’t know if the vaccines are safe and effective at this point.” Check out Fauci’s comments here: Concocting a #COVID19 vaccine is not the same thing as proving a vaccine is safe and effective.

Wording was dramatically watered down concerning Russia’s strong backing for Trump shortly after then-Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was forced into early retirement when he refused to make the changes, the Times reported. The classified document reportedly also discussed Russia’s ongoing efforts to influence U.S. elections in 2020 and 2024. “I can affirm that one of my staffers who was aware of the controversy requested that I modify that assessment,” Coats told the Times. “But I said, ‘No, we need to stick to what the analysts have said.’” A short time later, Coats was surprised to learn in a tweet by Trump that he was being forced into early retirement, several weeks before he planned to leave his position, the magazine reported. The language was changed after Coats left, according to the Times. I am pleased to announce that highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to be the Director of National Intelligence. A former U.S. Attorney, John will lead and inspire greatness for the Country he loves. Dan Coats, the current Director, will.... ....be leaving office on August 15th. I would like to thank Dan for his great service to our Country. The Acting Director will be named shortly. The report, known as a National Intelligence Estimate, was compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in July 2019, and made several “key judgments” about national security issues. “Key Judgement 2” concluded that Russia favored Trump to win in 2020. But any suggestion that Russia favored Trump invited the president’s wrath, the magazine reported, and top aides “went to considerable lengths to keep the topic of Russian election interference off the president’s agenda.” After Coats left, the intelligence report was modified to say that “Russian leaders probably assess that chances to improve relations with the U.S. will diminish under a different U.S. president,” the Times reported. The new language was far less pointed and made it sound like the Kremlin’s preference for Trump was a good thing for America. But a new U.S. intelligence assessment revealed last week that Russia not only favors Trump, but is still actively working to influence the election. The Kremlin is using a “range of measures” to “denigrate” and “undermine” presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said in a statement released Friday. “Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television,” the statement added. Trump dismissed the report. “I don’t care what anybody says,” Trump told reporters when asked about the latest assessment. “I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody’s been tougher on Russia — ever.” In fact, Trump’s refusal to complain to or punish Russia for anti-American actions continues to confound observers. Trump has said he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denials that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, even though the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that it did so in a “sweeping and systematic fashion” in a bid to sway the vote in Trump’s favor. The president has also recently failed to take any action to punish Russia following revelations that the country was paying bounties to Taliban-linked militia members to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan. He failed to even raise the issue in a recent conversation with Putin.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s interest in taking intelligence briefings has been declining steadily since his first months in office and has dropped to near zero in recent weeks, according to a HuffPost review of all of his daily schedules. Trump went from a high of 4.1 briefings per week on average in March 2017 to 0.7 per week since July 1, shortly after it became public that he had ignored intelligence reports about Russia offering bounties to the Taliban for each American soldier killed in Afghanistan. Monday’s briefing, in fact, was the first in August and the first since July 22. That month had only three briefings scheduled. “It’s remarkable that, even at their peak, they never exceeded 20 per month,” said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and a spokesman for the National Security Council during the Obama administration. “And now that they are arguably more important than ever, as foreign actors are again interfering in our democracy, tensions with Beijing are swirling, and America’s adversaries and competitors are becoming more emboldened, the president can’t seem to find the time to be briefed,” he added. Briefings from intelligence community officials are based on a package of report summaries from around the world prepared in the pre-dawn hours each morning specifically for the president. The sessions are among the few responsibilities in the modern presidency that cannot be delegated to others. Both of Trump’s immediate predecessors took daily briefings in the White House. Republican George W. Bush typically had his shortly after his arrival in the Oval Office at 6:45 a.m. each day. Democrat Barack Obama had the written material, known as the “President’s Daily Brief,” loaded onto his iPad by 6 a.m. each day, when he would read it prior to the in-person session later in the morning. Trump, by contrast, rarely gets to the West Wing before noon after spending much of each morning watching television and posting tweets based on his viewing. He displayed a diligence toward intelligence briefings only briefly, upon first taking office. In March 2017 he had 18 scheduled briefings on the 23 available weekdays. In April 2017, he had 17 briefings on the 20 available weekdays. But starting that May, right after he fired FBI Director James Comey for failing to end the investigation into the assistance his campaign received from Russia, the frequency of his briefings fell dramatically. Up until that day, May 9, Trump had taken 54 intelligence briefings in his 110 days in office, an average of 3.4 per week. In the 1,200 days since then, he has received 281 briefings, an average of only 1.6 per week. White House officials for years have denied that Trump has been getting briefings more and more infrequently, insisting that the public schedule does not always reflect the briefings he receives. They have declined to explain why some briefings wind up on the public schedule but not others. On Tuesday, though, White House communications director Alyssa Farah said: “The president is briefed on critical intelligence daily by his national security adviser, his career CIA briefer, and/or his chief of staff. He also takes part in full formal presidential intelligence briefings near weekly or every other week with the CIA director, national security adviser, director of national intelligence, White House counsel, and usually the secretary of treasury, secretary of state, and sometime the secretary of defense in person in the Oval Office.” “Trump has demonstrated time and again that he’s not one to put America’s national security first.” Trump himself, asked about intelligence briefings in a recent interview with Axios, called the reports of the Russian bounties “fake news,” that they had “never reached” his desk, and that he does read the PDBs and is regularly briefed. “I read a lot. I spend a lot of time at meetings. Usually it’s once a day or at least two or three times a week, intelligence meetings,” Trump said. One former top White House aide, asked on condition of anonymity whether Trump actually took more intelligence briefings than were reflected on his public schedules, began laughing aloud. The aide’s reaction was the same when asked whether Trump reads the intelligence briefing books prepared for him. Trump’s last national security adviser, John Bolton, has stated publicly that Trump does not read his intelligence briefing book and that making him absorb information was a difficult challenge. “He’s just not receptive to new facts,” Bolton told CBS News last month. “The intelligence briefings don’t communicate as much information as they should. We tried to think of ways to change that. I think it was probably a doomed effort.” Trump’s engagement on intelligence has become a major issue in his reelection bid, after reports earlier this year that he ignored warnings in his PDBs in January that a pneumonia-like virus was spreading in China. Trump did not have a briefing on his schedule until Jan. 6, a week after Taiwanese authorities raised the alarm with U.S. officials about an epidemic on the mainland. He then spent more than two months downplaying the virus and praising China’s dictator for his great work and “transparency” in controlling the coronavirus, even as it had gained a foothold in the United States and was spreading across the country. Months later, first The New York Times and then other outlets reported that Trump had ignored intelligence that Russia was paying rewards of up to $100,000 per American soldier murdered in Afghanistan. Trump has called those reports “a hoax” and “fake news” and acknowledged that he has never raised the issue with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin in the numerous phone calls they have shared this year. “Whether it’s ignoring the impending pandemic or looking the other way in response to Moscow’s bounties on our service members, Trump has demonstrated time and again that he’s not one to put America’s national security first,” Price said. “Especially when doing so comes into conflict with what’s best for him politically.”",3.2574184678004325,2.6641503866225493,0.5932680811778832,6

The Kremlin is using a “range of measures” to “denigrate” and “undermine” Biden as Russian officials maneuver again to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said in a statement released Friday. “Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television,” the statement added. Evanina also warned that pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach , the son of a former KGB officer, “is spreading claims about corruption — including through publicizing leaked phone calls — to undermine ... Biden’s candidacy and the Democratic Party.” Derkach has met with Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, and the two speak often. Derkach has also reportedly fed suspect information to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). When asked by a reporter about Evanina’s statement at his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey, Trump responded: “I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump, because nobody’s been tougher on Russia — ever.” “I don’t care what anybody says,” he added. “Nobody with any common sense would say ... look at what we’re doing with our military ... look at all of the things we’ve done with NATO, where I’ve raised $130 billion a year from countries that were delinquent and now they’re paying all of this money ... that’s all money to protect against Russia.” Trump hasn’t “raised” any money at NATO. Countries in NATO also aren’t “delinquent” — nations are encouraged to contribute 2% of their GDP. ""I don't care what anybody says"" -- Trump dismisses the intelligence community's announcement today that Russia is once again helping him  Trump’s refusal to complain to or punish Russia for anti-American actions continues to confound observers. Trump has said he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denials that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, even though the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that it did so in a “sweeping and systematic fashion” to sway the vote in Trump’s favor. The president has also recently failed to take any action to punish Russia following revelations that the country was paying bounties to Taliban-linked militia members to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan. He failed to even raise the issue in a recent conversation with Putin. Evanina’s statement Friday also noted that China does not want “unpredictable” Trump reelected. But actions Evanina cited concerning China regarded officials “harshly” criticizing the president’s statements on TikTok and Hong Kong, and didn’t mention any subterfuge. U.S. officials more thoroughly briefed on the intelligence were told that Russia is a far graver threat to the election, The New York Times reported. China seeks to gain influence in American politics but has yet to take more decisive action. As part of the Russian campaign to aid Trump, snippets of leaked Biden phone calls are being characterized by Derkach as as an attempt by the former vice president to block investigations into corruption at a Ukrainian energy company, where his son held a board position. In fact, they appear to be part of Biden’s efforts as vice president to force a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor from office for failing to investigate criminal activity, The Washington Post has reported. UPDATE: In April 2021, 10 months after The New York Times, Associated Press and Washington Post reported on U.S. intelligence that Russia had offered secret bounties to the Taliban for the deaths of Americans, the Biden administration said that CIA analysts only have “low to moderate confidence” that the bounty program ever existed.",3.156828263903011,3.4199309467308687,-0.26310268282785776,6

The summary was filed as part of Operation Hurricane, the code name for the FBI investigation launched in August 2016 into suspected Kremlin interference in that year’s election and possible ties to the Trump campaign. Trump-appointed Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified and released the summary of the briefing this week at the behest of Senate Republicans looking to present the FBI as targeting Trump even before his election. But Trump’s own comments about Russia, related in the FBI summary, place him in a less-than-favorable light — revealing him to be either incredibly gullible and unsophisticated in his understanding, or deliberately disingenuous about Russia. Michael Flynn, who would later go on to be Trump’s national security adviser, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Trump’s transition team leader, were also at the 13-minute briefing, in which FBI agent Joe Pientka presented them with the basics of the threat to U.S. security. According to Pientka’s summary, Trump asked him if the Russians were more dangerous than the Chinese because they have more operatives in the U.S. The agent said both countries are bad and told the men that the number of operatives was “not an indicator of the severity of the threat,” according to the document. The FBI agent then shared that when he told Trump and his team that the U.S. is a “world leader in counterintelligence,” Trump asked: “Russia, too?” According to the summary, Trump also asked which country, Russia or China, was worse when it came to violations of nuclear testing bans and was told: “They are both bad, but Russia is worse.” “Trump and Christie turned toward each other, and Christie commented, ‘I’m shocked,’” Pientka wrote of their reactions to that information. Pientka also said he warned the men that foreign agents might try to approach their relatives, friends and campaign staff in the U.S. to obtain “information pertaining to political, economic, energy, technology and military policy/plans of the U.S.” in order to “collect inside information to give their country a competitive advantage over the U.S.” Trump was also advised to take special care with phone and electronic communications that could be hacked, according to the summary. Trump has repeatedly used his personal cell phone for official conversations, despite warnings from aides not to do so. Pientka, who would continue to be part of the Russia investigation, noted in his summary of the meeting that he was on the alert for any comments on Russia from the Trump team. “During the [intelligence] briefs, writer actively listened for topics or questions regarding the Russian Federation,” he wrote. Former White House Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News Friday that the transcript is proof the FBI was out to “take down” Trump. But the transcript clearly shows Pientka offering advice to Trump and his team on how to deal with possible overtures by foreign agents. He was not questioning them. At the time of the briefing, the FBI had disturbing indications of Russian interference in the 2016 election, including a Kremlin-orchestrated hack of emails from the Democratic National Committee, which were published by WikiLeaks and benefited the Trump campaign. Trump later called on Russia to get his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton’s emails, and those were hacked and leaked as well. Despite his repeated insistence that the probe into Russian election interference was a “witch hunt,” Trump has also attacked his predecessor Barack Obama for not being aggressive enough in investigating Russia’s actions. Robert Mueller’s special counsel report last year concluded that the “Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion” in a way that “favored” Trump. The report also noted numerous contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Kremlin representatives. By 2016, Trump had a long business history with Russia, and was even working to get a Trump tower built in Moscow. Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons, told a golf journalist in 2014 that the Trump Organization had “all the funding we need out of Russia” — which he later denied saying.",2.9575676890916953,3.3522223971799807,-0.3946547080882854,12

A caption below, written in ALL CAPS to maximize the effect, warns of “CHAOS & VIOLENCE.” It is shock advertising at its most routine, designed to stoke fear and provoke a retreat to the safe and familiar. It popped up on Facebook on Tuesday and, as with so many whoppers of the Trump era, it’s also a lie. This image that President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign desperately wants you to believe is of anarchy in a “Democrat-run” U.S. city is ... actually a photo from 2014 of a pro-democracy protest in Ukraine. Jesse Lehrich, a former Hillary Clinton spokesperson, pointed out the misrepresentation on Twitter, noting that the Trump campaign seemingly downloaded the original file from Wikipedia, which clearly states it was taken in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2014: LOLa new Trump ad warning of chaos & violence depicts a cop being attacked by protesters......only it's a pic from Kyiv in 2014, when Yanukovich's thugs fought to quash a democratic uprising.  Photographer Mstyslav Chernov confirmed to HuffPost that he took the photo in Ukraine in 2014 but declined to comment further. At the time, much of the country was rebelling against Kremlin-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. A Ukrainian court convicted Yanukovitch of treason in 2019 for fleeing the capital for Russia and urging Putin to invade the country to put him back in power. Incidentally, before he was Trump’s campaign manager in 2016, Paul Manafort worked for Yanukovitch from 2006 through 2015 and was paid tens of millions of dollars by the Ukrainian president.

Johnson, a second-term senator from Wisconsin who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is leading an investigation into the former vice president nearly identical to the one Trump pushed for in Ukraine that led to his impeachment earlier this year, and which echoes allegations being made in Russian-owned propaganda outlets. On Wednesday, Johnson denied being part of any Russian effort. “This is all being fabricated by Democrats. Have them point to something that we’ve released that’s Russian disinformation,” he told HuffPost. “We’re gathering information, but I’m not aware of anything that is Russian disinformation.” One former pro-Russian Ukrainian lawmaker, though, told The Washington Post that material showing the former vice president’s efforts to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired has been turned over to Johnson’s committee. Oleksandr Onyshchenko is among a group of pro-Russian Ukrainians, including one graduate of a KGB school, who have ramped up claims against Biden and released batches of edited audiotapes. They have said more material would be released closer to the election, when it would be more useful to Trump. The effort mirrors Putin’s role in 2016, when emails stolen by his intelligence services from the Democratic National Committee and from a top campaign aide to nominee Hillary Clinton were released through WikiLeaks on a near daily basis in the final month before the election. Then-candidate Trump had been informed starting with an August intelligence briefing that Russia was behind the email thefts, and that connection was announced publicly on Oct. 7 by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Despite this, Trump began using the material anyway, starting with his Oct. 10 rally straight through Election Day, citing it in his rally speeches and news interviews as proof that Clinton was corrupt. Clinton and her campaign, while occasionally pointing out that Putin would prefer a Trump presidency, never made a serious effort to publicize Russia’s role in the WikiLeaks material. Four years later, the Biden campaign is taking a much more aggressive stance. “I am putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments on notice. If elected president, I will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation’s government,” Biden said in a statement Monday. “If any foreign power recklessly chooses to interfere in our democracy, I will not hesitate to respond as president to impose substantial and lasting costs.” On Wednesday, his campaign hit Johnson directly. “As Ron Johnson demonstrated over the last 24 hours, he is complicit in a foreign attack against the very sovereignty of our elections, and that kind of assault against our democracy cannot stand,” Biden spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement to HuffPost. “Donald Trump himself has attempted to launch several foreign influence operations, including when he got himself impeached trying to force Ukraine to spread this same long-debunked, hardcore rightwing conspiracy theory.” Trump in 2019, through his emissaries in the State Department and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, tried to coerce the new Ukrainian president into announcing investigations of Biden, whom he and his campaign feared would be the strongest Democratic challenger against him. Trump eventually withheld $391 million in military aid to the country, which remains under siege from Russia, as leverage but released the funds after the hold became public. Trump wound up getting impeached by the House for abusing his power and then trying to cover it up, but Johnson and every other Republican senator except Utah’s Mitt Romney permitted Trump to remain in office. Trump and his campaign continue to push a claim that Biden, during his years as vice president, tried to protect his son’s role at a Ukrainian energy company by getting a prosecutor who was investigating the company and its owner fired. In fact, the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was widely viewed as corrupt, and his dismissal was a priority for the Obama administration, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and others who saw it as a necessary step to increasing Western investment into the former Soviet republic. Indeed, Shokin had dropped an investigation into the energy company, Burisma, by the time he was fired ― meaning that Biden’s push to remove him actually endangered his son’s income stream rather than protected it. During House hearings leading to Trump’s impeachment, officials from Trump’s own administration testified that Biden was carrying out both United States and Western European policy when he pressured the Ukrainian leader at the time into dismissing Shokin. Fiona Hill, a Russia expert on Trump’s National Security Council, said a related claim by Trump ― that it had been Ukraine that had interfered in the 2016 election, and on behalf of Clinton; not Russia on Trump’s behalf ― was Russian propaganda. “In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests,” Hill testified during a House impeachment hearing, addressing Republican members who were trying to protect Trump.",2.5039357762297403,4.015700599918154,-1.5117648236884138,12

On Sunday, the pop superstar posted a clip of a mid-concert speech she delivered during the St. Petersburg stop on her 2012 MDNA Tour. In it, she doubles down on her support for LGBTQ rights, telling the crowd, “We want to fight for the right to be free, to be who we are.” “I am here to say that the gay community and gay people, here and all around the world, have the same rights [as everyone else] to be treated with dignity, with respect, with tolerance, with compassion, with love,” she tells the crowd, many of whom signal their agreement by hoisting rainbow flags into the air. In a caption accompanying the video, Madonna said that she was slapped with a $1 million fine by the Russian government for the speech, but that she “never paid.” A post shared by Madonna (@madonna) on Jul 19, 2020 at 7:42pm PDT Days after the performance, the Queen of Pop was reportedly sued by a group calling itself the Trade Union of Russian Citizens for blasphemy in connection with the speech. The group sought $10 million in damages, but the suit was later dropped. While the Kremlin has yet to respond to Madonna’s latest claim, her 2012 concert made global headlines as it coincided with a firestorm of controversy over Russia’s opposition to LGBTQ rights. In 2013, the Russian government came under fire from human rights groups when it enacted a law forbidding the distribution of “gay propaganda” to minors. In more recent years, officials have tried to dismiss troubling allegations that gay men are being detained, tortured and even killed in the Russian republic of Chechnya. And last week, lawmakers submitted draft legislation that would effectively ban same-sex marriage in Russia after voters backed changes to the constitution that would define marriage as a union of a man and a woman. Other stars, including Lady Gaga and Elton John, have also spoken out in defense of LGBTQ rights during performances in Russia. Not surprisingly, Madonna’s subsequent concert treks ― 2015’s Rebel Heart Tour and 2019’s Madame X Tour ― have bypassed Russia altogether.",4.84267019274035,4.243016828198147,0.5996533645422026,2

Stone “remains a convicted felon,” Mueller snapped. The Russia investigation into possible collusion with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election was of “paramount importance,” Mueller wrote. “Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so.” Mueller said he was “compelled” to respond to “broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper, and to specific claims that Roger Stone was a victim of our office.” Trump has repeatedly insisted that Stone was an unfair target of a so-called illegal Russian investigation “witch hunt.” He repeated those claims Saturday. “Roger Stone was treated horrible,” Trump told reporters (see the video above). “Roger Stone was brought into this witch hunt ... and the Mueller scam, and he was treated very unfairly.” The president claimed “people” are “very happy” that he commuted Stone’s three-year sentence days before he was to report to prison. Trump’s action was hugely controversial, particularly since he stood to benefit if Stone kept his mouth shut, and rewarded him when he did. Stone said as much Friday to NBC journalist Howard Fineman. The president “knows I was under enormous pressure to turn on him,” Stone told Fineman. “It would have eased my situation considerably. But I didn’t.” Mueller pointed out in his op-ed that Russia’s actions interfering with the election were a “threat to America’s democracy. It was critical that they be investigated and understood.” The probe established that the “Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome,” Mueller said. By late 2016, the FBI had “evidence that the Russians had signaled to a Trump campaign adviser that they could assist the campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging” to Trump’s rival, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Mueller wrote. “And the FBI knew that the Russians had done just that: Beginning in July 2016, WikiLeaks released emails stolen by Russian military intelligence officers from the Clinton campaign,” he added. Stone, a longtime GOP operative and Trump’s confidant and campaign adviser, became a “central figure” in the investigation, Mueller wrote. Stone “communicated in 2016 with individuals known to us to be Russian intelligence officers, and he claimed advance knowledge of WikiLeaks’ release of emails stolen by those Russian intelligence officers,” Mueller noted. Stone “lied repeatedly to members of Congress. He lied about the identity of his intermediary to WikiLeaks,” Mueller wrote. He lied when he denied he had “communicated with the Trump campaign about the timing of WikiLeaks’ releases. ... And he tampered with a witness,” Mueller added. “We made every decision in Stone’s case, as in all our cases, based solely on the facts and the law and in accordance with the rule of law,” he concluded. “The women and men who conducted these investigations and prosecutions acted with the highest integrity. Claims to the contrary are false.” Read Mueller’s entire op-ed in The Washington Post here.",3.060842175129974,4.189014903374773,-1.1281727282447984,12

A woman says her uncle has discovered she is gay. If he tells her father, a government official in the southern Russian republic where gay people are systematically tortured, he might murder her. She isn’t sure how to flee without getting caught, hence the reason she’s seeking counsel from David Isteev, the person who initiated the call. He’s part of the Russian LGBT Network, an activist group that executes risky missions to help relocate oppressed Chechen queers to other parts of Russia, as well places in Eurasia and Canada. Considering that the U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that employers cannot discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, it can be easy to forget how violent anti-queer intolerance remains in some parts of the world. “Welcome to Chechnya,” premiering Tuesday on HBO, is a striking reminder. Moreover, it introduces a revolutionary way to chronicle persecution without risking harm to already vulnerable victims. What began as a police-led drug raid in 2017 resulted in a region-wide purge when authorities discovered gay photographs and text messages on a man’s phone. They beat him and coerced him into turning in other gay men, setting off a domino effect. Scores of people were publicly abused and arrested, prompting the formation of the activist coalition that “Chechnya” follows. David France, the Oscar-nominated documentarian whose credits include “How to Survive a Plague” and “The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson,” first learned of the Russian LGBT Network in a July 2017 New Yorker article. Wanting to capture the crisis on film, France flew to Moscow to meet survivors who had been transferred to safe houses. He’d planned a weekend “fact-finding mission,” but wound up staying for a month. Before he knew it, cameras were rolling. France visited hideouts and tracked down refugees, estimating that 65% of the ones he approached agreed to participate with the understanding that their identities be concealed. “Before I started making documentary films, I was a print journalist, and I have a great deal of foreign reporting experience in my past,” France said. “But I had never reported from Russia, so it was a crash course for me to understand the dynamics there and the risk that it takes to tell a story like this in Russia, and to develop what amounted to really extraordinary security protocols, both for myself and the team to make sure we are safe, and also for the people who we were visiting in their shelters to make sure nothing that we did would expose them or their location.” That’s where the hardest work came in. The goal, France said, was to mask the participants so thoroughly that not even their own parents could recognize them. France had 20 months’ worth of footage by the time he started assembling the film, having left encrypted cameras in some of the safe houses that allowed refugees to document themselves. The director assumed he’d use traditional visual-effects methods to anonymize everyone, namely rotoscoping, an animation technique that turns live-action material into realistic cartoons. But upon applying the rotoscoping, France discovered it wasn’t viable. “It either completely erased the humanity of the people whose stories I was telling, or it rendered them, unexpectedly, even more recognizable,” he said. “It kind of made them into caricatures of themselves.” France spent a few months exploring various options, which ultimately led him to Ryan Laney, a VFX specialist who has worked on Hollywood blockbusters such as “Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones,” “Hancock” and “Ant-Man.” Laney said he is known as someone who finds “unorthodox” solutions to complicated effects problems. When he got a call in September 2018 from a colleague who’d been contacted by France’s production company, Public Square Films, Laney immediately wanted to help. Laney and a small team spent nine months experimenting with ways to fashion a technology that camouflaged faces but still captured the real person’s expressions. The intent was for audiences to feel survivors’ every emotion as they escape Chechnya and transition to a new life, which traditional identity-obscuring procedures — think blacked-out faces and improbable voice disguises — wouldn’t allow for. The VFX producers landed on an automated version of what stunt doubles do on big movies. France recruited approximately two dozen local activists to stand in for the subjects in the film. On a soundstage in Brooklyn, Laney shot footage of those activists that could later be filtered onto refugee’s faces through computers. “Our goal here was to create a journalistic tool,” he said. “Humans are really engineered to read faces, and when you’re telling a story with someone in shadow or behind a screen or with their face blurred out, there’s so much information that’s lost. The idea that a documentary filmmaker could tell the same story in a more compelling way seemed really powerful, but then we realized that not only will this help the documentary filmmaker — it will help the witness. If a witness has more confidence that their identity can be preserved, the more likely they’ll be to speak. It changes the dialogue for telling these stories.” In conjunction with Dartmouth College’s neuropsychology lab, France commissioned a study to measure the effectiveness of the efforts. Participants watched a clip in which a subject’s face had been given several different VFX treatments, after which they scored the impact of each. Laney’s method rated just as high as imagery of the subjects without any effects at all. France then allowed each survivor featured in “Chechnya” to sign off on their new likeness before deeming the project complete. The final results are astonishing. It’s not that you can’t tell there are effects while watching the film — it’s that they don’t matter. Every late-night absconding, every panicked moment and every sigh of relief comes through vibrantly, contrasting the grainy scenes of battery and torment that Chechen extremists consider keepsake trophies. In the past, France’s documentaries have provided a sort of catharsis. “How to Survive a Plague,” which depicts the AIDS crisis, ends as a success story: Thanks to advocacy on the ground, that epidemic has dwindled, proving that society can overcome bigotry. There’s hope to be found in “Welcome to Chechnya,” but it doesn’t have the advantage of hindsight. This purge is still happening. According to the film’s postscript, the Russian LGBT Network relocated 151 people in its first two years of existence. But Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of the Chechen Republic, continues to deny that queer people are suffering — a notion Russian President Vladimir Putin has endorsed. Adding insult to injury, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has not accepted any Chechen asylum seekers. With the existence of “Welcome to Chechnya,” the humanitarian emergency is now impossible to deny. “We wanted stories that really explained the facts on the ground and told the larger story of what it meant to survive that kind of torture and abuse, what it meant to be so forcibly dislocated from your homeland, and what it meant to be the activist who had sacrificed so much and put so much of their lives in danger to carry out this heroic work,” France said.",3.5283863055178664,3.906663165139815,-0.3782768596219488,2

A group of veterans opposed to President Donald Trump released a new video calling him out over reports that the U.S. government knew the Russian military paid bounties to Afghan militants for killing American soldiers. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Trump was briefed on the situation in March, but took no action against Russia. To the contrary, Trump said he would like to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the next G-7 meeting in September. Trump said on Twitter that he was not briefed about the alleged bounties, called the Times “fake news” and claimed “nobody’s been tougher on Russia” than his administration. VoteVets ripped into him. “Putin owns Donald Trump,” the organization wrote on Twitter, along with the #TRE45SON hashtag that went viral over the weekend.

President Donald Trump on Sunday said that he was never briefed about an alleged plot by Russian operatives to pay Taliban-linked militants in Afghanistan to kill American troops because U.S. intelligence officials did not find it credible. “Possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax, maybe by the Fake News [New York Times] wanting to make Republicans look bad!!!” he tweeted. Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @VP. Possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax, maybe by the Fake News @nytimesbooks, wanting to make Republicans look bad!!! In an earlier tweet, Trump accused The New York Times of using a fake “anonymous source” to report the alleged briefing. In fact, the Times report cited multiple officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It’s not uncommon for news outlets to grant anonymity to sources who aren’t authorized to speak publicly about information that may be newsworthy. “Everybody is denying it & there have not been many attacks on us,” Trump tweeted. He added of the Times report: “Who is their ‘source’?” The Fake News @ nytimes must reveal its “anonymous” source. Bet they can’t do it, this “person” probably does not even exist! The Times was the first to report on the alleged Russian operation. It was later confirmed by several outlets, including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and ABC News. All of these outlets reported that Russian intelligence officers offered bounties to Afghan militants to kill soldiers serving with coalition forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. and British troops. As of Sunday, the Times was the only outlet to report that Trump was personally briefed on the matter. The Times also reported that the National Security Council was made aware of the plot in late March. The White House has not yet taken any action against the Russian government in response to the reported plot, according to the Times. The reports sparked renewed accusations from Trump critics who say the president doesn’t take enough action against the Kremlin. Twenty-four Americans were killed in combat in Afghanistan between early 2019 and early 2020, reported the Times. It’s unclear whether any of the bounties Russian operatives may have paid to Afghan militants resulted in the deaths of any American soldiers. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement Saturday that neither Trump nor Pence were briefed on the matter. “The United States receives thousands of intelligence reports a day, and they are subject to strict scrutiny,” McEnany said. She added that her statement “does not speak to the merit of the alleged intelligence but to the inaccuracy of the New York Times story erroneously suggesting that President Trump was briefed on this matter.” Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe also denied that Trump and Pence were made aware of the alleged operation. Former Acting Director National Intelligence Richard Grenell, who served in that position when Trump was allegedly briefed, said Saturday that he had “never heard” of it. “No one would be fine with this if it were true,” Grenell tweeted in response to someone asking whether he was “fine” with the alleged Russian bounties. In their statements, Trump, McEnany and Ratcliffe did not confirm or deny reports that Russian agents offered to pay Afghan militants to kill U.S. soldiers. The Kremlin has denied the existence of any such operation. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Saturday slammed Trump for failing to “sanction and impose any kind of consequences on Russia for this egregious violation of international law.” He called the White House’s inaction a “betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation — to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way.” Instead of condemning the alleged Russian bounties, Trump on Sunday ranted about Biden’s statement. “Funny to see Corrupt Joe Biden reading a statement on Russia, which was obviously written by his handlers,” the president tweeted. “Russia ate his lunch and Obama’s lunch during their time in office, so badly that Obama wanted them out of the then-G-8.” Funny to see Corrupt Joe Biden reading a statement on Russia, which was obviously written by his handlers. Russia ate his and Obama’s lunch during their time in office, so badly that Obama wanted them out of the then G-8. U.S. was weak on everything, but especially Russia! Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking Republican in the House, called on the White House to answer questions about the alleged Russian bounties, including who knew about the plot and when, and what has been done to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable. “Why weren’t the president or vice president briefed?” she tweeted.",3.735267467667717,3.7934820655072983,-0.05821459783958138,6

Twitter and other social media companies were harshly criticized in the wake of the 2016 presidential election for failing to police propaganda, especially from accounts launched by the Kremlin in a bid to sway the election in Donald Trump’s favor. Twitter on Thursday reemphasized the company’s vow to provide more vigorous and transparent action to weed out false conversations being peddled to manipulate a nation’s politics. “Ultimately our goal is to serve the public conversation, remove bad faith actors, and to advance public understanding of these critical topics,” Twitter said.

Twitter removed 1,152 accounts (which tweeted 3.4 million times) associated with Current Policy, a “media website engaging in state-backed political propaganda within Russia,” including activities “promoting the United Russia party and attacking political dissidents,” according to the company. The accounts, which also disseminated “anti-Western content,” violated Twitter policy because they engaged in “cross-posting and amplifying content in an inauthentic, coordinated manner for political ends,” the company said.

The president fired Bolton in September. “I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn’t driven by reelection calculations,” Bolton writes, saying he was often “astonished” by Trump’s singular motivation. Bolton, one of the most controversial figures in American foreign policy, described Trump as a “president for whom getting reelected was the only thing that mattered, even if it meant endangering or weakening the nation.” The former adviser also argues in the book excerpts that the House committed impeachment malpractice by leading a trial focused narrowly on Trump’s transgressions with Ukraine, and that the House should have also explored similar foreign policy violations Trump has committed elsewhere. It’s currently unclear what other incidents Bolton has in mind. “Trump’s Ukraine-like transgressions existed across the full range of his foreign policy — and Bolton documents exactly what those were, and attempts by him and others in the Administration to raise alarms about them,” the Simon & Schuster news release states. But Bolton wasn’t willing to speak out against the president when it really mattered: during Trump’s impeachment trial. At the time, Bolton threatened a legal battle if Congress subpoenaed him and ultimately did not testify in the proceedings. Reports during the lead-up to the impeachment trial alleged Bolton’s opposition to appearing was rooted in a desire to distance himself from being implicated in any crimes.

The disaster happened on May 29 at a power plant in the remote Russian industrial city of Norilsk, about 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle. A collapsed fuel tank began spilling diesel into nearby rivers and a reservoir, ABC News reported. Two rivers, the Ambarnaya and Daldykan, turned shades of red. State of emergency in Norilsk after 20,000 tons of diesel leaks into Arctic river system. Fear that thawing permafrost caused damage to storage tank  Norilsk Nickel, the mining conglomerate that owns the plant, said melting permafrost ― in the wake of Russia’s warmest winter since temperatures have been recorded ― may have been to blame: The thaw made the ground unstable beneath the diesel storage tank. “What we can suggest is that as a result of the abnormally mild temperatures, a melting of the permafrost could have happened that led to the partial subsiding of the support on which the tank sits,” according to a company statement reported by ABC. Permafrost is ground that has been continuously frozen for at least two years, and much permafrost has been frozen for tens or hundreds of thousands of years. “Entire cities and roads were built on permafrost,” Guido Grosse, a permafrost expert at Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute, told Bloomberg Green. “When permafrost thaws, the ice deep in the ground that has been there for thousands of years melts, and you lose stability. That has an impact on infrastructure.” Arctic permafrost has been melting at an alarming rate in recent years, threatening human communities, wildlife and potentially releasing millions of tons of additional carbon into the air as it thaws. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a state of emergency to clean up the spill this week and criticized Norilsk Nickel, saying it did not alert government officials about what happened soon enough. “Why did government agencies only find out about this two days after the fact?” Putin said in a video conference, as widely translated. “Are we going to learn about emergency situations from social media?” Vyacheslav Starostin, the power plant’s manager, has been detained in a criminal investigation. The region “will be seeing the repercussions for years to come,” Sergey Verkhovets of WWF Russia said in a statement translated by The New York Times. “We are talking about dead fish, polluted plumage of birds and poisoned animals.” A full cleanup could take five to 10 years. Norilsk Nickel was also responsible for turning the Daldykan blood red, apparently from pollution, in 2016, and the sulfur dioxide the plant emits has resulted in a “dead zone” around it that’s twice the size of Rhode Island.",5.076124669406005,5.752690417821703,-0.6765657484156975,5

Flynn, tapped as Donald Trump’s national security adviser at the time, reached out to Kislyak a number of times before his boss was in the White House. He urged Kislyak to not “go any further than you have to” in responding to the sanctions. “They’re gonna dismiss some number of Russians out of the country, I understand all that,” Flynn told Kislyak regarding the sanctions, according to the transcripts of a call dated Dec. 29, 2016, released Friday. “But what I would ask Russia to do is ... to only make it reciprocal. Make it reciprocal. Don’t ... go any further than you have to. Because I don’t want us to get into something that has to escalate, on a, you know, on a tit for tat. You follow me, Ambassador?” Flynn said if the Russian response was “even-keeled,” that “is a good message and we’ll understand that message,” according to the call that was intercepted by U.S. intelligence. Flynn had a number of phone conversations with Kislyak beginning in December. He left his post as national security adviser in February 2017 after offering contradictory information about the conversations and later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the calls. Flynn early this year asked to withdraw his guilty plea, and the Department of Justice has moved to drop the case against him. The president’s supporters claim that the Flynn surveillance was a subterfuge for the FBI to launch an illegitimate probe into the Trump administration. Democrats say that Flynn’s secret talks were sign of possible collusion between the Kremlin and the incoming administration that justified the investigation. Flynn and Kislyak never discussed the Kremlin orchestrated hack of Democratic Party emails in the transcripts. But Flynn also did not say anything negative to Kislyak about Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election that had been uncovered by the American intelligence community. Kislyak responded to Flynn in a follow-up call that “our conversation was ... taken into account” in Moscow. “Your proposal that we need to act with cold heads ... is exactly what is invested in the decision,” Kislyak added. He told Flynn “we will be able to start working in more constructive way” in two weeks, when Trump would be in office. Trump was delighted with Russia’s moderate response to the sanctions. Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! Flynn and Kisylak also discussed cooperation in the Middle East, and setting up a “secure video line” between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn’s attorney, Sidney Powell, insisted the transcripts show Flynn did “nothing wrong,” and that he should be “applauded” for reining in tensions between the two countries, The Wall Street Journal reported. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Friday that the calls clearly reveal Flynn lied to the FBI about them. The calls also underscore that Flynn was trying to mute a response to sanctions imposed because Russian interfered in U.S. elections in a bid to help Trump, he added. His message to the Kremlin was that the Trump administration would now forge a new course more favorable to Russia, Schiff noted. The transcripts were provided to members of Congress by new Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe after outgoing director Richard Grenell declassified them and revealed a list of Obama administration officials who viewed Flynn’s identity in intelligence reports collected by the National Security Agency.

Among the sick were several top Kremlin officials including Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, as well as the heads of Russia’s construction and culture ministries. The chief of Moscow’s main coronavirus hospital, Denis Protsenko, and Putin’s first deputy chief of staff, Sergei Kiriyenko, have also tested positive for the disease. Despite the rising number of cases, Putin — who has spent over a month mostly in isolation at his country residence outside Moscow — announced on Monday that Russia was ready to lift its partial economic lockdown. “The nationwide nonworking regime is coming to an end,” Putin said in an address to the nation, AP reported. “Gradually, and very carefully, we are starting to ease the restrictions.” He stressed, however, that Russia still has “a long and difficult process ahead of us with no room for mistakes.”",5.297320493783482,5.791307734498429,-0.49398724071494726,27

To the shock of legal experts nationwide, the Justice Department on Thursday dropped charges against Flynn, a former White House national security adviser who previously pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. Prior to the Justice Department dropping the charges, President Donald Trump had hinted at potentially pardoning Flynn. The president said late last month that he would “certainly consider” bringing Flynn back into his administration. Asked Friday if he would be okay with such a move, Pence appeared to say yes. “I think Gen. Michael Flynn is an American patriot,” the vice president said. “He served this country with great distinction in uniform. And now I believe a decision by the Justice Department lays bare what was clearly prosecutorial abuse. And for my part, I’d be happy to see Michael Flynn again.” A representative for Pence did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. Flynn initially said he had not discussed possible changes to U.S. foreign policy toward Russia with Kislyak prior to Trump’s inauguration. Flynn later admitted that he had. A day after Flynn’s guilty plea, Trump tweeted that he “had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.” Flynn has tried to withdraw his guilty plea in recent months, claiming that he had been illegally entrapped by the FBI agents who had questioned him. A federal judge rejected that argument in December. The Justice Department inspector general wrote in a report that same month that the FBI has sufficient evidence to investigate Flynn as part of its probe into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. But in a court filing last week, Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Timothy Shea said that even if Flynn lied about his conversations with Kislyak, Flynn’s lies were irrelevant to the FBI’s probe into his Russia contacts. Pence told reporters last month that he was “more inclined” to believe Flynn unintentionally misled him in 2017 about communications with Kislyak.",4.6312448052441635,3.009628346189887,1.6216164590542763,19

I study history,” he continued, explaining how he reacted to the investigation into whether his campaign conspired with Russia to sway the 2016 election. “And the firing of everybody — I should’ve in one way, but I’m glad I didn’t, because look at the way it turned out. They’re all a bunch of crooks and they got caught.” He added: “Of course there was one difference, one big difference. Number one, he may have been guilty. And number two, he had tapes all over the place. I wasn’t guilty. I did nothing wrong, and there are no tapes. But I wish there were tapes in my case.” Trump, in fact, pretended there were tapes of him discussing the Russia probe with then-FBI Director James Comey. TRUMP: ""I learned a lot from Richard Nixon -- don't fire people. I learned a lot. I study history ... of course there was one big difference: Number one he may have been guilty and number two he had tapes all over the place.""  And he has ousted multiple officials from his administration connected to the Russia investigation, including Comey (an exception he acknowledged) and Attorney General Jeff Sessions (whom he called a “disaster”). Trump and his Fox acolytes got on the subject the day after the president’s Justice Department dropped charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia during the probe into Russian election interference. Flynn quit the White House in disgrace after less than a month on the job. Trump may have been holding up Nixon as a cautionary tale. In a famous October 1973 moment called the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox and received the resignations of Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus as the Watergate scandal intensified. Nixon resigned in 1974 before the House could vote to impeach him. Trump was impeached for withholding aid to Ukraine in a demand for investigations of Joe Biden and his son.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) for Obama administration records of “certain meetings connected to Ukraine.” The congressmen’s request was “not proper,” said the March 13 letter, obtained and first reported by BuzzFeed News. “The request for early release of presidential records in order to give credence to a Russian disinformation campaign ― one that has already been thoroughly investigated by a bipartisan congressional committee ― is without precedent,” the letter said. Scoop: In a letter to the National Archives, former president Barack Obama blasted the Senate GOP investigation into Joe Biden and alleged Ukrainian election interference, calling it an effort to ""to give credence to a Russian disinformation campaign.""  According to BuzzFeed, the letter represents the first reported comments by Obama or his team on the investigation ― led by Johnson and Grassley ― into whether Biden, as vice president, withheld aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to drop a probe into Burisma Holdings, an energy company with ties to Biden’s son. No evidence has emerged to date of any misconduct by the Bidens in the case. Johnson’s spokesman responded to Obama’s letter on Tuesday, telling BuzzFeed that “the accusation that our oversight gives ‘credence to a Russian disinformation campaign’ is unfounded.” “Baseless accusations aside, our legitimate oversight will continue until we get answers for the American people,” the spokesman added. Biden emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president following Bernie Sanders’ departure from the race last month. Obama formally endorsed his former vice president for the nation’s top job a few days after Sanders bowed out of the contest. “Joe has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery,” Obama said at the time. “I know he’ll surround himself with good people ― experts, scientists, military officials who actually know how to run the government and care about doing a good job running the government, and know how to work with our allies, and who will always put the American people’s interests above their own.”",2.9692584044873627,2.788202645983592,0.18105575850377065,12

Ukraine’s Emergency Situations Service said it was still fighting the fires, but that the situation was under control. Video footage shot by Reuters on Sunday showed plumes of black smoke billowing into the sky and trees still ablaze, with firefighters in helicopters trying to put out the fires. Aerial images of the 30-kilometer (19-mile) exclusion zone around the plant, site of the world’s worst nuclear accident in 1986, showed scorched, blackened earth and the charred stumps of still smouldering trees. The Emergency Situations Service said radiation levels in the exclusion zone had not changed and those in nearby Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, “did not exceed natural background levels.” Wildfires that have been burning for days in northern Ukraine are moving closer to the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant, and radiation levels are reportedly spiking  Greenpeace Russia said the situation is much worse than Ukrainian authorities believe, and that the fires cover an area one thousand times bigger than they claim. On April 4 Ukrainian authorities said the blaze covered an area of 20 hectares, but Greenpeace cited satellite images showing it was around 12,000 hectares in size at that time. “According to satellite images taken on Monday, the area of the largest fire has reached 34,400 hectares,” it said, adding that a second fire, stretching across 12,600 hectares, was just one kilometer away from the defunct plant. Ukrainian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those claims. Rashid Alimov, head of energy projects at Greenpeace Russia, said the fires, fanned by the wind, could disperse radionuclides, atoms that emit radiation. “A fire approaching a nuclear or hazardous radiation facility is always a risk,” Alimov said. “In this case we’re hoping for rain tomorrow.” Chernobyl tour operator Yaroslav Yemelianenko, writing on Facebook, described the situation as critical. He said the fire was rapidly expanding and had reached the abandoned city of Pripyat, two kilometers from where “the most highly active radiation waste of the whole Chernobyl zone is located.” He called on officials to warn people of the danger. Satellite images taken by NASA Worldview and seen by Reuters showed the two fires had extended far into the exclusion zone. The fires, which follow unusually dry weather, began on April 3 in the western part of the exclusion zone and spread to nearby forests. Police say they have identified a 27-year old local resident who they accuse of deliberately starting the blaze. It remains unclear if the person, who has reportedly confessed to starting a number of fires “for fun,” is partly or fully responsible",6.64594876802096,6.942014804507828,-0.29606603648686747,22

In a July 25 phone call, Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into unfounded accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. At the time, Trump was withholding military aid from Ukraine, a form of coercion for political gain that led to his impeachment in the House. Trump notified the Senate committee of his intention to fire Atkinson and remove him from his post as inspector general of U.S. intelligence agencies, which will be effective 30 days from Friday, according to congressional officials and a copy of Trump’s notification in a letter obtained by several media outlets. “As is the case with regard to other positions where I, as President, have the power of appointment ... it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general,” Trump wrote. “That is no longer the case with regard to this Inspector General.” Trump is removing the inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, per letter sent to lawmakers tonight.  Atkinson was appointed by Trump, but the president blamed him for exposing the July 25 phone call, The New York Times has reported. Trump was surprised Atkinson alerted Congress about the call, he told confidants, according to the Times, which said Trump considered the action disloyal and accused Atkinson of working with the Democrats to undermine his presidency. Critics slammed the move. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) called the “dead of night decision” a “blatant attempt to gut the independence of the Intelligence community and retaliate against those who dare to expose presidential wrongdoing.” Trump’s dead of night decision to fire ICIG Michael Atkinson is another blatant attempt to gut the independence of the Intelligence Community and retaliate against those who dare to expose presidential wrongdoing.It puts our country and national security at even greater risk.

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Monday claimed the way President Donald Trump’s administration appears to be favoring some states over others with its distribution of federal aid amid the coronavirus pandemic “feels like Ukraine all over again.” Murphy was asked by MSNBC’s Chris Hayes if he was concerned about “an uneven response federally that depends on the politics of the governor at play and the degree to which the president’s ego is massaged.” Trump last week revealed he told Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House coronavirus task force, to shun certain Democratic governors that he doesn’t like, Hayes noted. “It sort of feels like Ukraine all over again,” said Murphy, referring to Trump’s impeachment for withholding aid to Ukraine in exchange for the announcement of an investigation into his potential 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden. Explained Murphy: You know, the president is, you know, now instead of using foreign aid, using emergency relief in order to try to get people to do his political bidding.

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) plans to vote in support of issuing a subpoena in the investigation into Hunter Biden’s work with the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, a spokesperson for the senator said Friday. Romney’s vote will be the tipping point for the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, giving Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) just enough support to proceed with a subpoena. The news comes despite the Utah senator telling reporters on Thursday that “there’s no question” the probe into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and Burisma seems politically motivated, given Biden’s recent successes during the Democratic presidential primary. “Senator Romney has expressed his concerns to Chairman Johnson, who has confirmed that any interview of the witness would occur in a closed setting without a hearing or public spectacle,” Romney spokesperson Liz Johnson said in a statement. “He will therefore vote to let the Chairman proceed to obtain the documents that have been offered.” Johnson is seeking a subpoena for records from Andrii Telizhenko, a former consultant who worked with Burisma. Telizhenko, a Rudy Giuliani ally, has indicated he’s willing to cooperate with Johnson’s investigation. Romney said Thursday that before deciding to back a subpoena, he’d need to see what information Johnson has. “I would hope if there’s something of significance that needs to be evaluated, it be done by the FBI or some other agency that’s not as political as perhaps a committee of our body,” he said. Last month, Romney was the only Republican to break from his party and vote to convict President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial for pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and Hunter’s work with Burisma.",2.459004985486552,3.79690885361734,-1.337903868130788,16

Asked if he believes there are lessons the Trump administration can learn on election meddling, Biden told host Margaret Brennan that the administration is “incapable” of evolving on the matter. “They like this,” the Democratic presidential candidate said during the interview. “Come on, let’s be fair here. They’ve known this for a long time, for three years.” “Every intelligence agency has told them [that the Russians] continue to be engaged in this activity,” he added. “There is not any question anymore. ... And what’s he doing? Zero. What is the Republican leadership in the United States Senate and Congress doing? Zero.” RUSSIAN ELECTION INTERFERENCE: @JoeBiden to @margbrennan: ""Look, this administration is incapable of learning elections. They like this. Come on. Let's be fair here. They've known this for a long time, for three years.""  The U.S. intelligence community’s top election security official reportedly told House lawmakers earlier this month that Russia wants Trump to win reelection in November. Separately, U.S. intelligence officials last month told Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign that the Kremlin was apparently also seeking to help the Democratic candidate’s bid. Sanders denounced Russia’s interference and demanded Russian President Vladimir Putin “stay out of American elections.” Trump, in contrast, has attacked Democrats over reports that Russia is trying to help him win reelection, accusing those across the aisle of spreading “disinformation.” Russian agents, during the 2016 campaign, hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s server and orchestrated a massive disinformation campaign to help get Trump elected, according to U.S. intelligence agencies. Biden on Sunday said he’s been targeted by Russian bots on Facebook because the Kremlin doesn’t want him to be the Democratic nominee. Asked whether it was Facebook or U.S. intelligence officials who informed him of this, Biden said he was alerted by his staff. “I have not spoken to the intelligence community, but I think the intelligence community should inform the rest of us who are running what they told Senator Sanders,” he said. Trump is “angry” that intelligence officials informed Sanders and other members of Congress about some of Russia’s meddling efforts in the 2020 election cycle, Biden said, adding that the administration must do more to secure the integrity of our elections. “Why in God’s name haven’t we hardened the electoral process, provided ... hundreds of millions of dollars to states to be able to harden their voter rolls, make sure they can’t be attacked ... as a consequence of cyber attacks?” Biden continued. “Why haven’t we provided the capacity for them to be able to have the money to have paper ballots in addition to that?” “This is outrageous,” he said.

When asked by ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos whether he’s seen anything from the intelligence community that indicates Russia is working to bring about Trump’s re-election, national security adviser Robert O’Brien said no. “I haven’t seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to attempt to get President Trump re-elected,” O’Brien said, noting that, as a national security adviser, he gets “pretty good access” to information from the intelligence community. The full interview with O’Brien aired on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” on Sunday. A transcript was made public Saturday. ""I haven't seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to attempt to get President Trump reelected,"" Robert O'Brien tells @GStephanopoulos amid reports that intel officials told lawmakers Russia is meddling in 2020, with a preference for Trump.  O’Brien called the reports a “non-story,” despite Russia’s history of tampering with elections in Trump’s favor. The intelligence community concluded in 2017 that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee with the ultimate aim of helping secure Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential contest. The Associated Press, citing anonymous sources, received contradicting reports about whether there was intel on Russia pushing for Trump’s reelection. An intelligence official told the AP that intelligence officials did not tell House committee members that Russia was trying to aid Trump’s campaign. However, others familiar with that meeting said Russia was indeed trying to do just that. One source who was present at the meeting with the director of national intelligence’s team said that O’Brien’s claims about Russia and Trump’s re-election campaign “do not accurately reflect” what they themselves heard at that meeting, CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta reported. Speaking to Stephanopoulos, O’Brien did agree with reports that Russia is trying to boost the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a front-runner in the Democratic primary. Sanders has emphatically rejected Russia’s help. In his interview with ABC, O’Brien attempted to link Sanders’ honeymoon, which took place in 1988, to Russia’s meddling. “That’s no surprise. He honeymooned in Moscow,” he said. Critics noted that Trump himself has taken numerous trips to Moscow and had business dealings there, including the Miss Universe pageant in 2013 and the Trump Organization’s previous plans to build a tower there. Yes Sanders honeymooned in Moscow as opposed to Trump who held a beauty pageant in Moscow, took money from Moscow investors, hired aides linked to Moscow, heaped praise on Putin, and publicly asked Russia to get his opponent’s emails in the midst of the 2016 election campaign. The most ugly, xenophobic, and casually imperialist thing in here is the handwringing about how Sanders went to Nicaragua and the Soviet Union in the ‘80s. On top of Cold War and dirty wars, it’s this idea that these places are not worth going to at all This is actually terrifying. The New York Times reported earlier this week that intelligence officials briefed the House Intelligence Committee on Russia’s attempts to interfere in the 2020 race in order to get Trump reelected. O’Brien said he had heard of the reports on the House committee being briefed. He admitted he wasn’t there, but claimed that he heard from those briefing the lawmakers that the reports were “not what they intended the story to be.” When asked if he has a responsibility as the national security adviser to find out whether reports that Russia wants Trump to win reelection are valid, O’Brien danced around the question. “I don’t know ― these are leaks,” O’Brien said. “I’m telling you I haven’t seen the intel and I haven’t seen the analysis.” Stephanopoulos interrupted, “Have you asked for it?” “Look, I want to get whatever analysis they’ve got and I want to make sure that the analysis is solid,” O’Brien said. “I mean, you know, from what I’ve heard ― again, this is only what I’m seeing in the press ― it doesn’t make any sense.” Robert O’Brien repeatedly says he has “not seen” U.S. intel reports that Russia is meddling in 2020 to help Trump.@GStephanopoulos: “Don’t you have a responsibility as national security adviser to find out?” O’Brien: ""... I haven’t seen the intel.""  O’Brien also denied reports that Trump scolded outgoing acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire after he learned that House lawmakers were briefed on Russia’s alleged attempts to meddle in the 2020 election in Trump’s favor. Trump announced this week that Maguire was leaving his post, and named Richard Grenell, an ally of the president, as his replacement. Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, on Sunday echoed O’Brien’s denials about Maguire’s ouster as well as reports that Russia favors Trump. “I think that there’s not intelligence that said that the Russians are trying to help Donald Trump win election,” Short said during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday.” “It’s hard to see why they would be choosing Donald Trump over Bernie Sanders,” he added. Host Chris Wallace noted that Shelby Pierson, the U.S. intelligence community’s top election security official, briefed Congress earlier this month about Russia developing “a preference” for Trump. Short said he wouldn’t comment on the classified congressional meeting, but claimed the president did not receive such information during his own briefing on election security. U.S. intel says Russia is interfering in American elections to help boost President Trump and Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. Marc Short weighs in on FOX News Sunday: “There is not intelligence that said that the Russians are trying to help Donald Trump win an election.”  On Friday, Sanders denounced Russia’s alleged interference in the election. “Unlike the current president, I stand firmly against their efforts, and any other foreign power that wants to interfere in our election,” Sanders said in a statement. “I don’t care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president,” he continued. “My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do. In 2016, Russia used internet propaganda to sow division in our country, and my understanding is that they are doing it again in 2020.”",3.974000688019886,3.0774557707887595,0.8965449172311266,12

Only Trump Is Helping Russia.,"U.S. intelligence officials believe Russia is trying to boost Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2020 Democratic primary race as part of its interference in this year’s presidential election, according to Sanders and news reports on Friday. Sanders moved to quickly and firmly reject Moscow’s involvement. His response was strikingly different from the way President Donald Trump has handled Russia’s meddling since the Republican first received Russian President Vladimir Putin’s support in the 2016 election and then was informed earlier this year that Putin wants to see him reelected. “Unlike the current president, I stand firmly against their efforts, and any other foreign power that wants to interfere in our election,” Sanders said in a statement he issued after The Washington Post broke the news Friday of the Russian efforts to help him claim the Democratic nomination. “I don’t care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president,” Sanders said. “My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do. In 2016, Russia used internet propaganda to sow division in our country, and my understanding is that they are doing it again in 2020.” Four years ago, Putin used online support for Sanders to worsen splits within the Democratic Party as he sought to secure Trump’s election. His aim now could be two-fold: exacerbating Democratic divisions again to weaken the anti-Trump coalition while bolstering a Sanders candidacy some political analysts believe Trump would find easy to attack as extreme. Sanders in his response on Friday focused on the national interest in rebuffing the Russian efforts. Campaigning in California on Friday, he told reporters, “It’s an ugly business, and all of us have got to say, sorry, you’re not going to do this in this election.” Putin in 2016 could have viewed Sanders’ relative silence on foreign policy beyond criticizing U.S. overreach as a sign he might be sympathetic to Moscow. But the senator has since articulated a vision of foreign policy that’s wary of Putin’s aggressive ultra-nationalism and support for oligarchs. He’s shown that just because he is skeptical of muscular demonstrations of U.S. power like military interventions, he does not endorse forces trying to undermine the U.S. or spread disinformation on Washington’s role in global issues like the Syrian civil war. In the 2016 campaign cycle, Trump denied receiving Russian support even as he openly invited it. His family and his advisors explored the possibility of such help privately and his aides ensured the GOP’s convention platform adopted a position on Ukraine softer than Republican orthodoxy at the time and in line with Putin’s interests. Once elected, Trump continued to reject the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia had interfered in the election and did his best to denigrate and thwart special counsel Robert Mueller’s lengthy probe into the matter. Trump continually has framed the concerns and findings about Russian interference as a personal attack on him by political enemies, and used the power of the U.S. government to push a conspiracy theory that exonerated Moscow. The New York Times reported last week that Trump became angry with Joseph McGuire, the acting director of national intelligence, for telling House lawmakers ― especially Democrats ― about Putin’s 2020 interference efforts. McGuire was replaced as the acting intelligence chief on Friday by Richard Grenell, a staunch Trump loyalist.

Trump has admitted that he sent Giuliani, his personal lawyer, to Ukraine to pressure officials to investigate unfounded accusations against political rival Joe Biden. During some of that time, Trump held up $390 million in military aid for Ukraine that had been approved by Congress. Giuliani’s business associate Lev Parnas, who has been indicted for alleged campaign finance violations, has said that he followed Giuliani’s instructions to tell Ukrainian officials that their nation would not receive any aid unless they announced an investigation into Biden. “Evidence suggests that Giuliani, who is President Trump’s personal attorney, manipulated federal funds — specifically aid to Ukraine — for partisan political purposes, which is prohibited” by the Hatch Act, said a statement Thursday by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The organization filed a complaint Thursday with the Southern District of New York, which is reportedly already investigating Giuliani’s activities in Ukraine. The Hatch Act prohibits, among other things, the manipulation of federal funds and federal programs to advance a partisan agenda. Trump was not the only person involved in the Ukraine scandal, and he's not the only one that should face consequences for it. Today, CREW sent SDNY a criminal complaint saying Rudy Giuliani’s actions in Ukraine were illegal and should be investigated. “Giuliani and his potential co-conspirators likely violated the Hatch Act by threatening to withhold congressionally authorized security assistance to Ukraine to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce investigations that would be politically beneficial to Giuliani’s client, President Trump,” the CREW statement added. CREW’s executive director, Noah Bookbinder, said that Giuliani’s work in Ukraine not only led to the president’s impeachment in the House but “also violated our country’s criminal laws.” Holding up the military aid was “dangerous and anti-democratic,” he said. Officials from the Southern District could not immediately be reached for comment. Read CREW’s entire letter to the SDNY here.",3.8485291835612654,2.9018625984287283,0.9466665851325371,16

He also suggested that House Democrats should consider holding weekly hearings on the threat with Richard Grenell, the new acting director of the Department of National Intelligence. McFaul said it’s no surprise that Russia is again interfering this election season in a bid to sway the vote for Trump — as American intelligence discovered in the 2016 election. “It is an intelligence assessment that Putin seeks Donald Trump’s victory again,” McFaul told Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC’s “Deadline White House.” “To me, that’s no great insight ... [it’s] very clear.” But what needs to be disseminated is what “concrete” steps that Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, may be taking to help make that happen, he added. “Let’s just start declassifying this stuff” before the November election “so the American people know what’s going on. That’s what the Obama administration was criticized for not doing in 2016.” McFaul also warned of the extreme danger of the “politicization of intelligence.” If all intelligence is “filtered through partisan politics, that means that the president is not getting an accurate picture of the threats out there, whether it’s pandemics, or nuclear weapons or terrorist attacks,” he added. Do not politicize intelligence ! #FactsMatter.

Hector Alejandro Cabrera Fuentes, who is a resident of Singapore, was prevented from boarding a plane from Miami International Airport to Mexico City on Sunday following a search of his and his wife’s cellphones by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday. The search uncovered a photo of a license plate that belonged to the government source, who had been providing information to the U.S. about the Russian Intelligence Service. The photo had been deleted from Fuentes’ wife’s phone, but not before it was sent to Fuentes through the messaging app WhatsApp, authorities said. The 35-year-old allegedly confessed that he had instructed his wife, who is from Mexico, to take the photo after he was recruited by a Russian government official in 2019. He told U.S. authorities he was recruited after his second wife and two children were detained by Russian customs officials during a visit in March, according to a copy of the criminal complaint. It’s not clear whether his two wives know about each other. Fuentes said that after his wife and children were detained, he traveled to Russia to see them and was approached there by an official he believed worked for the Russian government. That individual, in a later meeting, showed him a hard-copy printout of his Gmail account from 2015 and said that he knew Fuentes had been looking for real estate in the Miami area. Fuentes said he confirmed the authenticity of the printout and agreed that he had been looking for real estate, according to the complaint. The Russian official acknowledged the situation his family was in and allegedly told Fuentes that “we can help each other.” The two men met again in Russia in September and Fuentes said he was instructed to rent property at a condominium complex in Miami where the U.S. government source lived. He was told not to rent it under his name or to let his family in Russia know about their meetings. Fuentes agreed to this deal and in December provided $20,000 to an associate to rent property in the building in the associate’s name. When Fuentes and the official met again in Russia in early February, the Russian official instructed him to go to the condominium complex and locate the U.S. government source’s vehicle using a description provided. He was then told to obtain the vehicle’s license plate number and note its physical location in the building’s parking lot. He was told not to take a photo of the vehicle. On Feb. 14, one day after flying into the U.S. from Mexico City, authorities said Fuentes and his wife were seen tailgating another vehicle to gain access to the gated condo complex where the government source resides. Once inside, he was confronted by a security guard who questioned his business at the building. Fuentes gave the guard a name of someone he was visiting but the guard did not recognize the name and asked him and his wife to leave. As this discussion was happening, Fuentes’ wife snapped a photo of the license plate belonging to the U.S. government source’s parked vehicle. Two days later, on Feb. 16, Fuentes and his wife traveled to Miami International Airport with plans to fly to Mexico City. He was arrested the following day. Fuentes is charged with acting within the United States on behalf of a foreign government without notifying the attorney general, and conspiracy to do the same. At a court hearing on Tuesday, Fuentes said he had a variety of jobs around the world. One of his jobs as a researcher at the National University of Singapore pays him $7,500 a month. Another job with an Israeli company based in Germany pays him $5,000 a month, he said, according to the Miami Herald. A LinkedIn page for Fuentes lists him as having studied biology and biochemistry at universities in both Germany and Russia. Fuentes was assigned a public defender after reportedly telling the judge that it would be difficult for him to acquire money to pay for his own defense attorney. “None of my family knows I’m here,” he told the judge, according to the Herald. A pretrial detention hearing has been set for Friday morning.",5.0278192436526545,4.70337299769704,0.3244462459556141,27

Trump on Thursday explained why he chose to “use Rudy” in an interview for Fox News host Geraldo Rivera’s podcast, perhaps feeling at ease after being acquitted by the Republican-led Senate earlier this month. “Was it strange to send Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine, your personal lawyer? Are you sorry you did that?” Rivera asked Trump. “No, not at all,” Trump said. “Here’s my choice: I deal with the Comeys of the world, or I deal with Rudy,” he continued, referring to former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired in 2017 after the FBI began investigating his 2016 campaign. The investigation mushroomed into special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian election interference. Trump said he has “a very bad taste” for U.S. intelligence officials because of Mueller’s investigation, so he chose Giuliani to do his bidding. “So when you tell me, why did I use Rudy? And one of the things about Rudy, number one, he was the best prosecutor, you know, one of the best prosecutors, and the best mayor,” Trump told Rivera. “But also, other presidents had them. FDR had a lawyer who was practically, you know, was totally involved with government. Eisenhower had a lawyer. They all had lawyers.” In November, Trump denied that he sent Giuliani to Ukraine, despite congressional testimony from multiple witnesses, including career diplomats and government officials, who said Giuliani met with and pressured Ukrainian officials as part of Trump’s plot to coerce a foreign government into aiding his reelection. “No, I didn’t direct him, but he is a warrior, he is a warrior,” Trump said in an interview on former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly’s radio show, when asked if he instructed Giuliani to “do anything” in Ukraine. But then-ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that Trump gave him “express direction” to work with Giuliani. Giuliani also was mentioned in Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when Trump told Zelensky to “speak to him.” “Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man,” Trump said, according to the summary of the call released by the White House. “He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.” Giuliani said this week his Ukraine snooping uncovered “smoking gun” evidence of the Bidens’ involvement in corruption. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a prominent Trump defender, said Attorney General William Barr told him there would be an “intake process” for Giuliani to funnel his dirt to the Justice Department.",3.875042108398994,1.9117238811584132,1.9633182272405807,16

Giuliani, the personal attorney to President Donald Trump, told Fox Business host Trish Regan he had “smoking gun” evidence of money laundering by Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, the former vice president now running for president. Giuliani did not present such evidence, but read an email on his iPad that he said was between the governments of Latvia and Ukraine detailing “a corruption affair” involving the younger Biden. He also said the plot runs even deeper. “It’s not just Biden,” he said. “Bunch of Democrats. That’s why they’re so crazy on the subject of Ukraine, and why they want to literally kill me.” .@RudyGiuliani says there is more to this #Ukraine corruption scandal than the #Bidens - #Giuliani says he has the proof, and he's ready to EXPOSE the corruption - and that's why people are after him, watch: #TrishRegan  Trump was impeached for withholding U.S. aid to Ukraine to pressure the nation into digging up dirt on the Bidens.

Col. Alexander Vindman, a key witness in the impeachment case against Donald Trump, for reporting the president’s “questionable” Ukraine dealings to his superiors last summer. “He did exactly what we teach them to do from cradle to grave,” Kelly said during a speech Monday at Drew University in Morristown, New Jersey, according to The Atlantic. “He went and told his boss what he just heard.” Vindman, an expert on Ukrainian affairs, was one of several National Security Council officials to listen in on Trump’s notorious July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He testified during the House’s impeachment inquiry in November that he was so disturbed by Trump’s efforts to get Zelensky to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden that he reported it to the NSC’s top lawyer. Trump removed Vindman and his twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, from the NSC last week, just days after the Senate voted to acquit the president. Trump also fired Gordon Sondland, another impeachment witness who had served as the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Kelly told the audience Monday that Vindman was rightly disturbed by Trump’s call with Zelensky and acted as a good soldier by flagging it. He said Trump’s decision to condition U.S. military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into Biden marked a major shift in U.S. foreign policy and probably sounded like “an illegal order” to Vindman. “We teach them, ‘Don’t follow an illegal order. And if you’re ever given one, you’ll raise it to whoever gives it to you that this is an illegal order and then tell your boss,’” Kelly said, per The Atlantic. After Kelly served as the homeland security secretary for about seven months, Trump tapped him to replace Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff. He held that position until he resigned in January 2019. Tensions between Kelly and Trump were widely reported during his tenure as chief of staff. The retired U.S. Marine Corps general once reportedly called the White House a “miserable place to work.” Kelly didn’t appear to hold back much during his appearance at Drew University on Monday. He condemned Trump’s infamous claim in 2015 while running for president that migrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico are “rapists” and drug dealers. “In fact, they’re overwhelmingly good people,” Kelly said Monday. “They’re not all rapists and they’re not all murderers, and it’s wrong to characterize them that way. I disagreed with the president a number of times.” He also hit out at Trump’s decision to intervene in the case of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who was convicted of posing with the corpse of a teenage fighter for the self-described Islamic State. The Navy demoted Gallagher for his actions, but Trump reversed it. “The idea that the commander-in-chief intervened there, in my opinion, was exactly the wrong thing to do,” Kelly said. “Had I been there, I think I could have prevented it.” Though he’s tried to distance himself from some of the Trump administration’s most controversial policies since resigning, Kelly helped implement some of them during his time in office. For instance, he supported the notorious family separation policy that split up parents who illegally crossed into the U.S. from their children at the border. He has also come under fire for protecting then-White House aide Rob Porter in the face of domestic violence allegations made by his ex-wives ― and for just being an all-around jerk. Trump lashed out at Kelly in a series of tweets Thursday morning, accusing his former chief of staff of being unable to “keep his mouth shut.” “When I terminated John Kelly, which I couldn’t do fast enough, he knew full well that he was way over his head,” the president wrote. “He came in with a bang, went out with whimper.” When I terminated John Kelly, which I couldn’t do fast enough, he knew full well that he was way over his head. Being Chief of Staff just wasn’t for him. He came in with a bang, went out with a whimper, but like so many X’s, he misses the action & just can’t keep his mouth shut,. ....which he actually has a military and legal obligation to do. His incredible wife, Karen, who I have a lot of respect for, once pulled me aside & said strongly that “John respects you greatly. When we are no longer here, he will only speak well of you.” Wrong!

Rep. Jerry Nadler’s (D-N.Y.) letter comes hours after Barr admitted that the department would evaluate material that Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, had collected from Ukrainian sources claiming to have damaging information about 2020 candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Giuliani’s gathering of such information was a huge part of Trump’s attempt to get Ukraine to announce an investigation into the Bidens ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, which led to the president’s impeachment (and eventual acquittal). Much of what the former New York City mayor has said to media outlets so far has consisted of conspiracy theories and misinformation. “As you know, the Department has formal, established channels by which to receive information and begin investigations,” Nadler wrote in the letter. “This new channel to Mr. Giuliani would seem to be a significant departure from those traditional channels.” NEW: @RepJerryNadler sent a letter to AG Barr to demand answers after @LindseyGrahamSC and Barr admit that Rudy Giuliani is sending information concerning Ukraine to the Department of Justice through a special intake process.  Nadler cited Sen. Lindsey Graham’s interview on Sunday with Face the Nation where the South Carolina Republican said Barr told him about a so-called “intake process” in which Giuliani “could give information” and that the Justice Department would “see if it’s verified.” Barr later confirmed at a press conference on Monday morning that the Justice Department does in fact have such a process to receive information relating to Ukraine and the Bidens, including “anything Mr. Giuliani might provide.” The attorney general and other Justice Department officials tried to hedge the answer by alleging that Giuliani was being treated the same as any other tipster. ICYMI: AG Barr responds to comments made by @LindseyGrahamSC on @FacetheNation Sunday where he said @TheJusticeDept ""process"" would let @RudyGiuliani turn over info from Ukraine. Barr says he has an open door policy to “anybody.” WATCH-->  “Your announcement also represents a significant departure from your past statements about Mr. Giuliani,” Nadler wrote. “On September 25, the Department confirmed it had not been asked by the President to ‘contact Ukraine ― on this or any other matter. The attorney general has not communicated with Ukraine ― on this or any other subject. Nor has the attorney general discussed this matter or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.’” “To the extent that statement is no longer accurate, any official relationship between Mr. Giuliani and the Department raises serious questions about conflicts of interest ― both for the Department, generally, and for you, specifically,” Nadler continued, citing Giuliani associate Lev Parnas’ allegation that Barr knew virtually everything about communications with Ukraine. “Whether or not you are in league with Mr. Giuliani and his associates, DOJ guidelines and regulations exist to protect you and the Department from even the appearance of a conflict of interest or any impropriety.” A spokesperson for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment, though a department official told The Washington Post that Giuliani had “recently” shared information through the process described by Barr. The information is reportedly being vetted through the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, according to the Post. Nadler asked Barr to answer a series of questions regarding the so-called “intake process” for Giuliani and the attorney general’s relationship with the president’s personal attorney. Barr has until Feb. 25 to respond to the questions. Giuliani is currently being investigated himself by the Justice Department, a case that has so far led to campaign finance charges against Parnas and fellow associate Igor Fruman. Both Parnas and Fruman helped Giuliani in his pursuits related to Ukraine.",2.467243423469066,2.0408014242415677,0.42644199922749815,4

On Fox News,"An internal Fox News report on Ukraine scandal coverage warns about disinformation — on Fox News — by frequent guests, including Donald Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, according to a copy obtained by The Daily Beast. The first page of the research briefing book was also posted Thursday on Twitter by a former Fox News freelance producer. Here's the front page of the internal Fox News Trump-Ukraine timeline. I'll start tweeting some of the highlights shortly.  Giuliani is described in the 162-page report, “Ukraine, Disinformation & the Trump Administration,” as having a “high susceptibility to disinformation.” The report also singles out John Solomon, a frequent guest of Sean Hannity and a former right-wing columnist for The Hill. He’s widely considered the key source of baseless conspiracy theories concerning Ukraine, including that it was Ukraine and not Russia that interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Concerns about Solomon include allegations of “non-disclosure of conflicts, use of unreliable sources, publishing false and misleading stories, misrepresentation of sources, and opaque coordination with involved parties,” the Fox report states, according to the Beast. “John Solomon played an indispensable role in the collection and domestic publication of elements of this disinformation campaign” on Ukraine, according to the document. Married Trump supporters Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova, lawyers who have been frequent Fox News guests, have also spread “disinformation” concerning Ukraine while employed by Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash. He is fighting extradition to the U.S. to face bribery-related charges. The research report was created by Fox News senior political affairs specialist Bryan S. Murphy, who produces research as part of the Fox “Brain Room” that provides information and data for network programming, according to The Daily Beast. The four people singled out in the report have appeared 348 times on Fox News weekday programs since 2018, according to Media Matters. About 203 of them were on Hannity’s program alone. A Fox News senior vice president, Mitch Kweit, said the report was “being taken out of context and politicized to damage the network,” The Guardian reported. He called the briefing book “nothing more than a comprehensive chronological account of what every person involved in the Ukraine controversy was doing at any identifiable point in time.”",3.866702136663885,3.8990049536036673,-0.0323028169397821,4

Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated Army officer who served as the Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, was escorted out of the White House on Friday after reports surfaced that President Donald Trump would be punishing people who testified during his impeachment trial. Vindman is a national security official who testified about his knowledge of a July 2019 call with the Ukrainian president that set off Trump’s impeachment inquiry and proceedings. Up until Friday, Vindman worked in the White House and his term in the NSC would have ended in July. The White House planned to inform Vindman that he was being moved into a role at the Pentagon, The Washington Post reported late Thursday night, citing two people familiar with the plan. Vindman had previously told senior officers that he planned to leave his posting early, the Post reported, but Trump reportedly wanted to make him a target for his fury. The officer’s lawyer confirmed to HuffPost that Vindman was escorted from the White House on Friday, adding that he was “asked to leave for telling the truth.” “There is no question in the mind of any American why this man’s job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House,” attorney David Pressman said in a statement. “LTC Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, commitment to right, frightened the powerful.” Vindman’s twin brother, Army Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, was also fired and escorted out of the White House. “Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, a senior lawyer and ethics official at the National Security Council, and a decorated Iraq war veteran, was escorted off of the grounds of the White House, suddenly and with no explanation, despite over two decades of loyal service to this country,” Pressman told HuffPost. “He is deeply disappointed that he will not be able to continue his service at the White House.” Here’s the full statement from Lt. Col. Vindman’s attorney saying he was escorted out of the White House today  Earlier on Friday, ahead of a trip to North Carolina, Trump hinted at Vindman’s dismissal when asked by a reporter whether he wanted to see the officer “out” of the White House. “Well, I’m not happy with him,” Trump told reporters. “Do you think I’m supposed to be happy with him? I’m not.” Vindman was the first person to testify in the House’s impeachment hearings who had personally listened in on Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president, and he told lawmakers he repeatedly expressed concerns to his superiors that Trump’s behavior was inappropriate. Trump’s allies moved to smear Vindman at the time, despite his extensive military career and résumé, but the officer said he acted out of a “sense of duty” and did not fear retribution. “Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth,” Vindman told his father during his remarks at a House Intelligence Committee hearing in November. Despite hopes from some Republicans that Trump might have learned his “lesson” after being impeached, the president has signaled that he plans to continue to target his political opponents. He attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as a “horrible person” on Thursday during what he called an acquittal “celebration.” He called the investigations into his actions “evil” and has all but assured that he plans to use the outcome to drum up support and fundraising going into his 2020 reelection campaign. The Post noted Thursday that Trump’s ire may extend throughout the White House to other administration officials who spoke or testified during the impeachment inquiry. During the House impeachment hearings, dozens of current and former officials detailed the president’s demand that the leader of Ukraine announce that he was opening an investigation into political rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son Hunter. The story has been updated to note that Army Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman has also been fired from his White House job.",3.0891787518902554,2.821974782753106,0.2672039691371495,6

Yovanovitch testified that she was the target of a bad-faith smear campaign by Trump and his allies, who wanted to “get rid of her,” and eventually ousted her. Trump issued threats against her on a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, an incident central to the congressional inquiry against Trump. On the call, Trump asked Ukraine’s government to investigate former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden — effectively asking a foreign government to intervene in a U.S. election. In November, Yovanovitch and several other career U.S. officials testified before the House Intelligence Committee in the impeachment proceedings against Trump. She did it, she wrote, “because it is the American way to speak up about wrongdoing.” Her op-ed continued: I have seen dictatorships around the world, where blind obedience is the norm and truth-tellers are threatened with punishment or death. We must not allow the United States to become a country where standing up to our government is a dangerous act. It has been shocking to experience the storm of criticism, lies and malicious conspiracies that have preceded and followed my public testimony, but I have no regrets. I did — we did — what our conscience called us to do. We did what the gift of U.S. citizenship requires us to do. Yovanovitch implored Americans to do their part to preserve essential freedoms and stand up against wrongdoing. “Unfortunately, the last year has shown that we need to fight for our democracy,” she wrote. “‘Freedom is not free’ is a pithy phrase that usually refers to the sacrifices of our military against external threats. It turns out that same slogan can be applied to challenges which are closer to home.” On Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate acquitted Trump on the two articles of impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, on a largely party-line vote. Only one Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah), joined the Democratic minority in voting to convict Trump on the abuse of power charge.

Despite his concerns about the “back channel,” Bannon told investigators he didn’t think the “stuff” regarding Russian President Vladimir Putin and his links to the White House were “a big deal,” according to the summary. Russia’s “reach outs” after the election were not “any different than any other country’s,” Bannon told investigators. “For example, the Japanese prime minister wanted to fly over and have a cup of coffee,” he said, BuzzFeed reported. Bannon also noted that the White House transition was chaotic because few people had expected Trump to win. “People in the campaign thought it was not necessary to have a strong transition team going into the election, in part because they were so far down in the polls,” Bannon explained in Miller’s office in early 2018, according to another summary. “Trump was also superstitious about things like that. Bill Hagerty, the director of the transition, had scheduled a trip to the Bahamas for after the election, assuming they would not win.” At some point, Flynn went to see Obama’s national security adviser, Susan Rice, and her deputy, Ben Rhodes, for advice about “how to do things.” NEW: Steve Bannon told the FBI and prosecutors during a meeting at Mueller's office that after the election, Michael Flynn sought out Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice and her deputy, Ben Rhodes, for advice “about how to do things.”  Kushner’s name came up in Bannon’s interview — but no details were released in his own interview.

The former New York City mayor sat with NPR’s Steve Inskeep for an interview that aired Tuesday. Giuliani spoke about the Senate trial regarding the president’s attempts to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for the country’s announcement of an investigation into the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden. “Biden should be investigated” after the trial ends, “100%,” Giuliani told Inskeep. “I would have no problem with him doing it. In fact, I would have a problem with him not doing it. I think he would be saying that Joe Biden can get away with selling out the United States, making us a fool in the Ukraine.” ""Absolutely; 100%,"" Giuliani told @NPRinskeep. “I would have no problem with [Trump] doing it. In fact, I'd have a problem with him not doing it. I think he would be saying that Joe Biden can get away with selling out the United States, making us a fool in the Ukraine."" Giuliani was central in the events that led up to the House conducting an inquiry that resulted in Trump’s impeachment in December. The president’s personal attorney conducted shadow diplomacy for Trump with Ukrainian officials to get them to announce an investigation into the Bidens, the younger who served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father ― who is now one of Trump’s 2020 rivals ― served as vice president of the United States. Trump is accused of withholding congressionally approved U.S. military aid to Ukraine while pushing for the country’s president to announce the investigation. “He’s the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. He certainly shouldn’t back away from it,” Giuliani said of Trump investigating Biden. Technically, the U.S. attorney general is the chief law enforcement officer, serving in the executive branch under the president. Giuliani told Inskeep that he’s still looking into the Bidens’ relationship with Ukraine, despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Asked if he’s investigating Biden on the president’s orders, Giuliani said, “He hasn’t told me not to do it.” The attorney’s comments to NPR come as the Senate prepares for a vote in the impeachment trial Wednesday that will likely end in the president’s acquittal. All 53 Republican senators are expected to vote against convicting Trump on the charges ― abuse of power and obstruction of Congress ― after almost all refused to allow witnesses in the trial. Some senators, such as Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), expressed disappointment with Trump’s actions and said it was inappropriate to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent. But both lawmakers still plan to acquit the president, with Collins saying Tuesday that she believes Trump “has learned from this case” and “will be much more cautious in the future.” Susan Collins, in saying she won’t vote to remove Trump, says he learned a lesson. Trump has repeatedly said he behaved perfectly and did nothing wrong. But Giuliani’s remarks Tuesday signify otherwise: “I believe that it would be one of the great corrupt events in American history if this case is not investigated at the highest levels of two governments.”",2.9858705679008666,1.768922449996829,1.2169481179040376,16

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Fox News on Sunday that the Ukraine whistleblower will be called before the Senate Intelligence Committee after the impeachment trial because “I want to find out how all this crap started.” Graham is also threatening to go after former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter when the trial is over, even though Donald Trump’s impeachment defense team failed to demonstrate a single ethics violation or crime by either man. As for the whistleblower, who is protected from retaliation by federal law, Graham told Fox host Maria Bartiromo: “The Senate Intel Committee under [Sen.] Richard Burr (R-N.C.) has told us that we will call the whistleblower. Why is it important? I want to find out how all this crap started.” Graham, a vociferous apologist for Trump, added: “The day of reckoning is coming.” Graham said he wants to know “if the whistleblower is a former employee [or] associate of Joe Biden,” or “was working with people” on Rep. Adam Schiff’s (D-Calif.) staff. Republicans have presented no information that either case is true. “We’re going to get to the bottom of all of this to make sure this never happens again,” Graham said. The whistleblower did not testify at the House impeachment hearing (the Senate called no witnesses) because information the whistleblower provided was confirmed by other documents or witnesses under oath. Corroboration included Trump’s own rough transcript of his phone call last year with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he pressured Zelensky to launch an investigation into unfounded accusations against Joe Biden — while Trump was withholding military aid from the nation. Federal law protecting a whistleblower’s identity is designed to encourage government employees with information of wrongdoing to come forward. Some Republicans and Trump supporters have revealed the identity of someone they claim is the whistleblower, which the whistleblower’s attorney has argued puts his client’s life at risk. At the Senate impeachment trial last week, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) submitted a question to Chief Justice John Roberts reportedly naming the whistleblower in order to deliberately expose the person’s identity. Roberts refused to read Paul’s question. Republicans claim that Biden, who was pressuring Ukraine to crack down on corruption in the nation while he was vice president, was attempting to block investigations into Ukraine energy company Burisma while his son was on the company board. But the vice president was pushing Ukraine to oust a prosecutor widely viewed by U.S. and European allies as corrupt. A Ukrainian investigation into Burisma was closed before Biden came on the scene, according to reports. Check out Graham’s interview in the video above. He talks about the whistleblower at 7:26.",2.3419124194700163,1.8819097164705327,0.46000270299948354,16

The Tennessee lawmaker told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that he will vote on Wednesday to acquit Trump, despite the president’s “inappropriate” actions and his “mistake” of echoing Russian talking points to Ukraine’s president. “I think he shouldn’t have done it,” Alexander said of Trump conditioning U.S. military aid on Ukraine investigating political rival Joe Biden. “I think it was wrong. Inappropriate was the way I’d say ― improper, crossing the line.” Alexander, who is retiring instead of seeking reelection this year, said he believes Trump’s actions were “a long way from treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors” and that American voters should decide Trump’s fate in the 2020 election. He said Trump, if he was truly concerned about Biden, should have asked Attorney General William Barr ― not Ukraine ― to look into the matter. WATCH: @SenAlexander says “maybe [Trump] did not know how to” call the AG to look into Bidens and Burisma. #MTP@chucktodd: “At what point is he no longer new to this?Sen. Alexander: “Well, the bottom line, it's not an excuse.”  Asked why he believes Trump didn’t go to Barr, Alexander said Trump “maybe didn’t know how to do it.” “At what point, though, is he no longer new to this?” host Chuck Todd asked, noting that Republicans often defend Trump’s controversial actions by saying he’s a political outsider. “Well, the bottom line, it’s not an excuse,” Alexander said. “He shouldn’t have done it. And I said he shouldn’t have done it.” Todd then asked whether he’s concerned that the Senate likely acquitting Trump could encourage the president to continue seeking foreign interference. “I don’t think so,” Alexander said. “I hope not. I mean, enduring an impeachment is something that nobody should like. Even the president said he didn’t want that on his resume. I don’t blame him. So if a call like that gets you an impeachment, I would think he would think twice before he did it again.” WATCH: @SenAlexander says he hope Pres. Trump does not continue to engage in foreign interference. #MTP #IfItsSundaySen. Alexander: “If a call like this gets you an impeachment, I would think he would think twice before he did it again.”  Todd also questioned Alexander about Trump’s peddling of Russian propaganda during his infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump had mentioned a debunked conspiracy theory pushed by the Kremlin that alleges Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly rejected the claim. “Does it bother you that the President of the United States is reiterating Russian propaganda?” Todd asked. Alexander said yes. “I think that’s a mistake,” the senator continued. “I think we need to be sensitive to the fact that the Russians are out to do no good, to destabilize Western democracies, including us, and be very wary of theories that Russians come up with and peddle.” Alexander, widely seen as one of a few swing votes, helped cinch the GOP effort to block a Democratic motion to call witnesses during the impeachment trial. He announced Thursday, after the final day of the trial’s question-and-answer portion, that he would vote against the motion because he doesn’t need any more evidence to know what Trump did. The Senate ultimately voted 51-49 to block witnesses. Just two Republicans ― Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine ― joined Democrats in voting in favor of the motion. Republicans have been twisting themselves into knots to justify acquitting Trump. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), during an appearance Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” danced around questions about whether Trump was “wrong” to ask Ukraine to investigate Biden. “I think ferreting out corruption is absolutely the right thing to do,” Ernst said. “It’s probably something that I wouldn’t have done.” Host Jake Tapper noted that Trump never mentioned the word “corruption” during his July 25 call with Zelensky. “If it’s not something you would have done, why wouldn’t you have done it? Because it was wrong? Because it was inappropriate?” Tapper pressed. “I think, generally speaking, going after corruption would be the right thing to do,” Ernst said. “He did it maybe in the wrong manner. But I think he could have done it through different channels.” ""I think generally speaking, going after corruption would be the right thing to do, he did it maybe in the wrong manner.

2020-02-02,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mcconnell-trump-legacy_n_5e35e33fc5b611ac94d5cdd3,Mitch McConnell’s New Legacy: Impeachment Trial Rigger For Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON ― Years after professing admiration for the “Great Compromiser” Henry Clay but then engineering a dramatic remake of the federal judiciary, Mitch McConnell is now earning a different legacy: The guy who rigged a Senate trial to protect a president impeached for trying to cheat his way to reelection. With even members of his own caucus agreeing that Donald Trump behaved badly by leveraging $391 million in taxpayer-funded foreign aid to damage a political rival, the Senate’s majority leader is on the brink of acquitting Trump without hearing from a single witness ― defying the three-quarters of Americans who say they want witnesses. “Sadly, the constitutional travesty that he orchestrated here will serve as his legacy,” said George Conway, a prominent Republican Trump critic and husband of a top White House aide. “Not the legions of fine judges he has put on the bench, judges of the sort that would have been nominated by a President Pence even if Trump had been removed, as he rightly should have been.” An aide to Senate Republican leadership, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected the idea that protecting Trump would become the most noteworthy part of McConnell’s record. “If you don’t think his legacy on courts and the Merrick Garland decision will be at the top of his legacy then you just aren’t in touch with reality,” the aide said, referring to McConnell’s decision to block former President Barack Obama’s choice for a Supreme Court vacancy and instead to leave it open for the next president. “History is going to remember him not for being a great legislator, but as a wingman to Donald Trump. He’ll be seen as the leading sycophant to Donald Trump.” Other Republican defenders said McConnell was simply doing what both his constituents in Kentucky as well as most Republicans nationally wanted him to do. Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt said McConnell handled the situation properly. “I don’t think the leader is affected in any way by trying to figure out how to move through that and get to the work that needed to be done,” he said. “You play the hand you’re dealt,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican political consultant who has worked for McConnell’s campaigns, adding that steering the GOP caucus toward removing Trump from office was never a possibility. “I don’t know that that’s Mitch McConnell’s decision to make.” Yet that was precisely the decision that Arizona GOP Sen. Barry Goldwater made in 1974, when he visited President Richard Nixon at the White House to tell him that he and many other Republicans in the Senate would not support him in an impeachment trial. Nixon announced his resignation the following evening rather than face removal for using the powers of his office to cover up his campaign’s break-in at the Democratic National Committee. “It’s like Nixon redux,” said Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley. “When the conservative leader of the Senate found out he had been lied to, he balked at Nixon. And he has a fine place in history. Mitch McConnell is going to be remembered as a lackey for Trump.” Thirty years after McConnell was first elected to the Senate in 1984, Republicans took control of the chamber, elevating him from minority leader to majority leader and thereby allowing him to realize a lifelong dream. Just a few years earlier, he had famously declared that his top priority was to make Obama a one-term president. Obama had nonetheless won reelection in 2012, and McConnell spoke in conciliatory tones about working with the Democratic president on bipartisan priorities. He spoke about his great love of Henry Clay, the 19th century Kentucky senator known for forging a string of major pre-Civil War compromises, and his respect for John Sherman Cooper, the mid-20 century Kentucky senator for whom McConnell had once interned. In a news conference after the 2014 midterm election, McConnell said he wanted the chamber to start working together for the common good again, as it used to. “The Senate in the last few years basically doesn’t do anything. We don’t even vote,” he said. Whatever comity McConnell might have hoped for, however, dissipated when he essentially ended judicial confirmation hearings for Obama’s picks, and then vanished entirely when he refused to even acknowledge Obama’s nomination of Garland for the high court after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death. Then, when Trump unexpectedly won the 2016 election, McConnell suddenly had the opportunity to fill, assembly-line fashion, over a hundred federal court vacancies he had helped hold open with conservative nominees pre-screened by the Federalist Society. “That’s a long-term McConnell priority,” said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University. “McConnell has a very, very narrow agenda.” It is also a squarely mainstream Republican agenda, along with tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks ― all of which Trump, who has little personal knowledge or interest in legislation, was happy to give him and House GOP leaders. “Trump comes along and McConnell comes along and their paths converge, and voila,” Jennings said. Which was the state of affairs right up until an intelligence community whistleblower’s complaint in August accused Trump of trying to coerce Ukraine into conducting investigations politically useful to Trump by withholding a White House meeting and $391 million in military aid. House Democratic leaders began an impeachment inquiry, then formal proceedings, and just before the Christmas recess, voted to impeach Trump ― dropping the question of whether to remove Trump directly into McConnell’s lap. On Friday, Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat and one of the House’s impeachment “managers,” asked at the trial: “What do you want your place in history to be?” If the question was designed to shame Republican senators, it appears not to have had that effect ― and certainly not with McConnell, who wore a broad grin after Democrats’ attempt to open the proceedings to witness testimony failed by two votes. That tally capped Senate Republicans’ implicit approval of Trump’s unprecedented stonewalling of the House. In sharp contrast even to Nixon, Trump refused to turn over a single requested document and ordered all executive branch employees not to testify. McConnell openly telegraphed his intention to stand with Trump even as the House was completing impeachment proceedings in December. In a Dec. 12 appearance on Fox News, McConnell said there was “zero chance” Trump would be removed from office. “I’m going to take my cues from the president’s lawyers,” he said. “We’ll be working through this process hopefully in a fairly short period of time, in total coordination with the White House counsel’s office and the people who are representing the president.” Indeed, on Friday, McConnell made sure to get Trump’s approval of his plan to finish the trial with a Wednesday acquittal before announcing it on the floor. “McConnell believes history will record Trump as his useful instrument. I think history will record McConnell as Trump’s useful instrument,” said Stuart Stevens, a former aide to 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who is now a senator from Utah and one of two Republicans who voted to hear from witnesses. “McConnell will always be remembered as the majority leader who turned the United States Senate into a kangaroo court in order to save Donald Trump from being justly convicted and removed from office,” said Rick Tyler, a GOP consultant and former aide to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s 2016 presidential campaign. Other Republicans, among them Trump critics, said McConnell’s push to get conservative judges will ultimately outweigh his facts-be-damned acquittal of Trump. “If the judiciary rules in a more conservative direction for the next 20 years, the trade-off for what a few insiders may view as a legacy seems unimportant in contrast,” said Rory Cooper, once a top aide to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. One McConnell supporter, a former Republican National Committee official who would only speak on the condition of anonymity, even cited Trump’s vindictiveness and the fanaticism of his core supporters to justify McConnell’s approach. “Removing Trump would have ignited a firestorm from which we will not recover,” he said. “I think prudence dictates they did what they did.” Historians, though, were dubious that McConnell’s name will ever be disentangled from Trump’s, especially decades after they are long gone, when all the details of Trump’s Ukraine scandal will finally come to light. “Mitch’s hero was Henry Clay, his role model was John Sherman Cooper,” laughed Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “Nobody has done more to blow up the rules and norms of the Senate and destroy its integrity than McConnell. I knew John Sherman Cooper, and he would be appalled by his onetime protégé. The way he has handled impeachment is in some ways an extension of his utterly immoral behavior, but very likely it will lead the obituary.” And Brinkley, the Rice University professor, said whatever thoughts McConnell might have had for being known as a Senate institutionalist are gone forever. “History is going to remember him not for being a great legislator, but as a wingman to Donald Trump,” Brinkley said. “He’ll be seen as the leading sycophant to Donald Trump.” Igor Bobic contributed to this report.",2.4670531453407114,2.0819406880832108,0.38511245725750065,11

Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) has warned that former Vice President Joe Biden could immediately face calls for impeachment if elected president. The first-term Republican went on the offense in an interview with Bloomberg News on Sunday, saying Biden’s prior dealings with Ukraine puts a target on his back. “I think this door of impeachable whatever has been opened,” she said. “Joe Biden should be very careful what he’s asking for because, you know, we can have a situation where if it should ever be President Biden, that immediately, people, right the day after he would be elected would be saying, ‘Well, we’re going to impeach him.’” Ernst accused Biden of interfering in an investigation into the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. She said then-President Barack Obama tasked Biden with weeding out corruption, but that Biden ignored “Burisma because his son was on the company’s board making over a million dollars a year.” Biden’s alleged involvement in that Burisma investigation is based on an unsubstantiated claim made by President Donald Trump. Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, testified in the House impeachment inquiry in November that he saw no validity to Trump’s allegations of Biden being corrupt. Ernst’s comments come as Trump faces his own potential ouster from office due to his dealings with money and Ukraine. Trump, whose impeachment trial in the Senate is set to conclude this week, has said that he withheld congressionally approved aid to the war-torn country due to his own concerns about internal corruption. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Ernst said she will vote to acquit Trump on Wednesday, arguing that what he did does not merit being removed from office.

But I think that he could have done it through different channels,"" Republican Sen.

The Times published the bombshell report, which it attributed to Bolton’s unpublished book, just before Friday’s resumption of Trump’s Senate impeachment trial on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice. It provides further reason for senators to hear from witnesses, particularly Bolton and the other White House officials he reportedly says were in the room. However, it’s unlikely to change anything: Republicans already had enough votes to block witnesses, and are expected to do so later on Friday. According to the Times report, Trump during an Oval Office meeting in May allegedly directed Bolton to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to make sure Zelensky met with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to discuss investigations targeting Trump’s political rivals. Giuliani was the point person in Trump’s shadow foreign policy mission intent on forcing Ukraine to investigate 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden, witnesses said during House imnpeachment proceedings against Trump. Bolton writes that he ignored Trump’s order and did not call Zelensky. The account of Trump involving Bolton in a quid pro quo arrangement with Ukraine adds further weight to the impeachment charges against the president. Bolton alleges that Trump directly orchestrated the pressure campaign, and had an obsession with Ukraine based on inaccurate information and conspiracy theories, the Times reported. Bolton also claims that White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Giuliani were in the room when Trump ordered Bolton to call Zelensky. Trump denied Bolton’s recounting of events in a statement and claimed the meeting Bolton described never took place. Giuliani called Bolton’s description “absolutely, categorically untrue.” The meeting Bolton describes in his book draft reportedly took place months before Trump’s July phone call with Zelensky in which he requested investigations targeting Biden. It alleges that senior Trump administration figures were aware of Trump’s quid pro quo campaign long before the details of that call became public as a result of a whistleblower complaint. Bolton has been a central figure looming outside of Trump’s impeachment trial, with Democrats demanding that he should be allowed to testify and Republicans seeking to block that from happening. The White House has also sought to prevent Bolton from publishing his book, and Trump’s lawyers in the impeachment trial have argued the manuscript is inadmissible. Republicans on Friday appeared set to vote against allowing witnesses to testify in the trial, forestalling the possibility that Bolton would become its star.",1.7266802850540406,2.2224183306912004,-0.49573804563715984,16

Neal Katyal, who served in the Justice Department role under former President Barack Obama, made the prediction on Twitter after Trump’s defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz argued during impeachment proceedings that “if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.” “The fact a President would send his lawyer out to say such grossly unconstitutional things highlights the need for impeachment,” Katyal tweeted in response. “If he believes he can do anything, so long as 1 of his motives is to win reelection, he won’t just do Ukraine leverage again, he’ll do far far worse.” The fact a President would send his lawyer out to say such grossly unconstitutional things highlights the need for impeachment. If he believes he can do anything, so long as 1 of his motives is to win reelection, he won’t just do Ukraine leverage again, he’ll do far far worse. In a second tweet, Katyal noted how Trump will always be able to “assert his motives are pure/mixed” and “because he thinks he can boycott the proceedings+bar all witnesses and testimony, incl his own, it means there is no way to test that, or impeach/remove him..” “It reads the impeachment clauses out of Constitution,” he concluded. If he is ever accused, he can assert his motives are pure/mixed. And because he thinks he can boycott the proceedings+bar all witnesses and testimony, incl his own, it means there is no way to test that, or impeach/remove him. It reads the impeachment clauses out of Constitution. Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, made a similar argument last week. “The president never views a near-miss as an opportunity for reflection and reformation,” he said. “He sees it as permission to indulge his every urge.” Trump is accused of withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine in exchange for the country’s announcement of an investigation into his potential Democratic 2020 rival Joe Biden. Katyal earlier this month dared Trump to testify in the Senate trial. “The fact that you don’t speaks volumes and far more than your protestations of innocence on, ahem,Twitter,” he wrote. So come and testify and explain why 18 witnesses, many from your own Administration, have testified in Congress and thrown the book at you. So far, the count is 18-0. Your party controls the Senate.

Lindsey Graham Was 'In The Loop' On Ukraine Scheme, Says Lev Parnas","Rudy Giuliani’s indicted business associate Lev Parnas accused Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) of being “in the loop” on the scheme to pressure Ukraine to launch an investigation into unfounded accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate. Parnas, a Florida businessman who had donated to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, said he was “1 million percent” certain that Graham was aware of the Ukraine operation. “Rudy told me not once but on several occasions that he spoke to Lindsey Graham about the situation, that Lindsey was always aware,” he told Anderson Cooper in a CNN interview Wednesday night. Graham was “aware of what was going on going back to at least 2018, maybe even earlier,” Parnas said. (Check out the video above beginning at 1:30.) Parnas said it was “surreal” to watch Graham “talking about all the stuff, that this is a sham, this should go away” — when “at the end of the day he was in the loop just like everybody else.” Graham could not immediately be reached for comment on Parnas’s allegations. Parnas, who has been indicted for alleged campaign finance violations, has said that he worked to pressure Ukraine into announcing a probe against Biden and his son Hunter Biden to try to smear Trump’s political rival. He has alleged he was following the president’s wishes as he worked with Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney. Trump’s own pressure on Ukraine to launch a probe into the Bidens, along with other political conspiracy theories, while he was withholding U.S. military funds became a catalyst for the president’s impeachment iinquiry n the House. The Trump administration initially insisted the president was merely seeking an investigation into corruption. But in a bombshell claim at Wednesday’s session of the Senate impeachment trial, Trump defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz argued that a president can essentially do anything to get reelected — apparently including seeking foreign influence in a U.S. election — if that president believes it’s in the public interest. When a president “does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,” Dershowitz said. White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin also argued in the Senate trial that Trump could take such action if the information he was pursuing was “credible.” The Republicans have yet to substantiate any wrongdoing by Biden or his son.",2.2290578787958735,1.985716463994586,0.24334141480128757,16
2020-01-29,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-impeachment-defense_n_5e31d13ec5b690f10577612c,Trump Team Argues Anything Goes As Long As It's In Service Of Reelection,"WASHINGTON ― The president of the United States can essentially do whatever he wants to get himself reelected if he believes that his own reelection would be in the public interest, a lawyer for President Donald Trump argued on Wednesday in a sweeping claim of executive power. “Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,” Alan Dershowitz, one of the president’s attorneys, said on the Senate floor during Trump’s impeachment trial. “If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.” It was an extremist view of executive power ― instead of arguing Trump shouldn’t be removed from office because he didn’t do what witnesses and Democrats have accused him of, Dershowitz was arguing that he shouldn’t be removed because he has the right to do basically anything he likes, as long as it doesn’t violate a specific criminal statute. He’s the president, so no one can stop him. Dershowitz has argued that presidents can only be impeached for direct violations of the law. He’s argued that Trump’s pressure campaign to get the Ukrainian government to publicly announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s political rival, doesn’t warrant impeachment. On Wednesday, as members of the Senate sitting in Trump’s impeachment trial questioned the House managers and Trump’s defense attorneys on issues of fact and law, Dershowitz argued that the president had broad leeway to engage in conduct he thought might benefit his reelection and the national interest. “All quid pros are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are corrupt, and you don’t need to be a mind reader to figure out which is which.” The view extends from the attitude of Trump himself, who has said he has “the right to do whatever I want as president.” If he can get enough of the U.S. Senate to agree to acquit him, he may be proven right. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead House impeachment manager, pushed back on Dershowitz’s argument, saying that the founders didn’t write that the president could commit whatever high crimes and misdemeanors he wanted in his first term if it was in the interest of his reelection. He proposed a hypothetical situation in which the president withheld aid to a state in order to get a state attorney general to announce an investigation into a political rival. “If you say you can’t hold a president accountable in an election year where they’re trying to cheat in that election, then you are giving them carte blanche,” Schiff said. “All quid pros are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are corrupt, and you don’t need to be a mind reader to figure out which is which.” “For one thing, you can ask John Bolton,” he added. The questions came the same day that the White House threatened Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, over the planned publication of his book, claiming it contains “significant amounts of classified information.” Bolton’s unpublished manuscript reportedly confirms Democrats’ core allegation: that Trump withheld military assistance from Ukraine in order to coerce that country into announcing a bogus investigation into Joe Biden, the top-polling Democrat running to unseat Trump. News of the Bolton book is hanging over the trial and a highly anticipated vote on whether to subpoena witnesses. Bolton has already said he would testify if he receives a Senate subpoena. “There’s no way to have a fair trial without witnesses,” Schiff said Wednesday. “To turn him away, to look the other way, I think is deeply at odds with being an impartial juror.” “If you have any question about it at all, you need to hear from his national security adviser. Don’t wait for the book. Don’t wait until March 17 when it is in black and white to find out the answer to your question,” Schiff said. “If you have any question about it, you can erase all doubt.” Three Republicans who seemed open to hearing from witnesses signed onto the first question of the day, which suggested they believed Trump might have had mixed motives in withholding aid to Ukraine. Susan Collins (R-Maine), on behalf of herself, Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) asked Trump’s lawyers how the Senate should respond if they believe Trump had more than one motive in withholding the military aid. Patrick Philbin, deputy White House counsel, argued that House managers had to argue that there was no possible public interest at all in an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter. “Once you’re into mixed motive land, it’s clear that their case fails. There can’t possibly be an impeachable offense at all,” Philbin said. “Think about it: All elected officials, to some extent, have in mind how their conduct, how their decisions, their policy decisions, will affect the next election. There’s always some personal interest in the electoral outcome of policy decisions, and there’s nothing wrong with that.” In a presentation on Monday evening, Dershowitz argued that Democrats’ case is fatally flawed because their two impeachment articles ― for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress ― don’t cite specific criminal actions by the president. He also said that even if Bolton’s allegations are true that the president explicitly told him he was essentially extorting Ukraine ― it wouldn’t matter, because “quid pro quo” arrangements are essential to foreign policy. “He knows better.” Several Republicans have embraced the argument that it doesn’t matter if the president engaged in a quid pro quo ― something the president has forcefully denied for months, even though he has admitted he wanted Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. “Quid pro quo doesn’t matter,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said during an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Tuesday. On Wednesday, before the proceedings started, Dershowitz told reporters that he’d received kudos for his Monday argument. “A number of the senators, as I was waiting for the elevator, just congratulated me on a good presentation, said I had changed some views,” Dershowitz said. Democrats strongly disagreed with Dershowitz’s assertions. “He knows better,” Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Wednesday after Dershowitz made his arguments about the public interest. “He also said that ... the framers wanted us to have indictable crimes for an impeachment. Of course there were no indictable crimes at the time that they wrote that.” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said that Dershowitz’s remarks were “pretty striking” and “disconcerting.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told HuffPost she plans to ask a question about the Trump team’s claim of “absolute immunity.” She said the president’s lawyers “are playing a game of whack-a-mole,” with the Justice Department saying the president can’t be indicted and the president’s impeachment lawyers arguing he can only be impeached for indictable conduct. She said Dershowitz’s arguments were “not consistent with what even he has said in the past.” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) called Dershowitz’s argument “beyond absurd.” “I thought he made absolutely no sense because he essentially said that if President Trump believes his election is good for the American people, he can do whatever he wants.” Igor Bobic contributed reporting.",1.5753258846456364,1.589417020479666,-0.014091135834029656,11

A European diplomat this week joined Amnesty International in condemning the work of the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media (WGSPM), saying its members were either “unwittingly and naively acting as agents of propaganda for the Russians, or actively support[ing] Russian disinformation.” None of the academics – one of whom left his job last year after it emerged he was a supporter of 9/11 conspiracy theories – is an expert in the Middle East, Syria or chemical weapons, and the group has previously been accused of “whitewashing war crimes.” Yet speaking at the United Nations Security Council last week, a senior Russian official praised the “recognized experts and reputable scientists” of the WGSPM, citing their work as he claimed a chemical weapons attack in 2018 never happened. The same day, another Russian official tweeted a link to the group’s work that accuses the civilian search and rescue group the White Helmets of being “actively involved” in murdering civilians to frame the Syrian government. There is no reliable evidence to support the theory and an investigation by the globally recognized Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded that a chemical attack did occur. It is indeed very likely the victims at Douma were murdered captives. As such a potential warcrime and one that is being covered up by @opcw management, western governments and most of the mainstream media. But the truth is coming out. Although not mandated to attribute blame, the report found chlorine gas was released from two canisters that had been dropped from the air. Syrian government and Russian forces are the only ones equipped with aircraft meaning opposition forces could not have carried out the attack. It fits a well-documented pattern of chemical weapons use by the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad against civilian targets. A European diplomat told HuffPost UK: “There is wide and serious concern about the extent to which academics in the WGSPM appear to be pursuing issues which so closely overlay with Russian lies and propaganda, particularly on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. “Russia appears to be using these academics to amplify and bolster their own disinformation, particularly to undermine the OPCW and divert attention from their own activities. “It is unclear whether these academics are unwittingly and naively acting as agents of propaganda for the Russians – or they actively support Russian misinformation. “Either way, it is difficult to see how their involvement with WGSPM is compatible with having any official role in academia.” The WGSPM counts a number of academics among its members including professors Tim Hayward and Paul McKeigue of the University of Edinburgh, Professor David Miller of the University of Bristol and Dr Tara McCormack of the University of Leicester. It was established in 2017 by Piers Robinson, who used to teach at Sheffield University but left last year after HuffPost UK reported he was a supporter of 9/11 conspiracy theories. Robinson told HuffPost at the time that his “decision to leave [...] was based on a number of reasons relating to both professional goals and personal circumstances,” and that he was not “criticized or pressured to leave by the university because of my research or public statements.” Shadi Hamid, senior fellow and Middle East expert at the Brookings Institute thinktank, told HuffPost UK: “These academics don’t know enough about the Middle East to be able to sort through what is real and what is not real. “And because these people don’t know a lot about the Middle East, they are susceptible to these kinds of bonkers ideas.” It is also an established fact that a) the White Helmets are basically Al Q (they provide most of the reporting from Jihadi held areas and b) that hospitals are used as bases by these groups. The WGSPM has published a number of papers that all echo Russian disinformation lines and suggest western governments or those working for them are actually responsible for events such as the Skripal poisoning. Some 40 people were killed in a chemical weapons attack in the Syrian town of Douma in April 2018. Shortly afterwards, the WGSPM set about trying to prove it had been staged by the White Helmets as a means of justifying the U.S., UK and French missile strikes against the Assad government that had followed. Eliot Higgins of the investigative website Bellingcat told HuffPost UK: “It’s a theory without any evidence to support it. The ‘working group’ are just useful idiots. “This kind of denial of war crimes in Syria – it’s like saying vaccines cause autism, or that 9/11 was an inside job. “It’s insane and the fact their universities still employ them is embarrassing for their universities.” The WGSPM does not provide any video, picture or documentary evidence to support its theory. Instead, its central argument — which it describes as “[t]he clearest evidence that the White Helmets were actively involved in managinga massacre of civilians” — rests on a separate attack in 2017 which it argues Syrian jets could not have carried out because of its location. (The OPCW disagrees.) The Working Group, at something of a stretch, then concludes that “the only possible alternative” is for the White Helmets to have been actively involved in “managing a massacre.” The WGSPM’s claim that the OPCW report is wrong eschews experts and instead relies heavily on a number of dubious sources, many that the academics came across via Twitter, including: When asked by HuffPost UK about the sources the WGSPM has used in its research, Robinson stood by them all, adding: “We do not ‘rely on’ these sources: in each of the instances you list, we have examined the original material and drawn our own conclusions.” The group’s conspiracy theory was given an apparent boost last year by a leaked internal report penned by an OPCW worker that appeared to cast doubt on the widely held belief that a chemical weapons attack had indeed taken place. But a source close to the OPCW told HuffPost UK that the document given to the Working Group was based on incorrect assumptions and ignored crucial evidence on which the OPCW investigation’s final conclusions were based – just one of the reasons it was not reflected in the eventual public report. A further source cited by the academics was a series of leaked anonymous emails apparently written by a different OPCW staffer questioning the organization’s work. HuffPost UK, however, has learned that much of the OPCW’s investigation was conducted after the whistleblower, self-styled as “Alex,” left the organization. The OPCW has stood by its conclusion that a chemical attack using chlorine as a weapon did happen. Russia intervened in Syria in 2015 in support of President Bashar al-Assad’s violent crushing of a popular revolution. It has subsequently sought to discredit and veto OPCW investigations that have directly accused its ally of a number of chemical weapons attacks. The Kremlin’s version of what happened in Douma has changed numerous times, from “no attack happened at all” to “British spies did it” to “the White Helmets did it” and various theories in between. Kate Starbird, an expert in online disinformation networks at the University of Washington, told HuffPost UK: “It has all the elements of ‘throw as many different conspiracy theories at the wall until we find one that sticks.’ “It’s taken a few years for them to find one that sticks but the techniques are so similar to what we’ve seen in other events like the [downing of flight] MH17 and the Skripal poisoning.” Why do you refer to ""Assad's Chemical Attacks""? Can you not distinguish speculation from established fact? In November last year Russia’s own OPCW representative addressed The Hague and praised the “dozens of experts, recognised and respected people, with remarkable international reputations, led by Professor Robinson” as it made its case that the OPCW had been hijacked by western nations in order to frame the Syrian government. Russian state media channels have been working hard to promote the narrative, and RT – formerly Russia Today – provided Robinson and McCormack with a platform to air their views. ""You have a corruption of the independence of the OPCW""@PiersRobinson1, co-director of the Organisation for Propaganda Studies discusses war, propaganda and crushing dissent with @uniofleicester's @McCormack_Tara on @Renegade_Inc.MORE:  Caroline Orr, a behavioural scientist who specialises in disinformation networks on social media, told HuffPost UK the paper was “the latest in a long line of misleading and defamatory claims from the ‘working group.’” “It’s done for the purpose of creating confusion about what’s going on in Syria,” she said, “to make people doubt the facts and, ultimately, to bury evidence of some of the most heinous atrocities and war crimes in modern history. “If you look at the tactics they use, they’re straight out of a propaganda handbook.” Undeterred, Russia has stuck to the theory and last week reiterated the claim at the UN. If so, the question arises of who was involved in the staging? The White Helmets are an obvious candidate since they admit to have produced the film of the dead civilians and it is known that they were involved in arranging the bodies of the dead including children. Kristyan Benedict, Amnesty International UK’s Syria campaign manager, told HuffPost UK: “Discrediting the White Helmets is partly about discrediting war crimes evidence. “The White Helmets’ filming at attack sites has meant they’ve built up a significant body of evidence of potential war crimes by pro-Assad and Russian forces – something neither Damascus nor Moscow views kindly. “The millions of Syrians whose lives have been devastated by years of barrel bombing, chemical weapons attacks, imprisonment, torture and killing deserve genuine truth and justice, not this squalid propaganda.” “The millions of Syrians whose lives have been devastated by years of barrel bombing, chemical weapons attacks, imprisonment, torture and killing deserve genuine truth and justice, not this squalid propaganda.” Two days after Russia spoke at the UN, Robinson and Miller appeared at a briefing in parliament sponsored by Labour’s shadow peace and disarmament minister, Fabian Hamilton. Hamilton has insisted he was unaware of who would be speaking when his office agreed to book a room for an anti-war collective “to discuss the OPCW report.” Hamilton’s spokesperson added that the shadow minister “does not support [the speakers’] offensive and factually incorrect views”. His spokesperson told HuffPost UK: “Fabian fully supports the OPCW’s conclusions into the vile chemical attacks that took place in Douma in 2018. “Any suggestion that Fabian somehow supports the ridiculous conspiracy theories held by some of the attendees at this event are ludicrous.” Responding to questions from HuffPost UK, Robinson maintained that the OPCW report “can reasonably be described as fraudulent by the standards applied to scientific reporting.” He added: “As far as we know, no one is denying that the Douma incident and other alleged chemical attacks in Syria were war crimes. “We are investigating these crimes, and making some progress in identifying the perpetrators and those in the media who collude with them.” (Infographics supplied by Statista)",5.30376455235607,4.940912881273603,0.36285167108246696,13

The key moment came in response to a question posed to Trump’s lawyers by Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two Republicans who may prove crucial to whether the chamber agrees to hear from witnesses and allow the presentation of new evidence in the case. For that to happen, Democrats need at least four GOP senators to break with their leadership The timeline of Trump’s interest in Ukraine corruption is potentially crucial to the validity of the impeachment charges against him leveled by the House: that he withheld military aid to the country in exchange for its government opening an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of an energy company there while his father was vice president. If Trump and his team can establish that he cared about the issue before Biden began his campaign, or was gearing up for his run, it would undermine the charge that the president was acting merely in his own political interest ― his re-election. But deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin acknowledged he couldn’t point to a specific example of an earlier interest in the corruption matter by Trump, arguing that the president’s defense was limited to addressing only evidence presented by the House impeachment managers. “There’s not something in the record on that. It wasn’t thoroughly pursued in the record. So I can’t point to something in the record that shows President Trump at an earlier time mentioning specifically something related to Joe or Hunter Biden,” Philbin said. Philbin did try to establish that Trump’s interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine predated Biden’s presidential run because the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, expressed a desire to travel to the country a month before Biden’s formally announced his presidential bid (speculation that he would run had been rampant for months). Philbin also argued that one could draw a “reasonable inference” that Trump had simply gotten new information about the Bidens because of news coverage about his son’s business ties in Ukraine prior to the president’s now-infamous call last July 25 with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump’s prodding of Zelensky to investigate the Bidens kicked the impeachment push into gear. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead House impeachment manager, rebutted Philbin by noting the president’s lawyers could call a witness to offer evidence of Trump’s interest in Ukraine prior to Biden’s presidential run if they so chose. Republicans are eyeing a quick acquittal vote after senators later this week consider the issue of whether to call witnesses and allow for new evidence. Collins and Murkowski, along with Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), offered the first questions of the day. They asked Trump’s lawyers how the Senate should respond if it could be determined that Trump had more than one motive in withholding the military aid to Ukraine. Philbin argued that House managers had to argue that there was no possible public interest in an investigation into the Bidens. “Once you’re into mixed-motive land, it’s clear that their case fails. There can’t possibly be an impeachable offense at all,” Philbin said. In response to another question from Romney about the specific date Trump ordered the hold on security assistance to Ukraine, and whether he gave a reason for doing so, Trump’s defense team again struggled to say. “I don’t think there is evidence in the record of a specific date,” Philbin said, only pointing to testimony that U.S. officials were aware of the hold in early July. But Romney, a Trump critic who has expressed an interest in hearing from witnesses, wasn’t satisfied with that answer. “I’d like more information than they were apparently able to give, given the fact that that information was not in the record,” he told HuffPost on Wednesday.",2.41333773648148,1.5431678842927161,0.870169852188764,16

The warning ― which CNN says came in the form of a letter ― follows a New York Times report outlining key allegations of Trump’s misconduct believed to have been included in Bolton’s soon-to-be-released book, “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir.” See the letter, via Associated Press reporter Zeke Miller, below: WH LETTER to Bolton lawyer claims his book as information classified at Top Secret level. Bolton and lawyer had maintained they didn't believe the draft contained any classified info.  The letter shared by Miller claims the manuscript of Bolton’s book contains “significant amounts of classified information,” including information classified as “top secret.” Trump posted multiple derisive tweets about Bolton on Wednesday morning, criticizing Bolton’s time working for the administration and, without evidence, claiming the former national security adviser’s book is “untrue.” For a guy who couldn’t get approved for the Ambassador to the U.N. years ago, couldn’t get approved for anything since, “begged” me for a non Senate approved job, which I gave him despite many saying “Don’t do it, sir,” takes the job, mistakenly says “Libyan Model” on T.V., and.. ....many more mistakes of judgement, gets fired because frankly, if I listened to him, we would be in World War Six by now, and goes out and IMMEDIATELY writes a nasty & untrue book. All Classified National Security. Who would do this? Bolton is widely seen as a possible key witness in Trump’s ongoing impeachment trial, which centers on allegations Trump withheld aid from Ukraine to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate pro-Russia conspiracy theories and former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s political rival. Several White House officials testified that Bolton disagreed with Trump’s conduct at the time and actively worked to stop it. On Jan. 6, Bolton announced he was willing to testify if called during the impeachment trial currently happening in the Senate. Trump and some of his allies in Congress have argued against Bolton’s testimony, but on Monday, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney said it seems “increasingly likely” GOP senators will vote to have Bolton testify. “I think it’s important for us to hear from John Bolton,” Romney said.",2.464760417908076,3.0126484765735455,-0.5478880586654693,11

Last year, after the White House released a summary of Trump’s infamous July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Republicans insisted that they saw no evidence of a direct link between security assistance to Ukraine and the opening of investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential Trump opponent in the 2020 election. “It clearly isn’t a quid pro quo,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said in November after several top U.S. diplomats testified before the House that the Trump administration did, in fact, withhold aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into a political opponent. Read the call record, they said over and over again, and it’s clear that the aid and the investigations weren’t linked. “If you could show me that Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Axios in October. Their position echoed White House talking points sent to Republicans on Capitol Hill (and mistakenly also to some Democrats) following Trump’s repeated denials on Twitter that there was “no quid pro quo.” “Let’s be clear, there was no quid pro quo for Ukraine to get US aid in exchange for looking into Biden or his son,” said one of the talking points. But Republicans changed their story on the matter this week after The New York Times revealed the existence of a book manuscript from former national security adviser John Bolton. The book, which is due to be released later this year, alleges that Trump told Bolton directly that the aid to Ukraine was tied to the Ukrainian government opening investigations into Biden and his son. The revelation from a first-hand witness threatened to derail Republican desires for a quick acquittal of Trump in the Senate impeachment trial this week and upped the pressure on them to allow witnesses such as Bolton to testify and new documents to be presented during the proceedings. During their opening arguments in the Senate, Trump’s defense team contended that even if Bolton’s account were true, it would not merit the removal of a president during an election year. Their argument opened the door for some Republican senators to acknowledge that Trump did, in fact, withhold Ukraine aid, but that it didn’t merit his removal from office because he was morally justified in seeking investigations into the Bidens. “It is clear to me that there is ample evidence for the President to be concerned about conflicts of interest on behalf of Hunter Biden and that Vice President Joe Biden’s failure to take appropriate action was unacceptable. This combination, in my view, undercut America’s message on reforming corruption in Ukraine,” Graham said in a statement on Wednesday. There’s no evidence that Biden or his son Hunter engaged in corruption in Ukraine. Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, also testified in the House inquiry that he saw no validity to Trump’s allegations against the Bidens. Trump and other Republicans only began inquiring about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of an energy company in Ukraine after his father announced his campaign for president. Other Republican senators were equally dismissive of Bolton’s allegations, maintaining this week that Trump had an official reason to insist on an investigation into the Bidens, rather than a personal one. “Quid pro quo doesn’t matter,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said during an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Tuesday. “[Bolton’s] point is what? That doesn’t tell us anything,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) added in a separate Tuesday interview with Hannity. Asked about Bolton’s book’s account on Wednesday, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said, “I don’t think there was any crime. I don’t think it was an impeachable offense.”",1.8475480766988512,2.3647092393718947,-0.5171611626730435,16

Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney who is integral to the allegations against the president, gave the bitter assessment of Bolton in an interview with “CBS This Morning” that aired Wednesday. “He never said to me, ‘I’ve got a problem with what you are doing in Ukraine,’” Giuliani told CBS’s Catherine Herridge. “Never once, never winked, never sent me a little note. He is a personal friend, I thought. So here’s the only conclusion I can come to, and it’s a harsh one, and I feel very bad about it: He’s a backstabber.” NEW: President Trump's personal attorney @RudyGiuliani called John Bolton a ""backstabber"" and told @CBS_Herridge he doesn't think the former national security adviser should testify in the Senate impeachment trial. More on @CBSThisMorning Wednesday.  When Herridge noted the seriousness of putting such a label on a former White House official, Giuliani responded: “It’s not serious. It’s true.” “If your friend was complaining about you behind your back and didn’t have the guts to come up to your face and tell you, ‘I think you’re screwin’ up, Catherine,’ that’d be a backstabber,” the former New York City mayor said. “That’s classic backstabber. So I feel I got a swamp character here.” According to a New York Times report from earlier this week, Bolton wrote in a draft of his upcoming book that Trump told him he wanted to continue freezing nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine until the country agreed to announce an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Tying the two actions together would reveal that the president attempted a quid pro quo with a foreign government for political advantage. “I find his testimony about the president pretty close to incredible,” Giuliani said. “I can’t imagine that the president of the United States said that to him.” Giuliani also said he maintains regular contact with Trump and can’t be part of the president’s impeachment defense team at the Senate trial because he’s a “possible witness.” Bolton sent an unpublished manuscript to the White House for review in December as required of former administration officials writing books, and he has denied leaking the draft to the Times. WBUR reported Tuesday that Trump’s legal team said nobody outside the National Security Council has reviewed the manuscript. Trump himself denied Bolton’s reported account. I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. With that being said, the... Part of Bolton’s reported recollections included Giuliani himself. According to the Times, Bolton alleged that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo privately admitted there was no basis to Giuliani’s claims that ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was corrupt. Bolton also reportedly wrote that acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was present for at least one phone call in which Trump and Giuliani discussed Yovanovitch. Bolton also wrote that he expressed concern regarding Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy role with Attorney General William Barr after Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when the alleged political “favor” was requested, according to the Times. The revelations led Democrats to repeat their demands for witnesses in the Senate trial, as Bolton’s potential testimony could bolster House managers’ argument that the president abused the power of his office to further his own political interests. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) privately conceded to fellow GOP senators late Tuesday that Republicans do not yet have the votes to block Democrats from summoning Bolton or other witnesses. With a 53-47 majority in the Senate, Republicans can afford to lose only three senators in a potential vote to call more witnesses.

In the manuscript, Bolton reportedly recalled the attorney general responding that he, too, was concerned about Trump’s affinity for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Barr noted at the time that there were two Justice Department investigations into companies in the countries, and Bolton wrote that Barr was worried Trump’s fondness for the autocrats would make it seem as if the president was influencing what should be independent probes. The report Monday is the second bombshell revelation from the unpublished manuscript this week. Bolton also reportedly wrote in the book draft that Trump said he wanted to continue to hold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine until the country’s leader agreed to announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the Times reported. The report, if true, counters Trump’s impeachment defense that the aid was held up merely because of concerns about general corruption and that the demand for the Biden investigation was a separate matter, not a quid pro quo. Trump has long heaped praise on both Erdogan and Xi, two leaders who have been accused of directing authoritarian regimes that crush dissent. The president said in November he was a “big fan” of his Turkish counterpart, just weeks after Erdogan sent troops to invade parts of Syria against U.S. wishes. Trump also cheered Xi’s 2018 decision to end term limits in China. The cozy relationships have led both leaders to ask Trump for political favors. Xi personally appealed to Trump to lift sanctions on a Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE (he did), and Erdogan asked him to be kinder to a state-owned Turkish bank that was ultimately indicted last year. Trump has rejected the reported book account, writing on Twitter that he never told Bolton “the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats.” “Here’s a man who purports to care about the national security of this country,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday. “And to leave the White House and immediately go write a book, it’s really disappointing ...

Bolton has denied leaking the draft with the Times. The manuscript was submitted to the White House about a month ago for review. Trump’s pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was the basis for two articles of impeachment in the House: one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. The Senate is currently holding a trial to determine if the president should be removed from office. The revelations have been largely ignored by the president’s attorneys defending him at his Senate trial. The lawyers have largely avoided referring to Bolton and continued to insist there was no link between the hold on the security aid and any investigation Trump wanted Ukraine to open. “We deal with transcript evidence.

Shaun Tandon, the president of the State Department Correspondents’ Association, said Monday that Michele Kelemen, NPR’s diplomatic correspondent, had been barred from the trip, which will see the secretary travel to Britain, Ukraine, Belarus and Central Asia. Tandon said the timing appeared to be direct retaliation after Pompeo unleashed a profanity-laden tirade toward another NPR reporter, Mary Louise Kelly, last week after she asked about the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Yovanovitch’s removal is a key piece of the two articles of impeachment filed against President Donald Trump in the House and his ongoing trial in the Senate. “We can only conclude that the State Department is retaliating against National Public Radio as a result of this exchange,” Tandon said in a statement on Monday. “Michele is a consummate professional who has covered the State Department for nearly two decades.” The State Department removed NPR reporter Michele Kelemen from the press pool on ⁦@SecPompeo⁩ trip this week to Europe and Central Asia following his dustup w ⁦@NPRKelly⁩.

Kelly, the co-host of NPR’s “All Things Considered,” said last week that Pompeo asked to speak with her privately after she pressed him about Ukraine in an interview. She said she was led to a living room near his office where the secretary “shouted” at her for about 10 minutes. “He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine,” she told NPR’s Ari Shapiro. “He asked, ‘Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?’ He used the F-word in that sentence and many others.” She said the secretary then asked if she could even find Ukraine on a map. When she said she could, he had an aide bring in an unlabeled map for her to prove it. Pompeo responded after Kelly shared details of the exchange, blaming what he called the “unhinged” media and accusing the journalist of lying to him. “It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency,” the secretary said in a statement. “This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration.” Tandon called on the State Department to reconsider its decision to bar Kelemen from Pompeo’s trip this week, saying the press corps that covers the agency is “dedicated to informing the public and holding this and every administration accountable by asking questions about the issues of the day.” “The State Department has courageously defended journalists around the world through statements under its seal,” Tandon said Monday. “We are committed to do our part to preserve a respectful, professional relationship with the institution we cover.”",6.945413398743329,4.678277307639558,2.2671360911037715,18

The House in December passed two articles of impeachment against Trump ― abuse of power and obstruction of Congress ― stemming from his efforts to get Ukraine to publicly commit to investigating political rival Joe Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. Democrats are urging the Senate to call new witnesses who have direct knowledge of Trump’s handling of congressionally-approved aid to Ukraine, including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Senate Republicans have been reluctant to do so. But an explosive report in The New York Times on Sunday that Bolton believed Trump tied the aid to Ukraine announcing his requested investigations prompted some key GOP senators to say they may vote in favor of calling such witnesses. Each side in the trial was allotted 24 hours over three days to make their opening arguments. The Democrats concluded their presentation on Friday. After Trump’s defense team wraps up its arguments, senators will have 16 hours to ask questions before voting on whether to call new witnesses.

The emails cited by the Post show that Pompeo’s press aide, Katie Martin, agreed to allow the topic of Ukraine with reporter Mary Louise Kelly with the understanding that it would not be the focus of their conversation. This agreement followed some back-and-forth between the pair, as initially Martin wanted Ukraine entirely off the table. “Is that something we can agree to?” Martin asked Kelly, who co-hosts NPR’s news program “All Things Considered.” Kelly said she would like to largely focus on Iran but that she planned to also ask about Ukraine and any other hot topics that may arise before they met. “I never agree to take anything off the table,” she told Martin. The emails show Martin agreed with this arrangement. Kelly, in an email to HuffPost on Monday, said she can confirm the accuracy of the Post’s report, stating reporter “Paul Farhi accurately describes my email exchange with Katie Martin at State.” In Kelly’s later interview with Pompeo on Friday, the secretary balked when faced with questions about Ukraine, specifically regarding former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Pompeo repeated that he only agreed to come on her program to discuss Iran. “I confirmed with your staff last night that I would talk about Iran and Ukraine,” Kelly told him. After the interview, Pompeo branded Kelly a liar in a statement released from his office that accused her of not only reneging on a promise to not discuss Ukraine but of reporting on a later conversation he had with her that he claimed was off the record. Kelly, in addressing that later conversation in her report, said that a member of Pompeo’s staff asked her not to audio record their conversation but that she was never asked to agree that his words would be off the record. “She did not say we were off the record, nor would I have agreed,” Kelly has said. According to Kelly, Pompeo yelled at her while using the “F-word and many others” because she questioned him about Ukraine. She said Pompeo accused her of not knowing where Ukraine is located and challenged her to point out where the country is on a map, which he ordered his staff to produce. Kelly said she correctly identified Ukraine’s location when instructed. Pompeo has claimed that Kelly, who has a master’s degree in European studies from Cambridge University, was not correct. “It is worth noting that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine,” Pompeo said in his statement, appearing to refer to his map challenge. His statement did not deny that he yelled at Kelly or used obscenities. Pompeo’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.",5.763970396660902,4.1044233064589,1.6595470902020022,18

Bolton’s book alleges that Trump tied the release of congressionally approved Ukraine aid to the Ukrainians’ announcing investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, The New York Times reported on Sunday. The report caught Senate Republicans by surprise and upped the pressure for them to allow witnesses ― Bolton included ― to be heard and other evidence to be presented in the trial. Following the Times story, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said it was “increasingly likely” that at least four Republicans would join Democratic senators in passing a motion to subpoena Bolton. But Trump’s lawyers conspicuously avoided referring to Bolton during Monday’s arguments. Instead, they kept insisting there was no connection between the security assistance to Ukraine and any investigation desired by Trump, contrary to Bolton’s reported account and the testimony of more than a dozen diplomats last fall. “We deal with transcript evidence. We deal with publicly available information. We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards,” said Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, in a brief allusion to the Times story. Only Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a member of Trump’s defense team, referred to the Bolton allegations, albeit in passing. He did so late in the evening in the middle of a one-hour lecture on why abuse of power isn’t an impeachable offense ― a theory contradicted by many experts, including Attorney General William Barr. “Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense. That is clear from the history, that is clear from the language of the Constitution — you cannot turn conduct that is not impeachable into impeachable conduct simply by using words like ‘quid pro quo’ and ‘personal benefit,’” Dershowitz said. In his remarks before the Senate, White House deputy counsel Mike Purpura said that nobody testified “in House records” that Trump had linked the aid to Ukraine with investigations of the Bidens or with a White House meeting between Trump and Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That’s not true. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified in the House impeachment inquiry last year that, based on his conversations with the president, it was his understanding that the Ukraine aid was linked to investigations of the Bidens and that “everyone was in the loop.” Trump’s defenders have argued that Sondland’s statements were based merely on his own assumptions. The House asked Bolton to testify in October, but he did not appear because the White House did not authorize him to do so. House Democrats decided not to pursue the matter in court, arguing that doing so would have taken months of legal action. Now, Senate Democrats want to hear from witnesses like Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who as firsthand witnesses could shed more light on the Ukraine aid delay. The 45 Democratic senators and two Democratic-leaning independents need four Republican senators to vote with them to support motions to subpoena witnesses and other evidence. Republicans, meanwhile, sought to dismiss the Bolton development and its potential impact on the length and scope of the trial. “Truly, there’s nothing new here. It does seem to be an effort to sell books,” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters on Monday, suggesting Bolton’s credibility was at issue. “Right now I don’t see any need to have more witnesses, unless we have a lot more witnesses,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said. “I don’t think it’s appropriate to use the U.S. Senate as a fishing hole.” “My view is witnesses would just be prolonging the same outcome,” Cramer said. “I’m not so naive as to think the Bolton revelation didn’t cause some people some pause, but I don’t know what any individual is thinking one way or the other.” The president’s defense team argued that Trump did nothing wrong during that July 25 phone call last year when he asked Zelensky to investigate Trump’s domestic political opponent. “Asking a foreign leader to get to the bottom of issues of corruption is not a violation of an oath,” Sekulow said. In the phone call, the president specifically asked for an investigation of the Bidens and did not mention any general concerns about corruption. But Trump’s attorneys described Hunter Biden as a one-man whirlwind of corruption for his role on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president of the United States. “Every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden’s involvement at Burisma agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest,” former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi said Monday, describing House testimony. However, Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, testified in the House inquiry that he saw no validity to Trump’s allegations against the Bidens. Other diplomats said pushing an investigation of the Bidens benefited Trump, not the U.S. national interest. Bondi said Democrats themselves had brought up the Bidens, and she frequently referred to media reports questioning Hunter Biden’s board seat, including a Washington Post story in which a controversial former Ukrainian prosecutor claimed that Joe Biden had urged the prosecutor’s firing because he’d been investigating Burisma. (In fact, the prosecutor was widely accused of being insufficiently aggressive in pursuing corruption.) “All we’re saying is there was a basis to raise this, to talk about this issue, and that is enough,” Bondi said. In the House impeachment articles, Democrats allege that Trump withheld military assistance, as well as a coveted White House visit, in order to get Zelensky to announce the investigations Trump wanted. Because Ukraine ultimately received the security assistance that had been withheld, and because Trump ultimately did meet with Zelensky, Trump’s lawyers insisted on Monday that no harm was done. Trump and Zelensky met in New York on Sept. 25, “all without anyone making any statement about any investigations,” Purpura said. “So much for quid pro quo for a meeting with the president.” Zelensky never got the White House visit he wanted, however. At their New York meeting, he thanked Trump for an invitation but seemed to complain that he’d been left hanging. “You invited me,” Zelensky said. “But I think — I’m sorry, but I think you forgot to tell me the date.” Ryan J.

I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. With that being said, the... A key part of Trump’s defense in the impeachment process has been that his decision to withhold the aid was completely separate from his request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Tying the two together would indicate that Trump attempted a quid pro quo with a foreign government in order to sway the 2020 presidential election ― which Democrats have said was the case since the impeachment inquiry began. According to the Times, Bolton alleged that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo privately admitted there was no basis to Rudy Giuliani’s claims that ousted U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was corrupt, and he believed Trump’s personal attorney was acting on behalf of other clients. Bolton also wrote that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was around for at least one phone call during which Trump and Giuliani discussed Yovanovitch, according to the Times. Bolton also reportedly said he raised his concerns about Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy with Attorney General William Barr after Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Bolton alleged that he was the one who informed Barr that the president mentioned him on the call, according to the Times. A spokesperson for Barr told the publication he denied that allegation. Bolton’s account of Trump’s alleged remarks were included in the former national security adviser’s unpublished manuscript, which he has been circulating to close associates. The book, according to the Times, represents what Bolton might say in a testimony if the Senate calls him as a witness in Trump’s impeachment trial. Bolton spox Sarah Tinsley tells @HouseInSession: ""The ambassador transmitted a hard-copy draft of his manuscript to the White House for pre-publication review by the National Security Council. The ambassador has not passed the manuscript to anyone else, only the NSC.” In response to the Times report, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) reiterated his demands for the upper chamber to call witnesses to testify in the impeachment trial. Bolton has said that he would testify before senators if subpoenaed, but Senate Republicans have repeatedly stonewalled efforts to call any witnesses or bring any additional evidence. “John Bolton has the evidence,” Schumer tweeted Sunday night. “It’s up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump’s actions testify in the Senate trial.” John Bolton has the evidence.It’s up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump’s actions testify in the Senate trial.

The draft outline gives a view of what Bolton might say if called as a witness, according to the Times. Bolton has said that he would testify before senators if subpoenaed, but Senate Republicans have effectively stonewalled efforts to call any witnesses or bring any additional evidence for review in the trial. The upper chamber will vote on whether to consider witnesses and additional evidence after a period of questioning by senators from both parties. In order to subpoena new witnesses in the trial, Democrats need to sway at least four Republican senators to support an initial vote on including more evidence. Three Republicans have shown some level of interest in potentially voting in favor of doing so: Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who has led the charge in trying to bring witness testimony to the impeachment trial, reiterated his demands in response to the Times report. “John Bolton has the evidence,” Schumer tweeted Sunday night. “It’s up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump’s actions testify in the Senate trial.” John Bolton has the evidence.It’s up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump’s actions testify in the Senate trial.

Trump on Sunday agreed with comments posted on Twitter that labeled the nonprofit media organization a “big-government, Democrat Party propaganda operation” and asked why NPR receives government funding and still exists. “A very good question!” Trump responded. Trump has repeatedly called to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which contributes to funding for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), National Public Radio (NPR) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). A very good question! According to NPR’s website, fees paid by NPR’s member stations make up the largest portion of its revenue. Less than 1% of NPR’s annual operating budget is covered by grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments. Trump pushed his latest attack on NPR after reporter Mary Louise Kelly, who co-hosts the news program “All Things Considered,” revealed on Friday that Pompeo yelled at her while using the “F-word and many others” after she questioned him about the war-torn country in an interview that she was asked not to audio-record. “I was taken to the Secretary’s private living room where he was waiting and where he shouted at me for about the same amount of time as the interview itself,” she said. “He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine.” Pompeo has defended his behavior and accused Kelly in a statement of breaking an agreement that his comments to her would be off the record. He also accused her of not being able to find Ukraine on a map when directed. Kelly had previously reported that she correctly identified Ukraine, which is Europe’s second-largest country after Russia, when Pompeo demanded she point it out.

Kelly said Pompeo was furious that she questioned him about Ukraine on the program Friday, and he took her aside after the interview to launch a profanity-laced tirade against her. He has not contradicted her report of the confrontation. Pompeo has only insisted it was “off the record,” which NPR has denied. Taylor called out Pompeo for his misguided attitude about Ukraine in an op-ed in The New York Times. “The relationship between the United States and Ukraine is key to our national security. Americans should care about Ukraine,” Taylor wrote. The country remains vital to America regardless of the outcome of the ongoing impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Ukraine is “defending itself — and the West — against Russian attack” along its border, he added. “Until Russia recommits to a rules-based international order, Western nations are in jeopardy.” The battle has come at a heavy cost to Ukraine. Since the Russians invaded six years ago, 14,000 Ukrainians have died in this war, Taylor noted. Russian President Vladimir Putin “seems to want to return to the law of the jungle ... where powerful nations dominated and invaded less powerful nations, where nations established spheres of influence that oppressed neighbors, leading to war and suffering,” Taylor concluded. “In the contest between democracies and autocracies, the contest between freedom and unfreedom, Ukraine is the front line.” Pompeo is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv later this week. Despite what Pompeo reportedly told Kelly, he told Bloomberg just last week that Ukraine is an important nation that “sits at the edge of democracy and tyranny.” He also denied in the interview, seen in the video below, that there was any “shadow” Ukrainian foreign policy being carried out by Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani — which appeared to be contradicted Sunday in a circulated book manuscript by former national security adviser John Bolton.

But even if Democrats can’t drag in White House officials like acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney or former national security adviser John Bolton, they already have evidence from someone much better: Donald J. Trump himself, who has provided some of the most incriminating remarks in the impeachment trial. After an unidentified official blew the whistle on the president last August for trying to coerce a foreign government into helping him win the 2020 election, the White House released a partial transcript of the phone call that sparked the complaint. Republicans contend that it shows Trump cares about corruption; Democrats say that it shows Trump asking the Ukrainian president for a sham investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. If there was any doubt about which side is right, Trump has explained exactly what he wanted from Ukraine. “I would think that, if they were honest about it, they’d start a major investigation into the Bidens,” Trump said outside the White House on Oct. 3 last year. “It’s a very simple answer.” During the first three days of arguments in front of the U.S. Senate, Democratic House impeachment managers played the clip of Trump’s comment at least four times. As the president’s legal team assumes control of the proceedings on Saturday, they’ll have to come up with a credible explanation for his comments ― something that Trump’s defenders in Congress have struggled to do so far. “I can’t imagine being in the position of being President Trump’s attorney, because he says things all the time that are directly contradictory to his own interests, to his defense strategy or to what he said yesterday,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told HuffPost this week. The Oct. 3 clip is just one of several videos Democrats have shown repeatedly at trial. In another, from a June 12 ABC News interview, the president said that if a foreign government offered dirt on an opponent, he’d accept it ― contrary to campaign finance law, which prohibits candidates from accepting anything of value from foreign governments. “There’s nothing wrong with listening,” Trump said in the video. “If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said,] ‘We have information on your opponent,’ oh, I think I’d want to hear it.” In an Oct. 17 video shown at least four times, a reporter explicitly asked Mulvaney to confirm that the Trump administration had withheld military assistance from Ukraine as a “quid pro quo” in return for political favors. “We do that all the time with foreign policy,” Mulvaney said, adding a moment later: “Get over it.” Democrats, obviously, think the videos are great stuff, even though they’re not new. “The video is telling the story very powerfully and the president of the United States and his chief of staff ... basically confessed to the violations that they’re charged with,” Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) said. Republicans are less impressed. “Old stuff,” said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). But in the months since the videos were recorded, Republicans haven’t come up with a compelling defense of a president openly demanding that a foreign government investigate his political opponent. They have argued instead that the Democrats used a flawed process in the House impeachment inquiry. Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) acknowledged this week that the Biden request was bad. “I wouldn’t have done it myself, but it’s not impeachable,” Braun told HuffPost. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of the House members advising Trump’s trial team, seemed to concede that the president’s statements have not helped his case, but Meadows suggested the public has already factored in those remarks. “The poor narratives are already out there,” Meadows said. “I don’t see anything that could get any worse.” Trump’s call for a “major investigation” of Biden by Ukraine points to a fundamental question: Is it OK for the president to ask a foreign government to investigate his political rival? Many Republicans have avoided giving a yes or no answer. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told HuffPost that, speaking hypothetically, if a president asked a foreign government for electoral assistance, “it would not be a good thing.” But he said that’s not what Trump did on his phone call. So what did Trump do? “I think that he asked the Ukrainian president if the government would cooperate in ongoing American investigations, DOJ investigations, which seems fine to me,” Hawley said. On the call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to talk to Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, and to U.S. Attorney General William Barr about investigating both Biden and a conspiracy theory (favored by Trump) that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Department of Justice said in September that it had nothing to do with any investigation into Biden. “The president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,” a DOJ spokesperson said at the time. “The president has not asked the attorney general to contact Ukraine — on this or any other matter.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) ― who is probably the president’s biggest Senate defender and someone who has described Trump’s impeachment as a “lynching” ― acknowledged this week that the president might be wrong about a few things. “The president believes that what happened in the Ukraine with the Bidens was inappropriate. Now, whether or not that will withstand scrutiny, I don’t know,” Graham said, adding that the Ukrainian government was definitely not a bad actor in 2016. “All I can do is tell you is that from the president’s point of view, he did nothing wrong in his mind,” Graham said.",2.984546178535935,2.7167239748880516,0.26782220364788323,16

Trump is currently on trial in the Senate after being impeached by the House for pressuring the Ukrainian government to open an investigation that could benefit him in the 2020 presidential election and withholding military aid until it did so, and then obstructing Congress’s efforts to look into the matter. Trump himself has said he wanted Ukraine to launch an investigation into the son of potential 2020 opponent and former Vice President Joe Biden. But Trump’s defense argued that Trump wasn’t the one interfering with the election ― in fact, they said, now Democrats are, through a process that has involved selective leaks, closed door meetings and incomplete presentation of facts. “They’re here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history, and we can’t allow that to happen,” said White House counsel Pat Cipollone. He said earlier that Democrats were asking the Senate to overturn the 2016 election and interfere in the next one ― something that could be argued for any removal from office in an election year. “They’re asking you to remove President Trump from the ballot in an election that’s occurring in approximately nine months,” Cipollone said. “They’re asking you to tear up all of the ballots across this country ... take that decision away from the American people.” Trump’s attorneys suggested at the beginning of the day that they plan to spend far less time defending the president than House Democratic impeachment managers spent arguing for the prosecution. While Democrats spent all of the 24 hours allotted by the rules, Trump’s team spent about two hours on Saturday and far less than the 24 total. They argued that they don’t need the time, again referring to the election. “We will finish efficiently and quickly so we can all go have an election,” Cipollone said. The fact that Democrats took up all of their allotted 24 hours to argue their case came up repeatedly. Trump’s attorneys argued that, in all of that time, the House managers had failed to include certain details. Mike Purpura, deputy counsel to the president, noted that Ukrainian leaders have said they did not feel pressured, that some top officials in the U.S. and Ukraine have said they didn’t know the assistance was paused, that aid was eventually approved and that Trump’s support for the nation was stronger than his predecessor’s. Purpura said that by suggesting Trump did pressure Ukraine, Democrats were effectively accusing Ukrainian leaders of lying. “There can’t be a quid pro quo without the quo,” Purpura said, arguing Ukrainian officials couldn’t have been pressured by the Trump administration if they were unaware of the hold on the aid. But Olena Zerkal, a former deputy minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine, said Ukrainian diplomats in Washington knew there was a problem with the aid as early as July 25, the day of Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that prompted the impeachment inquiry. Her account was backed up by congressional testimony from Laura Cooper, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. Trump’s lawyers also sought to aggressively undermine the House managers’ arguments by suggesting the Democrats’ witnesses only “presumed” Trump’s hold on Ukraine aid was linked to investigations, calling it a “fatal” blow to their case. They showed video footage of testimony from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who told House impeachment investigators last year it was his understanding that Trump sought to extort Ukraine’s government for personal political gain. Sondland later amended his testimony, saying he told a top Zelensky aide on September 1 that the aid was linked to opening investigations into Biden. Trump’s defense implied that Democrats were overstepping simply because they didn’t agree with the president’s decisions. “Disagreeing with the president’s foreign policy is not an impeachable offense,” Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said. Trump’s team accused Democrats of acting nefariously behind the scenes ― Republicans have claimed that interviewing witnesses in a secure room (that was accessible by many GOP lawmakers) was part of a cover-up ― and holding only staged public hearings. The first clip Trump’s defense played was a favorite among Republicans: video of House impeachment manager Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) doing an exaggerated paraphrase of Trump’s call with Ukraine. They said repeatedly that the House Democrats had held something back. “The House managers didn’t tell you ― why not?” Purpura said at one point. Schiff responded after the Senate ended its day, writing that Trump’s defense was trying to distract from the truth but hadn’t actually contested the facts. “They don’t contest the basic architecture of this scheme,” Schiff said. “They do not contest that the president solicited a foreign nation to interfere in our election, to help him cheat. I think they acknowledge by not even contesting this that the facts are overwhelming.” Trump’s lawyers are expected to continue their opening arguments on Monday. Following the conclusion of their arguments, and a period of questioning by senators from both sides, the senators will vote on whether to consider witnesses and other evidence. Democrats want to hear from witnesses like Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and several of his top deputies, who could answer questions about Trump’s hold on Ukraine aid. The White House blocked Mulvaney and the others from testifying in the House impeachment inquiry, and most Republicans are opposed to calling them in the Senate trial for fear of lengthening the proceedings. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said afterward that Trump’s defense team did a “good job” and is “making me think about things.” But the moderate Democrat added that their argument underscored the need to call witnesses like Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. “One thing that stuck in my mind is they said there isn’t a witness they have had so far that had direct contact with the president. I’d love to hear from Mulvaney and Bolton,” Manchin said. But Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) dismissed the point raised by Manchin and other Democrats on Saturday, questioning why witnesses were needed when the House managers had already described their case against Trump as rock-solid. “They said their case was overwhelming and undisputed. In a court of law, if a party says their evidence is undisputed, then you say why do you need any more witnesses?” Cornyn said. This story has been updated with additional comments from lawmakers.

No One Buys It.,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came out swinging — again — Saturday in yet another attack on a National Public Radio host, indicating she mistook Bangladesh for Ukraine in his map challenge. But no one is buying it. Pompeo exploded in a profanity-laced tirade at “All Things Considered” host Mary Louise Kelly after she dared to ask him questions about Ukraine in an interview Friday. He led her to a private office after the interview and yelled at her, using the “F-word and many others,” said Kelly. “He shouted at me for about the same amount of time as the interview itself,” which was 10 minutes. Pompeo also asked: “Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?” Kelly recounted. He then challenged her to find Ukraine on a blank map, which Kelly did. On Saturday, Pompeo appeared to indicate that she mistook Bangladesh for Ukraine, which is 3,600 miles away. “It’s worth noting that Bangladesh is not the Ukraine,” he scoffed in his statement. He also claimed that the ugly confrontation was off the record, which NPR denies (and stands by its report), and that Kelly “lied,” was “shameful” and violated the “basic rules of journalism and decency.” Some observers speculated that it was Pompeo who made the geographical goof in his attempt to call out Kelly — by confusing Bangladesh with Belarus, which borders Ukraine. The Washington Post blasted Pompeo’s tale as a “blatant gaslighting attempt.” There is “absolutely no way” Kelly mistook Bangladesh for Ukraine, the Post declared. To mention just a couple of issues, the countries are on different continents, and Bangladesh clearly doesn’t share a border with Russia, so it would be difficult to engage in a border war with that nation, something a journalist would know. In addition, Kelly is a former national security reporter who has traveled extensively abroad and has a master’s degree in European studies from prestigious Cambridge University. “The mere fact” that Pompeo challenged Kelly to begin with suggests he didn’t “know who he was dealing with,” the Post wrote. Former White House ethics chief Walter Shaub blasted Pompeo’s statement as possibly the “most breathtakingly childish” ever issued by a secretary of state in “over two centuries.” Pompeo claims @NPRKelly mistakenly identified Bangladesh as Ukraine. As we evaluate what may be the most breathtakingly childish official statement ever issued by a Secretary of State in over two centuries, consider the magnitude of the mistake he implausibly claims she made:  Then other Twitter critics piled on. Mr. @SecPompeo , please provide evidence to support your contention that @NPRKelly confused Bangladesh with Ukraine. Otherwise, your statement is disinformation, slander, and embarrassing to those of us who pay your salary. You are a public servant. You work for us. The path from Ukraine to Bangladesh looks like a graph of Pompeo's credibility.  What are the odds that it was Pompeo who misidentified Ukraine and thought it was actually Bangladesh? Pretty good. See that red? That’s Bangladesh, to the east of India and south of China, 3600 miles from Ukraine.Mary Louise Kelly has a masters in European Studies from Cambridge. She knows where Ukraine is located.Mike Pompeo is blantantly slandering a journalist for questioning him.  That Bangladesh jibe negates the entire statement. An obvious lie. First, no educated person would confuse Ukraine with Bangladesh. Please. 🙄Second, is there *anyone* in this administration who is not an unhinged, narcissistic toddler?? Oh my God this is exactly what happened. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to slander a reporter who knows far more about European geography that he does, by insinuating that she has misidentified Ukraine as Belarus. But he is such a dingdong he accidentally wrote Bangladesh. “Unhinged.” The notion that @NPRKelly would confuse Ukraine with Bangladesh on a map is so ludicrous it doesn’t even merit comment. As for the other accusations, I trust our reporter. And as for “basic rules of decency”: well. ",4.048230379961082,4.9235840265533595,-0.8753536465922771,18

A portion of the recording shows Trump in frame of the video, which was filmed at a private dinner on April 30, 2018, PBS reported. The recording also picked up Trump telling his associates to “get rid” of then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, adding that they needed to “take her out.” Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, was at the dinner when Trump made these claims and a voice that appears to be his can be heard during the recording. “The biggest problem there, I think where we need to start is we got to get rid of the ambassador,” Parnas can be heard saying in the video, adding that Yovanovitch is “telling everybody” Trump is going to get impeached. “Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow,” Trump replies. “I don’t care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. OK? Do it.” Trump has insisted multiple times that he doesn’t know who Parnas is, though Parnas’ attorney Joseph Bondy has published videos and images of Parnas with Trump and his family members on Twitter. Call the witnesses. Hear the sworn testimony. @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani @senatemajldr @SenSchumer #LetLevSpeak #LevRemembers  The release of the video recording confirms that Trump indeed called for Yovanovitch’s ouster, as suggested by reports from ABC News and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday. It also sheds more light on Trump’s efforts to attack Yovanovitch and push her out of her post. While sitting presidents have the privilege to appoint and fire U.S. ambassadors, Yovanovitch testified to Congress last year that she felt threatened by the president and was a target of an unprecedented smear campaign against her reputation by the administration. She was eventually recalled from her ambassadorship in May 2019, a year after the video published on Saturday was recorded. About 39 minutes into the footage, Trump also expresses surprise that Ukraine produces oil, and wonders how long Ukraine would last in a war with Russia. “Ukraine has oil,” he says. “Ukraine? How come ― they don’t have any money? Why aren’t companies going in, too risky?” Others respond that Ukraine is protected because other countries know it has support from the U.S., which Trump answers by complaining about European countries’ lack of support for Ukraine, echoing statements he’s made in public. “It’s always us that has to support everybody,” Trump says. “And then you wonder, why isn’t Germany supporting? Why isn’t others?” Trump then asks how long would Ukraine “last in a fight with Russia?” A voice replies, “without us, not very long.” Then someone says, “30 seconds.” On Friday night, Bondy told Maddow that Parnas was the one who replied to that question from Trump. Striking moment in the tape.President Trump asks how long Ukraine would last in its war w/Russia.- ""Without us?""- ""Not long.""- ""30 seconds.""The tape is from April 2018.Then, in 2019, the president orders the withholding of all US military aid to Ukraine. In the footage, Trump also spoke at length about beating Hilary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, then said he would have had an even easier time beating President Barack Obama in his 2012 race. “Obama would have been easier, second term,” Trump can be heard saying. “[GOP nominee Mitt] Romney should have never lost. Obama would have been much easier.” Igor Fruman, another associate of Giuliani’s, filmed the recording, according to PBS News. In October, Fruman was indicted along with Parnas on campaign finance charges for allegedly making straw donations and funneling foreign money into Trump’s presidential campaign.

I feel like the walls are closing in on Republicans. I don’t understand it. I think they will rue the day they have turned this trial into a cover-up,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Friday, the final day of presentations by House impeachment managers charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of congressional investigations. “I don’t know whether it’s having the same impact on my Republican colleagues as it is on me,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who is friendly with senators on the other side of the aisle, added of the proceedings so far. “I haven’t seen or heard anything to me that suggests significant movement.” In order to subpoena new witnesses in the trial, Democrats need to convince at least four Republican senators to support an initial vote on including additional evidence next week. Three GOP senators have expressed some level of interest in doing so and are considered the likeliest votes in favor: Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Finding at least one more Republican senator to join that effort will be difficult given broad opposition within the GOP to increasing the scope and length of the trial. Republican leaders have warned their members that a subpoena for witness testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney could mean a protracted legal fight over executive privilege, dragging out the process for weeks or even months. But Democrats maintain a dispute over executive privilege ― which Trump is expected to assert over witness testimony ― could be resolved relatively quickly given that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is presiding over the proceedings. “If it’s signed, the subpoena, by the chief justice, I think it’ll whip through the courts very, very quickly. Much different than the House situation,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday. Still, Republicans are expressing confidence that they’ll prevail next week. Asked Friday how much support there is in his caucus at the moment for calling witnesses, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said, “Not a lot.” The North Carolina Republican, who is facing reelection this year, said that Democrats’ rhetoric about how undeniable the case is against Trump has been “somewhat discounted by how much time they’re spending singing about all the new information they need.” One possible vote for calling witnesses could be Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a quiet institutionalist with bipartisan credibility who is retiring this year. Alexander is not close to Trump and doesn’t emulate the president’s rhetoric like some of his colleagues do. But he is a close ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and he has rarely voted against the party line since Trump was inaugurated in 2017 ― save for a vote to revert the president’s national emergency on the border. The Tennessee Republican was one of several senators who pushed for giving the House managers more time to put on their case this week, contrary to the wishes of McConnell and Trump’s defense team. While he has emphasized the need to give the public at least the appearance of a fair trial, Alexander has kept his thoughts about witnesses and evidence to himself, at least for now. “We’ve done a good job of letting the House managers present their case,” Alexander told reporters on Thursday. “The managers have said they’ve offered a mountain of overwhelming evidence, so we have a lot to consider. And I think if the American people are watching, they’ll see the Senate taking this very seriously, allowing a fair trial, and we’ll see what the result is at the end.” Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas), who is also retiring this year, was also tight-lipped about the notion of including witnesses and new evidence. “I’m just a juror trying to get all the facts that I can,” Roberts said Friday. The House impeachment team will conclude its case Friday evening, and Trump’s defense team will launch its defense during what is expected to be a short session on Saturday. Following the conclusion of Trump’s defense next week, and a period of questioning by senators from both sides, the Senate will take a vote on whether to consider witnesses and other evidence. Public polling is overwhelmingly on the side of Democrats as they press the need for witnesses. Per a new ABC News/Washington Post poll released Friday, two-thirds of Americans said the Senate should do so, including 45% of Republicans, and 65% of independents. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who observed on Twitter that Republicans looked “shook” by the House managers’ closing arguments Thursday, warned that senators who vote against including witnesses would have trouble explaining their vote to the American public. “Anyone who stakes a claim to being reasonable, moderate and open-minded is going to have a devil of a time explaining why this is the only trial in American history to lack witnesses and documents,” Schatz said Friday. “It’s not just that it will lack witnesses and documents, it’s that they’re affirmatively voting to shut it down without getting all of the information.”",4.442047895794173,2.4836103768200246,1.958437518974148,11

Val Demings (D-Fla.) told senators Friday. Democrats have accused Trump of engaging in a cover-up in addition to abusing his power. When the House investigated Trump’s involvement with Ukraine, the administration refused to turn over documents or allow key individuals to testify. Demings said the administration has blocked more than 70 requests for documents and testimony, but that Democrats have been able to assemble their impeachment articles thanks to more than a dozen “courageous public servants who were willing to follow the law, comply with subpoenas and tell the truth.” Democrats are finishing their third and final day of opening arguments Friday, with each impeachment manager taking a few minutes at the top of his or her presentation to thank the increasingly restless senators for listening. Demings spoke to the obstruction-of-Congress charge, the second of two impeachment articles that Democrats have brought against Trump. The first article charges Trump with abuse of power for his scheme to pressure Ukraine into announcing an investigation of his highest-polling political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful. A series of diplomats testified last fall that the pressure campaign on Ukraine subverted U.S. foreign policy for the president’s personal benefit. Democrats said their case is overwhelming, but that it would have been even stronger if more witnesses had testified. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), another of the seven impeachment managers, who worked as a staffer on the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate hearings in the 1970s, said President Richard Nixon was more forthcoming with aides and documents than Trump has been. “No president ever used the official power of his office to prevent witnesses from giving testimony before Congress in such a blanket and indiscriminate manner,” Lofgren said. Impeachment manager Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), wrapping up his comments about how Trump had obstructed congressional investigations, said the president was “the first and only president ever to declare himself unaccountable.” “Only his will goes,” Nadler said Friday, urging the Senate to remove Trump from office. “He is a dictator. This must not stand.” On Saturday morning, Trump’s defense team is expected to start the first of as many as three days of arguments against removing Trump from office, and then the Senate will vote on whether to call witnesses. It’s unclear if enough Republicans will break ranks ― four are needed ― to vote in favor of gathering more evidence. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow told reporters on Friday that the “idea that you obstruct Congress by exercising constitutional privileges is absurd.” He said the courts have said that executive privilege rights are “fundamentally important rights to weigh our separation of powers under our form of government.” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading the team of House impeachment managers, said the managers might ask Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to rule on questions of executive privilege ― although he noted that Senate Republicans might overrule him. “You cannot use executive privilege to hide wrongdoing or criminality or impeachable misconduct, and that is exactly the purpose for which they seek to use it,” Schiff said.

The report backs up claims made by Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

But they can all have a laugh at the expense of politician-turned-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. On Thursday, as House Democrats laid out their case for removing Trump from office, impeachment manager Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) played a clip of a former Trump homeland security adviser Tom Bossert in which he quipped that hiring Giuliani was a way to “impeach oneself.” “Last year, retired former Sen. Judd Gregg wrote a piece in The Hill magazine saying the three ways or the five ways to impeach oneself. And the third way was to hire Rudy Giuliani,” Bossert said on ABC News’ “This Week” in September. The Senate has banned independent audio or video of the floor of the Senate, only offering a video feed that gives a narrow perspective on the impeachment trial proceedings. But a HuffPost reporter in the chamber at the time spotted a number of Republicans and Democrats laughing and smiling after hearing Bossert’s line about the former New York mayor. Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) smiled at each other after the clip, as did Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and James Risch (R-Idaho). Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who had previously said he’s not sure Giuliani was helping the president, chuckled to himself. Giuliani did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment, though HuffPost’s texts were marked as read. Serving as Trump’s personal attorney, Giuliani is at the center of the events that led to Trump’s impeachment. He’s made sweeping corruption allegations against former vice president and Trump political opponent Joe Biden, and he lobbied Trump to remove U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch because of the perception she got in the way of a campaign to have Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announce an investigation into Biden’s son Hunter that would benefit Trump politically. Giuliani kept up the campaign against Biden on Thursday, tweeting that he’d release evidence that the “Biden Family Enterprise made millions by selling public office.” Giuliani was a major focus of the House impeachment managers’ presentation on Thursday. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) laid out a narrative of Giuliani’s efforts beginning around the time that Biden announced his presidential campaign in the spring of 2019. Lofgren said government officials came to learn that Giuliani was the “key to Ukraine,” as Trump directed government employees to work with his personal agent on matters of foreign policy. They realized there was “no getting around Rudy Giuliani when it came to Ukraine” and that they “had no choice” but to deal with him, Lofgren said. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said during a break in the trial that there’s recognition on both sides of the aisle that Giuliani has brought about a number of new problems for Trump. Hirono pointed to remarks by former Trump national security adviser John Bolton that referred to Giuliani as a “hand grenade” who would “blow everybody up.” While Bolton has expressed a willingness to testify before the Senate during the impeachment trial, Republican senators voted Tuesday against subpoenaing Bolton’s testimony. “I think we all know that Rudy runs around and I think his credibility is entirely shot,” Hirono said.",3.1673186910594904,2.0016778012339516,1.1656408898255388,16

A House investigation determined that Trump withheld authorized military aid to the country because leaders declined to investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.

The party’s House impeachment managers argued Wednesday before the Senate that the document — supplemental material provided to the House by Jennifer Williams, a special adviser on Europe and Russia to Pence — should not be classified and alluded that the vice president’s office was attempting to conceal it because it was embarrassing. “This supplemental testimony will allow the Senate to see further corroborative evidence as it considers articles of impeachment,” a Democratic official working on the Senate trial said in a statement to reporters. “If declassified, it would provide the public further understanding of the events in question.” Pence spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sept. 18, and Williams testified that it was a “very positive” follow-up to a meeting the pair had earlier that month. But House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said in December that Williams provided lawmakers additional classified evidence about the Pence phone call after that deposition. Schiff called on Pence at the time to make public the document, saying there was “no legitimate basis” for the vice president to assert it was classified. Despite repeated Congressional requests, Vice President Pence has refused to declassify his aide Jennifer Williams' additional testimony.""I've read that testimony. And I'll just say: A cover up is not a proper reason to classify a document."" -@RepZoeLofgren  It’s unclear what is in the document, but Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), one of the party’s impeachment managers who has reviewed it, alluded that its contents contained damaging information about the call between Pence and the Ukrainian president. “Now I’ve read that testimony. Now I’ll just say: A cover-up is not a proper reason to classify a document,” Lofgren said during the Democrats’ oral arguments on Wednesday. “We urge the senators to review it, and we ask again that the White House declassify it. There is no basis to keep it classified, and again, in case the White House needs a reminder, it’s improper to keep something classified just to avoid embarrassment.” Lofgren continued to note that Pence has said he has no objection to the White House releasing the full transcript of his call with Zelensky. But despite that assertion, his office has refused multiple times to declassify Williams’s supplemental testimony about the call. At the end of the Democrats’ first day of oral arguments, Chief Justice John Robert said a “single one-paged classified document identified by the House managers for filing with the secretary of the Senate” would be made available to all senators to review in a classified setting. But Democrats have continued to call for its public release. Trump’s pressure campaign was the basis for two articles of impeachment passed by the House last month charging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate is holding a trial on those articles to determine if he should be removed from office. As part of the House investigation, lawmakers heard from a parade of current and former White House officials who described Trump’s demand that the Ukrainian leader announce an investigation into a political rival, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Williams was one of a handful of national security aides who listened in on Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky in real time, and she told House lawmakers in closed-door testimony that she believed President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign was “unusual and inappropriate.” “I found the specific references to be — to be more specific to the president in nature, to his personal political agenda, as opposed to a broader … foreign policy objective of the United States,” Williams told House investigators, according to a transcript from her deposition.",2.3159289459178307,2.4803346428795323,-0.1644056969617016,16

Facebook makes a fortune knowingly and intentionally disseminating political lies and misinformation, and that was clearly on Pelosi’s mind as she delivered a frank and damning response. “The Facebook business model is strictly to make money,” she said. “They don’t care about the impact on children, they don’t care about truth, they don’t care about where this is all coming from. And they have said even if they know it’s not true they will print it.” Fact check: True. Pelosi on Facebook:""They don't care about the impact on children, they don’t care about truth … I think what they have said very blatantly, very clearly that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people … I think their behavior is shameful.""  “I think that they have been very abusive of the great opportunity that technology has given them,” Pelosi continued. “All they want are their tax cuts and no anti-trust action against them. And they schmooze this administration in that regard because so far that’s what they have received.” Pelosi then alluded to the role Facebook played in the last presidential election, and warned that this time around, the company will knowingly play a similar role. “They have said very blatantly, very clearly, that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people, with money from God knows where. They didn’t even check on the money from Russia in the last election. They never even thought they should.” Fact check: Also true. As part of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election, a Kremlin-backed troll farm that called itself the “Internet Research Agency” paid for at least 3,000 divisive political ads on Facebook. The company accepted payment for the spots in Russian rubles. Those ads were in addition to other Russian efforts to sway public opinion on social media in favor of Donald Trump. A 2018 Senate Intelligence Committee report found thousands of covert Russian accounts on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit and Pinterest amassed millions of followers and hundreds of millions of social engagements.

The House Intelligence Committee released a collection of documents obtained from Giuliani’s indicted associate Lev Parnas. The evidence includes WhatsApp messages between Parnas and a Connecticut congressional candidate who apparently tracked Yovanovitch’s location in March. Lawrence Robbins, an attorney representing Yovanovitch, released a statement to several news outlets Tuesday night saying that the idea that the then-ambassador was being surveilled is “disturbing.” BREAKING: Ambassador Yovanovitch calls for an investigation into whether she was surveilled.Her lawyer Lawrence Robbins tells @NBCNews the notion her movements were being monitored is ""disturbing""  “Needless to say, the notion that American citizens and others were monitoring Ambassador Yovanovitch’s movements for unknown purposes is disturbing,” Robbins said in his statement, reported by NBC News and USA Today. “We trust that the appropriate authorities will conduct an investigation to determine what happened.” Parnas received messages from Robert F. Hyde in March 2019 that contained details about Yovanovitch’s location in Ukraine from people who appeared to be tailing her in Kyiv. Those messages came in response to articles, tweets and videos accusing Yovanovitch of being disloyal to Trump ― which Yovanovitch has denied and said was part of a smear campaign by Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer. “Wow. Can’t believe Trumo [sic] hasn’t fired this bitch. I’ll get right in that,” Hyde, the Republican congressional candidate, wrote to Parnas before sending him several updates about her whereabouts. “They are willing to help if we/you would like a price,” Hyde said in a separate text message. “Guess you can do anything in the Ukraine with money… what I was told.” Yovanovitch was removed in May as ambassador after Republicans complained she was undermining efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump’s political rivals in the 2020 presidential election. She testified in the House’s impeachment inquiry that the president was politically motivated to pressure the State Department to remove her because she was an obstacle for Trump and his allies to carry out shadow diplomacy in Ukraine. Hyde, who is a friend of Trump’s, responded to reports of the released documents by telling NBC News, “How low can liddle Adam Bull Schiff go. To take some texts my buddy’s and I wrote while we had a few drinks to some dweeb I met a few times.... Bull Schiff is a desperate turd,” referring to House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). Parnas is a Florida businessman who helped Giuliani try to find dirt on Biden. Parnas and Igor Fruman, another Giuliani associate, were arrested in October on charges they funneled foreign money into Republican campaigns, including Trump’s. That arrest came as the House was conducting its impeachment inquiry into the president. We’ve just asked the Court’s permission to give additional materials, extracted from three more of Lev Parnas’ electronic devices, to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence #HPSCI for use in the impeachment inquiry. #LetLevSpeak #LevRemembers  Parnas eventually complied with the impeachment inquiry by privately testifying and providing lawmakers with access to phone records and documents that were seized during his arrest. Over this past weekend, Parnas’s attorney Joseph Bondy asked a judge to let him turn over additional documents he considered essential to Trump’s impeachment case, including records from two cellphones and an iPad. The release of documents comes a day before the House is expected to vote on whether to send the articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate.

Among the documents was a previously unseen handwritten note by Parnas, a Florida businessman who helped Giuliani try to dig up dirt on one of Trump’s political rivals. The note read: “Get Zalensky to announce that the Biden case will be investigated.” The new evidence also includes letters sent to then-Ukranian President-elect Volodymyr Zelensky from Giuliani and WhatsApp message exchanges between Parnas and a man who apparently tracked the location of then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch in March. Parnas and Igor Fruman, another Giuliani associate, were arrested in October on claims that they funneled foreign money into Trump’s presidential campaign as the House continued its impeachment inquiry. As seen in the documents obtained by lawmakers, Parnas received messages from Republican Robert F.

It was submitted to be included as part of the official records sent to the Senate, along with the articles of impeachment against Trump. Schiff described the documents as “pertinent to the impeachment inquiry” in a letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). “Despite the President’s unprecedented and sweeping obstruction of our impeachment inquiry, we have continued to collect additional evidence relevant to the President’s scheme to abuse his power by pressing Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election for the President’s benefit,” the chairs of four House committees said in a statement Tuesday. The four ― Schiff, Nadler, Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) ― described the evidence submitted by Parnas as a “trove of documents that provide more information about the effort to coerce Ukraine into helping the President’s reelection campaign.” Weeks after his arrest, Parnas agreed to comply with the impeachment inquiry by testifying and giving lawmakers access to phone records and documents seized during his arrest. Over the weekend, Parnas’s attorney asked a judge to allow him to hand over even more documents that were “essential” to Trump’s impeachment inquiry, including records from two cellphones and an iPad.

Giuliani, who has acted as Trump’s attorney for free since early 2018, has been “working Trump hard” to be included among the lawyers who will defend him on the floor of the Senate, according to an informal adviser close to the White House who spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House declined to comment on Giuliani. A second informal adviser said Giuliani has not really been aggressively lobbying, but has made it known that he is “available” to offer his services. “They said, ‘Thanks, but no thanks,’” the adviser said, also on condition of anonymity. Giuliani did not respond to HuffPost’s queries on the matter. The former New York City mayor has, however, made it clear in recent public statements that he would enjoy arguing Trump’s case before the Senate. “I’d try the case. I’d love to try the case,” Giuliani told reporters at Trump’s New Year’s Eve party for paying guests at his Palm Beach resort. “I don’t know if anybody would have the courage to give me the case. But if you give me the case, I will prosecute it as a racketeering case.” And Saturday night, Giuliani told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro he would ask for the U.S. Supreme Court to dismiss the case against Trump, which, in his view, would have the effect of expunging the impeachment from Trump’s record. “I would say if it’s nonconstitutional, it’s null and void,” he said. Trump responded by posting a tweet of the interview with the statement: “Thank you Rudy!” Top White House aide Kellyanne Conway told reporters Friday that Trump’s case would be handled by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, his two deputies and Jay Sekulow, another of Trump’s personal lawyers. She was noncommittal on the possibility of any others joining the team. Giuliani, a onetime federal prosecutor, bought into the false story that Russia had not helped Trump win the 2016 election, but rather it was Ukraine framing Russia with fake evidence. Giuliani was making that story a centerpiece of his planned rebuttal to special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. Mueller found last spring that Trump’s campaign had expected and welcomed election help from Russia but did not engage in a criminal conspiracy to obtain it. The special counsel did not recommend any specific actions by Congress against Trump, and the White House never released Giuliani’s response. Giuliani nonetheless continued pushing the theory to Trump — particularly the element that former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden had somehow been involved and that an investigation into the younger Biden’s job with a Ukrainian energy company could hurt his father’s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Last spring, Trump and his top advisers believed Biden presented the most potent threat against Trump’s reelection. According to testimony by State Department and National Security Council officials during impeachment proceedings in the House, Trump responded by referring them to Giuliani when questions arose about his Ukraine policy. “Go talk to Rudy,” recalled Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who had become Trump’s point person in charge of Ukraine after the president, at Giuliani’s urging, recalled the ambassador to Ukraine back to Washington. Trump even personally referred the new Ukrainian president to Giuliani in their July 25 phone call. “I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call,” Trump said, according to a rough transcript released by the White House. “Rudy very much knows what’s happening, and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.” Trump was impeached last month for trying to coerce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into opening investigations into the Bidens and the election conspiracy theory, using $391 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine as leverage. Trump had ordered the aid withheld but released it after learning that a whistleblower had filed a formal complaint about his conduct and that it was likely to reach Congress. Trump’s upcoming trial for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress notwithstanding, he has continued to push the conspiracy theory — a theory so convoluted that conservative radio host Glenn Beck needed two chalkboards to explain it all. Former NSC staffer Fiona Hill testified during the impeachment proceedings that the conspiracy theory was actually Russian disinformation designed to obscure the country’s responsibility for helping Trump win. “This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,” she said. Trump’s own former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, called the theory baseless in an interview with ABC News. “It’s not only a conspiracy theory, it is completely debunked,” he said in September. “I don’t want to be glib about this matter, but last year, retired former Senator Judd Gregg wrote in The Hill magazine Five Ways or Three Ways to Impeach Oneself and the third way was to hire Rudy Giuliani.”",1.7352169410431921,1.8037652559182928,-0.06854831487510071,16

Naftali pointed out that the question is “at the heart of the entire impeachment issue,” in which Trump is accused of wielding the might of the U.S. to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival. Naftali was responding to a question about Trump’s possible attendance in May at Moscow’s Victory Day Parade, when Russia celebrates its military might. “If the president is going to Russia simply to help cheerlead for Vladimir Putin, who has challenged the security of Europe, who has undermined American goals in the Middle East, who has undermined U.S. goals in Latin America ... you’re not cheerleading for U.S. national security,” said Naftali.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggested in an interview Sunday that the information Rudy Giuliani claimed he gathered on Ukraine and Joe Biden may be Russian propaganda. Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, returned last month from a trip to Kyiv with what he characterized as damaging findings. He has yet to reveal any facts. “My advice to Giuliani would be to share what he got from Ukraine with the IC [intelligence community] to make sure it’s not Russia propaganda,” Graham warned in an interview with The Daily Beast. “I’m very suspicious of what the Russians are up to all over the world.” The senator noted that Giuliani has not shared any of the information with him. Earlier this month Graham invited Giuliani to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, to vet his unsupported claims that former Vice President Joe Biden helped his son Hunter get a spot on the board of a Ukraine energy company. Giuliani and Trump have also both pushed the debunked claim that it was Ukraine, not the Kremlin, that interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Graham, agreeing with the American intelligence community, has said he is “1000% confident” it was Russia — not Ukraine — that meddled in the election. Graham’s indication that Giuliani’s information could be Russian propaganda is surprising given that the senator has already launched an investigation into the Bidens. Graham has also defended Trump’s call to Ukraine pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe the Bidens — while Trump was withholding military funds. Though the call triggered Trump’s impeachment, Graham is insisting the call was not cause for impeachment. But at the same time, he has also conceded that the “Trump policy toward Ukraine ... was incoherent.” Graham isn’t the only senator trying to put daylight between himself and Giuliani ahead of the impeachment trial. The Daily Beast reports that senators are avoiding meeting with Giuliani in part because they fear he’ll peddle Kremlin conspiracy theories as fact, according to several sources. “Rudy Giuliani long ago lost any shred of credibility, especially after the dossier he assembled for the State Department stunningly mirrored Russian propaganda,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) told the Beast. Giuliani has insisted his information is not Kremlin propaganda.

The federal Southern District of New York is reportedly looking into records and information involving President Donald Trump’s personal attorney and his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. It’s quite a change for Giuliani, given that he ran the SDNY for most of the 1980s. Not surprisingly, he has harsh words for the district’s current team in an interview with New York magazine that seems to have been fueled by Bloody Marys. “If they’re investigating me, they’re assholes. They’re absolutely assholes if they’re investigating me,” he told reporter Olivia Nuzzi, who noted that saliva leaked from the corner of his mouth and then fell onto his sweater. He added: “If they think I committed a crime, they’re out of their minds. I’ve been doing this for 50 years. I know how not to commit crimes. And if they think I’ve lost my integrity, maybe they’ve lost theirs in their insanity over hating Trump with some of the things they did that I never would’ve tolerated when I was U.S. Attorney.” Parnas and Fruman were indicted in October on federal campaign finance charges, and Nuzzi asked Giuliani how he ever trusted them in the first place. “They look like Miami people. I know a lot of Miami people that look like that that are perfectly legitimate and act like them,” the former New York mayor said, adding that neither have ever been convicted of a crime. “Neither one. And generally that’s my cutoff point, because if you do it based on allegations and claims and — you’re not gonna work with anybody. Particularly in business,” he said. Giuliani also continued to smear former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who he previously said was an obstacle in his attempt to find dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, in part by claiming she was controlled by Jewish billionaire George Soros. Soros, he asserted, “put all four ambassadors there. And he’s employing the FBI agents.” When Nuzzi told Giuliani he sounded crazy, he insisted he wasn’t ― and then bizarrely claimed he was more of a Jew than Soros. “Don’t tell me I’m anti-Semitic if I oppose him,” he said. “Soros is hardly a Jew. I’m more of a Jew than Soros is. I probably know more about — he doesn’t go to church, he doesn’t go to religion — synagogue. He doesn’t belong to a synagogue, he doesn’t support Israel, he’s an enemy of Israel. He’s elected eight anarchist DA’s in the United States. He’s a horrible human being.” Giuliani also accused the media of falsely reporting he has business interests in Ukraine before telling Nuzzi about all his business interests in Ukraine. “I’ve done two business deals in Ukraine, he said. “I’ve sought four or five others,” he said. You can read the complete interview here. Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, later condemned Giuliani’s remarks, telling the Daily Beast that the former mayor “is not the arbiter of who is Jewish and who is not, or what is anti-Semitic and what is not.” “Mr. Giuliani should apologize and retract his comments immediately, unless he seeks to dog whistle to hardcore anti-Semites and white supremacists who believe this garbage,” Greenblatt said. When NBC News asked Giuliani if the remarks were made it jest, he doubled down via text: “I’m more Jewish than half my friends.” This was updated.",3.4631242587435627,3.143867593404986,0.3192566653385769,4

Congress was not to be told, according to the email from a top Office of Management and Budget official. A judge had ordered the Trump administration to provide the communications between the White House and the Pentagon to The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative journalism center. The July phone call, which has been repeatedly heralded by the U.S. president as “perfect,” was key to a whistleblower complaint that led to Trump’s impeachment last week. A partial transcript released by the White House states that the call began around 9 a.m. and lasted about 30 minutes. Less than two hours later, in an email timestamped at 11:04 a.m., OMB Associate Director for National Security Programs Michael Duffey told three top Pentagon officials to “pause” the aid’s disbursement. “Based on guidance I have received and in light of the Administration’s plan to review assistance to Ukraine, including the Ukraine Security Assistance initiative, please hold off on any DoD obligations of these funds, pending direction from that process,” Duffey wrote. “Given the sensitive nature of this request, I appreciate your keeping that information closely held to those who need to know to execute the direction. Please let me know if you have any questions,” he concluded. His message was addressed directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist along with the Department of Defense’s Elaine McCusker and Eric Chewning. It came shortly after Trump told Zelensky to “do us a favor” by looking into conspiracy theories that would benefit him politically, a move that resulted in the House of Representatives impeaching him on one article of abuse of power. The House also passed a second article of impeachment: obstruction of Congress. Duffey appeared to assure the officials that the aid would ultimately be disbursed to Ukraine, writing that “this brief pause in obligations will not preclude DoD’s timely execution of the final policy direction.” Extensive testimony from State Department officials affirmed Trump’s interest in exchanging military aid and a meeting at the White House for Zelensky publicly announcing an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Although the Trump administration has offered mixed messaging on whether this was indeed his aim, the president vigorously maintains that his conduct was not improper. Duffey noted that the White House intended to “formalize” the pause later that day. Joel Rubin, who was a deputy assistant secretary of state under former President Barack Obama, said the email “makes clear that the White House intentionally violated the law by not notifying Congress about the Ukraine aid hold.” .@dabeard This email makes clear that the White House intentionally violated the law by not notifying Congress about the Ukraine aid hold. It states that only those who “execute” the spending -ie the Pentagon- are to be made aware of the hold. Not Congress. Trump is now the third president in American history to be impeached.

Republicans argued about process. “When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers,” Rep.

They called the process a “witch hunt,” a “kangaroo court,” a “sham,” a “complete charade,” and a “total joke.” One likened it to Pearl Harbor. At one point, Republicans stood on the House floor in a solemn moment of silence to honor the 63 million Americans who voted for Trump. As Democrats pointed out repeatedly, Republicans didn’t spend much time disputing the facts. Instead, the primary focus for GOP members Wednesday was that Democrats hadn’t provided “due process” to Trump. Republicans started the day by forcing procedural votes, complaining that Democratic committee chairs had violated obscure committee procedures during the impeachment inquiry by not giving the minority the power to call their own witnesses. (In fact, Democrats allowed Republicans to suggest witnesses, and a number of them testified.) They complained about which committees Democrats used to conduct the inquiry. “Never in the history of the United States have we had impeachment that’s gone through the Intelligence Committee,” Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Wis.) said. They complained that the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees used the spacious Ways and Means Committee room. “They couldn’t even meet while you were doing all of this,” Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) said, even though Ways and Means actually did have hearings during the impeachment inquiry. And they complained that Democrats are just huge partisans. “This vote, this day has nothing to do with Ukraine,” Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) said. “This vote, this day is about one thing and one thing only: They hate this president.” Republicans complained time and again Wednesday that Trump hadn’t received “due process” during impeachment, even though impeachment is not a criminal proceeding. And they made the case, repeatedly, that Democrats have sought to impeach Trump since even before he took office. When Republicans did defend the president ― Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) claimed that the Democrats’ “allies in the media” liked to claim that Republicans only focus on process when “we continue to talk about substance as well” ― they did so with half-truths and outright lies. “This vote, this day is about one thing and one thing only: they hate this president.” Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) claimed the president’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was just to say congratulations. On that call, President Trump told Zelensky “the United States has been very very good to Ukraine” and that he wanted a “favor.” He asked Zelensky for investigations into Joe Biden, his top 2020 election opponent, and supposed Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Those requests launched the impeachment inquiry because they show the president using the power of his office to benefit his reelection campaign. And Trump withheld $391 million of congressionally appropriated security aid to further pressure Ukraine into opening an investigation. But Burgess insisted the president’s request for a favor was totally innocent. “A request for investigation as to how American foreign aid will be spent does not, does not equal soliciting election interference,” he said. President Trump himself, speaking on the White House lawn on Oct. 3, has made it clear what he wanted from the Ukrainians: “I would think that, if they were honest about it, they’d start a major investigation into the Bidens. It’s a very simple answer.” Many Republicans also claimed that Trump just wanted to root out corruption in a country that benefits from U.S. foreign aid, implying it’s just a coincidence that Biden was involved in the supposed corruption. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) opted for a more brazenly untrue take: “Joe Biden was not the opponent of Donald Trump,” he said, pointing out that Biden is part of a crowded Democratic primary. (The former vice president has topped the field since at least April.) Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) claimed that because Trump used a plural pronoun when he requested the favor from Zelensky, the favor was for all of America, not for him.“‘I want you to do us a favor.’ Not me a favor, us a favor,” Sensenbrenner said. “And there he was referring to our country, the United States of America, not a personal political gain.” Several diplomats testified under oath last month that pressing for an investigation into Biden was not in the U.S. national interest. The most substantive defense of Trump came from Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), who repeatedly pointed out that the aid that had been withheld was actually released. It’s not the strongest point, since the White House released the assistance only after a whistleblower complained that it had been withheld for improper reasons. “Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this President and this process.” For the most part, the defense of the president came in short statements such as “no quid pro quo” and simple assertions that the president didn’t commit any crimes. Mostly, it was about the process. “This was a political crusade in order to arrive at their predetermined conclusion,” Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.) said. “House Democrats spent the last several months staging well-rehearsed hearings where the charges were drawn up by their own focus groups.” “Not only is the process alarming, but it’s wasting taxpayers’ dollars and valuable time that elected officials could be using to move our country forward,” Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) said. “They are trying to reach their predetermined political outcome and along the way they have steamrolled over a constitutionally guaranteed due process and the federal rules of civil procedure,” Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) said. Before the floor debate, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) told HuffPost that though the Constitution doesn’t give the president due process rights in an impeachment inquiry, it doesn’t not give the president rights, either. Conaway said it was about fairness, and that Democrats had “not given the president due process that the common criminal would have gotten under any other circumstance.” A key difference between impeachment and a criminal trial, however, is that the president is not facing any loss of liberty if the Senate convicts him. He just couldn’t be president anymore.",2.0871462851042404,2.12514898824404,-0.03800270313979981,16

Both a current and a former U.S. official confirmed the news with the outlet. Taylor, who was serving as acting ambassador and was never officially nominated, is planning to depart from Kyiv on Jan. 2, one said. Taylor has been in the spotlight in recent weeks after he testified to House lawmakers in October that President Donald Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine until it agreed to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden ― the issue at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Taylor publicly testified before the House the following month. His appearance infuriated Trump, who bashed him as “Never Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor (who I don’t know).” The impeachment is expected to come up for a full House vote on Wednesday, following the Judiciary Committee’s approval of two articles of impeachment accusing the president of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Taylor’s departure is expected to come around the same time as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit to Ukraine. “Pompeo is not going to want to be in a photo with Taylor,” a congressional aide told NBC News.

Rudy Giuliani in recent days has been on a public relations tear, conducting print and television interviews essentially confirming a key charge in the impeachment articles against his client. “I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way,” he told The New Yorker magazine in an interview published Monday about his work to replace the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. “She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.” Monday night, he told The New York Times: “I mean, did I think she should be recalled? I thought she should have been fired.” Also Monday night, Giuliani in an appearance on Fox News said: “I forced her out because she’s corrupt ... there’s no question that she was acting corruptly in that position, and had to be removed. She should have been fired, if the State Department weren’t part of the Deep State.” Trump is charged in his impeachment articles of abusing his office to coerce Ukraine into announcing investigations valuable to his own re-election campaign: one into the Democrat Trump most feared, former Vice President Joe Biden; and the other into a debunked conspiracy theory that Russia had not helped him win the 2016 election, but that Ukraine had planted fake evidence to frame Russia. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, was abruptly recalled back to Washington this spring as part of Trump and Giuliani’s efforts to find damaging information on Biden. She wound up testifying in House impeachment hearings last month. White House officials have little explanation about how Giuliani fits into the overall defense of Trump as his impeachment moves to the Senate. The White House refused to participate in the Judiciary Committee proceedings but is planning to send its top lawyer, Pat Cipollone, to represent Trump in the Senate trial. “Rudy Giuliani is the president’s personal attorney. You’ll have to ask Rudy,” spokesman Hogan Gidley said. Giuliani, who has direct cell phone access to Trump and who claims to have been working for him without pay since the spring of 2018, told HuffPost Tuesday he is not trying to influence the Senate proceedings. He said he has no preference about whether Majority Leader Mitch McConnell chooses to go with a quick trial that has no live witnesses or a longer trial with witnesses. “I don’t care if they do short or long,” Giuliani said, adding that he does not think he would be sharing the information he says he learned from his latest Ukraine trip in the course of the trial. “A Senate hearing might be a better way to proceed.” Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman now running against Trump for the 2020 GOP nomination, said Giuliani’s willingness to stir the pot even in the middle of the impeachment proceedings is not surprising. “It’s the Trump modus operandi: ‘Never back down, never say you’re wrong, never show weakness. In fact, go on TV and lie. In fact, double and triple down. In fact, commit your crimes right out in public,’” he said. “Then the opposition will get tired and back down.” But Jason Miller, a spokesman for the 2016 Trump campaign who now appears on the pro-Trump radio show “War Room” each morning, defended Giuliani’s efforts. “Mayor Giuliani has been crucial in getting to the bottom of Ukrainian corruption issues that have been rampant for years, and most important, getting to the bottom of the bogus allegations against his client that sparked the entire two-year Russia hoax,” he said. Trump’s Republican defenders have argued, variously, that Trump never asked for an investigation into the Bidens; that he did, but he was within his rights; that there was never a “quid pro quo”; that there may have been a quid pro quo, but it was legal and appropriate; or that since Ukraine wound up getting the withheld military aid, none of it matters. Trump used some form of several of those arguments himself in a rambling, six-page diatribe against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Tuesday. “You are turning a policy disagreement between two branches of government into an impeachable offense,” he wrote in a relatively coherent paragraph of a letter that included lines like: “It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I!” Democrats in the House Intelligence Committee, though, took testimony from a number of State Department and National Security Council officials who said that Trump was pressuring newly elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to announce the investigations and was using $391 million in military assistance to counter Russian aggression and a potential White House visit as leverage. The military aid was released after the White House learned a whistleblower had filed a complaint based on Trump’s July 25 phone conversation with Zelensky. There has not yet been a White House meeting scheduled. Pelosi has set debate and a vote on the two articles of impeachment for Wednesday, where they are almost certain to pass. A Senate trial on them could start as early as the first full week of January.",1.7769229084629667,2.070815239234212,-0.2938923307712453,16

The Tuesday bail hearing was scheduled because prosecutors with the U.S. Southern District of New York want to have Parnas redetained without bail after accusing him earlier this month of misleading his pretrial services officer by failing to disclose a $1 million payment he and his wife received from a Russian bank account in September. Parnas’ lawyer Joseph Bondy has disputed those claims, filing a response to prosecutors Monday saying his client is not a flight risk and that he did not mislead his pretrial services officer. Bondy says the money was sent to Parnas’ wife Svetlana’s bank account as a loan, and therefore is considered part of her assets. Prosecutors were skeptical of that claim. “It is an unsecured, undocumented loan to a housewife. That makes no sense, your honor,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebekah Donaleski said, according to CNN. Judge J. Paul Oetken said Tuesday that the information Parnas provided about his assets and income “might have violated the spirit” of the disclosure requirements, but that “I don’t know that it rises to the level of intentional misstatements warranting the revocation of bail,” according to CNN. Judge Oetken has declined to revoke Parnas's bail, saying the info he provided about his assets/income ""might have violated the spirit"" of the disclosure requirements, ""but I don't know that it rises to the level of intentional misstatements warranting the revocation of bail."" At the bail hearing, both Bondy and the prosecutors said the $1 million payment from Swiss national Ralph Oswald Isenegger, a lawyer representing Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, according to CNN. Firtash is currently fighting extradition to the United States while facing bribery charges. Parnas’ lawyer told the judge that Parnas has severed his connection with Firtash after offering to cooperate with his congressional subpoena in relation to the impeachment investigation, according to Politico. “He has burned that bridge, to the extent there was ever a bridge,” Bondy said, according to Politico. The payment to Parnas came a month before he was charged with conspiring to funnel foreign money into Republican campaigns in the U.S. Parnas was indicted in October with his associate Igor Fruman on campaign finance charges related to using an unnamed Russian national as a source of funds for political donations, which were meant to win support from state and federal officials for a retail marijuana business. Those charges in part stemmed from Parnas and Fruman working with Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, to start a smear campaign about Marie Yovanovitch, who was eventually ousted as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in response to the smear campaign. Prosecutors initially asked for Parnas’ bail to be revoked after the businessman requested his house arrest be loosened. Oetken also rejected that request Tuesday, meaning Parnas must continue to stay in his home in Florida.",3.4472079521920165,4.90733999205303,-1.4601320398610138,4

PolitiFact, a nonprofit U.S. political fact-checking site, announced Monday that the award for 2019 goes to Trump’s claim that the anonymous whistleblower reported his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky “almost completely wrong.” Trump’s conduct and requests on that call are now at the heart of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Since the Sept. 26 release of the whistleblower complaint, the president has claimed more than 80 times that the complaint is “fake, fraudulent, incorrect, ‘total fiction,’ ‘made up,’ and ‘sooo wrong,’” PolitiFact reported. Despite the president’s repeated insistence that the report was filled with lies, the anonymous whistleblower actually got the call “almost completely” right, the fact-checking site’s managing editor, Katie Sanders, wrote. “We know this from the very record of the call the president released. We know this from testimony under oath from career diplomats and other officials. And the president and his allies have told reporters that Trump did what the whistleblower suggested — urged the Ukrainian president to investigate political rival Joe Biden.” In a video announcement featuring the site’s executive director, Aaron Sharockman, and Sanders, Sharockman explained that each December they selected the “most significant falsehood of the calendar year.” “This is something that... makes you angry, it’s kind of ridiculous, it threatens democracy, it’s something so significant that we want to reflect on it and hopefully avoid it in the future,” he said. “Lie of the Year” is the only time the site will use the word “lie.” The distinction with the claim that receives the award is that it proves to be of genuine consequence and undermines an accurate narrative, Sanders explained. The president’s lies have claimed the No. 1 spot twice before ― once in 2015 for his collective campaign trail falsehoods, which the site described as exhibiting “range, boldness and a disregard for the truth,” and once in 2017 for claiming Russian election interference is a “made-up story.” Trump is the only person to have ever won the award more than once, according to the site. Previous lie-perpetrators included then-President Barack Obama in 2013, presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012 and Democrats in 2011.",3.097292768063707,3.1069413490890523,-0.009648581025345493,12

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has invited President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee about his recent trip to Ukraine. “Rudy, if you want to come and tell us what you found, I’d be glad to talk to you,” Graham said in an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation,” which is set to air Sunday. Giuliani flew to Kyiv and Budapest, Hungary, earlier this month to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. “I don’t know what Rudy found,” Graham added. “I don’t know what he was up to when he was in the Ukraine.” The president publicly encouraged Giuliani to brief the Justice Department and Congress on his supposed findings, and the former New York City mayor indicated earlier this week that he would be willing to do so. Trump has seized upon the unproven idea that the Bidens meddled with Ukrainian corruption investigations, something he seems to believe would damage Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. But Trump’s attempts to leverage a White House meeting and freeze military aid to Ukraine in exchange for the country investigating the Bidens became the basis of the House’s impeachment inquiry, now in its third month. The House Judiciary Committee voted Friday to approve two articles of impeachment in a party-line vote, 23-17. The articles are expected to be sent for a full floor vote next week. If approved, the Republican-controlled Senate will hold a trial for Trump, which is highly unlikely to result in his removal from office. Graham himself has already expressly stated that he is “not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here” and wants to see the trial “die quickly.”",1.7483855267067996,1.6981877740443376,0.05019775266246196,16

Christopher Cooper, U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Columbia, said the department arbitrarily limited its search for documents it had previously been ordered to release to the period before Aug. 2 — prior to President Donald Trump lifting his freeze on military funds to Ukraine as he pressured the country’s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Cooper ruled that the department had “not adequately justified” why it used the early date, and said its records through Oct. 18 should be released no later than Jan. 8. Among the documents that were withheld were communication records concerning Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. NEW: A federal court just ordered the State Dept. to search for and release additional Ukraine-related records to us by January 8. State had previously failed to search for documents dated after Aug. 2, 2019. The court says searches must cover up through Oct. 18, 2019.  Nonpartisan watchdog American Oversight, which brought the suit, celebrated the ruling. “Despite the Trump administration’s obstruction of Congress, the paper trail of the Ukraine pressure campaign is continuing to come to light,” Clark Pettig, a spokesman for the group, said in a statement to HuffPost. “The time period covered by Friday’s court order includes some of the most critical events under scrutiny in the impeachment investigation, including the creation and release of the whistleblower report, and the eventual lifting of the freeze on aid to Ukraine,” he said. To battle a similar stonewalling case, the Center for Public Integrity went back to court Friday. It demanded that an earlier order for the Defense Department and Office of Management and Budget to release records concerning Ukraine be enforced. Released documents were so heavily redacted that they were nearly impossible to read. “Defendants’ production makes a mockery” of the court’s order, as well as the Freedom of Information Act and the “American public’s right to be informed of what their government officials are doing and why they are doing it,” the organization argued.

Schiff made the request to declassify the call shortly after Jennifer Williams, a national security aide to Pence, submitted new classified evidence to House impeachment investigators about Pence’s call with Zelensky. Williams handed over the material after she publicly testified last month about Pence’s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, telling lawmakers that details about what was said were classified. Her Nov. 26 supplemental filing contained classified information about the call. Schiff responded by asking the vice president’s office to declassify the call, saying there is “no legitimate basis” for it to remain secret. Pence, playing along with Trump’s stonewalling in House impeachment proceedings, has refused to hand over any information. Witnesses testified he was at the center of Trump’s scheme to pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation into 2020 Democrat Joe Biden. Morgan, in his letter to Schiff, decried that classified information was shared with the Intelligence Committee. He dismissed any suggestion that Pence, in his call with Zelensky, discussed Biden, the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, or the American cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the Democratic National Committee after a 2016 hacking that intelligence agencies blamed on Russia. “While the contents of a classified call with a foreign head of state should never have been discussed in an unclassified Committee hearing or an unclassified deposition, it is clear from public testimony that the Vice President never raised the Bidens, Burisma, or Crowdstrike in his conversation with President Zelensky,” Morgan said. Articles of impeachment against Trump accuse him of trying to coerce Ukraine into helping him in the 2020 presidential election and of obstructing the congressional inquiry. A rough transcript of Trump’s own call with Zelensky in April shows that he requested the Ukrainian president’s help with a corruption probe of Biden and Biden’s son Hunter based on unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.",1.979726760119897,1.6079784556072425,0.3717483045126544,16

Mark Paoletta said in the memo that OMB had temporarily delayed the funds as part of a routine and lawful process to ensure the spending was in line with U.S. policy and that it was not a politically motivated move aimed at stymying congressional spending decisions. “For decades, OMB has routinely used its apportionment authority to prevent funds from being used,” Paoletta wrote, according to the Post. “Often, in managing appropriations, OMB must briefly pause an agency’s legal ability to spend those funds for a number of reasons, including to ensure that the funds are being spent efficiently, that they are being spent in accordance with statutory directives, or to assess how or whether funds should be used for a particular activity.” The memo, which was also obtained by the Washington Examiner, was reportedly written in response to a request from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which had sought answers as to why the aid had been withheld. Paoletta’s memo said OMB had delayed the aid package “pending a policy decision” from the Trump administration. The agency took “appropriate action,” he asserted, “to ensure that funds were not obligated prematurely in a manner that could conflict with the President’s foreign policy,” the Examiner reported. Key point: memo claims only that OMB acted legally. No defense of Trump conduct. “Importantly, the agency’s memo does not attempt to rebut Democrats’ contention that Trump abused his power by seeking to pressure a foreign nation to open an investigation into a political rival.” OMB’s decision to withhold the aid package to Ukraine has been a central part of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. The agency has been accused by House Democrats of a “pattern of abuse” in delaying the aid. Last month, an internal White House review reportedly uncovered a slew of email exchanges between Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and OMB officials ― sent after the funds to Ukraine were already frozen ― in which Mulvaney sought to find out whether there was legal justification for withholding the aid. Also last month, Mark Sandy, a career OMB employee, testified to the House Intelligence Committee that two officials at the agency resigned after expressing concerns over the aid freeze. OMB has said the officials left for other reasons. House Democrats on Tuesday unveiled two articles of impeachment against Trump, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over his dealings with Ukraine.

Prosecutors for the U.S. Southern District of New York asked a federal judge to detain Parnas without bail, arguing that he lied to the government about his income and assets and could potentially flee the country. “Parnas failed to disclose, in describing his income to the Government and Pretrial Services, the fact that in September 2019, he received $1 million from a bank account in Russia into Account-1,” prosecutors wrote in its court filing. “While the majority of that money appears to have been used on personal expenses and to purchase a home, as discussed below, some portion of that money existed in Account-1 at the time Parnas submitted his financial affidavit.” The court filing gave little detail about the purpose of the payment to Parnas, though prosecutors said the money was sent to an account under the name of Svetlana Parnas, the Florida businessman’s wife. The account appeared to be “an attempt to ensure that any assets were held in Svetlana’s, rather than Lev’s, name,” prosecutors said. The request came after Parnas, who was born in what is now Ukraine and who has worked with Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, filed a motion earlier this month asking for his bail to be modified so that he could spend some time outside each day while he’s under house arrest. “Parnas’s considerable ties abroad, seemingly limitless access to foreign funds, lack of candor with Pretrial Services about his assets, nature and circumstances of the offense, and powerful incentives to flee show that Parnas is a significant flight risk,” prosecutors wrote. Joseph Bondy, an attorney representing Parnas, did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Giuliani told HuffPost on Wednesday that he was unaware of Parnas allegedly receiving $1 million from Russia in September. Asked who exactly was paying Parnas and for what, Giuliani replied: “I don’t know.” Parnas was indicted in October with his associate Igor Fruman on campaign finance charges related to using an unnamed Russian national as their source of funds for political donations to win over state and federal officials for support in beginning a retail marijuana business. The two were arrested at Dulles International Airport in Virginia while trying to board a plane with one-way tickets to Vienna, Austria. Bondy subsequently said his client would comply with the House’s impeachment investigation and provide any documents they want. It’s unclear whether the same Russian national Parnas and Fruman used in their straw donations was the source of the $1 million payment to Parnas. The two also helped Giuliani connect with Ukrainian officials including Yuriy Lutsenko, who pushed the unsubstantiated corruption allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden, a Trump presidential rival, and Biden’s son Hunter. Those allegations, which Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate, are at the center of the impeachment investigation. Parnas and Fruman also helped with ousting Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine earlier this year. Bondy has repeatedly asked prosecutors to hand over documents they seized so that Parnas could provide them to the U.S. House for its impeachment investigation into Trump. According to the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment report, call records revealed that Parnas communicated with the committee’s ranking member, Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), which Bondy has publicly said his client remembers. Parnas could face at least five years in prison on the counts with which he’s already been charged, though prosecutors said he is still under investigation and will likely face more charges. That would make it difficult for Parnas to participate in the impeachment investigation, though he’s likely no longer necessary now that Democrats have already drafted articles of impeachment and plan to vote on them within the next week.

The articles of impeachment relate to two actions by Trump: One is abuse of power linked to his demand that the Ukrainian president investigate a political rival, and the second is obstructing Congress in its effort to investigate the behavior. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), flanked by House Democratic leadership, announced the articles during a news conference on Capitol Hill. “The president holds the ultimate public trust,” Nadler said. “When he betrays that trust and puts himself before country, he endangers the Constitution, he endangers our democracy, and he endangers our national security.” House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler: ""The House Committee on the Judiciary is introducing two articles of impeachment charging the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, with committing high crimes and misdemeanors.""  Democrats signaled on Monday that the chamber’s investigations were coming to a close after current and former administration officials testified about Trump’s behavior during a whirlwind month of House impeachment hearings. In a series of bombshell revelations, the aides detailed an effort by Trump and his aides to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into a prime Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden’s son, Hunter. Democrats cast the demand as a clear quid pro quo in which Trump would release nearly $400 million in security aid and arrange a coveted visit to the White House for the newly elected Ukrainian leader. Republicans, however, have largely remained steadfast behind the president, accusing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her leadership team of attempting to overturn the 2016 election and unfairly attacking the president. The GOP has admitted that Trump made the demand of Ukraine, but said there is no evidence that it amounted to a quid pro quo. The House Judiciary Committee, tasked with drafting the articles against Trump, laid out its case against the president during a marathon day of hearings on Monday that saw several dramatic clashes with Republican lawmakers. Trump’s “pattern of misconduct undermines our national security and our free and fair elections,” Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in his closing remarks Monday, calling the president’s conduct “clearly impeachable.” Nadler added: “In abusing his office in this manner, and in obstructing the investigation that followed, we know that President Trump has put himself before his country.” If Trump is impeached, the Senate — currently controlled by Republicans in a 53-47 majority — would hold a trial that’s likely to begin early next year. A two-thirds majority vote is required to remove a president, meaning about 20 GOP lawmakers would need to join all Democratic senators in voting to remove Trump. The Judiciary Committee will meet to consider the articles this week, Nadler said Tuesday, establishing a timeline that could see the full House debate and vote on impeachment by next week. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said during Tuesday’s news conference that the evidence against Trump is “overwhelming” and “uncontested.” “The president’s oath of office appears to mean very little to him,” Schiff said, “but the articles we put forward today will give us a chance to show that we will defend the Constitution and that our oath means something to us.” Trump raged against Democrats on Twitter following the announcement, calling Schiff “totally corrupt” and denying again that he did anything wrong. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed the articles as “baseless.” “It hurts the American people” Grisham said in a statement. “The President will address these false charges in the Senate and expects to be fully exonerated, because he did nothing wrong.” This story has been updated to include comments from the White House.",2.0198935141046146,2.6933068733634298,-0.6734133592588152,16

Whoever wins gets to set that foreign policy.” Foreign policy should not be decided by ""technocrats who are not accountable to voters,"" Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney says at #WSJCEOCouncil. ""Politics can and should influence foreign policy.""  Only that’s not the extent of what was conveyed during Mulvaney’s October briefing. While addressing reporters, he said that American military aid to Ukraine was held up over the summer because Trump was concerned about whether it would be properly spent, and “corruption that related to the [Democratic National Committee] server.” The latter point references a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine perpetrated the 2016 hacking of Democratic Party emails. The U.S. intelligence community has made clear that it believes Russia was responsible. When ABC News’ Jonathan Karl noted that he had described a quid pro quo, Mulvaney said, “We do that all the time with foreign policy.” “Get over it,” he added. “There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy. ... That is going to happen. Elections have consequences.” Mulvaney walked back the remarks in a subsequent statement, asserting, “There was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.” The matter has become the focal point of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry of Trump, which was spurred by a whistleblower complaint about his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript of the discussion shows Trump pressed Zelensky repeatedly to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son based on unsubstantiated corruption allegations while the nearly $400 million in funds was being temporarily withheld. On Tuesday, Judiciary Committee chair Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) announced articles of impeachment against Trump for abuse of power in soliciting a probe of his political rival, and for obstructing Congress’ investigation of the matter.",1.478128369964228,2.1929788128727705,-0.7148504429085425,16
2019-12-10,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-worse-nixon_n_5df0033ae4b0a59848d1d58e,Trump May Be ‘So Much Worse’ Than Nixon But Republicans Don’t Seem To Care,"BEDFORD, N.H. — Richard Nixon used tens of thousands of his campaign dollars to finance a burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in order to cheat in his 1972 presidential reelection. Forty-seven years later, Donald Trump, according to witness testimony in congressional hearings, used hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to coerce a foreign government in order to cheat in his 2020 reelection. Yet while Nixon wound up resigning after his fellow Republicans in the Senate told him they would vote to remove him from office, Trump today appears likely to survive a Senate trial, even as the House prepares to debate two articles of impeachment later this week. “Americans are guided in many ways by their leadership,” said Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. “There was significant bipartisan agreement that President Nixon had breached the threshold regarding abuse of power and thus was impeachable. Either today’s values have evolved, partisanship has hit a new high or the caliber of our GOP representation has diminished. Take your pick.” Reflecting — or perhaps driving — that difference across the decades: 31% of Republicans wound up abandoning Nixon and saying he should be removed from office, while only 7% of Republicans today believe that about Trump. At Trump’s rally in Minneapolis in October, construction contractor Jason Munson said he had no interest in any facts that did not come from Trump personally, and that Trump’s election was divine intervention. “It was the hand of God,” he said. At the Iowa Republican Party’s annual fundraising dinner in Des Moines last month, oral historian Kristine Bartley said Democrats should defeat Trump in the election next year rather than impeaching him, regardless of what he did with Ukraine. “Unless the president is running around with a gun shooting people, just let it go,” she said. And at a “Countdown to Victory Reception and Christmas Party” for New Hampshire Republicans at a restaurant in Bedford last week, Plymouth town selectman John Randlett said all politicians try to cheat and that it was pretty much impossible to know what really happened, even with Nixon. “Are you ever going to find out the true facts? No,” he said, adding that he was sticking with Trump. “As he says, it’s a witch hunt.” Republican pollster Neil Newhouse said there is not much in common between American politics today versus five decades ago. “It has little to do with the perceived seriousness of the crime, though I would argue that the break-in and cover-up was far more egregious than the current charges,” Newhouse said, adding: “1974 was a different, less partisan time. Today’s polarization is unprecedented.” Both Democrats and Republicans agree that a dramatically changed media landscape is a major cause of the difference. In 1974, all three broadcast television networks carried the impeachment hearings live — meaning that there was literally nothing else on TV during those hours. Today, not only do hardcore Republicans have news outlets that cater to their preferences, but there are hundreds of other cable channels and an internet that provide politics-free content for those who prefer that. Anthony Scaramucci, Trump’s short-lived White House communications director in 2017 who has now become a Trump critic, has a two-word answer for what’s different: “Fox News.” According to witness testimony as well as the rough transcript of Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s president, Trump demanded that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden as well as support a conspiracy theory which falsely claims that Russian intelligence agencies did not help Trump win the 2016 election, but rather it was Ukrainian officials who framed Russia by using fake evidence. He made $391 million in military aid contingent on Ukraine publicly announcing the probes but then backed down after the White House learned that the whistleblower’s complaint on the matter was about to reach Congress. “Trump has something Nixon didn’t have: Fox News. Conservative media. That’s the difference.” But pro-Trump media have largely been echoing Trump’s claims that he did nothing wrong in demanding investigations, or that if it was wrong, it was nevertheless not impeachable. Joe Walsh, the former Republican congressman running against Trump for the 2020 nomination, said he has had trouble getting coverage from pro-Trump news outlets because of his unsparing criticisms of the president. “It is a far worse abuse of power,” he said of Trump’s attempt to coerce Ukraine. “But Trump has something Nixon didn’t have: Fox News. Conservative media. That’s the difference.” GOP base voters are, indeed, getting a “diet of commentary” that supports Trump’s contention that he did nothing wrong, said Rory Cooper, a Republican consultant and onetime top aide to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. But he added that equally important is the extinction of moderate Republicans. “Centrist or New England Republicans that turned on Nixon don’t exist in today’s Congress. The longer this remains viewed as a partisan exercise, the longer the numbers will remain stagnant, which is to say it’s unlikely for them to move much more absent a significant development.” Another key difference between 1974 and now is how the scandals played out. Nixon spent well over a year denying that he had any knowledge of the break-in or cover-up as his approval numbers slowly deteriorated. Then, after the Supreme Court ordered the release of audio tapes that proved Nixon had been lying, his support collapsed to the point that senior Republican senators told him that he would be removed from office following an impeachment trial. In Trump’s case, within weeks of House Democrats revealing that a whistleblower had filed a complaint about his dealings with Ukraine, Trump himself ordered the release of the July 25 call memo, which showed him asking for “a favor” of investigations in response to the Ukrainian president’s mention of military aid. Days later, Trump told reporters that Volodymyr Zelensky should “start a major investigation into the Bidens,” and moments later added that China should investigate them, too. The effect of getting such damning evidence out in the open right at the outset may have been to make every subsequent piece of corroborating proof that came out seem small in comparison, and the hearings themselves anti-climactic. “My gut tells me that the smoking gun tape in this has already come out,” said Steve Duprey, a Republican National Committee member from New Hampshire who was also attending the Bedford Christmas Party. “The average American who’s shoveling snow in New Hampshire is not paying attention to this.” One former senior RNC member said Trump’s impeachment is not getting as much support as Nixon’s because voters understood they would get someone liable to say and do irresponsible things when they voted for him — similar to the way Americans did not support Republicans’ impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998. “People knew that Clinton was a sex fiend, and voted for him anyway,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “From the point of view of Trump voters, they knew when they voted for him that he was pretty outrageous and disruptive. Rude, crude and unattractive.” Not everyone, of course, downplays Trump’s actions. “What the president did was so much worse than even what Richard Nixon did,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CBS last month. Indeed, Pelosi’s Sept. 24 announcement that the House would move forward with an impeachment inquiry — after months of warning her newly won majority against impeachment — saw dozens of skeptical House Democrats switch to supporting impeachment as well as a shift in public opinion generally. While Americans had previously opposed impeaching Trump by an 11-point margin, that has swung to a 4-point margin in support. That movement, though, has since stalled, and may have even moved slightly in the opposite direction as Republicans argue that with the election coming up in 11 months, impeachment is not appropriate. Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee that conducted the initial impeachment hearings, nevertheless said that Democrats have no choice but to impeach Trump, because failing to impeach him would encourage him to continue trying to improperly use his position to help his re-election campaign. “The argument, ‘Why don’t you just wait,’ amounts to this,” Schiff said. “’Why don’t you just let him cheat in one more election? Why not let him cheat just one more time? Why not let him have foreign help just one more time?’”",1.9038388125959609,2.948755418359115,-1.0449166057631543,11

President Donald Trump has frequently attacked Page, accusing her of treason for her work with the FBI investigating Russian interference in the presidential election. Page fired back Monday: “The sum total of findings by IG [Michael] Horowitz that my personal opinions had any bearing on the course of either the Clinton or Russia investigations? Zero and Zero.” For those following along:After two IG investigations;At least a dozen IG lawyers and investigators poring over every text, email, and note I ever wrote;1000 pages of investigative findings;And the President repeatedly accusing me of bias and treason; /1 The sum total of findings by IG Horowitz that my personal opinions had any bearing on the course of either the Clinton or Russia investigations? Zero and Zero.Cool, cool. /end The president relentlessly attacked Page and her onetime romantic partner Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who has been fired, after disparaging texts they wrote to each other about Trump surfaced (the two also criticized Democrats in texts). Trump had characterized the criticism as a sign of an illegal and biased vendetta against him by an imagined “deep state” of organized government workers, including in the FBI. Horowitz’s report identified procedural failures by the FBI but found no evidence that the bureau was motivated by political bias in opening the “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. The report noted there were “statements of hostility toward then-candidate Trump” in 2016 by Page and Strzok. But it determined that Page “did not play a role in a decision to open” the FBI investigations. Nor was Strzok the “sole, or even the highest-level decision maker” in initiating the process. The @JusticeOIG weighs in on Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.  Page spoke out publicly for the first time about Trump’s attacks on her and Strzok early this month after what she characterized as the president’s “reprehensible” performance at a campaign rally in October of an imagined “orgasm” between the former lovers. She told the Daily Beast that repeated attacks by the president are “like being punched in the gut.” The “president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world.

WADA’s executive committee took the decision after it concluded that Moscow had tampered with laboratory data by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats. The WADA committee’s decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous, the spokesman said. Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals since a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics. Its doping woes have grown since, with many of its athletes sidelined from the past two Olympics and the country stripped of its flag altogether at last year’s Pyeongchang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping cover-ups at the 2014 Sochi Games. Monday’s sanctions had been recommended by WADA’s compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year. One of the conditions for the reinstatement of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data. The sanctions effectively strip the agency of its accreditation. Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory data to technical issues. The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem for four years, as was the case during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics. Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country. If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA’s executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said.

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a staunch defender of President Donald Trump, broke from GOP allies of the president on Sunday to admit that he found it strange that Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was in Ukraine again. “It’s weird that he’s over there,” the Florida lawmaker said on ABC News’ “This Week.” “I am grateful that very soon after I made those comments on CNN, the president put out a statement that said that Rudy Giuliani does want to come into Congress and explain his role, explain what he’s been up to,” Gaetz added. “I believe that the president urging Mayor Giuliani to provide that clarity to the Congress will be helpful in resolving what seems to be odd having him over there at this time.” On Saturday, Trump told reporters that he believed Giuliani would report on his findings to Congress and to Attorney General William Barr. “He says he has a lot of good information,” Trump said. “I have not spoken to him about that information.” The comments came as the House Judiciary Committee worked to draft articles of impeachment against the president that could come to a vote as early as this week. Giuliani, who multiple witnesses placed at the center of events leading to the impeachment inquiry, traveled to Budapest and Kiev last week to meet with several former Ukrainian prosecutors. He is also reportedly under federal investigation due to his overseas dealings, which has raised questions about his choice to travel to Ukraine. “Like a good lawyer, I am gathering evidence to defend my client against the false charges being leveled against him,” Giuliani told The New York Times. Gaetz distanced himself from Giuliani on Thursday during an interview on CNN’s “Chris Cuomo Tonight.” Gaetz said he found it “weird” that Giuliani was in Ukraine, but said Giuliani deserved to get the “benefit of the doubt.” “I think it probably would be helpful if Rudy clarified the role that he was playing in these different circumstances,” Gaetz added. Giuliani has continued to claim that he possesses information which proves former Vice President Joe Biden contributed to corruption in Ukraine during the Obama presidency, which he says he will be releasing “very soon.”",2.7062738968317297,2.6135561453134706,0.09271775151825912,16

I found out he was on the board after he was on the board, and that was it.” HuffPost has reached out to the Biden campaign for clarification on the remarks. The former vice president, a frontrunner in the 2020 race for the Democratic nomination, has been forced to go on defense for months, after a whistleblower revealed that President Donald Trump had pressured the newly elected Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens in July while peddling unfounded theories about the younger Biden’s work for the company, which paid him as much as $50,000 a month. Trump’s demand for a political favor is the focus of the ongoing impeachment inquiry. There’s no evidence of any wrongdoing by either Biden. The former vice president was tasked with overseeing an anti-corruption initiative in Ukraine while serving under President Barack Obama. Hunter Biden has defended his work amid the scrutiny, saying in an interview in October that he did nothing “improper,” while admitting that it may have been “poor judgement” to sign up for the job. Axios asked how Biden would address questions about his son’s work as the 2020 race heats up, noting that even though he hadn’t been accused of impropriety, “the average Joe hears that and says that sounds fishy.” Axios: You’ve had a lot of time, isn’t this something you want to get to the bottom of? Biden: No, because I trust my son. Axios: When you’re vice president, isn’t there a higher standard? Don’t you need to know what’s happening with your family? Don’t you need to put down some guardrails? Biden: No, unless there was something on its face that was wrong. There’s nothing on its face that was wrong. … You know there’s not one single bit of evidence, not one little tiny bit, to say anything done was wrong, you know that. But you keep asking me these questions. Biden has grown increasingly frustrated over questions about his son’s involvements in Ukraine in recent days. During an event in Iowa earlier this week, the former vice president snapped at a voter — and challenged him to a push-up contest — after the man hinted that Biden had helped set his son up with the board position. “You’re a damn liar,” Biden told the man, whose comments echoed debunked conspiracy theories. “That’s not true.” Biden also clarified Sunday that should he be elected to the White House next year, no members of his family would undertake foreign business while he served as president, drawing a contrast with the Trump family’s ongoing work overseas. “They will not be engaged in any foreign business because of what’s happened in this administration,” Biden said. “No one’s going to be seeking patents. … No one’s going to be engaged in that kind of thing.”",2.3554017476392533,2.2145748404069945,0.14082690723225877,16

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Sunday became the latest Republican to claim Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election ― a theory peddled by Russian officials and discredited by the U.S. intelligence community. The Senate Judiciary Committee member, during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” attacked the media for believing “nobody else” interfered in the election besides Russia. “Ukraine blatantly interfered in our election,” Cruz said. He pointed to an op-ed published in August 2016 by Valeriy Chaly, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. at the time, as evidence of election meddling. In his op-ed, Chaly condemned comments Donald Trump made days earlier hinting that he supported the 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea, which is internationally recognized as a part of Ukraine. Republicans seeking to discredit the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump have held up Chaly’s op-ed as so-called evidence of Ukrainian corruption. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 election by hacking the Democratic National Committee’s servers and launching massive misinformation campaigns to benefit then-candidate Trump. Fiona Hill, the former top Russian expert on the National Security Council, testified last month that the Kremlin is pushing the theory that Ukraine interfered in the election to distract from its own culpability. WATCH: @SenTedCruz says he believes Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election. #MTP #IfItsSunday  Cruz’s comments come a week after Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), during an appearance on “Meet the Press,” claimed former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko “actively worked” for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “You realize the only person selling this argument outside the United States is ... Vladimir Putin?” host Chuck Todd asked the senator at the time. “You’ve done exactly what the Russian operation is trying to get American politicians to do.” Cruz on Sunday defended his Republican colleague against Todd’s criticism and accused the media of “acting like they work for” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). “Last week, Chuck, you called Sen. John Kennedy basically a stooge for Putin,” he said. “The press needs to stop being ridiculous.” Asked if he received a briefing from U.S. intelligence officials that explained how Russian agents are pushing the Ukraine interference theory, Cruz said he’s sat in on “multiple briefings” over the years. “Russia has tried to interfere in our elections,” he said. “China has tried to interfere in our elections. North Korea has tried to interfere in our elections. Ukraine has tried to interfere in our elections. This is not new. 2016 is not the first year they did. And they’re going to keep trying.” Cruz defended Trump against the ongoing impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine, saying the president has the “authority” to investigate corruption. House Democratic leaders and several current and former State Department officials say Trump withheld U.S. military aid in an effort to get Ukraine to publicly commit to investigating political rival Joe Biden. Trump appeared pleased with Cruz’s performance on Sunday, tweeting some of the senator’s quotes from his interview with “Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd.”",3.159020731328672,3.26071142109445,-0.10169068976577833,12

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) got an unintentional laugh during his appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press” on Sunday. During a heated interview with host Chuck Todd, the GOP senator joined the list of Republicans to support the conspiracy theory that Ukraine worked to influence the 2016 presidential election. “Do you believe Ukraine meddled in the American election in 2016?” Todd asked the senator. “I do, and I think there’s considerable evidence,” Cruz replied. “You do?” Todd responded incredulously, with a smirk on his face. At this point, laughter was picked up by the mic. Twitter users assumed someone on Todd’s staff couldn’t hold it in. However, the show is taped before a live audience, making it unclear who had a case of the chuckles. WATCH: @SenTedCruz says he believes Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election. #MTP #IfItsSunday  Todd went on to tell Cruz he found it strange that Cruz, whom President Donald Trump waged war on during the 2016 primaries, wasn’t more aware that this president was capable of creating “false narratives” about people in order to promote himself politically. Cruz waved it off and went on to insist that Ukraine “blatantly interfered in our election,” but was only able to cite one op-ed, written by then-Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Valeriy Chaly, as evidence. The op-ed condemned comments made by Trump hinting that he supported the 2014 invasion of Crimea by Russia, which is recognized internationally as a part of Ukraine. Todd told his guest that an op-ed was of a slightly different magnitude to Russia’s well-documented interference in the U.S. election to help Trump win. Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate the debunked Ukraine claim during the July 25 phone call that sparked the impeachment probe, and has continued to promote the falsehood since ― despite it being widely discredited by the U.S. intelligence community. A GOP-led Senate inquiry into the matter was also said to have found no evidence to support the claim, according to CNN and Politico sources familiar with the matter. Keen-eared Twitter users were quick to comment on Cruz’ “laugh track.” Holy crap — you can hear people in the @MeetThePress studio laughing out loud right after Ted Cruz proclaims that he thinks Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election. What an embarrassment.  Love the laugh track. Ted Cruz is comedy Studio employees laugh out loud as Ted Cruz prostitutes self as Trump-cult stooge. Did I just hear all of Chuck Todd’s studio laugh when Ted Cruz said Ukraine meddled in 2016? Ted Cruz's lies on national TV are so egregious that the Meet the Press crew - THE CREW! - is heard laughing off camera.Imagine doing all of this for the guy who called your wife ugly in front of the entire nation. Not even a SHRED of dignity. That was the collective laugh of all reasonable people bring fed this line of bullshit Did I hear someone laughing at @tedcruz in the background?

Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) on Sunday said the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump has produced a “rock solid case” against the president regarding his dealings with Ukraine. “I think the case we have if presented to a jury would be a guilty verdict in about three minutes flat,” Nadler said during an interview on CNN’s “State Of The Union.” He shrugged off Republicans who claim there’s no evidence to prove Trump withheld U.S. military aid to get Ukraine to publicly commit to investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his Democratic rivals. “All this nonsense about hearsay evidence ― there is considerable direct evidence,” Nadler said. He added: “The reason we don’t have even more direct evidence is the president has ordered everybody in the executive branch not to cooperate with Congress in the impeachment inquiry, something that is unprecedented in American history and is a contempt of Congress by itself.” “We have a very lock solid case,” @RepJerryNadler says about the House Democrats' impeachment case. “The case we have if presented to a jury would be a guilty verdict in about three minutes flat.” #CNNSOTU  The ongoing impeachment inquiry is set to continue in the House this week. Nadler said his committee on Monday would examine the House Intelligence Committee’s report, which was compiled after two weeks of public testimonies from witnesses. Nadler said he would likely bring articles of impeachment before his committee this week, but would not specify how many or what they would say. Asked whether Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election would be included, Nadler wouldn’t say. “It’s all of a pattern,” he told CNN’s Dana Bash. “The central allegation is that the president put himself above his country several times, that he sought foreign interference in our elections several times ― both for 2016 and 2020 ― that he sought to cover it up all the time and that he continually violated his oath of office.” “All this presents a pattern that poses a real and present danger to the integrity of the next election, which is one reason why we can’t just wait for the next election to settle matters,” he added. Dem @RepJerryNadler tells @DanaBashCNN that he sees the Ukraine evidence as part of ""a pattern"" of conduct by President Trump, but would not commit to including the evidence of obstruction of justice included in the Mueller report as part of the articles of impeachment. #CNNSOTU  Trump has repeatedly claimed he did nothing wrong by asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July 25 phone call to investigate Biden and his son. The call was the subject of a whistleblower complaint filed by a CIA analyst in August and became the centerpiece of the impeachment inquiry. Several current and former State Department officials testified before the House Intelligence Committee last month that the White House used U.S. military aid as leverage to get Ukraine to publicly commit to investigating Biden, a frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary. If the House Judiciary Committee votes to move forward with articles of impeachment, the inquiry will move to the full House. House Democrats reportedly hope the impeachment vote will take place before Christmas so a Senate trial can begin in early 2020.",2.2406160574947145,2.9895996542844627,-0.7489835967897482,16

On Thursday, a local “bear patrol” reported 56 polar bears gathered near the far northeast Russian village of Ryrkaypiy on the Chukchi Sea, according to a statement from World Wildlife Fund Russia. And later local reports cited by Mashable put the number at 61. “Almost all the bears are thin,” Tatyana Minenko, head of the village’s bear patrol, said in the WWF Russia release. “There are both adult and young animals, including cubs of different ages with their moms.” The bears appear to be feeding on walrus carcasses. Around five years ago, it would be rare to see more than three to five bears in a group near the village, biologist Anatoly Kochnev told Russian news agency TASS in November. But a “massive gathering” like this one is more likely to occur as a warming climate leads to shrinking sea ice, according to WWF Russia. Polar bears use sea ice to hunt for prey, like seals, but they can’t do so when there’s too little ice. “If there is enough ice, the bears would go further north to hunt the seals,” Mikhail Stishov of WWF Russia said in the statement. But if the ice isn’t thick enough, the bears “will stay ashore” where they may “visit the village due to curiosity and hunger,” he said. Stishov told CNN that “similar situations are becoming the norm,” cautioning that people “need to adapt to this so that neither people nor bears suffer.” Geoff York, senior director of Polar Bears International, told Mashable that such large congregations of polar bears are “exactly what we expect in these low ice years.” The sea ice extent — the measurement of the ocean area where there is at least some sea ice — in the Chukchi Sea hit a record low in October. And according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the 13 lowest recorded September Arctic sea ice extents all occurred in the last 13 years. Currently, volunteers are patrolling the area around the village to deter bears from entering, paying special attention to the area near a local nursery school. For the time being, public events are canceled and children are being bussed to school.",6.477047026395713,6.189835060092359,0.2872119663033539,8

The 55-page document is primarily a historical and legal discussion about why and how a president should be removed from office, rather than a lengthy debate on Trump’s presidential misconduct in dealings with Ukraine. Its release follows Wednesday’s Judiciary Committee hearing on whether or not those dealings are grounds for impeachment. Three experts on constitutional law testified that there was clearly enough evidence of wrongdoing to impeach the president. A fourth disagreed. Impeachable conduct is defined in the Constitution as “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” “A President faithful only to himself — who will sell out democracy and national security for his own personal advantage — is a danger to every American,” the report states. “Indeed, he threatens America itself.” The Framers worst nightmare is what we are facing in this very moment. President Trump abused his power, betrayed our national security, and corrupted our elections, all for personal gain. The Constitution details only one remedy for this misconduct: impeachment. In a series of public and private hearings, several current and former American foreign policy officials helped House investigators piece together a picture of a president attempting to secure a this-for-that deal with a foreign power: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would receive military aid and a coveted White House meeting if he announced investigations that would benefit Trump personally. Committee staffers who authored the report did not instruct members of Congress how to vote on impeachment. Instead, they offered guidance, concluding that “the ultimate question in an impeachment is whether leaving the President in our highest office imperils the Constitution.” A similar report was prepared in advance of President Richard Nixon’s impeachment. The report defends the way in which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has led the proceedings, which have been criticized by Republicans as unfair because they have not been able to call witnesses of their choosing in the Democrat-controlled chamber. It also addresses another popular Republican talking point, that Democrats in Congress are attempting to reverse the results of the 2016 election. The nation’s founders “firmly rejected” that notion, the staffers wrote, arguing that ”[w]here the President’s misconduct is aimed at corrupting elections, relying on elections to solve the problem is no safeguard at all.” Pelosi instructed the House this week to begin drafting articles of impeachment. If passed, the impeachment proceedings will move to the Senate for a trial.",3.0590537264921287,2.8402876097605745,0.21876611673155422,16

He has “a lot of good information,” Trump told reporters gathered on the White House lawn. The former New York City mayor traveled to Ukraine and Hungary with a crew from One America News Network, a conservative cable channel and website that occasionally peddles right-wing conspiracy theories, to film a documentary meant to challenge the House impeachment inquiry. “He’s going to make a report, I think, to the attorney general and to Congress,” Trump said. “I hear he has found plenty.” Giuliani reportedly spoke to former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko along with other former Ukrainian officials ― all of whom have faced accusations of corruption. The Bidens have been accused, without evidence, of using their influence to improperly meddle in Ukrainian affairs because Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company around the same time his father was tasked with addressing corruption in Ukraine. Trump is thought to consider Joe Biden to be his chief rival in the 2020 presidential election. However, his Biden preoccupation has landed him in hot water: Members of Congress launched impeachment proceedings after becoming aware of requests the president made of Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky. If Zelensky announced that his government was investigating the Bidens, his country would receive pledged military aid that was being withheld and he would meet with Trump at the White House. The president also asked Zelensky to look into a conspiracy theory positing that it was Ukraine that meddled in the 2016 election, not Russia, and that the country did it on behalf of Hillary Clinton, not Trump. American intelligence officials have consistently said the theory has no basis in fact.",2.7112454581026566,2.8293917885955704,-0.11814633049291379,16

Some were literally at a loss for words when told that Trump was now claiming ― more than two months after the White House released a summary of the July 25 conversation ― that he was actually urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to help the United States when he pushed the foreign leader to “do us a favor” by probing former Vice President Joe Biden and a 2016 election conspiracy theory. “When I said, in my phone call to the President of Ukraine, ‘I would like you to do US a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.’ With the word ‘us’ I am referring to the United States, our Country,” Trump claimed in a tweet on Wednesday. When asked about the tweet on Thursday, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) doubled over in laughter. Pressed to voice his response in words, the Democratic whip declined, shaking his head in apparent disbelief before walking into a caucus lunch. Other senators on both sides of the aisle seemed equally amused by Trump’s latest explanation. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) smirked when asked if he agreed with the president’s reading of the call summary. But he declined to comment until the Senate receives articles of impeachment, which the House is expected to draft next week. “I think the safest course is not to start analyzing all this until the House decides to send over whatever they send over, if they decide to send anything,” Blunt said on Thursday. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) reacted with a similar expression on his face. “It would help if we actually have a full transcript,” Warner said, noting that the summary of the call the White House released was the product of contemporaneous handwritten notes and not a full transcript. But Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said he viewed Trump’s call with Zelensky, including the portion for which the president was offering a new explanation, as unremarkable. “I’ve talked to the president enough to have heard him say, ‘Ron, do me a favor.’ It’s almost in some respects a verbal tick. It’s not an unusual thing to come out of President Trump’s mouth. I view that whole conversation as pretty benign,” he said. The House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday released a 300-page report accusing Trump of abusing the power of his office in his dealings with Ukraine by seeking to withhold military assistance until its government announced an investigation into Biden, one of Trump’s 2020 rivals. The Senate is expected to take up articles of impeachment against Trump sometime next month. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he’ll give the House case against Trump a trial, even though he does not believe there are enough votes in the upper chamber to remove the president.",2.63926837771414,2.924451341082524,-0.285182963368384,16

Biden, 77, responded to the man’s comments by calling him a “damn liar,” defending his son and urging the man to do push-ups. The confrontation with the man, who identified himself as an 83-year-old retired farmer who is not a Republican, took place during a campaign event in New Hampton, Iowa, on Thursday. Biden’s campaign stopped in the city as a part of his “No Malarkey” bus tour through the state, which is just two months away from its Democratic caucus. The Iowa man, who did not provide his name, began by arguing that Biden was too old to run for president. “You’re damn near as old as I am,” he said. “You’re too old.” He then explained his other objection to Biden’s candidacy: “We all know Trump has been messing around in Ukraine. ... You, on the other hand, sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company and [he] had no experience in natural gas.” “You’re selling access to the president just like he is,” he added. Interrupting the man, Biden said firmly: “You’re a damn liar, man. That’s not true.” “And no one has ever said that. No one has proved that,” he added before telling his staffers to allow the man to keep his microphone. Joe Biden lashed at an Iowa town hall after the man suggested he helped his son get a sweetheart deal in Ukraine and was “selling access” like President Donald Trump does:“You’re a damn liar. That's not true,"" Biden said. “Get your words straight, jack!”  The man’s accusation echoed Trump’s debunked claims that as vice president, Biden wielded his political power to stop an investigation into a major Ukranian gas company while his son Hunter Biden sat on the company’s board of directors. Trump’s own conduct with Ukraine, including a proposal that the Ukrainian government investigate the Bidens, is now the subject of the House impeachment inquiry. Hunter Biden reportedly made between $50,000 to $80,000 a month while he served on the board, but no evidence has surfaced to prove that the Bidens did anything illegal. The younger Biden maintains he did nothing “improper” while working in Ukraine, though in October he admitted to exercising “poor judgment” by taking the role. At the Iowa town hall, Joe Biden also defended his physical health. “Let’s do push-ups,” he told the man. “Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test.” And then he turned his attention back to his son. “No one has said my son has done anything wrong,” Biden said. The man cut in to tell Biden, “I didn’t say you were doing anything wrong.” “You said I set up my son to work on an oil company. Isn’t that what you said? Get your words straight, Jack!” Biden retorted. After a few more heated comments, the man compared the former vice president to Trump, saying he didn’t “have any more backbone than Trump does.” Then he told Biden he wouldn’t be voting for him, prompting the crowd to boo. “I know you’re not, man,” Biden replied, before moving on to more questions. “You think I thought you were voting for me standing there. You’re too old to vote for me.” A spokesman for Biden’s campaign declined to comment on the confrontation and pointed HuffPost to a statement put out by Biden’s senior adviser Symone Sanders. “The reality is this - a reference was made to the ‘news’ today and I think we all know which outlet has continued to peddle the debunked conspiracy theories cooked up by Trump and Rudy Guiliani about Ukraine,” Sanders tweeted. “These lies will not go unchecked & we’ll continue to lay out the facts.” Let's be clear RE: the exchange VP Biden had with a voter in Iowa earlier today: 1) the gentleman is a self identified Warren supporter who said he would vote for the VP in a general election 2) his facts were flat-out wrong and 3) the crowd backed VP Biden up in his response. To be clear: Any assertion VP Biden said a word about the gentleman's appearance is making this something it is not. In the latter part of the exchange, the VP began to say ""Look, facts"" then said ""here's the deal."" If you've been to a Biden event, you've heard this before. The reality is this - a reference was made to the ""news"" today and I think we all know which outlet has continued to peddle the debunked conspiracy theories cooked up by Trump and Rudy Guiliani about Ukraine. These lies will not go unchecked & we'll continue to lay out the facts. The retired farmer told reporters after the event that he was voting for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for the Democratic primary, The New York Times reported. The man also told reporters that he wasn’t trying to cause any problems. The Iowa voter who Joe Biden called a ""damn liar"" speaks with reporters after their tense exchange: ""At least he's not getting so old that he's senile.""  Asked about Biden’s apparent aggression towards him, he said, “That’s good. At least he’s not getting so old that he’s senile anyhow.”",2.164103788944135,2.8617369260408796,-0.6976331370967448,16

Susan Gordon, who until recently served as the principal deputy director of national intelligence, detailed her experiences briefing Trump at an event Tuesday by the Women’s Foreign Policy Group in Washington, according to CNN. (See the video above.) But beyond his doubting of intelligence information, she said, the bigger concern was that Trump often received his own information from questionable sources. “Remember, intelligence is fundamentally a craft of uncertainty and of possibility, so that doesn’t put you off,” Gordon said. The difficulty was in “trying to catch up to how you adjudicate the sources that led him to believe that, and how you respond to it.” Trump routinely parrots false information from right-wing conspiracy theories (often promulgated on his favorite cable news network, Fox News), such as rejecting the widely proven finding from U.S. intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. He has also regularly attacked intelligence officials and agencies, suggesting they should serve him, not the country. Gordon, a career government official who worked under every president from Ronald Reagan to Trump, was ousted in August, despite being next in line to replace retiring Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. Trump named Joseph Maguire as acting director, passing over Gordon. The president reportedly wanted someone he deemed more loyal. In a note accompanying her resignation letter, Gordon made her dissatisfaction clear, writing: “I offer this letter as an act of respect & patriotism, not preference. You should have your team.” Asked about her departure Tuesday, Gordon said she heard that White House officials were “not comfortable with me continuing as the acting director” when Coats stepped down. When Trump was receiving intelligence briefings, she said, he would often ask questions like, “‘Why is that true?’ ‘Why are we there?’ ‘Why is this what you believe?’ ‘Why do we do that?’ Those sorts of things.” “What’s different about this president: Number one, is, he is the first in my experience that had no foundational framework to understand what the limits of intelligence are, what the purpose of it was, and the way that we discuss it,” she said. According to Gordon, Trump “asked different questions” and often “disproportionately” approached the information using an “economic” lens. “He is much more economic in the way that he sees the world, and the intelligence community traditionally is much more political, military — purposely so,” Gordon said. “We were scrambling a bit to try and produce intelligence that was foundationally useful for someone who is interested in making trades and deals.” While Trump was uniquely different in some ways, Gordon acknowledged that every president approaches intelligence differently, and it’s up to intelligence officials to adapt their briefings to each person. “President Obama was a reader and just voraciously consumed it. JFK wanted 3-by-5 cards in his pocket,” she said. “You have to figure out a way to convey the information because ultimately that’s what you’re trying to do. You’re trying to present information in a way that is both heard and then can be used.” “I found him actually kind of a fun brief because he was interactive. He would challenge you,” she said of Trump. “The role of intelligence is to provide wisdom, clarity and insight. You can’t wish that the recipient were different from where they were. Your challenge is to present it in a way that it can be heard.”",3.8993604987709127,2.39808281003304,1.501277688737873,6

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has broken ranks with President Donald Trump and many of his GOP allies, declaring Tuesday that he is “1,000% confident” that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. His view contradicts a conspiracy theory backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and peddled by Trump and others in his party that Ukraine meddled in the presidential election and framed the Russians. “It was the Russians. I’m 1,000% confident that the hack of the [Democratic National Committee] was by Russian operatives, no one else,” Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill. In a subsequent interview with CNN, Graham said he had “no doubt” that it was the Russians who hacked the emails of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. “It wasn’t Ukraine. Russia was behind the stolen DNC emails and Podesta and all that good stuff,” the senator said. “So as to the Ukraine, they had zero to do with the hacking of the DNC and the stealing of the emails. Whether or not people from the Ukraine met with DNC operatives, I don’t know. All I’ve seen is press reports that no one has validated.” The senator joins Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who also told reporters on Tuesday that he’d seen no evidence of Ukrainian meddling, in distancing himself from the theory floated by some of their Republican colleagues. The break comes amid the House impeachment inquiry, which was triggered by the president’s dealings with Ukraine. At the center of the probe is a July 25 phone call to Ukraine in which Trump referenced the hacking theory to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging him to look into CrowdStrike, a California-based cybersecurity firm that had investigated the breach of the DNC email system. The president called into “Fox & Friends” recently to again push the theory, claiming that CrowdStrike is owned by a “wealthy Ukrainian.” The company is U.S.-owned. Politico and CNN reported Monday that a GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee found no evidence when investigating allegations of interference by Ukraine, according to sources with direct knowledge of the inquiry. Graham’s comments contrast with those of Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who declined to directly refute the theory and refused to say whether he saw evidence that Ukraine interfered, despite his own committee’s conclusion that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election and was “overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump.” Graham is usually a devoted Trump defender. He has blocked a Senate resolution to formally recognize the Armenian genocide at the behest of the White House, opened a formal investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden’s work in Ukraine despite the claims of corruption being widely discredited and unsubstantiated, and repeatedly denied unfavorable but damning testimony against Trump during the impeachment inquiry.",3.678493223596399,2.210584593911417,1.4679086296849824,12

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) distanced himself from some of his GOP colleagues on Tuesday, stating that there was no sign of Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election. “I saw no evidence from our intelligence community, nor from the representatives today for the Department of State, that there is any evidence of any kind of that suggests that Ukraine interfered in our elections,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill. “We have ample evidence that Russia interfered in our elections.” ""We have ample evidence that Russia interfered in our elections.""Sen. Mitt Romney says he won't comment on any GOP colleagues voicing debunked theory on 2016 election meddling, but adds, ""We have to adhere to the facts as presented to us by our Intelligence Community.""  Romey’s statement follows testimony from Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale, the third-highest ranking State Department official. Hale told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Russian meddling was not a “hoax,” and that he knows of no evidence implicating Ukraine. The remarks are a stark contrast to those of Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who on Monday told NBC News that there was no “question that elected officials in Ukraine had a favorite in the election,” promoting a debunked conspiracy theory. “Every elected official in the Ukraine was for Hillary Clinton,” the Senate Intelligence Committee chair said. “Is that very different than the Russians being for Donald Trump?” The comments echoed Sen. John Kennedy’s (R-La.) claims on Sunday, when he speculated during a “Meet the Press” appearance that “both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election,” and that “it’s been well documented.” The U.S. intelligence community has dismissed rumors of any role by Ukraine, reportedly briefing senators in November that the allegations are a talking point touted by Russia to divert attention from its own interference in the U.S. election. Less than two weeks ago, Kennedy suggested on Fox News that Ukraine may have perpetrated the 2016 Democratic National Committee server hack that exposed party emails. The senator’s claim promulgated a lie often peddled by President Donald Trump while blatantly ignoring American intelligence officials’ conclusion that it was Russia behind the hack. Kennedy recanted shortly after, telling CNN, “I was wrong.” “The only evidence I have, and I think it’s overwhelming, it that it was Russia who tried to hack the DNC computer. I’ve seen no indication that Ukraine tried to do it,” he said. On Tuesday, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the Intelligence Committee, denounced the erroneous claims, telling CNN that he hasn’t seen the slightest indication of Ukrainian involvement. “I bet I sat through 25 hearings, briefings, meetings, probably more on the question of what happened in 2016,” he said. “In none of those meetings was there ever a hint, a breath, a suggestion, a word that somehow Ukraine was involved.”",2.877073609713784,1.3316636484012159,1.5454099613125682,12

The documents, released by the Justice Department on Monday in response to a lawsuit by BuzzFeed News and CNN, included almost 300 pages of witness memoranda and notes from the FBI’s interviews with key players in the Mueller probe. The documents included summaries of the bureau’s interviews with Christie, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and former White Hosue communications director Hope Hicks, among others. According to the memos, Christie told the FBI that he’d discussed the Mueller investigation with Trump over lunch on Valentine’s Day in 2017. “Now that we fired Flynn, the Russia thing is over,” Trump allegedly told Christie, referring to former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s removal from office. Flynn resigned on Feb. 13, 2017, after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia’s then-ambassador to the U.S. Flynn later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Christie told investigators that he “laughed” at Trump’s suggestion that the Russia problem was behind them. “No way,” he recalled telling the president. “We’ll be here on Valentine’s Day 2018 talking about this.” Christie, a former federal prosecutor, said he went on to urge Trump to keep his head down as the probe into Russian interference ramped up. Per the memos: [Christie said] he had been through both sides of investigations and there was no way to make it shorter, but there were a lot of ways to make it longer. Trump asked Christie what he meant, and Christie told him not to talk about the investigation and to keep his mouth shut even though it would be frustrating at times. Christie added that “if you get near a guy like Flynn, he’s like gum on the bottom of your shoe, and you can’t get rid of him.” Chris Christie told Mueller investigators that Trump said to him ""Now that we fired Flynn, the Russia thing is over"" and Christie laughed at him and said ""no way.""  Later during that same Valentine’s Day lunch, Trump allegedly asked Christie to speak with then-FBI Director James Comey ― who, at the time, was leading the bureau’s probe into Russian election interference ― and to tell him that Trump “really like[s] him.” Christie told the FBI that he never made the call, saying he thought the request was “nonsensical.” “Christie said it would have been uncomfortable to pass on that message” to Comey, the FBI summary of the interview said. Comey was fired three months later. During a Q&A session last month at his alma mater, the University of Delaware, Christie called Mueller an “American patriot” and praised the special counsel’s final report as “very thorough and fair” given “the complicated set of facts.” Separately, he said he believed Trump would be impeached by the House of Representatives over his dealings with Ukraine but would not be removed from office by the Republican-led Senate. “I have a very, what I call, practical view of this. He will be impeached. It’s just a matter of time. The Democrats didn’t start this to not finish it,” Christie said, according to NPR. “This is a political judgment, not a factual judgment. They will impeach him, and then it will go to the Senate, and the Senate will not remove him.” “Everyone’s got their uniform on,’’ Christie continued, referring to partisanship in Washington. “And 20 Republicans are not taking their red jersey off and putting a blue jersey on between now and January. And that’s what it’s going to take, and I don’t think it’s going to happen.” Mueller witness interview memos, round 2.

Carlson said something similar a week ago, but then disavowed it within the hour. This time, Carlson made the leap as he railed against U.S. sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Crimea and for an ongoing deadly border war with Ukraine. “I should say for the record that I’m totally opposed to these sanctions and I don’t think we should be at war with Russia,” a serious Carlson told Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on his program. “And I think we should probably take the side of Russia, if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine.” He also wondered why Putin is “so bad”? In another jaw-dropper, Carlson insisted that Putin “does not hate America as much as many of these people do” after he attacked MSNBC news host Chuck Todd and the “rest of the dummies.” He criticized them for being incapable of speaking Russian. He accused Todd of going “full Joe McCarthy” for challenging Rep. John Kennedy (R-La.), who on Sunday pushed President Donald Trump’s unfounded accusations that Ukraine interfered in the U.S. presidential election. Remember last week when Tucker said he's rooting for Russia? Well here he is tonight defending Putin and saying ""for all his faults"" at least he doesn't hate America as much as people on MSNBC do  Jordan ducked any similar pro-Russia declaration. The smiling Republican seemed weirdly amused by Carlson’s short proclamation. Ironically, Jordan had been trying to make a point that Trump is very tough on Russia. Carlson last week said that he wanted to side with Russia in conflicts with Ukraine. “Why shouldn’t I root for Russia, which I am,” he said then. But just 45 minutes later, he insisted he wasn’t serious. “Of course I’m joking. I’m only rooting for America,” he claimed. Twitter critics had a few observations to share about Carlson’s position. Someone tell me the difference between tucker on fox and RT.  Tucker Carlson says USA should side with Russia, the country that attacked our elections and wants to weaken US here and abroad, over Ukraine, an ally that has lost over 13,000 fighting Russia. Like I said, Republicans will bring it all down for Trump, their blunt instrument. What? @TuckerCarlson thinks it is ok for Russia to annex Ukrainian territory and then we should side with Russia ? Wow. Just wow. Missing Reagan. Missing real conservative Republicans. Missing Churchill. Scared of appeasers. Wait, didn't Tucker claim just the other day that he was joking when he said we should back Russia in the conflict with Ukraine?

Wallace, confused by Republicans’ insistence on pushing claims by Putin in “defiance of facts” uncovered by U.S. intelligence officials, was referring to an unfounded claim in a dossier gathered by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele that Donald Trump watched prostitutes engage in “golden showers” in a Moscow hotel room in 2013. Such tapes could be used as blackmail, Wallace was insinuating — though not seriously. But how else to explain Republicans’ strange insistence on stories that serve Putin’s aims? Wallace guest and Bulwark editor Charlie Sykes accused Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) of coming off as an “addled Russian asset” when he claimed Sunday on MSNBC that former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko “actively worked” for Hillary Clinton to skew the American election on her behalf. When an astounded Chuck Todd asked for the basis for Kennedy’s claim, the senator responded: “Just read the articles” — though he identified no “articles.” An exasperated Todd responded: “C’mon!” Sykes, a conservative commentator and author, had no explanation for why Kennedy did a “full Devin Nunes,” referring to the California congressman who defends Trump no matter what the cost. “Is this the price now to be paid for currying favor in Trump World?” he asked. He called Kennedy’s — and others’ — Ukraine election claims “flat-out BS.” The insistence that Ukraine — and not Russia — interfered in the 2016 election serves to distract attention from the Kremlin just as officials warn Russia is already taking action to manipulate the 2020 U.S. election, critics warn. Former White House Russia analyst Fiona Hill testified last month before the House Intelligence Committee that the story that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election is “a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Sunday called Republican lawmakers the “most important global asset” of Russian intelligence.

Richard Burr (R-N.C.) on Monday refused to say whether he’s seen evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election, declining to directly rebut a debunked conspiracy theory floated by some of his fellow GOP lawmakers and President Donald Trump. Burr, the chairman of the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, instead played a game of words with reporters on Capitol Hill who pressed him about an interview with Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who suggested the Ukranian government worked “actively” to help elect Trump’s opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump later thanked Kennedy “for the job he did in representing both the Republican Party and myself” on Twitter. “Every elected official in the Ukraine was for Hillary Clinton,” Burr claimed Monday, according to NBC’s Frank Thorp. “Is that very different than the Russians being for Donald Trump?” Asked if he had seen any evidence to back up the claim that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, Burr answered by addressing a different question, saying he didn’t think “there’s any question that elected officials in Ukraine had a favorite in the election.” Russia didn’t simply prefer Trump in 2016. The U.S. intelligence community has stated definitively that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee’s servers and leaked thousands of emails in an effort to discredit Democrats and help Trump win the presidency in 2016. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine was behind the cyberattack, however. Burr’s own committee concluded that Russia used social media campaigns to sow discord among the American electorate in 2016, adding that the activity was “overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump.” The committee also looked into the theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election but “found no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin’s efforts to help Trump win in 2016,” according to Politico. But Burr did not mention those conclusions on Monday and continued to insist in an extended Q&A that a “preference” for a candidate is somehow on the same footing as a foreign government waging a systematic campaign to affect an election’s outcome: Here's the end of our Q+A with Senate Intel Cmte Chair @SenatorBurr:  In her testimony at a House impeachment hearing last month, former National Security Council member Fiona Hill, a top Russia expert, warned that Republicans were playing into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hands by pointing the finger at Ukraine. “Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country ― and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,” Hill said at the hearing. “This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.” Nevertheless, Trump and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill have continued to seek to shift the narrative that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. Democrats on Monday slammed their GOP counterparts for “disgracefully” repeating Russian propaganda. “The charge that Ukraine had something to do with election meddling in 2016 is a lie spread by Vladimir Putin to get things off his back,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) added in an interview on MSNBC: “My hope has been all along that the Senate would be able to survive the Trump presidency, that we wouldn’t be pulled down into this cesspool of lies and mistruths. It’s just sad to watch my colleagues willingly propagate these lies.”",1.5220266770535813,1.4786287020825089,0.04339797497107245,12

John Kennedy (R-La.) that Ukraine, like Russia, interfered in the 2016 election ― a theory peddled by the Kremlin and rejected by U.S. intelligence agencies. “I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election. I think it’s been well documented,” Kennedy said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” Though Kennedy has backtracked on his comments from last week, in which he appeared to suggest Ukraine may have been behind the 2016 cyberattack against the Democratic National Committee, he has continued to say the country interfered in the U.S. election generally. Todd pointed out that the U.S. intelligence community has said that’s not true. He also noted that Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert in the National Security Council, testified before Congress last month that Ukraine did not meddle in the election. What’s more, Todd said, senators were reportedly briefed by U.S. intelligence officials after Hill’s testimony that Russia is behind the push to frame Ukraine for its own U.S. election interference. “This is a Russian intelligence propaganda campaign in order to get people like you to say these things about Ukraine,” he told Kennedy. “Are you at all concerned you’re doing Russian intelligence work here?” WATCH: @ChuckTodd asks @SenJohnKennedy if he is ""at all concerned that he has been duped"" into believing that former Ukraine president worked for the Clinton campaign in 2016 #MTP #IfItsSunday@SenJohnKennedy: ""No, just read the articles.""  Kennedy denied having been briefed on Russia’s efforts, and added, “Dr. Hill is entitled to her opinion.” Todd fired back: “When does opinion become fact? Does 17 intelligence services saying it; does every Western intelligence ally saying Russia did this? I’m just sort of confused. At what point is it no longer an opinion for you?” But Kennedy claimed it’s a “fact” that Ukraine interfered on the election, pointing to past articles in Politico and The Financial Times that reported that Ukrainian officials criticized Trump ahead of the 2016 election given his Russia-friendly comments at the time. In July 2016, Trump hinted that he supported the 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea, which is internationally recognized as a part of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials swiftly denounced his remarks. “Russia was very aggressive and they’re much more sophisticated,” Kennedy said Sunday. “But the fact that Russia was so aggressive does not exclude the fact that [former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko] actively worked for [Hillary Clinton].” An exasperated Todd interrupted Kennedy, after his claim about Poroshenko, for which there is no evidence. “You realize the only person selling this argument outside the United States is ... Vladimir Putin?” he asked. “You’ve done exactly what the Russian operation is trying to get American politicians to do. Are you at all concerned that you’ve been duped?” “No,” Kennedy said. Todd continued to grill him, asking if the senator believes there’s a difference between Ukrainian officials criticizing a presidential candidate who endorsed the invasion of their country — as Trump had — compared to Russia hacking the DNC servers. “Let’s suppose ― and I don’t believe ― but you’re right and I’m wrong,” Kennedy said. “Then what harm would it do to allow the president of the United States, who has a demonstrated record of fighting foreign corruption, to introduce evidence?” Todd noted that Trump has been given “every opportunity to provide exculpatory evidence” on the matter and hasn’t done so. Kennedy then claimed the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump, which is centered on the president’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, is “as rigged as carnival ring toss.” He also claimed Trump hasn’t been able to call his own witnesses or have legal representation during the hearings. However, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) asked Republicans last week which witnesses they would like to have testify on behalf of Trump. Nadler also invited the president’s attorneys to come to the hearings as the impeachment inquiry proceeds.",0.0,0.0,0.0,10

Inspector General Michael Horowitz will release a report on Dec. 9 undercutting claims from conservatives that the FBI exhibited systemic political bias against President Trump in its investigation, the Times reported, citing two people familiar with a draft of the inspector general’s report. This latest DOJ report follows an earlier one from Horowitz that indicated the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation in 2016 harmed Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee ― not Trump. On the matter of the investigation into Russian interference in 2016, two claims in particular have spread widely in conservative circles. The first arose in 2017, when Trump claimed that former President Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower. Trump has since admitted he made the claim without evidence, and the inspector general’s report is expected to refute the claim officially. The second accusation from the president’s conservative allies involves the approval of a wiretap on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page; Republicans in Congress have said the wiretap, which was approved in a special court overseeing foreign intelligence surveillance, was politically motivated. The FBI sought the wiretap after the Christopher Steele dossier — a compilation of bombshell claims about a relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia assembled by a former British intelligence official — said Page may have been in contact with Kremlin officials. Horowitz will say the FBI was “careless and unprofessional” in its pursuit of the wiretap, but his report ultimately finds the agency’s actions were not politically motivated, according to the Times’ sources. Trump, his campaign officials and Republicans have chafed at the Russia investigation since it was announced in 2017, repeatedly claiming that accusations Trump aided Russian interference in the 2016 election were meant to remove a “duly elected president” from office. But, although former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation couldn’t find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, the Mueller report did find several instances in which Trump or his campaign officials showed willingness — even eagerness — to gain Russia’s help. (The trial of Roger Stone, a former Trump campaign adviser with ties to WikiLeaks, has shed more light on the potential backchannels used to coordinate the effort.) The president has asked his allies in Congress and members of the press to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation, suggesting nefarious activity had taken place. But the Dec. 9 report — much like the Mueller report before it — will say the FBI acted properly in opening the investigation, according to the Times. Republicans in Congress have also trained their focus on a Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud, whom some have accused of being an FBI informant. The inspector general’s report is expected to dispel that claim, as well. Mifsud is cited in the Mueller report as the individual who first informed Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on Clinton. Mifsud’s interactions with Papadopoulos — which Papadopoulos discussed over drinks with an Australian diplomat — were the catalyst for the Russia investigation, according to the Mueller report. The diplomat, Alexander Downer, allegedly precipitated the Russia investigation when he reported what he’d heard to the FBI. So there were, in fact, taps involved in the earliest stages of the Russia affair — but they were apparently beer taps, not wiretaps.",0.0,0.0,0.0,12

John Kennedy (R-La.) conceded Monday to CNN host Chris Cuomo that he was wrong in the earlier interview. Russia, not Ukraine, was responsible for hacking Democratic National Committee emails before the 2016 presidential election, he clarified. “I was wrong,” he said on CNN. “The only evidence I have, and I think it’s overwhelming, it that it was Russia who tried to hack the DNC computer. I’ve seen no indication that Ukraine tried to do it.” Asked by Fox News’ Chris Wallace on Sunday if he thought Russia was behind the damaging cyberattack — as the U.S. intelligence community has concluded — Kennedy falsely claimed that nobody knows.

He told Cuomo he misheard Wallace as saying that “only Russia had tried to interfere in the election.” Though he believed Russia was responsible for the hack, he was reluctant to rule out Ukrainian involvement in other election interference, Kennedy explained. But his clarification reveals how difficult it is for even one of Donald Trump’s staunchest supporters to swallow the president’s narrative that the Democrats hacked their own emails with Ukraine’s help so they could blame it on the Republicans.

John Kennedy (R-La.) on Sunday suggested Ukraine may have hacked the Democratic National Committee’s servers in 2016 ― an assertion that bucks the assessment of the entire U.S. intelligence community, and also happens to echo a debunked conspiracy theory often peddled by President Donald Trump. Asked during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday” whether Russia was behind the cyberattack, as the CIA and Department of Homeland Security have concluded, Kennedy falsely claimed that nobody knows. ″I don’t know,” he told host Chris Wallace. “Nor do you. Nor do any of us.” Wallace interrupted to point out that the “entire intelligence community says it was Russia.” ″Right, but it could also be Ukraine,” Kennedy said. On FOX News Sunday: Louisiana Senator John Kennedy reacts to President Trump saying Ukraine may have the DNC server, an idea that runs contrary to the intelligence community. Chris asks Senator Kennedy who he thinks is responsible for hacking the DNC. #FNS #FoxNews  The U.S. intelligence community has stated definitively that Russia hacked the DNC’s servers and leaked thousands of emails in an effort to help Trump win the presidency in 2016. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine was behind the cyberattack. In September, Tom Bossert, a former homeland security adviser to Trump, said that idea is “completely false” and “completely debunked.” “It has no validity,” Bossert told ABC News. “The United States government reached its conclusion on attributing to Russia the DNC hack in 2016 before it even communicated it to the FBI.” Several current and former State Department officials, while testifying before Congress as part of the impeachment inquiry, have also said the Ukraine hacking claim has no basis in reality. Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, testified that Russia has pushed the Ukraine hacking theory in an effort to obscure its own role in the attack and sow discord within the U.S. political system. “Our nation is being torn apart,” Hill said. “Truth is questioned. Our highly professional, expert career foreign service is being undermined.” But Kennedy, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that’s simply “her opinion.” “I’m not saying that I know one way or another,” he said Sunday. “I’m saying Ms. Hill is entitled to her opinion, but no rebuttal evidence was allowed to be offered.” “We know that, at least that the Republicans in the House wanted to call a witness, a DNC political operative who lobbied the Ukrainian Embassy to be involved, get involved in 2016 election,” he continued. “We don’t know if Ukraine did that. We don’t know to what extent.” Kennedy was apparently referring to Alexandra Chalupa, a co-chair of the DNC’s Ethnic Council who worked with Ukrainian Embassy officials in 2016 to research former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s Russia ties. There is no evidence, however, that Ukraine coordinated with Chalupa or the DNC to influence the election. Wallace concluded the interview by telling Kennedy that it’s “always interesting to talk to you and even more interesting to listen to you.” Asked Sunday why Trump doesn’t believe his own Justice Department and intelligence officials about the Russian cyberattack, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway claimed he actually does. “The president has said he accepts that, but also there are plenty of ways to interfere in an election,” Conway told CBS’ “Face The Nation.” When host Margaret Brennan pressed Conway to answer specifically about Trump’s claims that Ukraine was behind the DNC hack, the White House aide pivoted to attacking Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and the media.",0.0,0.0,0.0,12

Committee Republicans have endorsed numerous unfounded theories that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. Specifically, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has suggested that the “black ledger” that revealed millions in hidden payments by the government of deposed President Viktor Yanukovych to Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort is a potential forgery. Trump has also endorsed conspiracy theories that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee servers and is presently hiding the server in Ukraine. These theories have all been disproven and Manafort was convicted in federal court of receiving illicit payments from Ukraine. On the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked Zelensky to “find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike,” referencing the private firm that investigated the DNC hack. Trump incorrectly claimed that CrowdStrike was funded by Ukrainian oligarchs and that the DNC server was in Ukraine. “The server, they say Ukraine has it,” Trump said. Hill described the theories pushed by committee Republicans as a “fictional narrative” that aims to implicate Ukraine and not Russia as the country that interfered in the 2016 election. She added that these disproven theories Trump floated to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the July 25 call were false. “Our nation is being torn apart,” Hill said. “Truth is questioned. Our highly professional, expert career foreign service is being undermined.” The conspiracy theories endorsed by Trump and committee Republicans are designed to muddy the waters about Russian interference in the 2016 election. Hill said that the Russian government supports these theories and that they have gained traction in some quarters of the U.S. independent of that support. She argued that the goal of Russia’s interference in 2016 and continued disinformation campaigns was to “delegitimize our entire presidency.” “The goal of the Russians was to really put whoever became the president [in 2016] … under a cloud,” Hill said. For Trump, that cloud is allegations that he was involved in the efforts by Russian intelligence to interfere in the election. But had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the target of said interference campaign, won the election, Hill noted, “She too would have had major questions about her legitimacy.” Hill noted that representatives of other countries, including perhaps Ukraine, may have “had harsh words for candidates” in 2016, but these statements did not add up to a concerted campaign to influence the outcome of the election. “I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked us in 2016,” Hill said. “These fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,12
