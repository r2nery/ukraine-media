Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's presidential office, yesterday admitted it was ""impossible"" to say the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was safe after the attack. He added: ""This is one of the most serious threats in Europe today."" Before the takeover, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted: ""Our defenders are giving their lives so the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated. This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe."" In 1986, a reactor at Chernobyl exploded during a routine test - resulting in horrific and deadly injuries for residents and workers alike. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone lies on the shortest path between Russia's and Ukraine's capital, Kyiv The once-bustling town of Pripyat is still eerily deserted - and was a bizarre tourist attraction for travellers intrigued by the disaster, before recent events. The area surrounding the town still records alarming levels of radiation, making it inhabitable and impossible for residents to ever return.

Sign up for a Mirror newsletter here At the time, it was feared that huge clouds of radioactive smoke could cover Europe, causing a further loss of life. Authorities initially tried to hide that something had happened but it became impossible to hide as citizens fell ill with severe headaches, vomiting and hacking coughs. A day after the explosion, buses finally arrived, allowing citizens to escape the deadly nightmare. Dozens of heroic workers tried to put out the flames and make the reactor safe following the explosion. Many sacrificed their own lives to save others, with many working around the clock to dump the sand on the structure and prevent a further loss of life. Across the Soviet Union, coal miners were drafted in to help dig under the core and create a pool of liquid nitrogen to cool the nuclear fuel. Finally, when the flames were contained, a massive concrete structure was erected - it took 206 days to build the first sarcophagus. Workers used 400,000 cubic metres of concrete and 7,300 tonnes of metal framework in its construction. Yaroslav Melnik, a firefighter brought in to help, recalled the incredible effort: “We worked in three shifts, but only for five to seven minutes at a time because of the danger. “After finishing, we'd throw our clothes in the garbage.” Dubbed the 'liquidators', thousands of these workers suffered long-term effects from acute radiation exposure. It was hoped that the structure would contain the deadly radiation leaking from the plant - but experiments showed dangerous levels were still escaping. This required a bigger, more permanent solution - after all, the initial structure was only meant to be temporary. Experts doubted such a feat of engineering would be impossible - as it needed to halt radiation from seeping out and entomb the plant. It had been hoped it would contain the deadly radiation leaking from the nuclear plant -but dangerous levels were still escaping every day. And this huge structure was only designed to be temporary -30 years after the explosion, things had become critical once again. A solution was needed that would prevent the radiation from seeping out at such a rapid rate and keep the reactor entombed for as long as possible. Finally, a group came up with a clever plan to cover the entire sarcophagus, with the reactor still inside it. It was a mammoth task - and needed to be built next to the still radioactive site, and then moved to its final position, without risking workers safety. Projections predicted it would cost more than £240 million. In 1999, Vince Novak, director of nuclear safety at the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, told how difficult it was to preserve the initial sturcture. A closer examination revealed it was so precarious that it could have collapsed at any time, potentially risking another Chernobyl disaster. He said: “The Soviets had lowered the beams into that sarcophagus using helicopters and the whole structure of the roof was in fact built the same way, using helicopters. “Pieces had been dropped in one by one and not tied together. “They were just sitting there and what quickly became apparent was that either these beams were sliding or that the wall was moving. “It came to a point where the further movement of an inch or so would have led to the huge beams falling down. You would have a collapse of the shelter.” Segments were shipped from Italy to Ukraine, before being transported by road - with around 18 ships and 2,5000 trucks used in total. It took more than two years to assemble the structure, which included a ventilation system and remote-controlled robotic cranes to dismantle the existing structure and reactor. Finally, it was erected on 29 November 2016, a mammoth but vital endeavour to make the world safe from the continuing threat of Chernobyl.",0
2022-02-24,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/moment-russian-tanks-roll-chernobyl-26324593,Moment Russian tanks roll into Chernobyl after battle to seize power plant,"These chilling images show the moment heavily armed Russian tanks arrived at the Chernobyl power station, following a fierce firefight between opposing soldiers. Earlier tonight Ukraine ’s government admitted it had lost control of the infamous Soviet-era plant- the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history in 1986. These videos show what Ukrainian ground forces faced as Russian troops were backed by vicious tanks which eventually led to Moscow seizing the plant. Several members of staff are said to have been taken hostage. It is unknown how many casualties there were as a result of the battle. The nuclear reactor is around 80 miles north of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv- believed to be Putin’s ultimate aim at this stage of the invasion. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says it is following the situation in Ukraine ""with grave concern"" and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put Ukraine's nuclear facilities at risk. A Ukrainian official earlier said Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository and an increase in radiation levels was reported. Mykhailo Podoliak, adviser to the head of the president’s office said: ""After a fierce battle, our control over the Chernobyl site has been lost. ""The condition of the facilities of the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant is unknown. This is one of the most serious problems in Europe today. ""It is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe. ""This is one of the most serious threats to Europe today. Knowing the habits of the Russians, they are probably already preparing provocative things at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. ""Either they will use the damage received by the facilities during the attack to blame Ukraine for this, or they will damage these undoubtedly most dangerous facilities themselves."" Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA's general director, said Ukraine has informed the Vienna-based agency ""unidentified armed forces"" have taken control of all facilities at the plant and that there had been no casualties or destruction at the industrial site. Mr Grossi said: “It is of vital importance that the safe and secure operations of the nuclear facilities in that zone should not be affected or disrupted in any way.” It was not immediately possible for experts to access the repository to assess damage before Russian forces overtook the site. The move by Putin led to concerns from some Putin could use the damaged reactor in some way, although there has so far been no evidence of that. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, said: ""I can't imagine how it would be in Russia's interest to allow any facilities at Chernobyl to be damaged."" Ukraine's operational nuclear power plants are running safely and there has been no ""destruction"" at the remaining waste and other facilities at Chernobyl, the U.N. nuclear watchdog says.",0
2022-02-24,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-russian-forces-enter-chernobyl-26320432,Russian forces seize Chernobyl nuclear plant after battle with Ukraine forces,"Russian forces have seized Chernobyl after intense gunfire at the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. Fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the area in the north of the country may have led to damage at the facility, although these reports are yet to be independently verified. Large parts of Chernobyl were closed to the public for decades after a nuclear power reactor melted down there during the Soviet Union's reign in 1986. ""Advisor to Ukrainian interior ministry says Russian forces entered Chernobyl and that fighting there destroyed a nuclear waste storage facility,"" NBC's Richard Engel tweeted this afternoon. This was initially reported, but was later clarified due to a mistranslation. He added shortly after: ""Clarifying: advisor says heaving fighting MAY disturb nuclear waste."" Click here to follor our live blog with the latest updates After a two-hour fight Russian forces were reported to be in control of the facility and have taken hostages. An adviser for the Interior Minister of Ukraine, Anton Gerashchenko said today, according to LBC: ""The invaders from the territory of Belarus have moved into the Chernobyl AES Zone. ""The National Guardsmen, who guard the collectors of unsafe nuclear radioactive waste, are fighting hard. ""If the invaders artillery hits and ruins/damages the collectors of nuclear waste , radioactive nuclear dust can can be spread over the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and the country of the EU!"" The President of Ukraine took to Twitter to say Russian forces are trying to seize the zone. ""Russian occupation forces are trying to seize the #Chornobyl_NPP,"" tweeted Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated. Reported this to @SwedishPM. ""This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe."" It comes after President Vladimir Putin said allies of Ukraine who try to interfere with his attack will ""face consequences greater than any you have faced in history"", in what was a chilling warning. Air sirens have been heard across the city centre, reports the Mirror's Andy Lines from Kyiv, as residents try to flee for safety. Five Ukrainians have also lost their lives after a military plane was shot down. Photos also showed a radar station that Russia had bombed on outskirts on Mariupol. Terrifying footage also showed a number of Russian helicopters swarming towards the Ukrainian capital as they fired missiles at an airport. Western officials believe Russia intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban area but are yet unclear whether that will mean occupying the whole country, for which Russian forces don't yet appear to be ready. The United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday that the situation in Ukraine was quickly deteriorating after Russia's invasion and pleaded with neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking protection. Poland is one country currently preparing hospitals to help Ukrainians who have been injured in the conflict. The nation had prepared a list of 120 hospitals where Ukrainians could be treated. Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine is ""putting up a real fight"" but added some places are proving difficult to defend. ""We are defending our land,"" he said. Earlier, Boris Johnson condemned Russia for unleashing a ""tidal wave of violence"" against Ukraine without provocation or credible excuse. ""It is an attack on democracy and freedom in East Europe and around the world,"" he said in a statement before addressing the country again this evening. ""This crisis is about the right of a free, sovereign independent European people to choose their own future and that is a right that the UK will always defend.""",0
2022-02-26,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-aims-rockets-second-nuclear-26339222,Russia aims rockets at second nuclear plant in Ukraine after capturing Chernobyl,"Russian troops are approaching a second nuclear power plant in Ukraine, after capturing Chernobyl. Ukraine's interior ministry has said the invading troops are approaching Zaporizhzhia. Vadym Denysenko, an adviser in the Ukraine government, said Russian troops have aimed their rockets at the site. Kremlin troops stormed the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on the first day of the invasion. Since then excess gamma radiation levels have been recorded but it is unclear why. The State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine (SINR) said the exact reasons for increasing radiation in the seized city were unknown. But Russian officials have denied the allegations that there has been any increase in levels and said it would deploy paratroopers to guard the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. Norway's nuclear monitoring agency weighed into the argument claiming it is concerned by ""elevated"" levels of radiation, but added that they do not pose a ""threat to health"" in the area at present. The Norwegian Directorate for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety released a statement saying they were in contact with Ukrainian authorities who had raised concerns. In a statement, it said: ""They have raised questions about whether the increased values are due to heavy vehicles that have whirled up radioactive pollution from the Chernobyl incident in 1986."" The area has been largely uninhabited since the devastating explosion of a nuclear reactor in the town of Pripyat in April 1986 which left toxic levels of radiation across the land. But the Ukrainian SINR claims that data from the automated radiation monitoring system of the exclusion zone, shows excessive levels of gamma radiation at a number of observation points. A spokesman for Russia's defence ministry refuted these claims, adding that troops were being deployed to stand guard of the closed power plant. ""Radiation levels at the plant are normal"" he told a briefing on Friday.",0
2022-03-03,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-fire-nuclear-power-plant-26382475,Fire at huge nuclear power plant in Ukraine after attack by Russian troops,"A blaze that erupted at Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been extinguished after the Russian army shelled it from all sides. This morning, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said there was no release of radioactive material at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant during the fire. He added that two security personnel were injured. Mr Grossi said that both Zaporizhzhia and the now-closed Chernobyl were under the effective control of the Russian military. He confirmed that at the moment Zaporizhzhia was still being run by Ukrainian staff. Earlier, reports said that firefighters were being prevented from extinguishing it as Russian troops bombarded the important energy-producing city of Energodar in the south of Ukraine with shells on Friday. Mr Grossi said the IAEA has been in contact with the Ukrainian nuclear regulator and the Zaporizhzhia plant and says the situation ""continues to be extremely tense and challenging"". A generating unit at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was hit during an attack by Russian troops and part of the station was on fire, RIA news agency citing the Ukrainian atomic energy ministry said. ""Firefighters can't start extinguishing the fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - they are being fired on at point-blank range. There is already a hit on the first power unit,"" the agency quoted the ministry as saying. The Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba confirmed the blaze on Twitter and said an explosion at the nuclear plant could be 10 times worse than the Chernobyl disaster. ""Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,"" Kuleba's tweet said. ""Fire has already broke out. If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!"" There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine and six of them are at the Zaporizhzhia power plant. It is feared that if one of the reactors is set on fire then it could lead to a disaster in Europe worse than that at Chernobyl. Local mayor Dmytro Orlov had earlier reported fierce fighting between Ukrainians and Russian troops near the plant in southeastern Ukraine. ""As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,"" Orlov said on his Telegram channel, citing what he called a threat to world security. He added that there had been casualties without giving details in the fighting between local forces and the Russian troops. The Russian military laid siege to Energodar, a city on the Dnieper River that accounts for about one-quarter of Ukraine’s power generation. Russian troops have been fighting for control of Energodar on Wednesday with tanks, a Ukrainian official earlier said. Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said in online posts that the forces had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant. The fire was later said to have happened in a training facility outside the plant's perimeter and the potentially devastating attack sparked condemnation from world leaders. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the reactors ""are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down"". Granholm said on Twitter she had spoken with Ukraine's energy minister about the situation at the plant and added: ""We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility."" It comes as Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, some 100 km north of Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Kremlin troops stormed the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on the first day of the invasion. Thousands are thought to have died or been wounded as the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two unfolds, creating one million refugees, hits to Russia's economy, and fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades. The incursion is entering its ninth day. A member of Ukraine's parliament has said the country's government is collating examples of alleged war crimes by Russian forces, after the International Criminal Court's (ICC) prosecutor announced it had launched an investigation into the situation. Vadym Ivchenko said video footage and other evidence was being gathered by officials. The ICC announced its investigation amid reports of the use by Russian troops of cluster bombs, with a nursery school and a hospital both reportedly hit. ""We are gathering all the information, all the videos,"" Mr Ivchenko said. Mr Ivchenko also called for a humanitarian corridor to be established, saying that aid is not reaching some areas. He said Sumy, a city in Ukraine's northeast, is ""now without a supply of water and supply of food...(people are) just afraid to go there with any humanitarian aid"". He added that Russian troops have surrounded the city, saying: ""Imagine what the people in Sumy feel...it's a humanitarian catastrophe, and it's not only one city. ""The humanitarian equation should be negotiated in the mediation of the United Nations or countries like the United States or the United Kingdom.""",0

Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said in online posts today that the forces had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, after entering in tanks. Earlier, Mr Herashchenko said Russian troops were stepping up efforts to seize control of the power plant. The plant's workers live in the nearby town of Energodar. It comes as Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, some 100 km north of Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Kremlin troops stormed the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on the first day of the invasion. Fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the area in the north of the country may have led to damage at the facility, although these reports are yet to be independently verified. Earlier this afternoon, crowds of brave Ukrainians formed a human barricade in front of Zaporizhzhia, lining the road leading to the plant in a bid to prevent Russian troops from seizing it. The move of defiance came after Kyiv warned Russia risked creating “a new Chernobyl” if it went ahead with an attack. And this morning the UN nuclear watchdog voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Zaporizhzhia, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. According to Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant - which housed six of the country’s 15 reactors. Anton Gerashchenko, the interior ministry official, said in a Facebook post: “Russian generals – change your minds! Do not create conditions for the new Chernobyl! ""Radiation knows no nationalities, one does not spare anyone! Go around the Energodar and Zaporizhzhya.” Ukraine had requested that the IAEA declare a 30km safe zone around Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants. News of gunfire in the worrying new battleground comes as Vladimir Putin has today claimed Ukraine is using civilians and foreigners as ""human shields"" - while his forces bomb densely-populated areas. The outrageous claim came during a day of continued attacks on cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv, which have suffered intense damage. Attempts to seize both cities have failed so Kremlin forces have instead resorted to heavy bombing, causing thousands of civilian casualties. The city of Kherson has been taken by Russian troops but elsewhere the invaders have met with fierce Ukraine resistance. Negotiations began between the Russian and Ukrainian sides at about 3pm GMT, with a humanitarian corridor to evacuate citizens agreed by 5.30pm. Earlier today an airstrike on an apartment block in Chernihiv killed 22 civilians.",0
2022-03-04,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-wants-another-chernobyl-26384172,Vladimir Putin 'wants another Chernobyl disaster' after nuclear plant attack,"Vladimir Putin has been accused of wanting “another Chernobyl”-sized disaster after his thugs attacked Europe’s largest nuclear power station. A building near radioactive material was set ablaze earlier this morning as Russian soldiers opened fire on the Zaporizhzhia plant in the south east of Ukraine. Despite continuous gunfire, firefighters were able to put out the flames before irreversible damage was done to the control towers - but the plant has fallen into Russian hands. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian counterpart Putin of wanting another Chernobyl-like disaster, when an explosion at the infamous plant petered Europe with radiation. He said in a television address: “Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible? After all we fought together in 1986 against the Chernobyl catastrophe. “You have to... take to the streets and say that you want to live, you want to live on earth without radioactive contamination. Follow all the updates on the war on our liveblog “Radiation does not know where Russia is, radiation does not know where the borders of your country are. “You have to remember the burning graphite scattered by the explosion, the victims. “You have to remember the glow over the destroyed power unit, the evacuation. How can you forget that? If you have not forgotten, you should not be silent. ""No country other than Russia has ever fired on nuclear power units. “This is the first time in our history. In the history of mankind. The terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror.” The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a tweet Ukrainian authorities had informed the agency the fire at Zaporizhzhia had not affected ""essential"" equipment. Russia's Ministry of Defence blamed the attack at the power plant on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a ""monstrous provocation"". They claimed the area had been under Russian control since February 28 and fighters were attempting to take it back, sparking the serious blaze. Speaking of the attack, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant. ""The Prime Minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. ""The Prime Minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN Security Council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. ""Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial."" The fire at the Zaporizhzhia facility has raised ""a very real concern"" about the potential for disaster, says Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington D.C. He added: “For example, the prospect of a widespread fire, although that appears not to be the case, could disable the plant's electrical systems and lead to an event very much like Fukushima if cooling is not restored in time.”",0
2022-03-04,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/nuclear-radiation-capable-travelling-far-26384245,Nuclear radiation and its impact on surroundings as Russia takes power plant,"As the conflict in Ukraine has continued to escalate, Vladimir Putin made an order to the Russian military on Sunday, which has been widely interpreted as a reference to nuclear weapons. According to Pavel Podvig, an expert on Russian nuclear forces, Putin's order to ""transfer the deterrence forces"" to a special mode of combat duty likely means ""the nuclear command and control system received what is known as a preliminary command"". Fears were further ramped up on Thursday night with Russian shells igniting a fire on the Zaporizhzhia power plant site - but this was brought under control and the UN atomic watchdog has confirmed no radioactive material was released during the blaze. While nuclear warfare looks unlikely over this conflict, here's what you need to know about nuclear missiles - including how far the radiation from an explosion is likely to travel. A big nuclear weapon has the power to wipe out an entire city. When detonated, nuclear bombs produced a flash of light and large fireball which can vaporise everything caught in it. The power of the blast carries all items around it - including soil and water - upwards, creating a mushroom cloud of smoke. Radioactive materials in the bomb mix with the mushroom cloud to form dust particles, which then fall back to earth and are referred to as 'fallout'. This fallout can be carried by the wind, reaching hundreds of miles away from the initial explosion and contaminating anything it lands on. Fallout can circulate around the world for years until it gradually falls back down to Earth, and can land hundreds of miles away from ground zero, which is the point directly above or below the detonation of a nuclear bomb. How far the effects of a nuclear bomb explosion travels depends on the size of the bomb and its blast yield. Currently, the blast yield of the most powerful nuclear bomb has been recorded as 1,200 kilotons, meaning the spread and the impact would be severe. While the immediate blast would destroy everything within a kilometre in all directions. Those up to eight kilometres outside of it could suffer third-degree burns, and those up to 11 kilometres away may experience second- and first-degree burns. Anyone up to 85 kilometres away could experience temporary blindness or severe burns to the retina if looking directly at the blast. Besides the heat from the blast, another thing to deal with would be the high levels of radiation due to the nuclear fallout, which can damage the body’s cells and lead to severe and long-term illness - and eventually death. The radioactive particles from nuclear weapons can travel very far and last for a very long time. A recent study even found remnants of radioactive carbon from Cold War nuclear bomb tests in the deepest point of the world's oceans. Experts have widely described the event of nuclear war as very unlikely, due to the mass costs for all involved. Meanwhile, Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has also said both Ukraine and Russia are considering an offer of meeting at Chernobyl. He added that he is not concerned about radiation at Chernobyl.",0
2022-03-04,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-fire-everything-26384230,Everything you need to know about nuclear plant fire as Russians shell facility,"A fire erupted in the early hours of the morning at Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine as Russian troops shelled it from all sides. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southeast Ukraine has reportedly been seized by Russian military forces after a fierce battle overnight. It has sparked fears that if it explodes it would be ""ten times worse than Chernobyl "". However, experts have assured that there was no release of radioactive material. Ukrainian authorities later confirmed that Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. ""Operational personnel are monitoring the condition of power units,"" a local authority said on social media, quoted by Reuters news agency. For all the live updates from the Russian invasion follow our liveblog Station personnel continue to work and monitor the state of the power units, it said. This morning's attack marks a severe escalation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We've answered the pressing questions you may have. Ukrainian authorities said a fire broke out in a training building outside the plant in the early hours of March 4 after Russian forces shelled from all sides. The alarm was raised by an employee of the plant, who shared it on Telegram, saying there was ""a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest power plant in Europe"". By 2.30am local time, Ukraine's foreign minister confirmed the reports and tweeted that the Russian army was ""firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out.” Shortly after, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service reported that radiation at the plant was “within normal limits” and the fire conditions at the plant were “normal”. It added the fire was in a building outside the power plant. By 2.26am, they reported the third power unit at the plant was disconnected, leaving just one of the four units operating. The fire has since been extinguished. Ukrainian authorities this morning that the facility was secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed”. Earlier, the International Atomic Energy Agency said the Ukraine regulator confirmed there was “no change reported in radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant site”. This morning, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi says there was no release of radioactive material at the nuclear power plant during the fire. He added that two security personnel were injured. Ukraine is heavily dependent on nuclear energy and it has 15 reactors at four different plants generating about 54 per cent of the country's electricity, according to the World Nuclear Association. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station generates around 20 per cent of all electricity in Ukraine. Andrew Wilson, Professor of Ukrainian Studies at University College London, told the Mirror this attack could be an attempt to cut off the population from their services. Prof Wilson said: ""This is one of many nuclear power plants in Ukraine in the of the Russian advance. ""They are not making much progress from the East and their current strategy appears to be to surround main cities and cut off basic services. ""This is Russia's Modus Operandi they target the civilian population to make them suffer and make them lose faith in their democratic leaders because they are no longer getting basic services. ""Russia's hope is that Ukraine will surrender which I don't think it will. ""So whether the shelling was part of the strategy - one hopes not and that it was a rogue local unit because these things are built for many things like earthquakes but they are not built for missiles or shelling."" ""An optimistic reading is that this is a brutal strategy to cut the population off from basic services rather than blow the whole place up. ""The fact that Ukraine is a neighbour of Russia should be a deterrent because if the wind blows in the wrong direction it will hit them too."" Other experts have said that attacking a nuclear plant was unprecedented. Dr Graham Allison, a nuclear security expert at Harvard University, told the BBC the ""worst case"" would be if a fire at the plant caused a meltdown and caused a release of radioactivity that contaminated the surrounding area for years. He also said it was more likely Russian forces were trying to ""close down the supply of electricity to the surrounding area"", rather than attack the plant. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and the ninth-largest in the world. It was built between 1984 and 1995 and has six reactors. It has six reactors, each generating 950MW, and a total output of 5,700MW, enough energy for roughly four million homes. In normal times it produces one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity and almost half the energy generated by the country’s nuclear power facilities. It is about 200km from the contested Donbas region and 550km south-east of Kyiv. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that everyone in Europe needs to be worried about the threat from Putin and a nuclear disaster. In his message to the West he said: ""For the first time in our history, the history of mankind, the terrorist state has resorted to nuclear terror. ""Russian protagonists have threatened to cover the world with nuclear ashes, now it is not a threat, now it is a reality. We must stop the Russian military immediately. ""If there is an explosion, it is the end of everything, the end of Europe. It is the evacuation of Europe. Only immediate European action can stop Russian troops. Prevent the death of Europe from the nuclear disaster."" Zelensky said that an explosion at the plant would be a catastrophe and much worse than that which happened at Chernobyl. ""It is a global catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of people fought with its consequences, tens of thousands of people were evacuated,"" the president said of the Russian invasion. He said: "" Russia wants to do it again and is doing it again, six times more. Europeans, wake up, please. ""Tell your politicians Russian troops are shelling the nuclear power plant in Ukraine, Zaporizhzhya NPP, in Energodar. There are six power units, six! One power unit exploded in Chernobyl."" Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with Zelensky after news broke about the fire at Zaporizhzhia. A Downing Street spokeswoman called the situation “gravely concerning”, adding: “Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant. “The Prime Minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. “The Prime Minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN Security Council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. “Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.”",0

But what could have happened, and is there a danger of a nuclear disaster? Here, atomic energy specialist Professor Robin Grimes, who previously advised the UK’s Ministry of Defence, and former nuclear scientist Cheryl Rofer, who worked for the US government’s Los Alamos National Laboratory, and spent 35 years clearing up nuclear sites in the former Soviet Union, answer your questions. Four, as well as the now-retired Chernobyl : Zaporizhzhia; Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant in Netishyn and Rivne Nuclear Power Plant in Varash, both west Ukraine; and the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant in Yuzhnoukrainsk, south Ukraine. They need that many because that’s how 51% of its power is generated. They are third most nuclear dependent nation, after France (70%) and Slovakia (53%). Zaporizhzhia has six light water reactors. The other three have nine between them. Chernobyl had four. Ms Rofer says: “The reactors all have outer concrete containment structures that can sustain a hit from a 20-tonne airplane. There is no way to cause a nuclear explosion - like a nuclear bomb - with reactors.” Ms Rofer says: “The worst would be a fire in the spent fuel storage pools. This would release radioactive material into the atmosphere. The effects would be mostly local, within tens of miles. Some material might be carried on the winds, which, in that part of the world, are usually toward Russia.” Prof Grimes says: “Claims it would be many times greater than Chernobyl are ridiculous. Zaporizhzhia has about the same amount of nuclear material as Chernobyl did.” Ms Rofer says: “I think all the reactors but one at Zaporizhzhia have been shut down but they still require cooling water. Shut down reactors are slightly less dangerous, but leaks and fires are still possible.” Prof Grimes adds: “The way to be safe is to put all reactors into ‘cold shutdown’ [when a coolant is added to keep it below 93C]. Then you can walk away for months.”",0
2022-03-04,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-shelling-russia-nuclear-plant-26301088,Shelling in war explained as Russian shells set fire to nuclear power plant site,"The Russian shelling of Ukraine has continued in cities with news last night that a nuclear power plant was targeted by invading troops. A fire broke out at the site of Zaporizhzhia power plant in Energodar, southern Ukraine. The plant is the largest of its kind in Europe and any potential explosion there has been described as being worse than ""ten times worse than Chernobyl"". However, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service later reported the fire was in a building outside the plant and has since been extinguished. When war broke out, Russian forces were expected to sweep through Ukraine far quicker than they have done. Instead, their advance of the capital of Kyiv is 'slowing' - according to recent reports - and they have also failed to take Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, only around 20 miles from the Russian border. With this occurring, there appears to have been a trend in which Russian forces are attempting to break resistance by increasing their shelling on key parts of Ukraine, leading to civilians being indiscriminately attacked. The tactic has been widely used by Russian forces, so what is shelling? Shelling is a tactic in warfare that involves firing large ‘shells’ full of explosives at your enemies. The definitions surrounding the words point to exactly that. Shelling is defined by the Oxford Learners’ Dictionary as “the firing of shells from large guns”, while a shell is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as “a container, usually with a pointed end, that is filled with explosives and shot from a large gun”. In other words, shelling is also often known as artillery fire, big guns launching huge projectiles at enemy positions from far away. Reports of the continued shelling on Ukrainian cities suggest that Russia is launching bombs indiscriminately, rather than just targeting military positions. As a result, Ukraine's State Emergency Service has said more than 2,000 civilians have died since war broke out. This has not been verified and the UN human rights office said it had recorded 227 deaths, with 525 injured. The tactic can be particularly brutal and indiscriminate because, with the shot fired often from a large distance and packed with high explosives, they can easily hit people and things they weren’t intended for. Kyiv and Kharkiv have seen particularly intense shelling, as have the cities of Mariupol and Chernihiv. Despite ensuring casualties would be avoided, Vladimir Putin's armed forces have resorted to the devastating shelling of Ukrainian cities, driving an estimated one million people across the border in neighbouring Poland, Romania, Hungary and Moldova. The shelling of Kharkiv has led to much of the cities landmarks being targeted, including the opera house, Freedom Square, university and city hall. The International Criminal Court has launched an investigation into Putin's shelling of Ukraine, including the alleged use of banned cluster bombs. A video verified by Reuters showed that the surroundings of the Zaporizhzhia power plant were also bombed by a 'volley of shells' as the mayor of nearby town Energodar saw ""continuous enemy shelling"". Zaporizhzhia is key to the energy supply of surrounding towns, and while there are no indications that the plant's functions have been affected - no reports of an increase in radiation have emerged - Russian control of the plant is ideal for the invaders. Outrage and condemnation of the attack were seen across the globe, as people feared another nuclear disaster should the plant be heavily damaged. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the assault on the plant, which is now under Russian control, as 'reckless'. The University of Sydney's School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, David Fletcher, said in a statement: ""The real concern is not a catastrophic explosion as happened at Chernobyl but damage to the cooling system which is required even when the reactor is shut down."" Ukrainian authorities have since said ""nuclear safety is now guaranteed"".",0
2022-03-04,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/putin-raining-down-nuclear-terror-26382647,"Putin is raining down first ever 'nuclear terror', says Ukraine president","The Ukraine president has said that the world needs to stand up to the ""nuclear terror"" from Vladimir Putin and stop the Russian army’s invasion. The stark danger of fighting to take over strategic nuclear power plants was clear when a fire broke out at the largest facility in Europe and claims that an explosion would lead to a catastrophe “10 times worse than Chernobyl ”. Fierce fighting has been taking place at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Friday morning and there were claims from the Ukrainian authorities that firefighters were unable to put out a fire as they were being shot at. Now Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that everyone in Europe needs to be worried about the threat from Putin and a nuclear disaster. In his latest message to the West he said: ""For the first time in our history, the history of mankind, the terrorist state has resorted to nuclear terror. ""Russian protagonists have threatened to cover the world with nuclear ashes, now it is not a threat, now it is a reality. We must stop the Russian military immediately. ""If there is an explosion, it is the end of everything, the end of Europe. It is the evacuation of Europe. Only immediate European action can stop Russian troops. Prevent the death of Europe from the nuclear disaster."" Zelenksy said that an explosion at the plant would be a catastrophe and much worse than that which happened at Chernobyl. ""It is a global catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of people fought with its consequences, tens of thousands of people were evacuated,"" the president said of the Russian invasion. He warned that the Russians are continuing to attack the nuclear plant. He said: "" Russia wants to do it again and is doing it again, six times more. Europeans, wake up, please. ""Tell your politicians Russian troops are shelling the nuclear power plant in Ukraine, Zaporizhzhya NPP, in Energodar. There are six power units, six! One power unit exploded in Chernobyl."" Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with Zelensky after news broke about the fire at Zaporizhzhia. A Downing Street spokeswoman called the situation “gravely concerning”, adding: “Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant. “The Prime Minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. “The Prime Minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN Security Council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. “Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.” A video feed from the plant southeast of the capital Kyiv appeared to show smoke and flames coming from an unidentified building. There has been fierce fighting in the area about 342 miles southeast of Kyiv, the mayor of the nearby town of Energodar said in an online post. He said there had been casualties, without giving details. ""As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,"" Mayor Dmytro Orlov said on his Telegram channel. Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, some 100 km north of Kyiv, which spewed radioactive waste over much of Europe when it melted down in the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986. ""Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. ""Fire has already broke out ... Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!"" Zaporizhzhia provides more than a fifth of the total electricity generated in Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a tweet that it was ""aware of reports of shelling"" at the power plant and was in contact with Ukrainian authorities about situation. As the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two enters its ninth day, thousands are thought to have died or been wounded, one million refugees have fled Ukraine and Russia's economy has been rocked by international sanctions. The United States and UK announced sanctions on more Russian oligarchs on Thursday, following on from EU measures, as they ratcheted up the pressure on the Kremlin. Sanctions have ""had a profound impact already,"" US President Joe Biden said. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that is not designed to occupy territory but to topple the democratically elected government, destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. It denies targeting civilians.",0

Forces fired unguided rockets at the US-funded $70million Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, which houses a reactor for research purposes, Emine Dzheppar, Ukraine's deputy minister for foreign affairs, said today. The reactor is not as big as those found at power plants but if damaged would still pose a danger. Ms Dzheppar said: ""The Russian aggressor fired hail at the Institute's territory, where the Neutron Source nuclear facility is located, with 37 nuclear fuel cells loaded into its core. ""Destruction of a nuclear installation and storage facilities for nuclear materials can lead to a large-scale environmental catastrophe."" For all the latest updates from Ukraine follow our dedicated Russia-Ukraine war liveblog Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine near the Russian border, has been destroyed during a days-long siege. It comes just days after Putin's forces bombarded Europe's second largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, which houses six of the country's 15 reactors. Their actions started a fire, with Russian troops taking control of the facility. After the attack, authorities released footage from inside the control room which shows an announcer pleading with Russian soldiers to stop. ""Stop shooting at a nuclear dangerous facility. Stop shooting immediately! You threaten the security of the whole world!"" they can be heard shouting. ""The work of the vital organs of the Zaporizhzhia station may be disrupted. It will be impossible for us to restore it. ""You are endangering the security of the entire world. Attention! Stop shooting at a nuclear hazardous facility. Stop shooting at a nuclear hazardous facility! Stop shooting at a nuclear hazardous facility! Attention! Stop it!"" In addition to Kharkiv and Zapoizhzhia Russian troops are 20 miles from the country's second largest nuclear plant. While the reactors are well protected damage to the cooling infrastructure could result in significant radiation discharge. Last week, intense fighting Russia seized Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst ever nuclear disaster. The 1986 meltdown saw the plant encased in a giant concrete and steel sarcophagus. Monitoring has not recorded any increase in radiation on day 11 of the invasion. The west watched Russia's reckless actions in horror. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky's chief advisor Michael Podolyak said Putin was ""blackmailing the world"". UN ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: ""Russian forces are now 20 miles, and closing, from Ukraine’s second-largest nuclear facility. ""This imminent danger continues. ""Nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict. Mr Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now."" Across the course of the invasion Ukrainians say they have killed 11,000 Russian troops, downed dozens of aircraft and blow up hundreds of tanks and vehicles. Ukraine says it has lost scores of soldiers but 2,000 civilians, with 1.5 million refugees fleeing. But there is uncertainty over the numbers of soldiers killed, with Moscow claiming their death toll was far less while Ukraine's was far higher – claiming 3,000 Ukrainian troops had died.",0

Russian forces seized Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Friday and have now placed staff running the facility under their command, according to the U.N. nuclear watchdog. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was ""extremely concerned"" about developments at Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Officials are struggling to contact the hostages after Russian forces blocked vital channels of communication. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog ""Ukraine reports that any action of plant management - including measures related to the technical operation of the six reactor units - requires prior approval by the Russian commander,"" the IAEA said in a statement. ""In a second serious development, Ukraine has reported that the Russian forces at the site have switched off some mobile networks and the internet so that reliable information from the site cannot be obtained through the normal channels of communication,"" it added. Russian forces also seized the spent-fuel and radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl, next to the now defunct power plant on February 24. More than 200 people at the site, including technical staff and guards, have not left since the day before the invasion. The UN agency has called for technical staff to be rotated out on safety grounds but the Ukrainian regulator is ""facing problems communicating with personnel"" at Chernobyl, said the IAEA, adding that communication was only possible via email. Workers at Chernobyl are said to be ""starving, exhausted and depressed"" as they survive on just one meal of porridge a day and two hours sleep, reports the Daily Mail. A source told the publication: ""'With nowhere to sleep and no blankets, many are only sleeping for two to four hours on desks or wherever they can find a space. ""They are running out of food and are down to one meal of porridge a day. They are fed once every 24 hours, if there is enough they might get extra bread."" The site is usually run by a staff of 500 people with the hostages forced to work round-the-clock to keep the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster safe. Ukrainian authorities said Russian forces had seized control of Zaporizhzhia - which houses six reactors - on Friday after setting the neighbouring training facility on fire. Russia's defence ministry blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a ""monstrous provocation"". The fire was put out and there was no damage to reactors or release of radioactive material but the incident raised concerns about the potentially catastrophic consequences should the conflict damage one of the country's four operating nuclear power plants.

Chernobyl is now raising concern again, some 36 years later, as reports claim invading Russian forces have completely disconnected the nuclear power plant from the grid. The plant has been captured by the advancing Russian army, the national nuclear energy provider Ukrenergo said. New claims from Ukraine state that Vladimir Putin is planning a terror attack on the nuclear power plant. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said: ""According to the available information - Vladimir Putin ordered the preparation of a terrorist attack at the Chernobyl nuclear station."" Ukrenergo previously said: ""Because of the military actions of the Russian occupiers, the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl was fully disconnected from the power grid,"" the provider said. ""The nuclear station has no power supply. The military actions are in progress, so there is no possibility to restore the lines. Slavutich city is also out of power supply."" This has sparked fears about the safety of the site, which was home to the worst nuclear power-related disaster in history and claimed the lives of over 30 people. Here's everything you need to know about Chernobyl. On Friday, March 11, Ukraine raised the alarm that Vladimir Putin was planning a terror attack on the plant, with the country's Ministry of Defence saying Russia plans a 'technological catastrophe'. If no such attack takes place, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said enough water should be in the spent fuel pools to sufficiently cool down the reactor’s rods and prevent an accident. Therefore, the Chernobyl power plant is currently deemed to be safe. On the agency's website it said: “Due to time elapsed since the 1986 Chornobyl accident, the heat load of the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water contained in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply.” Concerns have been raised by Ukraine's national energy organisation, Energoatom, who have sounded the alarm that materials will be unable to be cooled without power and this could cause the release of radioactive substances. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Ukrainian authorities had no information on the radiation levels in the area and that no information had been gathered since the facility had been captured by Russian troops, of which there are believed to be around 400. The UN’s nuclear watchdog has reported that monitoring systems are no longer coming from the plant, with the workers there have been unable to leave for two weeks. Ukrainian officials are thought to be increasingly worried about the safety of the 210 workers who were at the site, who have had to live at the facility since February 24. Chernobyl lies towards the north of Ukraine, close to the Belarussian border, in the northern Kyiv Oblast. It is a 95-mile or roughly 3-hour drive north of the capital, Kyiv, a little inland from the banks of the Pripyat River. Immediately to the northwest of the plant is the town of Pripyat, one of the hardest hit by the 1986 disaster and the scene of a mass evacuation. Due to the plant’s northerly location inside Ukraine, it was one of the first major landmarks Russian troops advancing from Belarus reached. It is around 450 miles from Warsaw, Poland, and a little under 900 miles from London.",0

The U.N’s nuclear watchdog the IAEA said it had lost touch with the Zaporizhzhia site, in the south east of the country. Russian forces stormed the nuclear plant on March 4, with fierce fighting broke out at the site as tanks blasted buildings and a fire broke out near radioactive material. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi has said the body was concerned about the sudden interruption of such data flows to the IAEA’s Vienna headquarters from the two sites.

The status of the equipment that had stopped transmitting was ""uncertain"", it said. The agency said Zaporizhzhia's operator had informed it that two of its four external high-voltage power lines had been damaged so only two were now available. It only needs one, and there is a fifth on standby, plus backup diesel generators. One unit's transformer was also undergoing emergency repair after damage to its cooling system was discovered ""following the events"" of March 4, the date of the fire and clashes, it added. ""These recent developments added to the IAEA's growing concerns about the safety, security and safeguards impact of the conflict in Ukraine on the country's nuclear facilities,"" the IAEA said. Grossi has called for a trilateral meeting with Ukraine and Russia to ensure the safety of Ukraine's nuclear facilities. He said on Wednesday he would travel to the Turkish city of Antalya on Thursday, where the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers are due to meet. Earlier on Wednesday Ukraine said power to Chernobyl had been cut but the IAEA said the spent fuel there could still be cooled safely.",0

The Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine believes the Russian despot is planning a 'technological catastrophe' at the power station. Intel chiefs warned that the disaster will be blamed on the Ukrainians and said Putin is prepared to commit 'nuclear blackmail' on the world if his invasion fails. The Intelligence Directorate wrote on Facebook: ""According to the available information - Vladimir Putin ordered the preparation of a terrorist attack at the Chernobyl nuclear station. ""The creation of a technological catastrophe is planned at the controlled Russian forces of the CAEC (Chernobyl), the responsibility for which the occupiers will try to translate to Ukraine. ""At the moment, the CAEC is completely disconnected from the monitoring systems of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAGATE). The station has been disrupted. The resource of existing diesel generators is calculated for 48 hours of security systems to support. ""Occupiers refused to give access to the station Ukrainian repairman. Instead, there, according to the instruction of Alexander Lukashenko, ""Belarusian specialists"" came in. Among them, under the guise of atomic (experts) also enter Russian dissidents to organise a terrorist attack."" Ukraine's intel chiefs added: ""Without getting the desired result from the ground military operation and direct negotiations, Putin is ready to commit to the nuclear blackmail of the world community for the sake of actions to support Ukraine."" It comes after the Ukrainian nuclear regulator said Russia had committed an ""act of nuclear terrorism"" in bombing a research facility containing a reactor. The State Nuclear Inspectorate of Ukraine said the reactor core at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology in the city of Kharkiv had been loaded with fresh nuclear fuel just prior to the start of Russian aggression. Russian forces carried out an airstrike on the science research centre in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, sparking fears of radiation exposure, according to reports. In a statement, the nuclear watchdog said they were still assessing the damage to the site, adding: ""This list of injuries is not complete at this time.""

BBC correspondent Quentin Sommerville walked among a dozen corpses at a petrol station forecourt on the frontline near Kharkiv. Ukrainian troops said they were 'fighting like lions' as showed Mr Sommerville some of the dead soldiers lying dead in the snow. It comes as Ukraine continues to slow the Russian advance, with reports of plunging morale among the Kremlin's troops. In the BBC's latest report from the frontline, one Ukrainian soldier said: ""The Russians are fighting like soldiers of 1941. ""They are attacking just like in front, they don't do any manoeuvres.

A 21-year-old Ukrainian soldier told the BBC that the Russians were just 900 metres away from them on the frontline. Meanwhile, a civilian who almost reached Ukrainian lines was seen lying dead in the middle of the road. The BBC report also showed a huge explosion in Kharkiv and the devastation caused to the city. Mr Sommerville managed to enter the besieged city and footage showed buildings that were gutted by Russian shelling, with debris left outside. A huge plume of black smoke poured into the sky behind the BBC correspondent as he walked through the city's shattered streets. In one of Kharkiv's hospitals, one injured woman recited a patriotic poem from her bed. She said: ""These stupid Russian shrapnel pieces I will carry all my life but as long as my heart still beats I will still live and love. ""Defenders we will ride together, we will win this war and all our heroic people will gather to rebuild our beloved Ukraine."" An eight-year-old boy injured by shelling was recovering in the hospital after surgeons removed a fragment from his skull. It comes as Russia's defence ministry said it would declare a ceasefire today and open humanitarian corridors from Kharkiv, as well as Mariupol, Kyiv, Sumy and Chernihiv. However, previous ceasefires have failed with Ukraine claiming Russian shelling prevented evacuations. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian nuclear regulator said Russia had committed an ""act of nuclear terrorism"" by bombing a Kharkiv research facility which contained a reactor.

The mayor of a town housing workers at the plant, Yuri Fomichev, warned of a 'complete catastrophe' as food and fuel supplies run out - including emergency generators for back up control of the plant's safety systems, reports said. Russia has held the site since the first days of the invasion. The mayor of Slavutych said the town faces 'humanitarian catastrophe' as the mental stresses staff are under while reportedly held at gunpoint to maintain operations posing the risk of 'a new accident'.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The official in charge of a 19-mile Exclusion Zone around Chernobyl echoed that staff were 'on the edge of their human capabilities due to physical and emotional exhaustion,' Ian Birrell writing for the Daily Mail said. Staff were said to be working around the clock, with the mayor warning of their tiredness, both physically and psychologically. He said they were losing concentration, which is 'very dangerous for the nuclear power plant'. At the disabled Chernobyl nuclear reactor, power had been restored after damage forced the plant to rely on electricity from diesel generators, Ukraine 24 reported on Tuesday. On Monday, state-owned grid operator Ukrenergo said the Chernobyl plant was relying on electricity from diesel generators after its external power supply had again been damaged. The nearby town of Slavutych was completely without power for the same reason, Ukrenergo chief Volodymyr Kudrytskiy said on national television. Russia's control of radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl is limiting the flow of information out of them such that Ukraine cannot fully answer all the International Atomic Energy Agency's questions, the Ukrainian nuclear regulator has told the IAEA. ""The regulator said for the first time today that information it received regarding Chornobyl was 'controlled by the Russian military forces' and therefore it could not 'always provide detailed answers to all' of the IAEA's questions,"" the IAEA said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that was also the case at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.",0

Putin’s thugs took the site, the scene of the worst nuclear disaster in history, by force in the first days of the war as tanks were filmed rolling up to its generator. Now the State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management says the occupiers have damaged the Central Analytical Laboratory which processed radioactive waste. It claims the £6 million lab also contained valuable equipment not found anywhere else in Europe. It comes as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned Russia the war in Ukraine is ""unwinnable"". The agency said in a Facebook post: “Russian occupiers robbed and destroyed the November Central Analytical Laboratory in m. Chernobyl, which is a unique complex with powerful analytical capabilities, can provide services at any stage of RAV handling, from air conditioning to burial, as well as at the research and development stage of technology. “Thanks to the EU Instrument for co-operation in the field of nuclear security (ISB) together with the Ukrainian partner DAZV in 2015, a project aimed at improving radioactive waste management infrastructure was successfully implemented. “Almost 100 units of the most modern valuable analytical equipment, similar to none in Europe. “The laboratory was based on highly active samples and samples of radionuclides, which are in the hands of the enemy today, hoping it will harm himself, not the civilised world.” It added the lab was used for the provision of analytical services for state nuclear and radiation safety and conducting tests on samples of waste from the Chernobyl exclusion zone, among others. The Russians who captured the site last month kept workers there for weeks before allowing some to be released. It remains a huge concern to Ukraine’s leaders as earlier this week a number of nearby forest fires were picked up in satellite images. Earlier this month Russian forces disconnected Chernobyl nuclear power plant from the national grid. National nuclear energy company Ukrenergo said the plant was in total blackout with no power supply. The lack of power at Chernobyl risks sending radioactive substances into the air. Ukrenergo added: ""Because of the military actions of the Russian occupiers, the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl was fully disconnected from the power grid. ""The nuclear station has no power supply. ""The military actions are in progress, so there is no possibility to restore the lines. Slavutich city is also out of power supply."" Russian troops are also in control of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest site in Europe.",0

Three weeks after the invading force drove Ukrainian soldiers out of the nuclear power plant in a explosive battle which shocked and alarmed the world, they destroyed and plundered a laboratory. According to the Ukrainian state agency responsible for the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the Central Analytical Laboratory had been “looted” by Russian troops. It contained “highly active samples and samples of radionuclides that are now in the hands of the enemy”, the state agency said. Radionuclides are unstable atoms of chemical elements that release radiation, causing organ damage and radiation poisoning. The organisation claimed the £6 million lab also contained valuable equipment not found anywhere else in Europe. The situation at Chernobyl is one of the many concerning elements of the war in Ukraine, beyond the terrible loss of human life. In capturing the plant, which was decommissioned following the 1986 disaster, Russia has shaken the post-Cold War global security consensus, imperilled the world supply of key crops, and raised worries it could set off a nuclear accident. This week wildfires broke out near the decommissioned nuclear power plant, which needs to be carefully monitored to avoid another catastrophe 36 years after it was taken offline. On Wednesday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russian troops were preparing new attacks around the Chernobyl exclusion zone. He said: “The world is on the verge of many new crises. ""The environmental and food challenges are unprecedented.” Mr Zelensky has said Russia’s seizing of the Chernobyl nuclear plant was “a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.” Earlier this month Russian forces disconnected Chernobyl nuclear power plant from the national grid. National nuclear energy company Ukrenergo said the plant was in total blackout with no power supply. The lack of power at Chernobyl risks sending radioactive substances into the air. This week, dozens of trapped workers at the infamous nuclear plant were allowed home for the first time in almost a month. They had been unable to leave the facility since the invasion began on February 24, but they have now been relieved by other staff.",0

There are concerns Russian shelling of Ukrainian checkpoints in the city of Slavutych, home Chernobyl nuclear workers, is preventing workers coming in and out of the plant. And the bombing comes just days after Ukrainian workers who were being held by Russian forces to maintain the nuclear plant for nearly four weeks without being rotated were finally able to go back to their homes in Slavutych. Staff working at Chernobyl have been held at gunpoint since Russia captured the site on the first day of the invasion on February 24. The Russian shelling of the city Slavutych means that the Ukrainian staff are not able to rotate in and out of the plant, increasing concerns of a nuclear disaster. For staff to be protected against any radioactive risks, they must have enough rest and have be confident to make decisions free of pressure - which they currently don't have. Ukraine said the shelling was putting the nuclear workers ""at risk and preventing further rotation of personnel to and from the site"". Meanwhile, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Reafael Grossi, said the incident came ""just a few days after technical staff at the Chernobyl (plant) were finally able to rotate and go to their homes in Slavutych and rest after working for nearly four weeks without a change of shift"". G7 leaders have come together this week to warn that Russia's attack on the site in Ukraine could lead to another nuclear catastrophe as Russian forces destroyed a laboratory at the Chernobyl plant that worked to improve management of radioactive waste. The International Atomic Energy Agency, Reafael Grossi, has also warned of the dangers of the conflict. It is the first to take place in a country with a vast nuclear estate comprising 15 reactors, in addition to Chernobyl. Mr Grossi said he was prepared to send equipment and staff to ensure the safety of the facilities and ""prevent a serious nuclear accident"". He also criticised the fact that an agreement had not yet been reached with Moscow and Kiev despite serious efforts. And in a joint statement from G7 leaders, the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan they warned: ""Russia's attack has already risked the safety and security of nuclear sites in Ukraine. ""Russian military activities are creating extreme risks for the population and the environment, with the potential for catastrophic result.""",0

The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said: ""The continuation of its bombardment can lead to severe radiation consequences with contamination of nearby territories."" Emine Dzheppar, Ukraine's first deputy minister of foreign affairs, added: ""The Russian aggressor fired rocket 'Grad' systems on the territory of the Kharkiv Institute, where the nuclear installation 'Source of Neutrons' is located, in the active zone of which 37 fuel nuclear cells were loaded. ""The destruction of a nuclear facility and nuclear material storage facilities could lead to a major environmental disaster.

It is believed that 25 acres of the forest surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear site - which is under Russian control - are now ablaze. Officials are concerned the fire could sweep through the forest and tear through the power plant, leading to a nuclear disaster and ""irreparable consequences"" for Ukraine and the ""whole world"". Ukrainian politician Inna Sovsun revealed on Twitter that authorities are unable to put out the inferno because the area is under Russian control. She tweeted: ""10 hectares of forest are burning in the Chornobyl Zone, caused by #Russian shelling. ""It isn't possible to put out the fire now, as this territory isn't controlled by #Ukraine. ""We're afraid that the fire will reach the nuclear power plant. The radiation level is already elevated."" Ms Sovsun's comments came after the speaker of Ukraine's parliament, Lyudmila Denisova, announced details about the wildfires earlier today. She claimed that 31 fires have already been recorded in the the Zone - the 1,000 square miles surrounding the plant where radioactivity is highest and where public access and residence is restricted, according to Interfax Ukraine. Ms Denisova warned the fires have lead to a spike in radioactive air pollution and called on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to send experts and firefighters to the war-torn nation to ""prevent irreparable consequences not only for Ukraine but for the whole world"". ""As a result of combustion, radionuclides are released into the atmosphere, which are carried by wind over long distances. This threatens radiation to Ukraine, Belarus and European countries,"" Ms Denisova said. The site contains nuclear fuel storage facilities and nuclear waste dumps, which if set alight could lead to a nuclear disaster, authorities have warned. The fires could intensify depending on weather - with large-scale blazes a possibility should conditions become windy and dry. However, Russian state media channels say the Exclusion Zone is not on fire - and filmed an area they claimed to be the Chernobyl site without blazes raging or smoke billowing into the sky. The Zone was cordoned off after the explosion on April 26, 1986, which produced a radioactive cloud that stretched across Europe - in what was the world's worst nuclear accident. Earlier today Ukrainian authorities announced that Russian forces had fired rockets at a nuclear research facility in Kharkiv - which remains under siege.

Kyiv officials say at least 31 blazes in the exclusion zone around the Moscow-occupied site have been recorded - which could have a detrimental impact. Up to 25,000 acres of forest around the volatile nuclear power plant - which saw the worst ever nuclear accident in 1986 - are on fire. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk condemned the shelling near the power station as she urged the UN to assess the risks. She added Kremlin troops are ""militarising"" the exclusion zone, including bringing in old potentially volatile weapons near the containment vessel protecting the station's destroyed fourth reactor. Vereshchuk added invading forces are also stopping firefighters from attempting to bring fires under control. On her Telegram account, she said: ""In the context of nuclear safety, the irresponsible and unprofessional actions of Russian servicemen present a very serious threat not only to Ukraine but to hundreds of millions of Europeans. ""We therefore demand that the U.N. Security Council adopt immediate measures to demilitarise the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl station as well as dispatching a special mission to eliminate the risks of any repeat of the Chernobyl accident resulting from the actions of Russian occupying forces."" She said damage to the containment vessel would ""inevitably lead to the release in the atmosphere of a considerable amount of radioactive dust and contamination not only in Ukraine but also in other European countries"". She claimed Russia is ""ignoring the risks"". Ukraine's human rights commissioner Lyudmila Denisova said suppression of the fires is currently ""impossible"", adding combustion would send radionuclides into the atmosphere, exposing Ukraine, Belarus and other European nations.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said Russian forces were ""militarising"" the exclusion zone around the station, site of the world's worst civil nuclear accident in 1986. Russia has held the site since the first days of the invasion. Fears have been growing of a nuclear disaster after Russian troops began shelling the Ukrainian town where staff working at the Chernobyl plant live. The mayor of Slavutych, the town created and built in the aftermath of the 1986 accident, said on Saturday that Russian forces had taken over the town. Three people were killed in clashes. There have been concerns that the shelling of the town has been preventing workers coming in and out of the plant. But the mayor of Slavutych said early on Monday that Russian forces have left after completing their task of surveying it. ""They completed the work they had set out to do,"" Yuri Fomichev, the mayor of the northern town, said in an online video post. ""They surveyed the town, today they finished doing it and left the town. There aren't any in the town right now."" Ms Vereshchuk is now urging the United Nations to dispatch a mission, in a bid to assess the risks. Russian forces, she said, were transporting large amounts of old and badly maintained weapons, creating a risk of damaging the containment vessel constructed around the station's wrecked fourth reactor. And Russian forces were preventing firefighters from bringing under control large numbers of fires in the zone. ""In the context of nuclear safety, the irresponsible and unprofessional actions of Russian servicemen present a very serious threat not only to Ukraine but to hundreds of millions of Europeans,"" Vereshchuk said on her Telegram account. ""We therefore demand that the U.N. Security Council adopt immediate measures to demilitarise the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl station as well as dispatching a special mission to eliminate the risks of any repeat of the Chernobyl accident resulting from the actions of Russian occupying forces,"" she said. Vereshchuk said damage to the containment vessel, built with European financing, would ""inevitably lead to the release in the atmosphere of a considerable amount of radioactive dust and contamination not only in Ukraine but also in other European countries"". Russia, she said, was ""ignoring these risks"" by continuing to transport weapons in areas near the station. Vereshchuk's claims could not immediately be verified on the ground. Russia has previously denied that its forces have put nuclear facilities inside Ukraine at risk. The fire and explosion in 1986 in Chernobyl's fourth reactor sent radiation wafting as far away as Britain and Spain. Thousands of deaths have been linked to the aftermath of the accident and the radiation it released. All its reactors have now been taken out of service. Russian forces occupied the Chernobyl station in the first days of the invasion last month and for a time prevented staff maintaining facilities there from leaving or being spelled off by other workers. The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that it was closely monitoring the situation and expressed concern about the ability of staff to rotate in and out of the station. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a ""special military operation"", has devastated several Ukrainian cities, caused a major humanitarian crisis and displaced an estimated 10 million people, nearly a quarter of the population.",0

During Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, there was intense fighting around the nuclear power station Chernobyl. Workers were left working under gunpoint to keep the station working. As Putin’s troops drove through the disaster site without radiation protection, they kicked up clouds of radioactive dust, workers at the site said. Two sources said soldiers in the convoy had no protection from the site’s radiation and another branded it “suicidal”. As they rampaged through they kicked radioactive dust that they would have inhaled, leaving radiation inside their body. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here As a result of the increased military personnel in the area, there have been increased levels of recorded radiation. Two Ukrainian workers spoke to Reuters about what had happened there, inside the radioactive site. Both men witnessed Russian tanks rolling through the Red Forest, which is the most radioactive part of the site, north of Kyiv. Russia ’s defence ministry refused to comment on the accounts from Chernobyl. The Kremlin claimed that by capturing the fusion site they prevented possible “nuclear provocations”. They denied they had put the nuclear facilities inside Ukraine at risk. The Russian convoy drove the most contaminated spot of the site, with one of the employees saying: ""A big convoy of military vehicles drove along a road right behind our facility and this road goes past the Red Forest. ""The convoy kicked up a big column of dust. Many radiation safety sensors showed exceeded levels.” The plant’s acting general Valery Seida was not there at the time when the Russians took over, but said he was told by witnesses that Kremlin troops rampaged all over the site. ""Nobody goes there ... for God's sake. There is no one there,"" Seida told Reuters. He added that workers on the site had told the Russians they should be cautious about the radiation, but he said it seemed their advice was ignored. ""They drove wherever they needed to,"" Seida said. After the Russian troops arrived in the first place, the two plant employees were forced to work for almost a month straight until they were allowed to go home and rest. It was only then Russian commanders allowed replacement staff to be sent in. Both employees only spoke out on the condition of anonymity because they feared for their safety. Ukraine’s State Agency of Management the Exclusion Zone said that by February 27, when they last had working sensors, radiation was seven times higher than normal. The International Atomic Energy Agency said that the day after the invasion radiation spiked but remained “within operating range”. But both the IAEA and Ukraine stopped receiving data from the site.

The Pentagon confirmed Russian troops were pulling out of the irradiated nuclear wasteland, but an employee at the Public Council at the State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management said they were running away ""irradiated"". He said they were being transported by the bus load to a special radiation medical centre in Gomel, Belarus to help treat their radioactive poisoning. In a post on facebook, Yaroslav Yemelianenko, who worked to keep the site safe, said: ""Another batch of radiation irradiation of Russian terrorists who captured the Chernobyl zone, was brought to the Belarusian center of radiation medicine in Gomel today. ""Digging the trenches in the Rudu forest, bitches? Now live the rest of your short life with this. There are rules of handling this territory.

He went onto quote a Belarusian TV channel which said ""about 7 medical PAZs arrived at the Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology. ""The photo shows that people are visible in cars. Let's note that Russian soldiers are brought to this centre on a regular basis"" This shocking revelation comes as US intelligence confirmed Russian soldiers have withdrawn from the site. It also comes days after Russian claimed it would 'drastically reduce combat operations' around Kyiv. Earlier this week, Moscow claimed it would take the significant step as a gesture to advance peace talks, but both Ukrainian and US officials expressed scepticism about Russian intentions. ABC News reported that the Pentagon said they had only seen “small numbers” of Russian withdrawals after Russia's first claim, but that these were repositioning of troops, not retreat. They challenged Russia characterising this as a move for peace, when in reality it was talked up military strategy. Then, the Pentagon said it believed those troops could simply be moved elsewhere such as to the Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine, where Russia controls. In its most specific description of Russian forces moving away from Kyiv, the Pentagon said that ""less than 20%"" of the Russian contingent in the vicinity of the Ukrainian capital were starting to ""reposition"". Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said those that had begun to move away from Kyiv had been deployed in the vicinity of the Hostomel airport north west of Kyiv. He added, it appeared that the Russian troops being pulled away from the capital was in an effort to resupply and reorganise with their help elsewhere, not send them back to Russia. However, the move will be greeted as good news by many as early fighting around the infamous nuclear power station raised fears it could become damaged amid gunfire. It comes as earlier today the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned the occupying Russian forces that there was a danger of ammunition exploding at the site. In a video posted on Telegram, she said: ""We demand that the UN Security Council immediately take measures to demilitarize the Chernobyl exclusion zone and introduce a special UN mission there to eliminate the risk of the repeat of a nuclear catastrophe."" Only days ago, Russian troops trampled unprotected one of deadliest area, Chernobyl's 'Red Forest', kicking up radioactive dust. On the first day of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the site's workers quickly became trapped there at the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. The workers were stuck there for more than 12 days under Russian guard, keeping the site working and safe. Even though it is no longer a functioning power station, Chernobyl was never abandoned and requires constant supervision to keep safe. It was this that Russia jeopardised early on. But now, it looks like as Russia's invading forces continue to be stretched thin, the Kremlin may have recalled the soldiers. This comes over a month into Moscow's deadly invasion of Ukraine. Early reports claimed Russia had intended to seize the capital in a 'lightning invasion', the Financial Times reported. Instead of seizing the capital and rampaging across the country, welcomed as victors, like some Russian troops reportedly expected, they are in the second months of staunch, bloody Ukrainian resistance. And instead of ousting comedian-turned-politician Volodymyr Zelensky's government, Russia are now negotiating with them.",0

This morning officials confirmed that the northern Pripyat region was back under Ukrainian control, having been seized by Russia at the start of Vladimir Putin's illegal invasion. Ukraine 's defence ministry posted today: ""Yes, today on April 03, the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine took control of the district of Pripyat and the area of the State Border of Ukraine with the Republic of Belarus. ""We continue to perform combat duties! Together to victory! Glory to the DSHW! Glory to Ukraine!"" Late last week Ukraine said Russian occupiers had left the nuclear power plant because of heavy losses and radiation poisoning. The General Staff of the Armed Forces said on Friday that several units of Russian forces had been withdrawn from the Chernobyl district and headed across the border with Belarus. The Russian retreat was a significant victory for Ukraine, amid fears of a fresh nuclear disaster at the plant, where staff were held hostage and forced to keep working without proper rest. It is the latest in a number of breakthroughs in the resistance against Russian invaders, with Putin's forces stepping down its assault on capital city Kyiv. But retreating Russian forces have been accused of arbitrarily killing civilians ""out of anger and just because they wanted to kill"" by Ukraine's foreign minister. It is the latest in a series of war crimes allegations against Putin's troops, who are also accused of using rape as a ""weapon of war"" amid sickening reports of women and girls being attacked. On Friday The Mirror reported that a Russian soldier has been killed by radiation from the damaged Chernobyl nuclear plant after his unit camped in a toxic forest. The soldier was part of a team that captured the power plant in the first days of the war before occupying the 20-mile exclusion zone around it. They dug trenches into radioactive mud and their trucks kicked up radioactive dust as they drove along dirt roads, it is claimed. Russian forces occupied the defunct power station after invading Ukraine on February 24, but Ukraine's state nuclear energy company, Energoatom, said on Thursday they had left the plant and were heading towards the border with Belarus. ""Russians were seen in the exclusion zone this morning,"" Yevhen Kramarenko, who heads the agency in charge of the exclusion zone, said in televised comments on Friday. Though Russian troops seized control of Chernobyl soon after the February 24 invasion, the plant's Ukrainian staff continued to oversee the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel and supervise the concrete-encased remains of the reactor that exploded in 1986, causing the world's worst nuclear accident. State-owned Energoatom said these workers had flagged earlier on Thursday that Russian forces were planning to leave the territory. Ukraine's foreign minister has said Russian troops executed civilians while withdrawing from regions ""out of anger and just because they wanted to kill"". Dmytro Kuleba branded Russia ""worse than Isis"" (Islamic State), and said it is possible its military actions could amount to genocide. Speaking to Times Radio, he said: ""We understand they were killing civilians while leaving, while withdrawing, while staying there in this town of Bucha and also in other towns and villages in key regions, but also while withdrawing from them out of anger and just because they wanted to kill. There was no good reason for them. These were not guerrillas, they were not people opposing them. ""Russia is worse than Isis, full stop."" He added the situation in de-occupied regions, where looted houses and killed civilians have been reported, ""ruins (him) inside"". He said: ""It remains to be seen based on the evidence collected whether these crimes will qualify for the crime of genocide, but I would like to make it clear that since the very beginning of the aggression, we hear from Russia and from Russian President Vladimir Putin that he denies the rights of Ukrainians to have their own identity and have our own state, so in the end of the collection of all evidence, I do not exclude the possibility of genocide.",0

The Ukrainian state nuclear company said at the end of March that Vladimir Putin's troops had left the defunct plant, which they had captured on the first day of the invasion. More than 100 workers and 169 Ukrainian guards were trapped inside an underground nuclear bunker for more than a month without fresh air and natural light. State-owned Energoatom said in a statement released at the end of March that these workers had flagged that Russian forces were planning to leave the territory. ""The information is confirmed that the occupiers, who seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and other facilities in the exclusion zone, have set off in two columns towards the Ukrainian border with the Republic of Belarus,"" it said in a statement. The BBC reported that workers had been limiting themselves to one basic meal of mainly bread a porridge a day prepared by cooks who were also stuck there. It was reported that Russian soldiers had delivered food but the workers turned it down saying it was a propaganda stunt. Now pictures have emerged of inside the plant - the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 - showing a floor blanketed with discarded clothes, cups and sleeping bags, with underwear and towels hanging from a line below the ceiling. Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyy told CNN it is not known where the Ukrainian guards are, but it is feared they have been taken to Russia through Belarus. ""They were kept here for 30 days without sufficient lighting and food,"" he told the American news outlet. ""They were not allowed outside. On the last day, they were taken away from here in an unknown direction. Today we know nothing about their fate, unfortunately. ""The Russian military went through all Ukrainian clothes, personal belongings, like dogs, in search of, probably, money, valuables, laptops. There was looting here. The Russian military stole computers and equipment."" Engineer Valeriy Semonov was one of those trapped inside the site and spoke to the BBC about how they had to steal fuel from the Russians when the power was cut off for three days, which could have caused ""catastrophic"" results. ""Radioactive material could have been released,"" he said, ""The scale of it, you can well imagine."" He added: ""I wasn't scared for my life. I was scared about what would happen if I wasn't there monitoring the plant. I was scared it would be a tragedy for humanity.""

In a Facebook post it said: ""Even a small part of this activity is deadly if handled unprofessionally."" It comes after energy minister German Gulashchenko said Russian troops had exposed themselves to ""shocking"" levels of radiation. He stated: ""After a month of such exposure, they have a maximum of one year of life. More precisely, not life but a slow death from diseases.

Four military scientists were reportedly forced to jump out of windows from the burning institute in Tver which develops new space and weapons systems. The blaze was at the Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. Initial reports said the fire started on the second floor of the top secret research institute. The cause was not clear but there were reports of “poisonous bluish-black smoke” and dramatic photos show thick plumes of dark smoke rising from the flames. It was unclear if there were chemical releases before the fire or as a result of the raging inferno. Flames quickly spread throughout the building due to the wooden flooring, reports said. Eyewitnesses report that because of the smoke, people who were in the room could not evacuate and had to jump from the windows. The death toll was first reported as one but has since risen to seven. Just hours after the Ministry of Defence fire, a second huge blaze broke out in one of Russia's biggest chemical plants.

Dramatic footage shows smoke billowing from the Dmitrievsky Chemical Plant in the city of Kineshma, around 250 miles east of Moscow. The site, the largest manufacturer of chemical solvents in the country, is around 950km from the border with Ukraine. It is not currently known what caused the fire to break out - but it comes on the same day that a huge defence plant blaze broke out, killing seven people. The Dmitrievsky Chemical Plant describes itself as the largest producer of butyl acetate and industrial solvents in Russia and Eastern Europe. It is also the supplier of a wide range of chemical and petrochemical products in Russia and in the world. It says its products are used in the paint and varnish, rubber, leather, and food industries. Images of the fire have been widely shared on social media, but authorities have yet to confirm if there were any casualties. Earlier today scientists were reportedly forced to jump out of windows in a separate fire at a defence institute in Tver, which develops new space and weapons systems. Officials have confirmed that five people died in that fire. The blaze was at the Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, which has been involved in the development of Iskander missiles used with deadly effect in Ukraine.

Railway tankers containing solvents caught fire by a huge factory in Dzerzhinsk, which has made chemical weapons. A fire train was deployed to fight the raging inferno in the industrial city which is 250 miles east of Moscow and more than 150 emergency service workers spent nine hours battling the fire covering over 2,500 square metres, on Wednesday. It is one of many attacks that have been taking place on strategic sites with military links on Russian soil since the Ukraine invasion. And as Vladimir Putin is rumoured to be considering mass army mobilisation, a video has been shared showing a Russian military enlistment office hit by multiple Molotov cocktails. Another blaze that officially killed 22 at a defence ministry missile design research institute, and an attack that saw three die at an explosive plant, are also seen as possible arson with the Russian authorities also being accused of playing down incidents. There remains suspicion over the cause of a fire which killed 22 at the top secret missile-designing defence plant in Tver and saw some of the country’s top missile designers die and their work destroyed. Some military scientists jumped for their lives from windows at the burning plant which develops new space and weapons systems. And in a gigantic fire on Monday three women died at explosives manufacturer Perm Gunpowder Plant, which supplies the army. The plant makes Grad and Smerch multiple launch rocket systems, used by Russian forces in Ukraine, and air defence systems as well as tank rounds, while also supplying gunpowder for small arms. The dead explosives workers were named as Svetlana Bardakova, 59, Olga Savishchenko, 43, and Ulyana Frants, 36. An eyewitness told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: ""The building just flew into the air” and the facility at the plant “just doesn't exist anymore”. One of the dead Svetlana Bardakova “couldn't even run out, but the other girls fled - they were all burned. Olga (Savishchenko) had 100 per cent body burns. She was not even taken to the hospital. “But Ulyana (Frants) was alive, she had 99% burns, and her son in the second grade is waiting for her at home. I don’t know how to go to work any more. I cried all night.” In another case, blame has been put on faulty wiring and a criminal case is under way into a fire which razed the Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence causing untold damage to Russian weapons research. Suspicions have been voiced that the fire was sabotage. The institute is central to the design of Iskander missiles, which have been unleashed in the war in Ukraine, as well as Russia ’s S-400 missile defence system. And human rights group gulagu.net viewed this week’s attack on the military enlistment office in Nizhnevartovsk, that caused a fire and no reported injuries, as an “anti-war protest”. Pro-government sources said that two Molotov cocktails were thrown and a third failed to catch fire.",0

It is the latest in a series of infernos at industrial facilities during the war in Ukraine with some experts saying sabotage could be to blame. Today’s blaze was at a plant making plastics in Berdsk, in Novosibirsk region, four time zones east of Moscow. It was unclear if the plastics had defence uses. A video shows thick black smoke emanating from the fire amid reports the roof was destroyed and extensive damage caused. The blaze appears to have destroyed production facilities, offices and a canteen. Almost 50 firefighters were working at the scene with some 22,000 square feet destroyed. The fire began in polyethylene products on the building's first floor, according to some reports. There were no reports of fatalities. Another fire on May 4 was at a railway tanker containing unspecified solvents on the territory of huge factory Kaprolaktam, in Dzerzhinsk, which once made chemical weapons. A blaze on 1 May saw a gigantic fire in which three women died at explosives manufacturer Perm Gunpowder Plant, which supplies the army. The plant makes Grad and Smerch multiple launch rocket systems, used by Russian forces in Ukraine, and air defence systems as well as tank rounds. It supplies gunpowder for small arms. The Dmitrievsky chemical plant in Kineshma burned down on April 21. This was the largest Russian manufacturer of chemical solvents used in a variety of industries including defence facilities. Another fire that has raised questions of sabotage was at a Russia missile design institute in which 22 weapons officials and designers died. At least 13 employees of the facility in Tver remain in hospital from among 54 rescued from ferocious flames. Another 98 were safely evacuated and one remains missing, presumed dead, from the blaze on 21 April at Russia’s Central Research Institute of the Aerospace Defence Forces This and other mysterious fires may be aimed at seeking “to dissuade his weapons of mass destruction brinkmanship”, says a US expert. Professor Douglas London, of Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, and a retired 34-year CIA operations officer, told Foreign Policy journal that some recent incidents - including oil deport fires - may have been sabotage linked to the war. “US and allied enabling of a Ukrainian sabotage campaign inside Russia telegraphs a significant and escalating cost Putin can ill afford,” he said. Russia’s leading independent gun-maker urged the Russian authorities to be more suspicious of sabotage over the wave of fires. Vladislav Lobaev said: “The Dmitrievsky chemical plant in the city of Kineshma burned down. “It is the largest Russian manufacturer of chemical solvents used in a variety of industries…. “Separately, the building of the defence research Institute in Tver burned to the ground… “It was at this institute that the Iskanders and the S-400 were developed.” He warned: “It is hard to believe in such coincidences, especially with large or such iconic enterprises. “In wartime, it is necessary to work out the version of sabotage more actively.”",0

Mariupol City Council reported today how the shelling of the Azovstal iron and steel plant could have dire consequences for local wildlife and cause a ""world-class environmental catastrophe"". The council fears the bombs could have damages a facility holding back tens of thousands of tons of concentrated hydrogen sulfide solution, reports EspresoTV. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said: ""The leak of this liquid will completely kill the flora and fauna of the Sea of Azov. Then dangerous substances can get into the Black and Mediterranean Seas."" The mayor called for United Nations experts to be granted immediate admission to prevent the climate threat. He added that Russia is trying to create a ghetto in Mariupol and that the chemical-tainted water supply could cause another crisis. Russian troops stormed the plant on April 19 and destroyed large areas, however, pockets of organised resistance fighters battled on at the plant for weeks - refusing to surrender. Members of the Azov Battalion, a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine in Mariupol, were based in the plant. The fighters - who surrendered at the steelworks - were told they may now be tried as “Nazi war criminals” after being assured they would be freed in a prisoner exchange. Russia is being accused of false promises after it agreed to exchange the Ukrainians still fighting in Mariupol if they gave up their resistance. Members of the Azov Regiment had been stubbornly fighting on against Vladimir Putin ’s forces at the massive steelworks with a maze of tunnels that made it difficult for them to be defeated. More than 250 Ukrainian soldiers surrendered after weeks of desperate resistance, bringing an end to the most devastating siege of Russia's war in Ukraine. But now Russia’s Parliament has said it will vote on a resolution not to allow the “exchange of Nazi war criminals” and some MPs have called for them to be executed. Environmental concerns were raised earlier in the war when Russian forces were seen firing at a nuclear research facility in Kharkiv. Ukraine's parliament announced it was not possible to estimate the damage due to the ongoing clashes in the area. A Ukrainian politician warned that the latest shelling risked a 'major environmental disaster'. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said: ""The continuation of its bombardment can lead to severe radiation consequences with contamination of nearby territories."" Emine Dzheppar, Ukraine's first deputy minister of foreign affairs, added: ""The Russian aggressor fired rocket 'Grad' systems on the territory of the Kharkiv Institute, where the nuclear installation 'Source of Neutrons' is located, in the active zone of which 37 fuel nuclear cells were loaded. ""The destruction of a nuclear facility and nuclear material storage facilities could lead to a major environmental disaster. Ukraine continues to gather evidence of (Russian) war crimes to The Hague."" The regulator previously accused Russia of committing an ""act of nuclear terrorism"" by bombing the research facility.",0

Russian President Vladimir Putin has put his own troops to work in Chernobyl - one of the most deadly and contaminated places in the world. The result of being exposed to nuclear radiation is the likelihood of having life-threatening cancer as one expert said: “Putin’s commanders might as well have ordered these men to dig their own graves.” The radiation damage to Russian troops started last month after several developed skin rashes and were suffering red and itchy eyes. There were around 2,500 soldiers and tanks who took control of Chernobyl on February 24. However, Putin ordered the troops to move out on March 31 after dozens of men were told to dig up the ground - with images showing how close the troops were to the contaminated site. Dr Olena Buntova, a retired biologist living in Chernobyl, told The Sun : “How could they have been so stupid? “The commanders who ordered the digging must have cared nothing for the safety of their men. No one is normally allowed to walk on the ground there or disturb it because of the levels of radioactive material still sinking through the soil."" She also said Russians were shovelling soil into sandbags which would have surrounded their bodies with deadly radiation. And, rather bleakly, Dr Olena Buntova, warned that once the radiation enters the body, it never leaves with the damage to the soldiers set to last. As the Russian troops took over the site, many of the plant's Ukrainian staff continued to oversee the 1986 nuclear accident. Staff were supervising the remains of the reactor that exploded and ensuring the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel. There were estimated to be around 170 Ukrainian staff who had no access to fresh air or the outside as they were locked in an underground bunker for a month. The nuclear site had become a popular tourist attraction in recent times with Chernobyl attracting visitors from across the globe. However, the radiation site has remained unopened due to the current war in Ukraine as The International Atomic Energy Agency is due to carry out an investigation on the site to check its safety.",0

Russian troops seized Chernobyl on day one of the Ukraine war in February and took over the 19 mile Chernobyl exclusion zone, surrounding the perimeter of the plant and taking full control for over a month, bunking in the grounds. What they left in their wake and after their retreat has now been revealed, as photographers had full access to its labs and offices for the first time. Horrifying messages graffitied on walls, rubbish overflowing along the corridors, smashed up windows and live electrical wiring uncovered were among the scenes left for the Ukrainian defenders to find. When the Kremlin's forces took control of the site many locals were fearful of a major radioactive disaster as a result of heavy fighting around the plant throwing up waste. The soldiers dug trenches in the highly toxic Red Forest zone but later retreated as part of a wider pull-out from around the capital Kyiv in April. The large nuclear station no longer produces power but before the invasion, nearly 6,000 workers were monitoring the effects of the catastrophic meltdown more than three decades ago. The Washington Post reports that 698 computers. 344 vehicles and 1,500 radiation dosimeters - all irreplaceable software - were seized. It estimates the cost of replacing what was lost at more than $135 million. Russian soldiers who seized control of Chernobyl reportedly spread radioactive material around the plant and a soldier picked up a source of radiation with his bare hands, according to the Telegraph. It is not known what happened to the soldier who handled the waste. The soldiers contaminated the power plant with radioactive material as they travelled to and fro the forest, carrying back waste on their shoes. As a result, radiation levels increased at the power plant. ""It's crazy, really,"" Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko told CNN. ""I really have no idea why they did it. ""But we can see they went in there, the soldiers who went there, came back here and the level of radiation increased."" Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine's former president, said that Putin's invasion of the nuclear site showed the threat Russia posed to the rest of Europe. ""Nuclear smoke is not limited by borders. It can reach Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and even Great Britain. The danger of nuclear contamination of Europe is very high, while Russia continues this war,"" he said.",0

Local officials reported at the end of May that Vladimir Putin's forces had loosened the ""Togliatti-Odessa"" ammonia pipeline during a military operation. The fighting lead to the gas being released into the skies near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donetsk region, the site of the war's new front line. The branch of the pipeline affected had been out of use since 2014 and the valves were closed at the time - but the corrosive element still slipped out, officials said. The gas - which is mainly used as fertiliser - is corrosive and exposure can cause the eyes, nose and throat to burn. Higher amounts can lead to blindness, lung damage and even death. Writing on Telegram, the Chairman of the Donetsy Oblast Military Administration Pavlo Kyrylenko said: ""Due to the actions of the Russian army, another natural disaster occurred in Ukraine. ""Donetsk RMA warns that in the Bakhmut district of Donetsk region, as a result of combat operations, damaged the tightness of the branch of the ammonia pipeline.

As the war rolls on, Putin has threatened to hit new targets if the West supplies longer-range missiles to Ukraine in the fight against Russian invaders. The warning came hours before the Ministry of Defence announced it would help Ukrainian fighters defend their country by sending rocket launchers that can hit targets 50 miles away. Explosions rocked Kyiv in the first assault on the capital in weeks as Russian strategic bombers fired missiles from as far away as the Caspian Sea. Putin said the “fuss” around Western weapon supplies to Ukraine was designed to drag out the conflict, as Russian troops struggle against dug-in defenders in the eastern Donbas region, He warned that if the US dispatched longer-range missiles to the war zone, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”.",0
2022-07-19,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-guilty-nuclear-terrorism-after-27520111,Russia guilty of 'nuclear terrorism' after seizing Chernobyl by fighting Ukraine,"Russia has been branded a terrorist state for seizing the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and controlling it for over a month during the brutal Ukraine war. Russian troops seized Chernobyl on day one of the Ukraine war at the end of February, taking over the 19-mile perimeter of the plant for over a month and bunking on the grounds. Now, the Security Service of Ukraine has collected ""indisputable"" evidence that the units of the Kremlin which forcibly seized the plant, from February 24 to March 31, committed an act of nuclear terrorism. The plant is not fully operational and a number of the reactors are decommissioned, but the compound is a vast complex with three nuclear fuel storage facilities and a number of radioactive waste sites. Before the invasion, nearly 6,000 workers were monitoring the effects of the plant's catastrophic meltdown more than three decades ago. The Washington Post reports that 698 computers. 344 vehicles and 1,500 radiation dosimeters - all irreplaceable software - were seized by the Kremlin during their takeover. It estimated the cost of replacing what was lost at more than $135 million. ""By turning this facility into its temporary military base, the Russian Federation flagrantly violated the Geneva Convention, which expressly prohibits attacks on nuclear facilities in conditions of armed conflict"", The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) wrote on Tuesday. During the temporary occupation, the invaders also violated all nuclear safety norms by damaging the premises, mining the area and provoking a number of fires. Images show the destruction Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces left in their wake including messages graffitied on walls, rubbish overflowing along the corridors, smashed-up windows and live electrical wiring uncovered. SSU documented that 300 military personnel were stationed directly on the territory of radiation-hazardous facilities and more than 100 mines and 3 explosions were discovered.",0
2022-08-03,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/europes-biggest-nuclear-power-plant-27652992,Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in Ukraine now 'completely out of control',"Europe’s largest nuclear power plant is “completely out of control” and urgent action needs taking to prevent a catastrophic disaster. That is the warning from Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), of the facility in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, which was seized by the Russian army following their invasion in February. Meanwhile, Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky insisted it could be “the end of Europe” should an explosion occur at the plant, with Grossi pleading with Vladimir Putin to let an IAEA mission proceed in order to undertake crucial safety checks and repairs of the sprawling complex. “What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous,” said Grossi, ominously. “Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated. “You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility.” He added: “And this is why I have been insisting from day one that we have to be able to go there to perform this safety and security evaluation, to do the repairs and to assist as we already did in Chernobyl. “If an accident occurs at Zaporizhzhia, we will not have a natural disaster to blame – we will have only ourselves to answer to. We need everyone’s support. “While this war rages on, inaction is unconscionable.” Grossi then issued an emotional appeal to both Ukrainian and Russian authorities. He added: “I’m pleading as an international civil servant, as the head of an international organisation, I’m pleading to both sides to let this mission proceed.” The nuclear power plant lies dangerously close to the fighting zones and was hit by shelling in March, with Zelensky insisting that the potential devastation from a shelling-induced blaze could have equalled six Chernobyls. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia earlier this week of using the plant, based in the south-eastern city of Enerhodar, as a military base to launch attacks on Ukrainian forces. But a Russian-installed official in the region told Reuters news agency that Ukrainian forces were using Western-supplied weapons to attack the plant, which is thought to still be operated by Ukrainian staff. And therein lies a problem as there have been moments of friction and violence between the Russians and Ukrainians involved at the plant. The Russian-controlled administration in the Zaporizhzhia region is headed up by Yevgeny Balitsky and he revealed that officials were keen to show the IAEA how Russians were “guarding the plant while Ukrainians were using weapons, including drones, to attack it”. But Washington hit back at the claim, saying Russian forces were using the nuclear power plant as a “nuclear shield”, with Blinken saying: “Of course the Ukrainians cannot fire back lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant.” In 1986, northern Ukraine was the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster when a reactor at the Chernobyl plant exploded. Russian forces also seized Chernobyl, 65 miles north of Kyiv, soon after the invasion on February 24 this year, but withdrew after five weeks.",0

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called on inspectors to be given access to a nuclear plant after the ""suicidal"" attacks. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station was hit by shelling over the weekend, but is reported to be operating ""in normal mode"" according to Russian occupiers. Ukraine and Moscow have blamed each other for the dangerous attacks on the plant and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it ""Russian nuclear terror"". Russia accused Ukraine of blasting the site with a rocket launcher, hitting administrative buildings nearby. Rafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said: ""I'm extremely concerned by the shelling at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond."" Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear facility in Europe and there is 855 tons of reactor core fuel said to be ""highly vulnerable."" Grossi added: ""Military action jeopardising the safety and security of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is completely unacceptable and must be avoided at all costs. ""What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous. Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated. ""You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility."" Damage to nuclear power plants has the potential to be catastrophic and worries were heightened when invading Russian forces captured Zaporizhzhia in March, though it is still operated by Ukrainians. On Friday, shells reportedly hit a high-voltage power line causing its operators to disconnect a reactor despite no radioactive leak being detected. Guterres said: ""We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to creating the conditions of stabilisation of the plant."" Zaporizhzhia is located in Southeastern Ukraine, currently under the occupation of Russian forces. Ukraine is expected to launch a major offensive to retake the area. James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told MSNBC that a failure of all the systems that keep a nuclear power plant safe has more chance of failing in a war. He said on the Rachel Maddow Show:"" Under normal conditions, an accident and nuclear power plant is very unlikely because you have all of these different safety systems in place. ""So you have an electricity grid connection to provide energy for the cooling, at multiple electricity connections. If they fail, you have emergency backup diesel generators. ""The problem is, in a war, a failure of all of these different systems together becomes much more likely... One could imagine damage to that plant or fire or damage to a power supplier cooling system that led to a serious accident.""",0

Yury Kot, leader of the pro-Russian Ukrainian 'Parus' movement, said the West was creating a ""fictional reality"" regarding the situation involving the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. ""We are dealing with the reality,"" he said. ""We need to tell Ukraine and it's supporting countries - Britain and America foremost... and make it clear."" Officials vented their frustration as Zaporizhzhia became caught in the crosshairs of the Russia-Ukraine war, with both sides blaming each other for shelling the plant. Vladimir Putin is accused of engineering a scenario involving an 'attack' on the plant in the future in which Russia could argue they are justified in responding with a serious escalation of the war. Kot went further and said: ""If Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is damaged and a disaster occurs, two missiles will immediately strike your decision-making centres. One in Washington, the other in London. ""Nuclear ones. And that’s it... there won't be any more talk."" Another pundit clamped down on Kot's comments, warning that such a tactic would be disastrous. Aleksey Mukhin, head of the Centre for Political Information, said: ""This would trigger the mutual destruction protocol, so I would honestly refrain from making such statements."" Damage to a high-voltage power line caused engineers to shut down the reactor over the weekend, though no radioactive leak occurred and Russia insists the plant they control is operating normally. The attacks on the plant earned the fury of United Nations Secretary General Antion Guterres, who said damage to Zaporizhzhia was ""suicidal"". Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine's nuclear power company Enerhoatom, told the BBC : ""They [Russian forces] use it [the power plant] like a shield against the Ukrainian forces, because nobody from Ukraine is going to do something. ""The Ukrainian Armed Forces know that these are Ukrainian personnel and this is a Ukrainian plant and there are Ukrainian people [there] so we aren't going to kill our people, our staff and damage our infrastructure."" Rafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), added: ""I'm extremely concerned by the shelling at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond."" Putin has been surrounded by grandstanding since the start of the war, with supporters stating outlandish claims of their hopes for the West struggling in the coming months. Rossiya 1 channel Putin propagandist Igor Korotchenko said the world is ""doomed"" and there is a ""nuclear winter"" coming. The reserve colonel said: ""Millions of Europeans…are terrified by winter coming. It will be like a nuclear winter. An apocalypse before our eyes. “Switching off the energy, lack of gas, marauders on the streets, hassles with the police and desperate people's attempts to survive.

Energoatom's chief, Petro Kotin, said it was vital Kyiv regains control over the facility in the Russian-occupied south in time for winter. He added that last week's shelling had damaged three lines that connect the plant to the Ukrainian grid and that Russia wanted to connect the facility to its grid. Some of the shelling landed near storage facilities for spent fuel, an area that has 174 containers of highly radioactive material, Kotin said. He warned of the dangers of them being hit, saying: ""This is...the most radioactive material in all the nuclear power plant. ""This would (mean) the distribution (of it) around this place and then we will have like a radiation cloud and then the weather will decide...which direction the cloud goes."" ""The risk is very high,"" he added. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site of the vast nuclear power station - Europe's biggest - that lies in Russian-controlled territory, in recent days. Kotin said Russia wanted to connect the plant to its grid, a technically difficult process that requires the facility to be severed from the Ukrainian system before it can be gradually connected to the Russian one. ""Their plan is to damage all the lines from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. After that it will not be connected to the Ukrainian power system,"" he said. The nuclear plant has six reactors and produced 20 to 21 per cent of Ukraine's electricity needs before the war, he said. It urgently needs renovations carrying out at it, he added. Kotin continued: ""So for winter season we urgently need to remove these Russians from there, then to renovate infrastructure."" Around 500 Russian troops are currently at the facility with heavy vehicles and the plant is being used as a base, he said. Kotin said the best solution would be for Russian troops to withdraw and for the plant to be returned to Ukrainian control. Peacekeepers could be sent in to guard the facility, he suggested. ""The ultimate solution is to remove soldiers and all their weaponry from the site. ""And this completely solves the problem of safety at the Zaporizhzhia power plant,"" he said. He warned, however, there would be no safety guarantees for any inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if they were to travel to the site, which was occupied in March. That kind of trip would be best conducted with the United Nations, he said.

The poor quality video shows smoke rising after the apparent shelling of the vicinity of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine claims Vladimir Putin ’s forces have turned the site into a military base in the expectation Kyiv’s military will not retaliate. ""Russian invaders again shelled the Zaporizhzhia plant and territories near the nuclear facility,” said a Ukrainian statement. The US said: ""Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous and irresponsible.” Russia’s envoy to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said attempts to accuse Moscow of shelling the facilities that it controls in occupied Ukraine are ""too absurd to be heard from grown-up, respectable people”. He told a UN security council meeting: ""The representative of the Kiev regime was the only person to claim during today’s session that Russia was shelling the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the city of Energodar that it controls.” Vladimir Rogov, a member of the occupying Russian administration, said: ""Dozens of MLRS rockets, heavy artillery rounds, strike drones have been launched towards the territory of the NPP.” The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on both sides to stop all fighting near the plant which should be made a demilitarised zone.

The “explosions” were filmed from a distance of 12 to 15 miles suggesting they were large. It was unclear if this was a Ukrainian attack or sabotage or an accident at the base. There were “from six to eight flashes of light” and “explosion waves”, claimed the channel, which asked: “If it's not an explosion, what do you think it looks like?” The Belarus Ministry of Defence explained the explosions as the ignition of an “engine”. Officials said this happened around 11pm on Wednesday while witnesses spoke of the explosions an hour and a half later. The base is close to the border with Ukraine in Gomel region. The incident followed the arrival of Russian Il-76s yesterday which may have brought air defence equipment.

The skirmishes earned an outpouring of fury from United Nations (UN) chiefs and nuclear experts, while Ukraine's authorities have been performing disaster response drills in the event of a catastrophic incident at the plant. Emergency responders were seen donning protective equipment and scanning 'patients' for radiation. Russia accused Ukraine of planning a ""provocation"" while UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the plant last Friday and is set to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Igor Kirillov, head of Russia's radioactive, chemical and biological defence forces said the plant's backup support systems were damaged during the shelling. Russia's Defence Ministry has also said it is considering shutting down the plant while it remains close to the front lines of the fighting. A disaster at the plant, they say, would see radioactive material covering large parts of Europe including Germany, Ukraine, Poland and Slovakia.

World leaders have been worryingly watching the Zaporizhzhia site since Russian army vehicles began rolling in. Russian shelling on Thursday night in a nearby coal power station disconnected the reactor complex at the nuclear plant from the power grid. It temporarily cut Zaporizhzhia off from the national grid for the first time in its history. Mr Zelenskyy said backup electricity kicked in and ensured a power supply kept the plant operating safely safe. The Kremlin's plan to disconnect it entirely would raise the risk of a catastrophic failure by leaving it dependent on a single source of electricity to cool the reactors. Zelensky said: "" Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster."" ""If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,"" he continued in his nightly address. There are fears over continued fighting near the plant, which is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, with the prospect of another accident like the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in the occupied town of Enerhodar near the plant, blamed Ukraine's armed forces for a fire in a forest near the plant for the disconnection of power. Russia seized control of the Zaporizhzhia plant right at the start of the war in March but it is still run by Ukrainian workers. The United Nations is calling for the area to be demilitarized and have been pressuring Moscow to all their inspectors to visit. “In any case, we won’t allow Russians to bring the world to the nuclear catastrophe and we will do everything just to return the plant to under our full control and operate it safely reliably, like it always been"", Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, told the Guardian.

One security expert warned one wrong step could “blow the brains of the reactor all over Europe,” causing the deaths of many thousands of victims. It came as Kyiv revealed the Zaporizhzhia nuke complex was on the brink of catastrophe when Russian shelling caused electricity supply to its reactors to be cut. Officials claimed hours later that the plant had been reconnected to the grid and it is believed emergency generators were used to avoid disaster. Ukraine 's president urged international bodies to act faster to force heavily-armed Russian troops to vacate the site which it is using as a nuclear shield. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian shelling had sparked fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the Zaporizhzhia plant from the grid. Emergency generators ensured vital power supply to drive cooling and safety systems at the plant, run by Ukrainian workers watched over by Russian forces. Zelensky said: ""If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident. "" Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster. “Every minute that Russian troops remain at the nuclear power station there is a risk of global radiation catastrophe.” Nuclear experts say the risk of damage to the plant's spent nuclear fuel pools, its reactors or cuts in power to cool the pools could cause a meltdown. Paul Bracken, a national security expert and professor at the Yale School of Management, said artillery shells or missiles could puncture the reactor walls and spread radiation.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February, captured the plant in March and has controlled it since, though Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the site, fuelling fears of a nuclear disaster. Russia's ground campaign has stalled in recent months after its troops were repelled from the capital Kyiv in the early weeks of the invasion. But bitter fighting continues along the front lines to the south and east. Russian forces control territory along Ukraine's Black Sea and Sea of Azov coasts, while the conflict has settled into a war of attrition in the eastern Donbas region.

""Ukraine calls on the world community to take immediate measures to force russia to liberate the ZNPP and transfer the power plant to the control of our country for the sake of the security of the whole world,"" the agency concluded. Yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Europe narrowly avoided a radiation disaster as the Russian-occupied nuclear plant was disconnected from Ukraine's power grid on Thursday. World leaders have been worryingly watching the Zaporizhzhia site since Russian army vehicles began rolling in. Russian shelling on Thursday night in a nearby coal power station disconnected the reactor complex at the nuclear plant from the power grid. It temporarily cut Zaporizhzhia off from the national grid for the first time in its history. Mr Zelenskyy said backup electricity kicked in and ensured a power supply kept the plant operating safely safe. The Kremlin's plan to disconnect it entirely would raise the risk of a catastrophic failure by leaving it dependent on a single source of electricity to cool the reactors. Zelensky said: "" Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster."" ""If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,"" he continued in his nightly address. There are fears over continued fighting near the plant, which is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, with the prospect of another accident like the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in the occupied town of Enerhodar near the plant, blamed Ukraine's armed forces for a fire in a forest near the plant for the disconnection of power. Russia seized control of the Zaporizhzhia plant right at the start of the war in March but it is still run by Ukrainian workers. The United Nations is calling for the area to be demilitarized and have been pressuring Moscow to all their inspectors to visit. “In any case, we won’t allow Russians to bring the world to the nuclear catastrophe and we will do everything just to return the plant to under our full control and operate it safely reliably, like it always been"", Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, told the Guardian.",0
2022-08-28,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/radiation-tablets-handed-out-near-27850903,Radiation tablets handed out near Ukrainian nuclear plant as fears of leak mount,"Fears of a looming nuclear disaster at the Russian-controlled reactor in Ukraine have lead to the mass distribution of iodine tablets among those at high risk of radiation poisoning. Both sides continue to blame each other for shelling the facility - which is the largest in Europe - as Russian forces rained down missile strikes on the far side of the river that divides the town. Despite the risks, officials from the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), are still planning to visit the front-line plant. The emergency pills can block one type of radioactive material and protect the thyroid from exposure. Regional Military Administration spokesman Volodymyr Marchuk told NBC News locals living in a 30-mile radius of the plant were being given the tablets. He added they were being distributed to guard against ""any future radiation leak"". Residents were warned against taking them preventatively, with the spokesman adding the Kyiv government would tell citizens to ingest them if their worst fears are realised. In one post on Telegram, officials claimed 25,000 tablets had been delivered. Standing beside a crater at a school that had been largely reduced to rubble, the governor of Zaporizhzhia region, Oleksandr Starukh, told Ukrainian television people were being informed how to apply iodine in case of a radiation leak. He was speaking in the city of Zaporizhzhia, two hours drive from the plant, which sits along the vast Kakhovka reservoir on the Dnipro river. Russian forces seized the plant since early March soon after invading Ukraine, while Ukrainian staff continue to operate it. In recent weeks both countries traded blame for shelling near the plant. Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said Russian troops again shelled the grounds of the complex in the last 24 hours. ""The damage is currently being ascertained,"" Energoatom wrote in a statement on Telegram. Moscow's defence ministry on Saturday accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant complex three times in 24 hours. It said in a statement 17 shells were fired, with four hitting the roof of a building storing ""168 assemblies of U.S. Westinghouse nuclear fuel"". It said 10 shells exploded near a dry storage facility for spent nuclear fuel and three near a building that houses fresh nuclear fuel storage. It said the radiation situation at the plant remained normal. Reuters could not verify either side's report. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday the situation at Zaporizhzhia remained ""very risky"" after two of its six reactors were reconnected to the grid following shelling that caused the nuclear plant to be disconnected for the first time. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said on Thursday the U.N. agency was ""very, very close"" to being able to send officials to inspect the plant. Energoatom's statement on Saturday said its staff at the plant had come under ""increased pressure"" ahead of the likely visit, ""to hush up their testimonies about the crimes of the occupiers at the station and using it as a military base"". U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called this month for military equipment and personnel to be withdrawn from the plant to ensure it is not a target. On the opposite shore from the Zaporizhzhia plant, the towns of Nikopol and Marhanets were hit by shells on Saturday afternoon and evening, Nikopol Mayor Yevhen Yevtushenko said on Telegram.",0
2022-09-01,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/nuclear-workers-disappear-life-death-27883782,Nuclear workers 'disappear' as life-or-death power plant UN inspection starts,"Anti-Russian power plant workers have “disappeared” as Russian forces delayed a life-or-death nuclear inspection by shelling the complex, Ukraine has claimed. Kyiv’s intelligence says some local crews at the Zaporizhzhia nuke plant have been removed before inspectors can get to them and others were tortured. The chilling warning came as shelling continued near Europe’s biggest power plant, initially delaying a long-awaited International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visit to the southern Ukraine plant. The IAEA's monitoring mission to the under-fire Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant may turn out to be ""shorter than planned,"" a Ukrainian source said. This is because of security concerns and came as heavily-armed Russian troops escorted the IAEA delegation to the site. During what is believed to be a lull in shelling the delegation passed through checkpoints and arrived at the plant shortly after 2pm local time (midday UK). Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate said: “Employees of the station are subjected to devastating repression. “Some of the workers, whom the occupiers consider insufficiently ""charitable"", have disappeared. “Their fate and current whereabouts are unknown.” The statement went on to say: “Some of the employees who, for various reasons, agreed to cooperate with the occupiers…” were well treated. It claims these people are colluding with Russian “technicians” believed to be Moscow’s spies to present a “necessary picture for the Kremlin” in a classic propaganda bid. The agency added: “We call on the world community, all authoritative international organisations and governments to contribute to the effective and objective work of the IAEA Mission . “In the course of their work, all the circumstances that led to the emergence of a dangerous situation that could lead to an accident at Europe's largest nuclear facility must be clarified.” It follows months of dangerous shelling close to the plant which the UN has warned could spark a catastrophe far worse than the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi in the city of Zaporizhzhia, 34 miles from the plant, he was aware of ""increased military activity in the area"" but would press ahead with the plan to visit the facility and meet staff. He added: ""Having come so far, we are not stopping.” The IAEA inspectors, wearing body armour and travelling in white, armoured land cruisers with UN markings on their sides, drove out of the city escorted by the police and were held at the first checkpoint outside the city. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia region, said Russian troops had shelled the route of the IAEA mission. Ukrainian officials have welcomed the IAEA visit, expressing hope that it will lead to the demilitarisation of the plant. They say Russia has been using the plant as a shield to hit towns, knowing it will be hard for Kyiv's forces to return fire. They have also accused Russian forces of shelling the plant, which Russian officials deny. Both sides have claimed battlefield successes amid a new Ukrainian push to recapture territory in the south. ""It is a very slow process, because we value people,"" said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Meanwhile fierce fighting has broken out as Ukraine doubles down on its counter-offensive in the south.",0
2022-09-06,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/un-demands-safety-zone-around-27924719,UN demands safety zone around Ukraine nuclear plant after ongoing shelling,"The UN has demanded a safety zone around Ukraine's nuclear plant after recent ongoing shelling. On Tuesday, the United Nations atomic watchdog advised the countries to establish a ""nuclear safety and security protection zone"" around the Zaporizhzhia power plant. It comes amid mounting fears the fighting could trigger a catastrophe in a country still haunted by the Chernobyl disaster. In a report following a visit by an inspection team last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency said ""shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damage to the plant and associated facilities. ""For the safety of the operating staff and to maintain the physical integrity to support safe and secure operation. ""This requires agreement by all relevant parties to the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone"" around the plant. IAEA director-general Rafael Grossi, who led the inspection visit, was due to brief the UN Security Council later. Shelling continued around Europe's largest nuclear plant on Tuesday, a day after it was again knocked off Ukraine's electrical grid and put in the precarious position of relying on its own power to run its safety systems. Russian-installed officials accused Ukrainian forces of shelling Enerhodar, the city where the plant is situated, while the Ukrainians said Kremlin forces attacked the city of Nikopol, across the Dnieper River from the power station. The Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, reported a powerful blast in the city around midday. The explosion left the city of 53,000 cut off from its power and water supplies. World leaders have called for the demilitarisation of the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the early days of the war but is being run by Ukrainian engineers. In its report, the IAEA noted that on several occasions, the plant lost, fully or in part, its off-site power supply because of military activity in the area. The plant normally relies on outside power to run critical cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel. A loss of those cooling systems could lead to a nuclear meltdown. The UN agency said a backup power supply line should be re-established and asked that ""all military activities that may affect the power supply systems end"". In addition, the IAEA warned that the Ukrainian staff operating the plant under Russian military occupation are ""under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available"" - a situation that could ""lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety"". The IAEA also said the staff are not being given unrestricted access to some parts of the plant and must get permission from the Russian occupying forces to reach the cooling ponds where spent fuel is kept. Mr Grossi expressed concern that that could hamper the staff's response in an emergency. The report said the team saw Russian military personnel, vehicles and equipment at various locations, including several military vehicles on the floor of two turbine halls. It called for ""the removal of vehicles from areas that could interfere with the operation of safety and security systems and equipment"". Two inspectors from the IAEA mission remained at the plant, a decision welcomed by Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. On Monday, the IAEA said Ukrainian authorities reported that the plant's last transmission line linking it to the nation's power grid was disconnected to allow workers to put out a fire caused by shelling. Ukrainian energy minister Herman Halushchenko told Ukrainian television: ""Any repairs are impossible at this point - there are ongoing hostilities around the plant."" In the meantime, the plant's only remaining operational reactor will ""generate the power the plant needs for its safety and other functions,"" the IAEA said. Ukraine in 1986 was the site of the world's worst nuclear accident, the explosion at Chernobyl. Ukrainian intelligence reported that residents of Enerhodar were fleeing the city out of fear.",0
2022-09-21,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/iodide-tablets-handed-out-over-28045831,Anti-radiation tablets handed out over nuclear fears amid Putin's threat,"The Polish Government has announced it is distributing iodide tablets to citizens across the country following fears of possible radiation hazard regarding the safety of nuclear power plants in Ukraine. At the beginning of the week, the Ministry of the Interior announced that all firefighting communities across the country have been provided with adequate doses of the drug. ""This is a standard procedure prescribed by law and applied in the event of a possible radiation hazard. At the same time, we would like to inform you that at the moment there is no such danger and the National Agency for Nuclear Energy is constantly monitoring the situation,"" the Ministry said. They went on to add that all services are on alert at the present moment, but sufficient doses of iodine have been provided to all Polish citizens. On the Polish government's website, the statement reads: ""As part of the crisis management and civil protection activities, in connection with the media information on the fighting in the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant region, last week tablets containing potassium iodide were handed over to the district headquarters of the State Fire Service. ""It is a standard procedure provided for by law and used in the event of a possible radiation emergency. ""At the same time, we would like to inform you that at the moment there is no such threat and the situation is monitored on an ongoing basis by the National Atomic Energy Agency. ""The services responsible for state security are on constant readiness, and the appropriate amount of potassium iodide is secured for every Polish citizen."" In case of confirmed contamination, the plan is to quickly distribute iodine tablets that help absorb radioactive substances. Russian forces seized the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in March this year - which was known as the largest plant in Europe. Since its seizure, there have been security concerns. Energoatom, which manages nuclear power plants in Ukraine, added that Russian forces fired missiles at the second largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, report Notes from Poland. However, the Polish national agency confirmed on Monday that the damaged systems were not important for the safety for the nuclear plants. Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine - on 24 February 2022 - the number of pharmacies selling iodine in Poland more than doubled. Meanwhile, the the interest in iodine itself has increased about 50 times in a week. When you take potassium iodide, your thyroid gland - just in front of the windpipe - absorbs it. Upon taking the pill, if you get the right amount at the right time, it will saturate your thyroid gland. This means that by taking the pill, it can help block any inhaled or ingested radioactive iodine from being absorbed by your thyroid. Therefore, this lowers your risk for radiation damage to that gland. After the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986, Polish authorities also distributed iodine to millions of citizens - especially to children.",0
2022-10-02,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-troops-bundle-blindfolded-head-28133303,Russian troops blindfold Ukraine nuclear plant boss and drive away in 'kidnap',"There are fears the boss of a nuclear power plant in Ukraine may have been kidnapped as he has not been seen since he was blindfolded and arrested by Russian troops. Ihor Murashov, the director general of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility in Enerhodar, was blindfolded and driven to an unknown location on Friday for questioning, according to eyewitness reports. The arrest has raised fears over the security of the nuclear power plant in the occupied south-east of the country. Murashov was said to be on his way from the facility to the town of Enerhodar in the occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast region when he was detained at around 4pm on Friday. Al Jazeera reported Petro Kotin, head of state-owned firm Energoatom, as accusing Russia of jeopardising the nuclear power plant's safety. “He was taken out of the car and with his eyes blindfolded he was driven in an unknown direction,” Kotin said in a statement. “His detention by [Russia] jeopardises the safety of Ukraine and Europe’s largest nuclear power plant.” Russia did not comment on the arrest and there has been no indication of Murashov's fate. Kotin appealed to the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, to take “all possible immediate actions to urgently free” Murashov. The IAEA said Musharov had been “temporarily detained to answer questions”, according to Russian authorities. The UN said that it was “seeking clarifications” to resolve the matter “in line with its nuclear safety mandate”. The Zaporizhzhia plant was shelled earlier in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with both sides accusing each other of risking nuclear disaster. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for the surrounding area to be demilitarised, with the site still staffed by Ukrainians despite the region being under Russian control. Murashov has opposed allowing Rosatom – Russia's state-run nuclear energy company – to take over the Zaporizhzhia plant. As director general, Murashov reportedly had access to security codes and oversaw day-to-day protocols.",0
2022-11-20,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/watchdog-issues-nuclear-disaster-warning-28540662,Warnings over renewed shelling at Europe's largest nuclear plant,"A watchdog has warned of a potential nuclear disaster after Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia power plant came under renewed shelling. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), called for ""urgent measures"" to prevent a catastrophe. It comes as fighting rages near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power station - the largest nuclear plant in Europe. In renewed shelling both close to and at the site, IAEA experts at the Zaporizhzhia facility reported hearing more than a dozen blasts within a short period on Sunday morning and could see some explosions from their windows. The IAEA said: ""There has been damage to parts of the site, but no radiation release or loss of power."" Several buildings, systems and equipment at the power plant - none of them critical for the plant's nuclear safety - were damaged in the shelling, the IAEA said, citing the plant's management. Still, Grossi said reports of the shelling were ""extremely disturbing."" He added: ""Whoever is behind this, it must stop immediately. ""As I have said many times before, you're playing with fire!"" Grossi said, and appealed to both sides to urgently implement a nuclear safety and security zone around the facility. Russia has been pounding Ukraine's power grid and other key infrastructure from the air, causing widespread blackouts for millions of Ukrainians amid freezing weather. That has left Ukrainians without heat, power or water as snow blankets the capital, Kyiv, and other cities. Ukraine's state nuclear power operator said Russian forces were behind the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant. Energoatom said in a Telegram post Sunday that the targeted and damaged equipment in the facility is consistent with Kremlin's strategy ""to damage or destroy as much of Ukraine's energy infrastructure as possible as"" winter sets in. The most recent strikes damaged the system that would enable the plant's power units 5 and 6 to start producing electricity again for Ukraine, the power operator said. It listed chemical desalinated water storage tanks and steam generator purge system as being damaged in the shelling Sunday, although the full extent of the damage is still being assessed. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine decided to bring the two units to a minimally controlled power level to obtain steam. This is critical in winter for ensuring the safety of power units, the plant's staff, the local population and the environment, Energoatom said. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov, however, blamed Ukrainian forces, claiming they shelled the power plant twice Sunday. He also said two shells hit near the power lines supplying the plant with electricity. Elsewhere in the Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces shelled civilian infrastructure in about a dozen communities, destroying 30 homes, the Ukrainian presidency said Sunday. In the central Dnipropetrovsk region, one person was wounded and 20 buildings damaged in shelling of Nikopol, a city across the river from the Zaporizhzhia plant, the report said. Three districts in the northern Kharkiv region - Kupyansk, Chuguiv and Izyum - also came under Russian artillery fire in the past 24 hours. In the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions, Russian shelling killed one person in Donetsk and damaged power lines, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office. The situation in the southern Kherson region ""remains difficult,"" the report said, citing the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces. Russian troops fired tank shells, rockets and other artillery on the city of Kherson, which was recently liberated from Ukrainian forces, and the settlements of Chervyn Mayak, Kachkarivka, Tokarivka, Chornobayivka and Antonivka. Shelling late Saturday struck an oil depot in Kherson, igniting a huge fire that sent black billowing smoke into the air. Russian troops also shelled people lining up to get bread in the Kherson regional town of Bilozerka, wounding five, the report said. In the city of Kherson - which still has little power, heat or water - more than 80 tons of humanitarian aid have been sent so far, said local administrator Yaroslav Yanushevych, including a UNICEF shipment of 1,500 winter outfits for children, two 35-40-kilowatt generators and drinking water. Also on Sunday, a funeral was held in eastern Poland for the second of the two men killed in a missile explosion Tuesday. The other man was buried on Saturday. Poland and the head of NATO have both said the missile strike appeared to be unintentional and was probably launched by Ukraine as it tried to shoot down Russia missiles or drones.",0
