2022-01-04,https://abcnews.go.com/International/mass-protests-break-kazakhstan-fuel-price-hike/story?id=82072673,Mass protests break out in Kazakhstan over fuel price hike,"Mass protests have broken out in Kazakhstan, triggered by a sharp rise in fuel prices in the Central Asian country. Videos posted on social media show thousands of people gathering in cities across the country on Tuesday, in some places clashing violently with police and trying to storm government buildings, as authorities deployed security forces to try to disperse them and a state of emergency was declared in two parts of the country. The internet was reportedly partially shut down in parts of the country, including in the former capital, Almaty, as Kazakhstan’s president appealed for calm and pledged his ""government will not fall."" The scenes on Tuesday were extraordinary in the repressive former Soviet country, where opposition is tightly controlled. For most of its independent history, Kazakhstan was ruled by the same authoritarian leader. The protests began three days ago in the western region of Mangystau after the price of liquified natural gas, used in vehicles, roughly doubled overnight. But on Tuesday, the demonstrations swelled, spreading to cities across the country. The government on Tuesday promised to reverse the fuel price rise, but the protests continued to grow, appearing to escalate Tuesday night as protesters in some cities sought to storm administrative buildings. In Almaty, videos showed dozens of riot police using tear gas and stun grenades to clear demonstrators who reportedly tried to seize the mayor’s office. Kazakhstan’s president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev declared a state of emergency in Almaty and the Mangystau region. In a video address, Tokayev called for dialogue, saying the government would address the protesters' legitimate demands but warned it would not fall. ""Calls to attack government and military offices are absolutely illegal,"" Tokayev said. ""The government will not fall, but we want mutual trust and dialogue rather than conflict."" He said the government would hold a working meeting Wednesday to discuss the issues raised by the protesters. Tokayev was hand-picked by Kazakhstan’s long-time ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev to be his successor in 2019, when Nazarbayev stepped aside after ruling the country since it gained independence from the USSR in 1991. Nazarbayev, 81, stood down as president to become chairman of Kazakhstan’s security council but is still believed to have retained significant power. A major energy exporter, Kazakhstan is one of the world's largest countries and a key neighbor for Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Unrest in the country is likely to alarm the Kremlin, which maintains strong influence in the region. Large protests are very rare in Kazakhstan, where political opposition is barely tolerated and demonstrations must receive permission from authorities to take place legally. The western city where the fuel protests were initially focused, the oil hub Zhanaozen, saw Kazakhstan’s last major protests in 2011. Those protests ended then in a massacre when security forces opened fire on demonstrators. Amid the unrest Tuesday evening, the government announced it was restoring a price cap of 50 tenge ($0.11) per liter, or less than half the market price, in Mangystau where the protests were focused, according to Reuters.",10
2022-01-05,https://abcnews.go.com/International/unprecedented-mass-protests-grip-kazakhstan/story?id=82086477,Russian-led alliance says it will send 'peacekeepers' to Kazakhstan over protests,"Kazakhstan's president has appealed to a Russian-led military alliance for help in quelling the mass protests gripping the Central Asian country, promising to use force to put down the unrest. President Kassym-Jopart Tokayev in a televised speech Wednesday said he had appealed to the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a security alliance of former Soviet countries dominated by Russia, to assist Kazakhstan with suppressing the protests which he claimed were being led by foreign terrorists. The alliance has agreed to send a joint force of ""peace-keepers"" to Kazakhstan to help restore order, according to Armenia's prime minister, which is part of the alliance. Prime minister Nikol Pashinyan said the force would deploy to Kazakhstan for a ""limited period,"" with the goal of ""stabilising and normalising the situation in the country."" The CSTO includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus and Kazakhstan's two neighbors, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The announcement raises the prospect that foreign and potentially Russian troops may now help violently put down the unprecedented protests that have spread across Kazakhstan. First triggered by anger over a hike in fuel prices, they have escalated into a unprecedented challenge to the authoritarian regime of Nursultan Nazarbayev, that has dominated the former Soviet country for three decades and is a key ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin"" target=""_blank"">Vladimir Putin. Thousands of protesters on Wednesday stormed government buildings in several cities, including the largest city and former capital Almaty. There, protesters broke into the city administration office, set fire to other key buildings, and overran the airport. Security forces trying to violently disperse the crowds there and in several other cities appeared overwhelmed, with videos posted by local media showing protesters forcing military armored vehicles to flee and riding in police vehicles. Kazakhstan's interior ministry said at least eight police officers had been killed. Authorities have declared a state of emergency in the country and internet access for the country was shut down on Wednesday. Tokayev on Wednesday tried to calm the protests with concessions, reversing the fuel price rise, dismissing his cabinet and announcing he would take over from Nazarbayev as head of the national security council. But after the protests continued, late Wednesday Tokayev announced he was now seeking assistance from the Russian military alliance. Tokayev claimed ""international terrorist groups"" had seized parts of Almaty, saying that should be considered an ""act of aggression"" and he was therefore invoking the CSTO's collective security guarantees. ""Considering the given terrorist groups are in essence international -- they've undergone serious training abroad -- their attack on Kazakhstan can and must be considered as an act of aggression. In connection with that, as set out by the treaty on collective security, I today am appealing to the heads of state of the CSTO for help,"" Tokayev said in his speech to officials. The CSTO alliance also includes Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Tajikistan, but its driving force is Russia. The alliance's treaty guarantees assistance to members when their security or stability is threatened. Tokayev made the announcement after calls with Putin and Belarus' leader Alexander Lukashenko. After Tokayev spoke, authorities in Almaty said security forces were conducting a ""counter-terrorist operation"" in the city, warning residents to remain indoors. Kazakhstan is a major energy exporter and its authoritarian government is an important ally for the Kremlin, which has a stable and productive relationship with Tokayev's government. It is the second time in a year and a half that a long-time former Soviet leader of one of Russia's key neighbors has faced a massive uprising after the failed protests in Belarus year. Before Tokayev's request for help on Wednesday, the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia believed the crisis could resolved internally and warned others against outside intervention. Dissatisfaction has been growing in Kazakhstan in recent years over worsening living standards and rising prices, and resentment at corruption among its ruling elite. The coronavirus pandemic has worsened those economic problems. The protests began four days ago in the Western oil region of Mangystau, sparked by a sharp rise in the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) widely used in vehicles. But since Tuesday, unrest has spread across the country and broadened into a movement calling for an end to the regime built around Nazarbayev. Kazakhstan has been dominated by Nazarbayev since it became independent after the fall of the Soviet Union, thirty years ago. In 2019, the ailing 81-year-old handed the presidency to the younger Tokayev, but Nazarbayev retained power behind the scenes by moving to become chairman of Kazakhstan's national security council. Tokayev on Wednesday announced he was now heading the council, in an apparent concession. Tokayev did not mention Nazarbayev by name or refer to him, and it was unclear what it meant for Nazarbayev's future role in the country. ""And so I, as head of state and from today chairman of the Security Council, am determined to act with maximum harshness,"" Tokayev said in the address broadcast on state news channels. ""Whatever happens I will stay in the capital,"" he said.",10
2022-01-06,https://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-arrests-man-allegedly-spied-egyptian-presidents-opponents/story?id=82113836,FBI arrests man who allegedly spied on Egyptian president's opponents,"An Egyptian American has been charged with acting as an illegal agent of Egypt as he ""tracked and obtained information regarding political opponents"" of the Egyptian president, federal prosecutors in New York said. It's the latest example of an autocratic leader extending their grip beyond their borders to quash political dissent -- a hand that in recent years has even extended into the U.S., according to some analysts. Pierre Girgis, 39, ""operated at the direction and control of multiple employees of the Egyptian government,"" according to the criminal complaint, as he spied on critics of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Egyptian general who seized power in 2013. Sisi has overseen a widespread crackdown on human rights in Egypt, which is among the least free countries in the world, according to the think tank Freedom House. Sisi's government has imprisoned tens of thousands of political prisoners, criminalized expressions of dissent and deployed security forces with impunity, according to human rights groups. ""At the behest of Egyptian officials, Girgis' alleged prohibited conduct included attempting to covertly gather non-public intelligence about the activities of political opponents of Egypt's president, and attempting to gain access for foreign officials to attend law enforcement-only trainings in Manhattan,"" U.S. attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. Girgis is charged with acting as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the attorney general of the United States and with conspiracy. The Egyptian Embassy in Washington, D.C., has not yet responded to a request for comment. The government has previously denied harassing dissidents or defended arrests as critical to national security, and Sisi once claimed his government held no political prisoners. Critics, such as the Freedom Initiative, have alleged that Sisi's repressive tactics now extend beyond Egypt's borders to target dissidents overseas. ""Mr. Girgis' activities are not isolated. Egypt has engaged in a pattern of intimidating and harassing rights defenders, journalists and the families of political prisoners in the U.S. for years,"" said Allison McManus, research director of the human rights organization founded by Mohamed Soltan. Soltan, an Egyptian American, spent nearly two years in prison for protesting Sisi's 2013 seizure of power. He was tortured in prison, he said, and went on hunger strike to demand his release, but after being returned to the U.S., his outspoken advocacy has resulted in Egyptian authorities harassing his family, he claimed. Soltan's father has been arrested by Egyptian authorities and has had no communication with his family since, according to Soltan, while five cousins have been arrested and released twice now. The Freedom Initiative alleged in a May 2021 report that at least a dozen American citizens have had family members back in Egypt detained throughout 2020, five of which were in direct response to their political activity in the U.S. The State Department declined to comment on Girgis' case, saying it is an active law enforcement matter. But spokesperson Ned Price told ABC News, ""We are seeking to hold to account countries that would pursue dissidents, that would undertake such activity extraterritorially."" Critics say that little has been done to punish Egypt, one of the United States' key Middle East allies and a major recipient of military aid. The Biden administration withheld $130 million in military aid last fall, which human rights groups in a joint statement said ""undermines the human rights of Egypt’s citizens and further erodes the standing of the United States."" Examples of this kind of ""extraterritorial"" activity by autocratic governments have grown in recent years, too. The Saudi government ordered the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at its consulate in Turkey, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko grounded a Ryanair flight to arrest a dissident blogger on board, and Russian agents poisoned former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the United Kingdom. Saudi Arabia claimed it was a rogue operation, while Russia denied any responsibility for Skripal's poisoning. This is also not the first case of a foreign agent spying on dissidents in the U.S. Last summer, the Department of Justice accused four Iranian citizens, including one intelligence agent, of attempting to kidnap activist and writer Masih Alinejad from her New York apartment. Federal prosecutors said the suspects were directed by the Iranian government to bring Alinejad back to Tehran because of her criticism of the government. It's unclear what Girgis' information was being used for, if at all, but an Egyptian official allegedly made its value to the government clear in encrypted communications sent in 2018, according to the criminal complaint. ""You do a lot of good things,"" one message from an unnamed Egyptian official said, according to the complaint. ""You have become an important source for them to collect information."" In a 2019 message, Girgis and the same Egyptian official reportedly discussed an upcoming trip of certain Egyptian officials to the United States. ""Tell me what you want me to do,"" Girgis asked his handler, according to the criminal complaint. The Egyptian official responded by inquiring about Girgis' relationship with a particular U.S. law enforcement officer. ""Ask [the U.S. law enforcement officer] for something,"" the official reportedly said. ""We want you to find out if there are any police trainings happening in Manhattan in the coming days, and if so, who are the people in charge of these trainings? We would like to attend."" Girgis surrendered Thursday morning to the FBI and was due to make an initial appearance in Manhattan federal court later in the day. It wasn’t immediately clear if he had arranged a lawyer.",0
2022-01-06,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-paratroopers-arrive-kazakhstan-end-protests/story?id=82108982,"Russian troops arrive in Kazakhstan, as dozens of protesters killed, thousands arrested","Russian paratrooper units have begun arriving in Kazakhstan to help its president end mass protests in the Central Asian country, as security forces there said they have killed dozens of protesters overnight amid violent clashes. The Russian troops are deploying as part of a joint force from a Russian-led military alliance of former Soviet countries, after Kazakhstan’s president appealed late Wednesday for help putting down the protests that have spread across the country. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev made the request after a mob of protesters stormed the mayor’s office in Kazakhstan’s largest city Almaty, and overran the airport. Small numbers of Russian paratrooper units landed at an airbase in Kazakhstan, with Russian state media showing the soldiers disembarking from transport planes and off-loading armored vehicles. The number of Russian troops was unclear, but it was estimated from several hundred to a few thousand, alongside several hundred from Belarus, Tajikistan and Armenia that were also due to arrive. The Russian-led alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), said it was deploying what it called a “peacekeeping” mission to help Kazakhstan’s government restore order. The organization said the forces’ main tasks would be “protecting important state and military facilities, and assisting Kazakh law enforcement in stabilising the situation."" Kazakhstani government troops moved to regain control in Almaty on Thursday, with videos published by local media showing them opening fire on protesters. Shooting was reported throughout the day, focused mainly around the city’s main square in front of the mayor’s office, according to local residents. A nationwide state of emergency has been declared and the internet has been repeatedly shut off, according to reports. The interior ministry said over 2,000 people had been arrested in Almaty and late Thursday it said it had “cleared” the city’s square. In a statement it warned that protesters that did not lay down their weapons would “be destroyed”. Saltanat Azirbek, a police spokeswoman, said dozens of people had been killed, when they allegedly attacked administrative and police buildings Wednesday night. Kazakhstan’s interior ministry said 18 police and security forces personnel had been killed and 748 injured. State media reported hundreds of people have been injured in the unrest. President Tokayev has vowed to use force to put an end to the protests, after concessions on Wednesday-- including dismissing his government and reversing the fuel price rise-- failed to calm them. Tokayev claimed the protests were being led by foreign terrorists groups, using the claim to justify his call for the Russian-led alliance to send troops. A major energy exporter and one of the world’s largest countries, Kazakhstan’s regime is a close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, which considers the ex-Soviet country to be a key part of its sphere of influence. The CSTO alliance was created after the fall of the Soviet Union and this was the first time it has acted to send troops to one of its members. The Russian intervention was the second time in a year and a half the Kremlin has acted to rescue an authoritarian leader from a mass uprising in one of its key neighbors, after Putin helped prop up Belarus’ leader Alexander Lukashenko against huge protests there. It was unclear whether the Russian troops would be deployed near protests, which could see them firing on Kazakhstani civilians, an inflammatory scenario the Kremlin likely wants to avoid. The CTSO’s general secretary Stanislav Zas told Russian state media the “peacekeepers” could remain in Kazakhstan as long as was required to stabilise the situation, saying they would be deployed to the cities where they were needed. The U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called Kazakhstan’s foreign minister Mukhtar Tileuberdi on Thursday to discuss the unrest. Blinken “reiterated the United States’ full support for Kazakhstan’s constitutional institutions” and “advocated for a peaceful, right-respecting resolution to the crisis,” according to a State Department readout. But he notably did not condemn the violence used against protesters. An internet blackout made it difficult to access the state of the protests on Thursday, although connection was restored later in the day. In Almaty, the center of the uprising, most of the city was eerily quiet on Thursday with little sign of protesters, according to an ABC reporter in the city. Intense shooting was reported early evening around the main square, where journalists on the ground said government armored personnel carriers and troops had opened fire on some protests gathered there. Witnesses said Almaty’s city center was a scene of devastation, dotted with burnt out vehicles and ransacked shops, following widespread looting overnight. Numerous residents told media the city’s protests had been overtaken on Wednesday by gangs of mainly young men, looking for violence who had rampaged through key buildings and looted stores. A video filmed by the BBC showed the wreckage of the former presidential palace in Almaty, where cars had been rammed through its walls. Authorities announced all banks were temporarily closed Thursday due to ongoing “counter-terrorism operations” and because of internet problems. In the capital, Nur-Sultan, local residents reported lines for bread and other foods. Videos posted by local independent media showed small crowds of protesters in other towns and cities, including the western oil hub Zhanozen, where the protests over the fuel prices began five days ago. Rising prices exacerbated by the pandemic have fuelled discontent in Kazakhstan. The protests were ignited after the price of liquified natural gas used in vehicles almost doubled. The demonstrations swelled into an unprecedented challenge to the regime created by Nursultan Nazarbayev, the former Communist party boss who has dominated the country since it gained independence during the Soviet Union’s fall. Nazarbayev, who is 81, in 2019 handed power to Tokayev as his handpicked successor, but he retained substantial power behind the scenes by moving to become chair of the national security council and he was granted the honorary title of “leader of the nation."" Under Tokayev, Nazarbayev’s cult of personality has continued, with the capital city, Nur-Sultan, named after him. Protesters pulled down a statue of Nazarbayev on Wednesday in Taldyrkurgan, the Almaty regional capital. And demonstrators in many places chanted a Kazakh slogan meaning “Go away, old man!” Tokayev on Wednesday announced he was taking over from Nazarabayev as head of chairman of the security council, in what appeared as a concession to the protests meant to signal a final end to Nazarbayev’s rule. Tokayev himself was named president in an election criticised by international observers as flawed.",10
2022-01-08,https://abcnews.go.com/International/signs-kazakhstan-president-regaining-control-crackdown-protests/story?id=82148752,Signs Kazakhstan president regaining control after crackdown on protests,"There are signs Kazakhstan's president is slowly regaining control in the country, following a bloody clampdown by security forces to end days of mass protests and after Russian-led troops arrived to support the government. For the second day in a row, Kazakhstan's biggest city Almaty was eerily quiet and under heavy military control, according to an ABC News reporter there. The city, the former capital, was the epicenter of the protests this week, where mobs stormed key government buildings and overran the airport. But under cover of an internet blackout, security forces using live fire have cleared the streets over the past three days in clashes that have left dozens killed, according to the government. The streets were mostly deserted on Saturday, but the occasional sound of gunshots could be heard. It was not clear, but some of the shots appeared to be warning shots fired by troops, directing people not to approach police cordons, according to the ABC News reporter, who is not being named for safety reasons. The main square, the key protest site, was occupied by security forces and blocked off with armored vehicles. A curfew is in effect in the evening and authorities have told people to remain indoors. Military units have set up checkpoints and are controlling access to the city. Most shops are closed and people are struggling to find basic groceries, except for bread that is still being delivered, according to ABC's reporter. The city center is wrecked, many shops looted and the roads are strewn with burnt-out cars. Several journalists on the ground have reported seeing corpses lying in the street. The protests began a week ago, triggered by a rise in gas prices, but quickly spread and developed into the biggest uprising against Kazakhstan's authoritarian government since it gained independence following the fall of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan's president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Wednesday appealed to Russia for help, asking a Moscow-led military alliance of former Soviet countries to send troops. A few thousand Russian paratrooper units have since arrived in the country, along with several hundred from Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. The internet blackout in the country made it difficult to get a clear picture of the situation in other cities on Saturday, but there were signs protests had faded. Kazakhstan's interior ministry said police now have ""full control"" over Aktob, a city that saw major protests. In Aktau, another protest center, a Russian-state news reporter showed police removing a small number of protesters from the central square. Security forces were engaged in a gun battle for several hours near a village on the outskirts of Almaty, according to a reporter from the Russian state news agency, Sputnik. Kazakhstan's interior ministry said police have arrested over 4,400 people during the protests. At least 26 protesters and 18 security forces personnel have been killed, and hundreds of people injured in the unrest, according to the authorities. Tokyaev on Saturday spoke to Russia's president Vladimir Putin, telling him the situation was ""stabilizing"" but that ""hotspots of terrorism"" remained and that he would fight them ""with the utmost determination,"" according to a readout from Kazakhstan's president's office. Tokayev and the Kremlin have claimed the unrest was carried out by ""foreign terrorist"" groups. In many places the protests have been largely peaceful, though in Almaty they were overtaken by intense violence, with mobs of men ransacking government buildings and there was widespread looting. Men armed with assault rifles, seemingly organized, have been seen and appear to have fought with the security forces. But peaceful demonstrations appear to continue in the city -- as troops advanced on the square on Wednesday, a group of young people stood holding a banner reading, ""We are not terrorists."" Kazakhstan's security services on Saturday also arrested the former head of the country's domestic security agency, Karim Masimov, on charges of treason, in a surprise move that fueled speculation in Kazakhstan that an internal struggle has also been going on among the elite during the protests. Masimov had headed the powerful KNB security service until he was removed this week by Tokayev, when the president dismissed his government as a concession to the protests. A statement published on the security agency's website, said Masimov and other unnamed individuals, were suspected of ""state treason"" and that he has been held in a detention center for the past two days. The charge against him carries a maximum sentence of 15 years prison. Masimov was a key ally of Kazakhstan's long-time ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev, the ex-Communist party boss who has dominated the country for three decades. Nazarbayev, who is 81, in 2019 passed the presidency to Tokayev, but had retained considerable power behind the scenes as chairman of the national security council and has the honorary title ""leader of the nation."" This week, amid the unrest, Tokayev announced he was replacing Nazarbayev as chairman of the security council, a move seen as signaling an end to Nazarbayev's power. Nazarbayev's removal now combined with the arrest of his key ally in Tokayev's government has prompted some to claim Tokayev is using the upheaval to put an end to his former patron's influence in the government and cement his own. Nazarbayev's whereabouts -- as has not been seen in public since the protests began -- have become a subject of interest among Kazakhstanis. Nazarbayev's spokesperson on Saturday denied multiple reports that Nazarbayev had left Kazakhstan with his daughter. The spokesperson said Nazarbayev was in the capital Nur-Sultan -- named after him -- and was in regular contact with Tokayev. A journalist working with ABC News contributed to this report from Almaty, Kazakhstan.",10
2022-01-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/year-election-rnc-spending-hundreds-thousands-cover-trumps/story?id=82114367,"A year after election, RNC still spending hundreds of thousands to cover Trump's legal bills","More than a year after the 2020 presidential election, the GOP is still covering numerous legal bills for the benefit of former President Donald Trump -- and the price tag is ruffling the feathers of some longtime GOP donors who are now critical of Trump. In October and November alone, the Republican National Committee spent nearly $720,000 of its donor money on paying law firms representing Trump in various legal challenges, including criminal investigations into his businesses in New York, according to campaign finance records. Trump's legal bills have sent the Republican Party's total legal expenditures soaring in recent months, resulting in $3 million spent just between September and November. In contrast, the Democratic National Committee has been gradually winding down its legal expenses over the last few months. Traditionally, national political parties have at times covered presidents and their advisers' legal fees in matters related to their presidential campaigns. And throughout his presidency, the Republican Party has footed legal bills for Trump, his family members and his political allies, going back to the days of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the 2016 election, through the impeachment proceedings following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But experts say the GOP's recent payments of Trump's attorney fees after he left the White House, for investigations that are not relevant to the next presidential campaign, is a very unusual move that's indicative of the ongoing influence that the former president has over the party. ""Campaign finance law does not strictly prohibit a national party committee from paying for private legal expenses, but it is very rare for a party committee to use donor money in that way,"" said Brendan Fischer, federal reforms director at nonpartisan government ethics group Campaign Legal Center. ""And it is entirely unprecedented for a national party committee to cover a former president's private legal bills, especially when those legal expenses arise out of an investigation into activity that preceded Trump's time in the White House, and when Trump is sitting on millions of his own PAC funds,"" Fischer said. RNC spokesperson Emma Vaughn told ABC News that the RNC's executive committee approved paying for ""certain legal expenses that related to politically motivated legal proceedings waged against President Trump,"" while declining to comment on which specific cases are being paid for. ""As a leader of our party, defending President Trump and his record of achievement is critical to the GOP,"" Vaughn said. ""It is entirely appropriate for the RNC to continue assisting in fighting back against the Democrats' never ending witch hunt and attacks on him."" The RNC has so far paid three law firms on behalf of Trump, paying $328,000 to NechelesLaw LLP, $200,000 to van der Veen, Hartshorn and Levin, and $172,000 to Fischetti & Malgieri LLP, according to its recent disclosure filings. The Washington Post reported that the RNC has agreed to pay up to $1.6 million of Trump's legal bills. Fischetti & Malgieri represents Trump in the parallel investigations by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and New York state Attorney General Letitia James into the business practices of Trump's eponymous company. Vance and James have said their investigations are not politically motivated. Susan Necheles of NechelesLaw reportedly joined the legal team representing Trump and the Trump Organization last summer. Michael van der Veen was part of Trump's defense team during the impeachment proceedings after Jan. 6. The law firm payments haven't sat well with some Trump critics within the GOP. ""It is very disheartening to see RNC donors funding Trump's legal bills,"" former Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., told ABC News. Rooney, who is among several Republican lawmakers who announced their retirement after clashing with pro-Trump forces within the GOP, was previously a U.S. ambassador to the Holy See under the Bush administration and a generous donor to the Republican Party, giving upwards of $1 million to various GOP candidates and groups over the years. ""I used to support the RNC quite a bit, especially when Reince Priebus was there,"" Rooney said. ""But I don't see myself doing it right now because they keep giving money to Trump."" Many Republicans are ""exhausted and bothered by"" Trump allies' continued election challenges, Rooney said, ""because all it's doing is giving a lot of grist to people who want to oppose the Republican Party, at least the one that I used to know."" ""We're getting tarred with this big lie and this claim of election fraud, and that is damaging our most important institution in our country -- belief in elections,"" Rooney said. The RNC's financial support of Trump's legal bills also complicates the party's vow to remain neutral ahead of nominating process for the 2024 presidential election. ""The party has to stay neutral. I'm not telling anybody to run or not to run in 2024,"" RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said last January. She has since reaffirmed that Trump ""still leads the party."" Financial support notwithstanding, the GOP and Trump have not always had a smooth relationship over the past year. In the final days of Trump's presidency, Trump told McDaniel he was leaving the GOP and creating his own political party, only to back down after McDaniel threatened to stop paying Trump's legal bills for his post-election challenges, according to a book by ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl. Both Trump and McDaniel have denied the story. Not long after that, Trump and the party again clashed over the use of Trump's name in fundraising appeals, with the GOP eventually reaching an agreement to use his name. In addition to covering many of Trump's legal bills, the RNC has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars supporting lawsuits across the country ""to ensure the integrity of our elections,"" said RNC spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez. Gearing up for the 2022 election cycle, the RNC has been building an aggressive nationwide ""election integrity program,"" engaging in election-related lawsuits in states like Georgia, Florida, Arizona and Texas, stationing state-directors in battleground states, engaging hundreds of attorneys at the state level and training thousands of poll watchers. The party is engaged in 30 such ""election integrity"" lawsuits, Alvarez said, with financial disclosures showing payments of $500,000 to the law firm of Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, more than $260,000 to McGuireWoods, and $243,000 to Consovoy McCarthy PLLC. Even with all the legal expenditures, the RNC has continued to build a huge war chest over the past year. Backed by megadonors that include Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman and casino mogul Steve Wynn, the RNC ended November with more than $65 million in cash on hand.",11
2022-01-10,https://abcnews.go.com/International/kazakhstans-president-order-restored-crackdown-protests/story?id=82175066,Kazakhstan's president says order restored after crackdown on protests,"Kazakhstan’s president said Monday ""constitutional order"" has been restored in the country and that his government is in control following assistance from Russian-led troops to quell the mass protests that erupted against his regime last week. Security forces have been re-establishing the government’s grip across the country since late last week, conducting what it calls an ""anti-terrorist operation"" to end the unrest. Last week troops used live fire in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s biggest city, to clear the streets amid the anti-government protests in which authorities say over 160 people were killed. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said the large-scale phase of the ""anti-terrorist operation"" would soon finish as he addressed a virtual summit of the leaders of the Russia-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), which last week sent 2,300 troops to Kazakhstan to help him quell the protests. Tokayev requested the alliance send troops as his government wobbled. But he said the foreign troops’ mission in Kazakhstan would end at the same time as the ""anti-terrorist operation."" ""In the near future the large-scale anti-terrorist operation will finish and with it will finish the successful and effective mission of the CSTO contingent,” he told the leaders on the call that included Russian President Vladimir Putin. Protests began in Kazakhstan last week over a sudden hike in fuel prices but quickly escalated into a major challenge to Kazakhstan’s regime that saw government buildings stormed, including in Almaty where the mayor’s office was set on fire and the airport overrun. Tokayev claimed the unrest had been an ""attempted coup"" carried out ""under the guise of spontaneous protests"" and involving well-trained fighters. Kazakhstan's interior ministry said nearly 8,000 people have been arrested during the protests. Units from Russian paratrooper brigades have deployed to Kazakhstan alongside several hundred from other members of the alliance, which consists of ex-Soviet countries including Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, but which is dominated by Moscow. Western countries have expressed concern that the Russian intervention could see Kazakhstan's independence erode and Russian troops may not leave once the unrest is over. Putin at the virtual summit dismissed that idea, saying the Russian-led troops would remain in the country for ""a limited period"" determined by Kazakhstan’s president and that ""without question"" they would leave once they had completed their tasks. He said the situation in Kazakhstan was ""gradually normalizing"" and that in the ""near future all of the country will be definitively taken under control and stabilized."" Putin backed Tokayev’s version that foreign and internal forces had tried to exploit the protests to carry out a violent coup, also claiming that fighters trained in terrorist camps abroad had taken part. ""We understand, of course, that the threat to Kazakhstan’s statehood was brought about in no way by spontaneous protests over fuel prices but by destructive internal and external forces using the situation,"" Putin said, adding that protesters and those ""who took up weapons"" were ""completely different people."" Putin claimed the unrest was caused by ""foreign interference"" and that the Russian-led alliance had helped prevent a ""Color Revolution"" in Kazakhstan, a catch-all phrase the Kremlin uses to refer to popular uprisings in former Soviet states that it claims are instigated by Western countries. Putin has alleged that Ukraine’s 2014 revolution that toppled its Russian-backed president was a Western-backed coup. In 2020 he came to the aid of Belarus’ authoritarian ruler, Alexander Lukashenko, amid mass peaceful protests against his rule. Lukashenko this week also sent troops to Kazakhstan. “Of course we understand that the event in Kazakhstan were not the first and not the last attempts at outside interference in our states,” Putin said. The unrest in Kazakhstan last week remains clouded in uncertainty and there has been growing speculation that an internal power struggle between rival parts of its elite may also have taken place during the chaos of the protests. The speculation was fueled after Tokayev arrested the former head of Kazakhstan’s security service, Karim Masimov, on suspicion of treason. Masimov was a close ally of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the longtime strongman who has dominated the country since the fall of the Soviet Union. Nazarbayev, who is 81, sought to manage his succession by handing the presidency to Tokayev in 2019 but retained considerable power as chairman of the national security council and holds the honorary title ""Leader of the Nation."" The arrested security service chief, Masimov, was a long-time lieutenant of Nazarbayev and was widely seen as his appointee to keep a check on Tokayev following the transition. Theories of an internal clash have been spurred by the mysterious absence of Nazarbayev, who has not been seen in public since the protests began, though his press secretary has insisted he is in the country and in contact with Tokayev. There is little evidence so far to prove the theories, although some protesters in Almaty have also said their peaceful demonstrations were overtaken by armed gangs of men who appeared organized and who led the attacks on government buildings. Almaty on Monday was reported to be quiet again, four days after security services re-took the streets, firing on protesters. The city is under heavy military control, with troops guarding key building and a curfew is in place. There have been signs of some attempts to return normality, as television channels showed crews clear some of the burnt cars and fix buildings ransacked during the unrest. An ABC News reporter in Almaty has said it has been hard to buy food in recent days, with most shops closed and only bread being delivered.",10
2022-01-11,https://abcnews.go.com/International/kazakhstans-president-russian-troops-start-leaving-week/story?id=82195762,Kazakhstan's president says Russian troops to start leaving this week,"Russian-led troops sent to help quell protests will begin leaving Kazakhstan in two days now that the government is back in control, the country's president has said. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in an address to Kazakhstan's parliament Tuesday said the troops, deployed by the Moscow-dominated military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation at his request last week, would start a phased withdrawal that would finish in no more than 10 days. ""The main mission of the CSTO peacekeeping forces has been successfully completed,"" Tokayev told lawmakers. He said that the situation was now stable in all regions of Kazakhstan. The Russian-led alliance sent troops late last week to Kazakhstan as violent protests saw Tokayev's authoritarian government lose control over its biggest city, Almaty. Russia sent the largest contingent, deploying paratroopers units with armored vehicles, backed by several hundred soldiers from the other former Soviet countries in the alliance: Belarus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Tokayev has said the force numbers around 2,300 troops. In recent days, Tokayev's security forces have forcibly regained control in Kazakhstan, using live fire to end the uprising in Almaty and arresting nearly 10,000 people. The unrest saw at least 164 people killed and over 2,000 injured, according to authorities. The Russian-led troops have not been used in combat or in direct clashes with protesters, according to the authorities, who say instead they were used to guard key facilities, including Almaty's airport which was overrun by protesters. Tokayev has said the arrival of the foreign forces freed up his security forces in the capital Nur-Sultan to help quash the unrest in other regions. The Russian intervention had worried Western countries that have expressed fear the Kremlin's forces might remain indefinitely and that Kazakhstan could find its independence eroded. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken this weekend told reporters, ""I think one lesson in recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave."" Russia's president Vladimir Putin a day earlier has insisted his troops would ""without question"" leave as soon as their mission was complete. Life was slowly returning to some normalcy in Almaty on Tuesday, although the city remained under heavy guard by security forces. Troops are posted at key buildings and checkpoints, stopping people and examining their phones for signs they may have taken part in the protests, according to an ABC reporter on the ground. Tokayev on Tuesday announced his picks for a new government, including a new prime minister. The lower house of parliament quickly approved Tokayev's acting prime minister, Alikhan Smailov, to the the post. In a special session of parliament, Tokayev also promised to launch broad reforms to overhaul Kazakhstan's government and tackle economic problems in the country -- addressing concerns that led to the protests. The unrest was triggered by a sudden hike in fuel prices, and came amid wide discontent with rising prices on basic goods and stagnant wages that have worsened with the pandemic. Tokayev said his government would announce a new packet of measures within two months aimed at tackling inflation and raising incomes. He also declared he would radically improve Kazakhstan's security forces to prevent a repeat of last week's unrest, promising to increase the number of special forces units in the police and create new ones in the national guard. He also promised to announce in September a packet of political reforms, saying Kazakhstan would ""continue a course of political modernisation.""",10
2022-01-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/endgame-eludes-democrats-voting-rights-urgency-note/story?id=82184094,Endgame eludes Democrats despite voting rights urgency: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The fight over voting rights has always turned on who has the votes. That's been true in the states that have changed their laws since 2020, whatever inspiration lawmakers might have drawn from. It's true at the federal level, where nothing substantial has changed despite repeated pushes by Democrats. That will remain true until or unless a few Democratic senators change their minds on changing Senate rules, regardless of the new focus President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris bring to voting rights and the Senate filibuster on Tuesday. ""The question is: Where will the institution of United States Senate stand?"" Biden plans to say, according to excerpts released Tuesday morning by the White House. The Biden-Harris trip to Georgia is designed to bring fresh attention and emotion in a place where voting rights have long been and continue to be relevant. But even the urgency isn't really new; among other notable moments, last year featured the Texas Democrats' weeks-long walkout and so much attention on Georgia's new laws that Major League Baseball pulled the All-Star Game from Atlanta. Those were supposed to galvanize Congress to act to override newly passed state laws. So were several major speeches by the president himself: Almost exactly six months ago, he went to the National Constitution Center to highlight what he called a ""21st century Jim Crow assault,"" and called for a ""coalition of Americans"" to ""raise the urgency of this moment."" It's possible that the effort to raise the urgency has and will continue to succeed -- yet it's also possible that the voting bills that passed the House still never get out of the Senate. That notion is part of the unusual pushback Biden is facing from allies, with some civil rights leaders urging the president and vice president to not even make the trip. ""We don't need another speech. What we need is action,"" Cliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, told reporters Monday in a conference call in advance of the visit. ""What we need is a plan."" The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema As Democrats renew efforts to bolster voting rights, Republicans are digging in on their positions against federal voting legislation while appearing confident in seeing a 2022 bicameral majority in their futures. Ahead of the president's remarks in Georgia, ABC News' Mariam Khan reported that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell laid into his Democratic colleagues on Monday, accusing them of ""bullying"" members into changing the Senate rules if their voting rights bills don't pass. ""The Senate Democratic leaders are trying to use a 'big lie' to bully and berate their own members into breaking their word, breaking the rules and breaking the Senate,"" McConnell said in a floor speech. The minority leader also went on to call Democrats' federal legislative efforts on voting laws a matter of ""fake hysteria"" that he said undercuts the ""core identity"" of the Senate. McConnell's assertions took place against the backdrop of his House counterpart, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, mapping out early plans to punish a handful of high-profile House Democrats if Republicans take back the House and he becomes Speaker. In an interview with Breitbart, McCarthy expressed plans to strip Reps. Adam Schiff, Ilhan Omar and Eric Swalwell from their committee assignments. All three lawmakers were painted as Republican antagonists throughout former President Donald Trump's time in office. The TIP with Hannah Demissie The first congressional election of 2022 is taking place Tuesday in Florida's heavily Democratic 20th Congressional District, where voters will ​head to the ballot box to fill the seat held by the late Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings, who passed away in April. After months of campaigning, Democratic contender Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a health care company executive, is favored to win over Republican candidate Jason Mariner, an advertising executive and former convict. Many special elections wind up taking place in heavily Democratic or Republican districts, where the takeaway is the final margin more than which party wins. If Democrats have a strong winning lead in this race, the success could lay the groundwork for motivating voters to the polls in future midterm contests.

2022-01-13,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-troops-begin-leaving-kazakhstan-government-restores-control/story?id=82243668,Russian troops begin leaving Kazakhstan after government restores control,"Russian-led troops sent to help Kazakhstan’s government quell violent protests have begun leaving the country, according to Russia’s defense minister. Roughly 2,300 troops were dispatched to Kazakhstan last week by a Moscow-dominated alliance of former Soviet countries, after Kazakhstan’s president appealed for assistance amid the protests that saw his government lose control in the country’s biggest city, Almaty. Kazakhstan’s government has since re-established its grip after its security forces forcibly ended the unrest, using live fire to clear the streets in Almaty, where over a hundred were killed. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev this week announced the foreign troops from the alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), had completed their mission and could leave now that the situation in the country was stable. Russia’s defense ministry on Thursday said the first Russian paratrooper units had taken off from Almaty. Four Il-76 transports would fly the troops and their equipment to their base in the Russian city Ivanovo, the ministry said. Sergey Shoigu, Russia’s defense minister, said the withdrawal was ongoing and would be completed by Jan. 19. In a televised meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Shoigu said the several hundred troops from other CSTO countries — Tajikistan, Belarus and Armenia — would all leave on Russian aircraft on Friday. A contingent sent from neighboring Kyrgyzstan would leave by land, Shoigu said. Putin in the meeting said the troops had completed their mission and thanked Russia’s military command. “On the whole we need to return home — we’ve completed our task,” Putin said. Video published by Kazakh news media on Thursday showed CSTO troops taking part in a farewell ceremony in Kazakhstan, marching on a parade ground at a military institute in Almaty. Photos also showed Russian paratrooper boarding transport planes at the city’s airport. Russia sent the largest contingent from the CSTO alliance, which was established as Moscow’s answer to NATO following the fall of the Soviet Union. The deployment was the first time Russia has acted through the alliance to assist a friendly regime against street protests in one of its former Soviet neighbors. Peaceful protests began in Kazakhstan over fuel prices but they escalated into a violent uprising against Tokayev’s regime in the middle of last week. Armed mobs stormed government buildings and there was widespread looting in Almaty. Tokayev and Putin have claimed foreign-backed forces inside the country sought to exploit the unrest to stage an “attempted coup” against Tokayev. Russia deployed soldiers as well as armored vehicles from the 45th Guards Special Purpose brigade, the 98th Guards Airborne Division and the 31st Separate Guards Order. The Russian-led troops were not used in combat operations or against protesters, according to Kazakhstan’s authorities. Instead the foreign soldiers were used to guard key facilities, freeing up Kazakh security forces to restore order elsewhere, the government said. Russia’s defense ministry released video of Russian troops patrolling a power station. Western countries, worried about Russian intervention in Kazakhstan, expressed concerns about whether Moscow might seek a more permanent presence in the country and whether its independence could be eroded. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken last week told reporters: ""One lesson in recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave.” The situation in Kazakhstan has calmed and Tokayev’s government appears to be back in control. In Almaty, normal life is returning, although there remains a heavy security presence in the city, according to an ABC reporter there. Kazakhstan’s authorities said they arrested nearly 10,000 people during the protests. The interior ministry on Thursday said 524 people were currently in pre-trial detention and that 412 of them had been charged with offenses relating to the unrest. At least 164 people died, including 18 police officers, and over two thousand were injured, according to the government.",10
2022-01-17,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bipartisan-group-senators-meet-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-russian/story?id=82308925,Bipartisan group of senators meet with Ukraine President Zelenskyy as Russian troops amass on border,"A bipartisan group of seven U.S. senators arrived in Ukraine Monday to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other officials in what they say is a show of commitment to the country as an ""increasingly belligerent Russia"" bears down on its border. ""Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Roger Wicker (R-MS) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) announced they are traveling to Ukraine this week to meet with President Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials to reaffirm the U.S.' commitment to Ukraine, which continues to face an increasingly belligerent Russia,"" said a statement released by the group Monday. Shaheen said in a tweet the meeting was productive and made clear that ""Putin will not be allowed to target our Eastern European partners and allies w/o consequences."" ABC News Senior Foreign Correspondent Ian Pannell met up with Sens. Shaheen and Murphy in Kyiv to discuss the purpose of their trip. ""I think the United States is interested, as we've heard from the officials we've met with today, that deterrence is much preferable to conflict. And so we are going to continue to do everything we can diplomatically to try and keep Russia at the table with Ukraine to see if there isn't some way to avoid a hot war here,"" Shaheen told Pannell. ""But again, it can't come at the expense of the future of this country."" Shaheen called the situation critical, saying a Russian incursion could come soon. ""We're talking about weeks, maybe a month or two, but we're not talking about six months, years. We're talking about a short timeframe,"" she said. On Friday a U.S. official said an invasion could come between now and mid-February and accused Russia of preparing to set a false pretext to attack. Later that day, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby also accused Russia of planning a ""false-flag"" operation to make an invasion of Ukraine appear defensive rather than offensive. ""We have information that they've pre-positioned a group of operatives to conduct what we call a false-flag operation – an operation designed to look like an attack on them or their people, or Russian speaking people in Ukraine, as an excuse to go in,"" Kirby said. Murphy told Pannell he would not be surprised by such deception from Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Anybody that's been paying any bit of attention to Vladimir Putin over the course of his career should know that he's an expert in false-flag operations and that he is willing to do anything and everything in order to avoid culpability for the actions that he undertakes,"" Murphy said. ""I think we all need to be on the lookout for what may be a Russian instigated attempt to try to start a hot war very soon."" Murphy said he hopes to convey that despite division in Washington politics, Republicans and Democrats are united in support for ""serious, unprecedented crushing sanctions on Russia"" if it moves further into Ukraine. ""I think what we need to explain to Russia is that this is not going to be bloodless. This is not going to be without pain,"" Murphy said. ""The United States people are going to support a Ukrainian population that's going to continue to fight back."" He continued, ""This is going to be a Ukrainian people every single day scrapping for their very survival, and that is going to be something that the American public will want us as members of the United States Senate to support.""",7
2022-01-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-report-card-year-accomplishments-stalled-priorities/story?id=82331377,"Biden's report card: 1 year in, accomplishments and stalled priorities","With the United States facing many of the same crises that Joe Biden took on when he took office one year ago, the president has been taking stock of his legislative accomplishments -- including major infrastructure and coronavirus relief packages -- and has stayed upbeat even as his popularity plummets and key priorities remain unmet. ""There's a lot of talk about disappointments and things we haven't gotten done,"" Biden said last week. ""We're going to get a lot of them done, I might add."" From fighting the pandemic and rebuilding the economy, to dealing with racial strife and combating climate change, Biden faces a mixed report card of what he's been able to accomplish, as the limits of his office -- and political realities he's had trouble overcoming -- launch him into a challenging second year in the White House. From his first day in office, Biden set a different tone on COVID-19 from his predecessor, President Donald Trump. He embraced science and his top medical advisers -- like Dr. Anthony Fauci -- donned face coverings, and expressed sympathy for lives lost to the virus. Biden pushed a $1.9 trillion relief package through Congress, oversaw a testing program that ramped up exponentially in his first months in office, and encouraged or mandated masks where he could, including on planes and other public transport. Sixty-three percent of Americans are now fully vaccinated and nearly all schools have in-person instruction. And while the Supreme Court this month blocked his administration from requiring large businesses to mandate their workers get vaccinated or test weekly, many companies have instituted vaccine and testing requirements regardless. But after Biden predicted that the Fourth of July last year would ""begin to mark our independence from this virus,"" the delta and omicron variants drove up cases, hospitalizations and deaths -- and overwhelmed U.S. hospitals. Shifting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a testing shortage amid the omicron surge led public health experts to criticize his administration. A group of Senate Democrats said ""far too many measures"" his White House had taken ""have been reactive, rather than proactive."" And fewer Americans than ever now approve of the way Biden is handling COVID. ""If you take a look,"" Biden said earlier this month, ""we’re very different today than we were a year ago, even though we still have problems."" On Tuesday, a White House official said, the Biden administration would make 400 million non-surgical N95 masks available to Americans for free and a government website went live allowing them to order free at-home tests. Biden delivered on two key economic promises: a $1.9 trillion COVID relief package and a $1.2 trillion infrastructure law that passed with bipartisan support. He presided over the economy's resurgence last year, with a record 6.4 million jobs created, rising wages and low unemployment -- dropping to just 3.9% in December. But inflation was up a record 6.8% over the course of the year, outpacing wage growth for many Americans. The White House initially labeled rising prices temporary in nature, and this month said they expected price jumps to moderate this year. Global supply chain headaches have also led to shipping delays, although most packages reached consumers on time for the holidays. While his infrastructure bill marked a major win, Biden ended his first year in office with two top domestic priorities, his nearly $2 trillion ""Build Back Better"" social plan and a pair of voting rights bills, stalled in the Senate despite passing the House. That's in large part due to the intransigence of two key Democratic senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The pair's opposition to changing Senate rules -- over Biden's pleas -- has allowed Republicans to block legislation that would widen access to voting and federal oversight of elections. Meanwhile, the president's negotiations with Manchin on the social spending plan -- which includes universal preschool, expanding the child tax credit, an historical investment in climate policies and more health coverage, among other policies -- hit a roadblock last month. Biden had pledged to take on climate change and racial equity as key priorities, and while he has signed executive orders aimed at both, legislative pushes -- climate action in the ""Build Back Better"" bill, and police reform measures -- have failed to garner bipartisan support despite Biden's pledge to soften political divisions. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that Biden would continue to ""advocate for both"" voting rights and the ""Build Back Better"" bill. ""You don't get everything done in the first year,"" she said. The president traveled twice to Europe last year, declaring to allies that ""America is back,"" reaffirming traditional relationships and returning the U.S. to international organizations and agreements like the World Health Organization and Paris climate accord. Seeking to end America's involvement in Afghanistan, he withdrew troops from the country before the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks -- but in the chaotic final days, a terror attack killed 13 American service members. He has found it difficult to bring Iran back to the agreement over its nuclear program, which Trump scrapped, while North Korea has continued to test missiles despite U.S. misgivings. As he juggles long-term competition with China and bringing about worldwide consensus on fighting climate change, Biden has in recent months found one of his most acute foreign policy challenges to be Russia's military build-up on its border with Ukraine. Biden has threatened severe consequences – economic and otherwise – should Russian President Vladimir Putin decide to invade. Just two weeks after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Biden stood on the building's steps for his inauguration and preached about the need for unity. Biden predicted Republicans would have an ""epiphany"" after Trump left office, but that has not materialized. In an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in late December, 71% of Republicans said they sided with Trump's false claims that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election. Trump's lies about the election -- and politicization of the pandemic -- continue to guide Republicans, both in Washington and across the country. And Biden this month used his strongest language yet to describe Republicans opposed to passing voting rights bills, comparing those opposed to his measures to notorious racial segregationists.

2022-01-19,https://abcnews.go.com/US/Style/fashion-icon-andre-leon-talley-dead-73/story?id=82341172,Fashion icon Andre Leon Talley dead at 73,"Fashion icon and former Vogue editor André Leon Talley has died at age 73, a statement released on his official Instagram confirmed late Tuesday. ""It is with great sadness we announce the passing of André Leon Talley on January 18, 2022 in New York,"" the statement read. ""Mr. Talley was the larger-than-life, longtime creative director at Vogue during its rise to dominance as the world's fashion bible."" The cause of his death was not disclosed. ""Over the past five decades as an international icon was a close confidant of Yves Saint Laurent, Karl Lagerfeld, Paloma Picasso and he had a penchant for discovering, nurturing and celebrating young designers. His byline appeared in Vanity Fair, HG, Interview, Ebony and Women's Wear Daily and he was the editor of Numero Russia,"" the statement continued. ""Mr. Talley wrote several books, including Valentino, A.L.T.: A Memoir, A.L.T. 365+ and Little Black Dress for Assouline, and contributed to Valentino: At the Emperor's Table and Cartier Panthère. He was the subject of the documentary The Gospel According to André and his recent memoir, The Chiffon Trenches became a New York Times Best Seller."" Talley was an American fashion journalist known for his work in shaping U.S. Vogue and fashion as a whole. He was the magazine's fashion news director from 1983 to 1987 and its creative director from 1988 to 1995. He was later made editor-at-large, a position he held until 2013. Talley, who later became the head of Numéro Russia magazine, remained an occasional contributor to Vogue following his departure as editor, and in 2019, wrote a piece honoring his late friend, designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in February of that year. ""In 2014, he was named artistic director of Zappos Couture, and he has been on the Board of Trustees of Savannah College of Art and Design since 2000,"" according to the statement on his Instagram. ""Mr. Talley was awarded the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Republic in 2020 and the North Carolina Governor's award for literature in 2021. He was a long-standing member of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church."" Apart from his contributions to Vogue, the six-foot-six star, known and loved for his sense of humor, honesty and loud, luxurious personal style -- especially when it came to designer caftans -- was an author, curator and TV personality. He starred in ""America's Next Top Model"" for four seasons, as a judge, made cameos on ""Empire"" and the first ""Sex and the City"" movie, dressed and profiled then-first lady Michelle Obama for Vogue, had a front row seat at the most prestigious couture shows around the world, became the muse and confidant of many designers -- including Oscar de la Renta, whom he curated a museum exhibition for in 2018 -- and, for many years, was the right-hand man of fashion's leading lady: Anna Wintour. In 2017, filmmaker Kate Novack released a documentary, ""The Gospel According to Andre,"" about the style legend -- starting from his humble upbringing to his rise to the top of the fashion industry. Throughout his career, the Durham, North Carolina, native made efforts to introduce more culturally diverse voices into the overwhelmingly white fashion industry and spoke out about his struggles with racism. In his 2020 book, ""The Chiffon Trenches: A Memoir,"" he recalled the emotion he felt when Edward Enninful was named the first Black editor-in-chief of British Vogue. That same year, Talley sent shockwaves across the fashion world when he spoke out about the lack of Black talent at Vogue. ""At one point, I was the only Black person on Anna's staff,"" he told Mail Online. In his 2003 memoir, ""A.L.T.,"" Talley described his childhood in Durham, where he was raised by his grandmother and worked as a taxi driver to save money. When it was time for college, he enrolled in North Carolina Central University, where he majored in French, and later, got a scholarship to Brown University, for his master's. Soon after graduating, Talley got his first job in fashion as a volunteer assistant to Diana Vreeland at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. Once inside the fashion bubble, he landed a position at Andy Warhol's Interview magazine, where his career as a journalist took off, and later moved around to WWD, Vanity Fair, Vogue and various other publications. Talley had largely stayed off social media since 2021, when he was involved in a financial mess over the ownership of the Westchester mansion where he lived since 2004, and which previously belonged to the former CEO of Manolo Blahnik. After hearing of his death, fashion insiders and friends have taken to social media to share their condolences and honor his memory. “The loss of Andre is felt by so many of us today: the designers he enthusiastically cheered on every season, and who loved him for it; the generations he inspired to work in the industry, seeing a figure who broke boundaries while never forgetting where he started from; those who knew fashion, and Vogue, simply because of him; and, not forgetting, the multitude of colleagues over the years who were consistently buoyed by every new discovery of Andre’s, which he would discuss loudly, and volubly — no one could make people more excited about the most seemingly insignificant fashion details than him,"" said Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour in a statement. ""Even his stream of colorful faxes and emails were a highly anticipated event, something we all looked forward to,” she continued. ""Yet it’s the loss of Andre as my colleague and friend that I think of now; it’s immeasurable. He was magnificent and erudite and wickedly funny — mercurial, too. Like many decades-long relationships, there were complicated moments, but all I want to remember today, all I care about, is the brilliant and compassionate man who was a generous and loving friend to me and to my family for many, many years, and who we will all miss so much."" Designer Diane von Furstenberg wrote on Instagram, ""Good bye darling André ❤️🙏… no one saw the world in a more glamorous way than you did ❤️🙏… no one was grander and more soulful than you were ❤️🙏…the world will be less joyfulI ❤️🙏 I have loved you and laughed with you for 45 years…. I miss your loud screams …I love you soooo much ❤️🙏."" Marc Jacobs posted a throwback photo of himself with Talley on Instagram, and wrote in the caption, ""I am in shock. You championed me and you have been my friend since my beginning. Our chats, the moments we shared….oh my friend. You and your passions were larger than life. I love you and I will miss you dear Andre. Rest In Peace."" Lindsay Peoples Wagner, editor in chief of The Cut, wrote on Instagram: ""Not even sure how to wrap my mind around all you've done, and the legacy you've left behind, but you gave us hope and aspirations that we never would have dreamed if it hadn't been for you andre."" ""Thank you for your knowledge and passion for fashion and glamour,"" designer Bob Mackie wrote on Instagram. ""You will be missed."" Hollywood and Broadway praised Talley as a man who dressed himself and others with a singular vision. ""Rest well king,"" Viola Davis wrote on Instagram. Talley was a ""truly original heart, spirit and mind. He cast a giant shadow and will not soon be forgotten,"" author and actor Harvey Fierstein said on Twitter. ""For a little black gay boy who reached for the stars from the south there were few people I could look up to up there amongst the stars who looked like me just more fab except for you Andre,"" playwright Jeremy O. Harris said on Twitter. ""For a generation of boys Andre Leon Talley was a beacon of grace and aspiration. RIP."" - ABC News' Jacqueline Laurean Yates contributed to this report.",27
2022-01-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-hold-rare-solo-news-conference-ahead-year/story?id=82348209,Biden defensive in rare solo news conference ahead of 1-year mark in office,"On the eve of the one-year anniversary of his inauguration, President Joe Biden held a formal news conference at the White House Wednesday, fielding reporter questions on his handling of the pandemic, the economy and his legislative agenda, characterizing the country as unified -- but not as much as it could be -- and raising eyebrows by saying Russia was likely to invade Ukraine. ""It's been a year of challenges, but it's also many years of enormous progress,"" Biden said to begin, ticking through his administration's successes before fielding questions from reporters. With Biden facing the limits of what he can accomplish with an evenly-divided Senate, unable to get either his signature social spending package or major voting rights reform through Congress in recent weeks, and with the pandemic still raging well into its second, his approval rating in polls has hit an all-time low. A Jan. 12 Quinnipiac poll found his approval rating to be 33%, a 3-point drop from November. Questioned at one point on the falling numbers indicating Americans are unhappy with his job performance, Biden replied bluntly, ""I don't believe the polls."" The president touted wins over the last year to kick off the news conference, including administering more than 200 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and hitting record-low unemployment rates in many states. ""Should we have done more testing earlier? Yes,"" Biden said in his opening remarks. ""But we're doing more now. We've gone from zero at-home tests a year ago to 375 million tests on the market just this month."" He said the bottom line on COVID-19 is the country is ""in a better place than we've been and have been thus far"" and reiterated his position not to go back to lockdowns and school closures. ""Some people may call what's happening now a new normal. I call it a job not yet finished,"" Biden said with confidence. ""We're moving toward a time that COVID-19 won't disrupt our daily lives or COVID-19 won't be a crisis, but something to protect against and a threat. Look, we're not there yet. We will get there."" The first question to Biden was on whether he believes he overpromised to the American public what his administration could achieve in office one year in. ""Look, I didn't overpromise,"" a defensive Biden replied. ""I have probably outperformed what anybody thought would happen. The fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where we have made enormous progress."" Then, he acknowledged a weakness. ""One thing I haven't been able to do so far, is get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country,"" Biden said. ""I did not anticipate that there'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn't get anything done."" In an answer to ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce, Biden said, at first, there's no need to scale back his agenda despite the appearance that Democrats aren't getting their priorities through -- before conceding he'd be willing to break up policy items in order to pass provisions that do have bipartisan support. ""I'm not trying to -- I'm not asking for castles in the sky,"" Biden replied. ""I'm asking for practical things the American people have been asking for for a long time, a long time. And I think we can get it done."" Biden told Bruce, ""I'm confident we can get pieces -- big chunks of the Build Back Better law signed into law"" -- appearing to back breaking up the landmark legislation publicly for the first time. Asked later on to follow up on whether he would split up Democrats' proposed expansion to the social safety net, Biden said, ""It's clear to me we're going to have to, probably, break it up."" ""I'm not going to negotiate myself as to what should and shouldn't be in it, but I think we can break the package up, get as much as we can now, and come back and fight for the rest later,"" he added. The massive package includes items from free universal pre-K to paid federal family and medical leave. ""But I also think we will be able to get significant pieces of legislation -- if we don't get it all now -- to build to get it so that we get a big chunk of the John Lewis legislation (John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act) as well as the fair elections act (For the People Act),"" Biden said. On foreign policy, Biden said for the first publicly that he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin will likely invade Ukraine -- but warned that he would ""pay a serious and dear price for it."" However, in a couple of answers on Ukraine, NATO, and Russia, Biden all but admitted NATO is not united on how to respond and seemed to draw a red line short of an all-out invasion for a unified Western response -- potentially giving Putin space for something less than troops crossing the border, but still highly destabilizing for Ukraine. While Biden said he still believed Putin still did not want ""any full blown-war,"" Biden said he believes Putin will ""test"" the United States as significantly as he could. Not long after Biden finished speaking, White House press secretary Jen Psaki issued a statement attempting to clarify Biden's assertion that a ""minor incursion"" might not elicit such a severe NATO response. ""President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that’s a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies. President Biden also knows from long experience that the Russians have an extensive playbook of aggression short of military action, including cyberattacks and paramilitary tactics. And he affirmed today that those acts of Russian aggression will be met with a decisive, reciprocal, and united response."" Speaking to his personal performance, Biden outlined three things he would do differently in his second year in office. He said he intended to get out of Washington more often to meet with Americans face to face, welcome ""more advice from outside experts"" for constructive criticism and become ""deeply involved in these off-year elections"" as the midterms approach. Questioned later on 2024 ambitions, Biden said Vice President Kamala Harris would be his running mate. He closed the nearly two-hour press conference by acknowledging it's the first time he's been in this role, while he's been in Washington for more than five decades, and that he needs to change his approach. ""And one of the things that I do think that has been made clear to me speaking of polling, is the public doesn't want me to be the President Senator. They want me to be the President and let senators be senators. And so, if I've made -- I’ve made any mistakes, I'm sure. If I made a mistake, I'm used to negotiating to get things done, and I've been in the past relatively successful in the United States Senate, even as vice president. And I think that role as president is a different role,"" he said. Psaki, one day earlier, set up a preemptive defense for the president, telling reporters, ""You don't get everything done in the first year."" ""But what we feel good about ... is that coming into an incredibly difficult circumstance, fighting a pandemic, an economic a massive economic downturn, as a result, an administration that was prior to us that did not effectively deal with a lot of these crises, that there's been a lot of progress made,"" she added. ""We need to build on that. The work is not done, the job is not done, and we are certainly not conveying it is, so our objective and I think what you'll hear the president talk about tomorrow is how to build on the foundation we laid in the first year, Psaki said. White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield cited the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief law, the American Rescue Plan, and a major, bipartisan infrastructure package as two achievements Biden will highlight in an appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Wednesday. But she also acknowledged the president can do more on other issues. ""He has been laser-focused on taming COVID and growing the economy. He would be the first to say we're not where we need to be on those,"" Bedingfield said. Wednesday's session marks just the second time Biden has held a solo formal press conference at the White House. The first such news conference was held March 25, 2021. Since then, he held five news conferences on foreign trips, and three in partnership with other foreign leaders at the White House, for a total of nine news conferences. While Biden often answers questions shouted by the press at other events, his tally of formal news conferences is the lowest for any president since Ronald Reagan, according to data from University of California Santa Barbara's American Presidency Project.

2022-01-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-infighting-worsens-bidens-year-mark-note/story?id=82334513,Democrats' infighting worsens at Biden’s 1-year mark: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein You can zoom in or out and see a similar picture – and President Joe Biden's challenge will be how to talk about it when that could be part of the problem as well. Biden holds a news conference marking his first year in office on Wednesday, at a moment that features familiar dynamics. There are COVID-19 and inflation frustrations, foreign policy provocations and Democrats divided among themselves even as they press forward in a Senate debate they know they won't win. The president is being measured -- harshly, according to recent polls -- against his own promises. Perhaps more than that, he's being held to account against the promise he once held. Biden always knew he was inheriting an angry nation with deep political divisions, including razor-thin majorities in both the House and Senate. Now, with those majorities in midterm-year danger, infighting has worsened inside his own party. Emily's List is now threatening to support a primary challenger to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is saying he might support primaries against both Sinema and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Biden's inaugural address, delivered just a day shy of one year ago, included the word ""unity"" eight times, including with this line: ""I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy."" As expected, that sentiment has been widely derided by Republicans. But at this moment, in particular, many Biden voters might agree more than they disagree. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Two Democratic House members added their names to the growing list of congressional lawmakers opting not to run for reelection during a high-stakes midterm year. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., and Rep. Jerry McNerney, D-Calif., announced, within minutes of each other Tuesday, that they wouldn't seek reelection. ""I have not come to this decision lightly, but it is time for me to chart a new course, which will allow me to stay closer to home and spend more time with my family and friends,"" wrote Langevin in an op-ed announcing his retirement. ""I will keep working for the people of my district throughout the remainder of my term and look forward to new opportunities to continue to serve,"" said McNerney in a Twitter thread. There are now 28 Democratic House members who have announced they won't run again, which is short of the 34 GOP House members who didn't seek reelection during the 2018 midterms. Republicans lost 35 seats during that midterm election cycle with former President Donald Trump in office. During former President Barack Obama's first term in 2010, 17 Democrats didn't seek reelection. That year, Democrats lost 63 seats. While both Langevin and McNerney's districts have a good chance of staying in Democratic hands, it does call attention to narrow margins in the House and a generally negative outlook for Democrats ahead of midterms. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Supply chain issues seem to be emerging everywhere -- including election administration in Texas, the nation's first state to hold primary elections this year. As some groups work to help register Texans to vote, they're encountering shortages of paper registration forms issued by the secretary of state's office. ""In some cases, we have not been able to send as many free voter registration applications to organizations and interest groups as they have requested. This is due to particularly acute supply chain issues that have delayed shipments of paper applications,"" Sam Taylor, assistant secretary of state for communications, told ABC News. Taylor added that ""the price of each paper application we have to order has increased significantly since the last time our office had to order paper voter registration applications on such a large scale."" The secretary of state's office says all requests from organizations are being treated the same way, and groups have been told that orders must be limited to 1,000-2,000 forms at a time before requesting more. The shortage is happening as groups seek out new voter registration forms that reflect updated phrasing regarding illegal voting penalty changes under the state's new voting law. According to Taylor, ""county voter registrars may accept completed voter registration applications on the old form, so long as the application is otherwise valid"" and ""using last year's form in and of itself is not fatal to the voter's registration application."" ONE MORE THING ABC News' Benjamin Siegel reported that the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack on Tuesday subpoenaed Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, who were among those who pushed claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election and for GOP officials to disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. ABC News also confirmed that the committee has acquired phone records from former President Donald Trump's son Eric and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fiancee of Donald Trump Jr. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-01-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cia-foreign-actor-havana-syndrome-cases/story?id=82376545,CIA says foreign actor may be behind some Havana syndrome cases,"The CIA has assessed that the ""majority"" of reported cases of unexplained medical symptoms known as ""Havana syndrome"" can be ""reasonably explained by medical conditions or environmental and technical factors,"" a senior CIA official told ABC News. The spy agency has assessed it's ""unlikely that a foreign actor, including Russia, is conducting a sustained, worldwide campaign harming U.S. personnel with a weapon or mechanism,"" they added. But they left the door open to the possibility that some personnel have been attacked by a still-unknown actor or device, saying a foreign actor's role has not been ruled out ""in specific cases. We're still looking."" The issue has vexed U.S. officials for over five years now after the first incidents were reported by personnel at the U.S. embassy in Cuba. Since then, scores of cases have been reported on nearly every continent in over a dozen countries, especially after the CIA and State Department urged employees to come forward if they experienced symptoms. But it was never clear how many of those reports were later confirmed as medically diagnosed cases. In a rare statement, CIA Director Bill Burns said those symptoms are ""real,"" his agency's commitment to providing care for officers is ""unwavering"" and its investigation is ""not done."" ""We are pursuing this complex issue with analytic rigor, round tradecraft, and compassion and have dedicated intensive resources to this challenge,"" he said. ""While underlying causes may differ, our officers are suffering real symptoms."" In a note to all staff obtained by ABC News, Secretary of State Antony Blinken also offered strong support for employees and encouraged diplomats and their families to continue reporting potential incidents. ""Those who have been affected have real stories to tell -- their pain is real. There is no doubt in my mind about that,"" he wrote. But many of the affected personnel are outraged or upset by the CIA's assessment, with some like Marc Polymeropoulos, a retired CIA agent who was affected while on assignment in Moscow, fearing they will not be believed or will be ""mocked and vilified."" ""I remain grateful of the health care that Director Burns has agreed to provide for those who have been impacted, but now victims are being shamed and mocked,"" Polymeropoulos said, calling it ""a return to the early days of Havana where officers were not believed."" A declassified internal government watchdog report found that the State Department moved too slowly to address the issues when personnel first reported incidents and symptoms in November 2016. Symptoms have included headaches, dizziness, cognitive difficulties, tinnitus, vertigo and trouble with seeing, hearing, or balancing. Many officials have suffered symptoms years after reporting an incident while some have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. Beyond Cuba, cases of what the Biden administration has called ""anomalous health incidents,"" or AHI's, have been reported in China, Austria, Germany, Vietnam, India, Uzbekistan and Colombia, among other countries. There have even been reports of incidents in the U.S., although the White House said the vast majority are overseas. But the CIA assessment found that ""previously undiagnosed illnesses, environmental factors, reporting out of an abundance of caution"" led to the majority of the cases, the senior official said. ""Many of the reports came in following growing workforce awareness of AHI's - after requests by departments and agencies for personnel to come forward,"" they added. ""This finding doesn't call into question at all the fact that our officers are reporting real symptoms and experiences. It's just that there's not one single cause that can be explained."" But after media reports emerged, some critics cast doubt again on whether U.S. personnel experienced anything at all, sparking anger in other corners that the CIA had undermined its personnel and those from other agencies. ""The CIA's interim conclusions are incredibly disappointing, insulting to those who are suffering, and highly suspect,"" whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid, who represents over a dozen affected employees, said in an email to ABC News. ""Once again, it is demonstrated that the failure of the government to produce a uniform, expert report only causes further controversy rather than resolution."" Zaid said the agency was ""more likely"" issuing it ""to allay a workforce which in recent months has been refusing overseas assignments in the wake of an overwhelming number of reported new cases among its ranks."" ""Other agencies [are] furious no coordination occurred & they disagree,"" he added in a tweet, calling the interim report ""disinformation."" ""It's not disinformation. That's absurd,"" the senior CIA official said in response, adding the assessment was conducted ""with the normal partners"" and through ""the intelligence community process."" Blinken also tried to address personnel's concerns about being believed. While he declined to address the assessment during a press conference in Berlin on Thursday, he told reporters employees ""have had real experiences, real symptoms, and real suffering, and we are going to continue to do everything we can with all the resources we can bring to bear to understand, again, what happened, why, and who might be responsible."" What is clear is that the report is preliminary. Lawmakers called for the CIA to continue to probe the issue, especially those cases that remain unexplained. ""Today's assessment, while rigorously conducted, reflects only the interim work of the CIA task force,"" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., chair of the Senate intelligence committee, which ""will continue pressing for answers on a bipartisan basis,"" he added. His Republican counterpart, ranking member Marco Rubio, R-Fla., reiterated that, saying the CIA ""must continue to make this issue a priority and seek answers to the causes of mysterious symptoms, including brain injury, and whether they can be attributed to the work of a foreign government or a specific weapon or device, particularly in a core group of cases."" It's unclear exactly how many cases are in that ""core group"" that remains under active investigation. The senior CIA official said that it numbers around a ""couple dozen"" and that it could still involve a ""foreign actor."" ""We're not ruling it out in specific cases. We're still looking,"" they said, but added, ""There are no patterns or linkages at this stage."" Russia had long been suspected in some circles as being behind the incidents, but it's unclear how or with what device such an attack would be possible. Blinken said last week that he and other U.S. officials have raised the issue with the Russians even without clear attribution. Asked whether he would raise the issue with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov when they meet Friday, Blinken declined to comment Thursday.",12
2022-01-20,https://abcnews.go.com/International/19-year-break-record-youngest-woman-fly-solo/story?id=82312020,19-year-old breaks record of youngest woman to fly solo around the world,"LONDON -- From flying over an active volcano to surviving in minus 31 degrees Fahrenheit, British-Belgium teen Zara Rutherford has experienced a lot in her five-month journey flying over 40 countries and five continents. When the 19-year-old landed in Belgium on Thursday, she made history by breaking the record of the youngest woman to ever fly solo around the world. The pilot who previously held the record, Shaesta Waiz, was 30 years old when she completed the journey. ""It's been ... challenging, but so amazing at the same time,"" Rutherford told ABC News. ""I think there're some experiences that I'll just never forget and others that I would wish to forget."" Rutherford embarked on her epic journey with her Shark Aero, a high-performance, two-seat ultralight aircraft manufactured in Europe. The small plane is especially made to withstand long journeys at the cruising speed of 186.4 mph. Since both of her parents are certified pilots, Rutherford learned her way behind the airplane controls when she was very young. ""Zara's first flight in a very small airplane, was when she was three or four months old. … And frequently, she'd be given the opportunity to sit in the front, to start with, of course, on about six cushions to be able to manipulate the controls and move the aircraft around,"" Sam Rutherford, Zara's father and a former army helicopter pilot, told ABC News. But it was not until about five years ago that Rutherford truly realized her passion for flying. ""It only really crystallized into something she actually wanted to do more formally when she was 14, and at 14, she started actually taking flying lessons,"" Rutherford's father said. Then teen ran into maintenance problems, COVID-19 complications and visa issues along her journey. She said once she reached Russia, she fully realized the risks of her mission. ""There was no humans. It's too cold. It's like nothing. There's no roads, there's no power like electricity cables. There's nothing, there's no animals, there's no trees. I didn't see a tree for over a month,"" Rutherford said. ""When you're flying alone and suddenly this challenge comes up, I can't say, 'I'm done. I'm out. I give up.' You have to still land the plane. You have to make sure that you get down on the ground safely,"" she said. Still, she was often amazed by the things she saw along the way. ""That is still like the hands down the most amazing thing flying straight over Central Park … because of air space [regulations] you have to fly quite low. And it's quite strange when… some of the buildings still are higher than you like. Wow, this is incredible,"" the young solo pilot said. Someone to look up to Before starting her journey, Rutherford messaged Waiz -- the American-Afghan pilot who previously held the flying record -- on LinkedIn and asked if she would mind if she attempted to break her record. ""'Of course, that's OK. Records are meant to be broken,' I told her,"" Waiz, who finished her journey in 2017, told ABC News. ""'Not only are you going to fly around the world, but I'm going to do everything I can to help you, because it is an incredible experience and I want [you] to have that,'"" she said to Rutherford. Waiz got on her first plane as an infant, when her family left Afghanistan as refugees during the Soviet–Afghan War and settled in California. She didn't fly again until she was 17. ""I was terrified. But as soon as that plane lifted off, something ignited in me and I just thought to myself, 'This is what I want to do for the rest of my life,'"" she recalled. Changing perspectives Flying solo around the world, for Rutherford and Waiz, was not just about crossing geographical borders and breaking records, but also about getting to see life from a different perspective. To Waiz, the unique thing about aviation is the way it takes away all discriminations and differences among people. ""When you're in the airplane and you're flying, it's such an unbiased environment that that aircraft doesn't care where you come from or what you look like,"" she said. Rutherford said flying has taught her that life is ""fragile,"" and there is ""so much more to life than just getting a good career and making and having a good salary."" She hopes her history-making journey inspires other girls and women to chase their dreams. ""Her aim is actually not to fly around the world. Her aim is to encourage young women and girls to consider and hopefully take up careers in aviation, science, technology, engineering and mathematics,"" Rutherford's father said. ""There's very little point to her flying around the world if nobody gets to hear about it. We all have our own worlds to fly around.""",22
2022-01-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-clarifies-comments-ukraine-russian-move-border-invasion/story?id=82376647,"Biden clarifies comments on Ukraine, says any Russian move across border would be an 'invasion'","President Joe Biden on Thursday sought to clean up his comments on Ukraine made during his marathon news conference Wednesday, making it ""absolutely clear"" that any Russian move into Ukraine would be seen as an ""invasion."" ""I've been absolutely clear with President Putin. He has no misunderstanding. If any, any, assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion. But -- and it will be met with severe and coordinated economic response that I've discussed in detail with our allies, as well as laid out very clearly for President Putin,"" he told reporters. ""Let there be no doubt at all: If Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price,"" Biden added. The clarification comes after he seemed to throw into question how the U.S. and NATO would respond if Russia did take action against Ukraine -- in the case of what he called a ""minor incursion."" ""It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera,"" Biden said Wednesday. ""But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the force they've massed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine."" Wednesday evening, shortly after his news conference, White House press secretary issued a statement attempting to clarify Biden's suggestion the NATO alliance might be divided, saying, in part, ""If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Berlin meeting with Germany's Chancellor Scholtz ahead of his talks Friday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, said, ""We have been very clear throughout -- if any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border and commit new acts of aggression against Ukraine, that will be met with a swift, severe, united response from the United States and our allies and partners."" Vice President Kamala Harris, in several network morning show appearances Thursday, also tried to clean up the president's comments. ""We will interpret any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity by Russia and Vladimir Putin as an aggressive action, and it will be met with costs, severe and certain,"" Harris told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America."" Biden's initial comments were quickly met with criticism from Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Rob Portman, who was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to Ukraine earlier this week. Portman tweeted he was ""deeply troubled"" by Biden's remarks, adding ""any Russian military incursion into Ukraine should be viewed as a major one that could likely destabilize Ukraine and Europe."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was also critical, saying Biden's news conference was ""a bizarre and devastating performance, especially -- I would add -- for our friends on the front lines."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seemed to issue his own rebuke of Biden's comments in a pointed tweet Thursday morning. ""We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones. I say this as the President of a great power,"" Zelenskyy said. ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.",15
2022-01-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-momentum-continues-tightening-voting-laws-note/story?id=82381429,GOP momentum continues in tightening voting laws: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein This week might be remembered for a big bill that didn't pass, or Democratic Party unity that didn't come together -- or maybe even for the start of a bipartisan push to change how the Electoral College vote is finalized. What it won't be remembered for, though, is any change in the momentum Republicans have found in making voting more difficult across a range of states. Almost lost in the Democrats' filibuster fight is the fact that all 50 Senate Republicans opposed the massive voting bill that was at issue. President Joe Biden's which-side-are-you-on buildup left both sides where they were all along, even with the Jan. 6 committee heating up in the background. Hints are starting to emerge in Texas of what state-level changes to voting will mean, in advance of the March 1 primaries there. Major urban counties contacted by ABC News say they are rejecting upward of a quarter of the applications for mail-in ballots received thus far because of new and stricter data-matching requirements. As state legislatures take up new bills beyond changes already enacted, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is seeking to create a new state ""Office of Election Crimes and Security,"" even though fraud cases are scant in his state -- which former President Donald Trump won twice. Just to his north, in Georgia, Former Sen. David Perdue -- now challenging Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in the GOP primary for governor -- on Thursday called for a similar new law enforcement entity. Kemp earned Trump's wrath for refusing to dispute Biden's victory in the state. One argument for changing filibuster rules offered this week was that, in most states that have changed voting laws, it can and has been done with simple majorities and on a party-line basis. If voting rights continue to play out as a battle between states and the federal government, it's not likely to be an evenly matched fight. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper A bill that would prohibit white students or employees from feeling ""discomfort"" when taught in schools or on the job about ""divisive"" topics, like racial discrimination, is one step closer to becoming law in Florida. SB 148 is one of the latest pieces of legislation penned by Republican state lawmakers across the country targeting ""critical race theory,"" the academic concept that aims to illuminate the impacts of institutional racism. The bill was approved by the state's Senate Education Committee on party lines Tuesday. The proposal's advancement follows newly-inaugurated Virginia Gov. Glenn Younkin's first executive order of his term: a ban on ""divisive concepts, including Critical Race Theory."" The proposal, authored by Florida Republican state Sen. Manny Diaz Jr., bans ""divisive ideas or concepts"" that could cause an individual ""discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress"" because of their race or gender. Democratic lawmakers in Florida have argued the legislation could create more problems than it would ever solve, citing issues of censorship and the burden of lawsuits on teachers and businesses. Some called the rhetoric driving the conversation on ""critical race theory"" racist. ""This was directed to make whites not feel bad about what happened years ago,"" said state Sen. Shervin Jones, a Democrat who is Black. ""At no point did anyone say white people should be held responsible for what happened, but what I would ask my white counterparts is, are you an enabler of what happened or are you going to say we must talk about history?"" The TIP with Brittany Shepherd The anti-abortion movement has reached an inflection point. One of its most prominent goals -- repealing Roe v. Wade -- feels within grasp now more than ever, with the Supreme Court's Republican appointees seeming sympathetic to a ban on nearly all abortions after 15 weeks in the state of Mississippi in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. And such near-the-finish-line enthusiasm will be on clear display at the March for Life, which formally kicked off Thursday morning but will gear up Friday with a rally, a march along the National Mall and a gala event into the evening. ""We expect this year's March for Life to be historic with even higher levels of enthusiasm from participants. We are all hopeful that, with the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case before the Supreme Court, this year will bring us much closer to building the culture of life we have all marched for since Roe v. Wade was imposed on our nation nearly 50 years ago,"" Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, told ABC News in a statement. Tangential events stretch into the weekend, with former Vice President Mike Pence addressing the National Pro-Life Summit Saturday morning to ""prepare for a post-Roe America,"" according to organizers. Both Pence's remarks and the March for Life come just days after the Supreme Court handed another win to anti-abortion advocates by thwarting an attempt by abortion providers to block Texas' restrictive six-week abortion ban.

Cuellar and his wife, associates","The federal grand jury probe that led to the raid of Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar's home and office in Texas this week has begun issuing subpoenas, seeking records about a wide array of U.S. companies and advocacy organizations, many of them with ties to the former Soviet nation of Azerbaijan. Among the information being sought, according to one subpoena reviewed by ABC News, are records related to the congressman, his wife Imelda, and at least one of his campaign staffers. An attorney representing Cuellar, Joshua Berman, told ABC News that ""the congressman and his family are fully cooperating"" with the investigation. On Wednesday, after the FBI raids in Laredo, Texas, an aide to Cuellar said the congressman is ""committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld."" The subpoenas issued in recent days came from a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. The FBI and Justice Department have declined to discuss the investigation or describe its scope. It is unclear if Cuellar or his wife are targets of the probe. But, in addition to other information, the subpoena reviewed by ABC News seeks records ""relating to anything of value"" that the congressman, his wife, and others close to them may have been offered by certain business leaders or foreign officials. The subpoena also asks for records relating to any ""work, act, favor, or service"" that Cuellar or his wife may have provided at the behest of certain foreign companies, government officials, American business leaders, or others. The subpoena reviewed by ABC News specifically seeks records related to at least three Texas-based companies for which online databases identify Imelda Cuellar as an officer or director. It also seeks records relating to an array of logistics-related firms and cultural advocacy organizations from around the United States, many of them with ties to Azerbaijan, which sits on the Caspian Sea near Iran, Russia and Georgia. Touting Azerbaijan as ""a secular, modern, Muslim country,"" Cuellar has been an outspoken advocate for the nation over the past decade, even serving as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus. He publicly called Azerbaijan ""a strong ally of the United States"" and a key partner in ""the global war on terrorism,"" noting that -- in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- it provided an important route for sending reinforcements and supplies to American forces in Afghanistan. On the House floor last year, Cuellar offered remarks to ""honor the diplomatic tour"" of Azerbaijan's long-serving ambassador to the United States, Elin Suleymanov, describing Suleymanov as ""a force of peace and diplomacy."" In recent years, Cuellar and Suleymanov attended many of the same events, including the 2015 announcement of what Cuellar called an ""historic agreement"" between Laredo's Texas A&M International University and the government of Azerbaijan. That agreement established an annual two-week program for Laredo-area college students to visit Azerbaijan and learn about international energy issues, including the worldwide oil and gas industry, according to press releases from Cuellar's office. The ""Baku Summer Energy School"" program was backed by a partnership between ExxonMobil, the Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, and the nation's state-owned gas company, known as SOCAR, according to the press releases. In 2015, when the first iteration of the program was announced, the Turkish-born head of a local nonprofit that also helped arrange the program, Kemal Oksuz, issued a statement thanking Cuellar ""for his playing a very instrumental role"" in making it all happen. Three years later, in 2018, federal authorities arrested Oksuz for his role in a scheme to conceal that a 2013 congressional delegation to Baku -- which did not include Cuellar, according to press reports -- was paid for by SOCAR, the state-owned gas company, ""in order to gain access to these public officials,"" the Justice Department said. Oksuz admitted to lying on U.S. disclosure forms, pleading guilty to one scheme-based count, and was sentenced to time served. But his lawyers insisted that he ""never attempted to corrupt any action by a government official, and never would have agreed to participate in such an effort."" The subpoena reviewed by ABC News is seeking, among other information, records related to Oksuz, SOCAR, the Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy, and other entities that the Justice Department mentioned in its case against Oksuz. Cuellar, who represents Texas' 28th Congressional District along the U.S.-Mexico border, has been in Congress since 2005. Cuellar is in the final weeks of a tough reelection campaign. He faces a challenge for his seat from a fellow Democrat, and the primary election is being held on March 1. The Justice Department usually tries to refrain from taking overt investigative steps involving a candidate close to an election. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment for this story.

2022-01-22,https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-preparing-approve-evacuation-embassy-ukraine-sources/story?id=82417211,US preparing to approve evacuation from embassy in Ukraine: Sources,"The Department of State is preparing to approve the evacuation of some U.S. diplomats and diplomats' families from the embassy in Ukraine, sources confirmed to ABC News. The final authorization has not been approved, the sources said, so the scope of the evacuation is not yet clear. A State Department spokesperson told ABC News, ""We have nothing to announce at this time. We conduct rigorous contingency planning, as we always do, in the event the security situation deteriorates."" That contingency planning has been underway for weeks now, as ABC News first reported last month that the embassy was preparing for an authorized or ordered departure. An authorized departure allows families and non-emergency staff to evacuate, usually on commercial flights, while an ordered departure requires them to do so. In either case, the State Department will warn U.S. citizens to depart the country, too. Ukraine is already a Level 4: Do Not Travel on the department's travel advisory, with an explicit warning that ""Russia is planning significant military action against Ukraine."" But while Americans will be warned to depart this week, the State Department is making clear that they will not be evacuated on government aircraft, like in Afghanistan -- an evacuation that the department continues to say is not a precedent. ""If there is a decision to change our posture with respect to American diplomats and their families, American citizens should not anticipate that there will be U.S. government-sponsored evacuations,"" the State Department's spokesperson said. ""Currently commercial flights are available to support departures."" The decision to evacuate some staff and families from the embassy has upset the Ukrainian government, according to one source, who said they were ""p----- off."" Ukrainians on the ground in Kyiv and at the front lines in the war between Ukraine and Russian-led forces in eastern provinces have told ABC News they are less convinced that a full-scale Russian attack is imminent. Some have suggested that the pressure from Moscow is a bluff -- and one they see the U.S. as buying into with moves like this. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hinted at that during his meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken Wednesday, telling him during a photo-op beforehand, ""Your intelligence is excellent, but you are far overseas, and we are here, and I think we know some things a little bit deeper.""",12
2022-01-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-joni-ernst-calls-strong-response-russia/story?id=82415824,Biden administration has 'doctrine of appeasement' toward Russia: Ernst,"Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, called for a strong response from the Biden administration as tensions continue to rise with Russia's potential invasion of Ukraine. ""We simply need to let Putin know that the United States stands with our Ukrainian friends,"" Ernst told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz Sunday. ""What's the likelihood you see of a Russian invasion at this point, and why should Americans be worried about that?"" Raddatz asked. ""Well, we need to be strong as America,"" said Iowa's junior Republican senator, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""And what we see with Russia ​amassing troops and equipment at the Ukrainian border is indicative of some sort of action. What that will transpire into is yet to be seen."" But, she added, ""What we can say is that we need to be very aggressive in pushing back against President Putin, whether that's in the form of sanctions, expulsion from the Swiss banking system certainly, sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, all of these actions need to be put in place, as well as continuing to equip our Ukrainian friends with not only defensive capabilities but also offensive weapons."" Russia has mobilized as many as 100,000 troops​, causing a standoff at the Russian-Ukrainian border and sparking debate about whether an invasion is ​imminent. ""And what happens if they do invade, if the Russians invade?"" Raddatz asked. ""The sanctions are put in place. What does Putin do next? He hasn't ruled out missiles to Cuba, Venezuela. Should a NATO military response be on the table if Russia invades?"" ""We want to make sure that an invasion doesn't happen,"" Ernst said. ""And that's why I think diplomacy is very important at this point. But also showing a strong resolve from the United States. So far, with this administration, we have seen a doctrine of appeasement. And that certainly is not going to deter President Putin and Russia from invading Ukraine."" Raddatz followed: ""I want to go back to my first question, it may be obvious to some, but I would like to say, why -- why is this important to your constituents, to Americans?"" ""Well, number one, we do need to fight for democracy. And understanding that Putin's goal is to retain some of what he had during the Soviet era, that power and control, to expand his reaches across Europe,"" Ernst answered. ""We know that if he's able to go into Ukraine, and there's very little pushback from the United States or from NATO, it allows him to move into other countries in Eastern Europe."" ""And we know that when -- when Soviet Union expands, as -- as he wants to see it, it's, you know, a new form of the Soviet Union, as it expands, democracy will constrict,"" she later added, noting that ""when democracy is stable, that means our troops, our citizens, are much more safe."" ​Last week, the Senate failed to vote for eliminating the filibuster to allow ending debate on the Democrats' voting rights bill with a simple majority. The legislation would have created nationwide laws that would have made Election Day a national holiday and allowed for no-excuse absentee voting. Following the failed vote, Raddatz reported ​out of Texas, covering the lead up to the primary election and how new voting laws are impacting the election system. The state's new Senate Bill 1 has already had an impact on voters, with hundreds of voters' ballot applications being rejected, according to a local election administrator. ""And, Senator, I want to move to voting rights,"" Raddatz said. ""I went down to Texas. You heard what the nonpartisan election official said, this is a canary in the coal mine for the midterms. Do you agree with that?"" Explaining her ​opposition to the Democrats' voting rights bill, Ernst insisted that federal legislation is unnecessary. ""Well, every state will put in place their own voting systems. Their own election systems. That is a state's right. We should not be federalizing our election system, as the Democrats had attempted to do,"" she said. Iowa is one of 19 states identified by the nonpartisan Brennan Center as having a new restrictive voting law. The new law shortens the early voting period from 29 to 20 days and closes polling sites an hour earlier. ""How do those changes make voting any more secure?"" Raddatz asked. ""Well, it is the same level of security,"" Ernst responded. ""What I would say is we still have three weeks of early voting before our Elections Day, which is far more liberal than the state of New York. So, I would love to see the Brennan Center actually focus on New York. I think they only have 15 days of early voting. So it's still three weeks to go in and vote."" ""But why shorten what you already had?"" Raddatz pressed. ""Because, when you do that, you are manning election centers,"" Ernst explained. ""And in rural communities like mine where it really does make sense, simply local governments can't afford to step out there and continue to man as they would during a smaller election season."" Ernst went on to argue that voter turnout has actually increased with new voting laws despite warnings that such provisions restrict ballot access. ""I would also say, since we have put a number of the voting laws into place over the last several years -- voter ID is one of those -- we've actually seen voter participation increase, even in off-election years,"" Ernst said. ""So I think it's a false premise that the Democrats are promoting out there that this is restricting access. Because, in Iowa, we've only seen voters get out in higher numbers to participate in their very safe elections.""",7
2022-01-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chris-coons-week-pushes-pause-sanactions/story?id=82415779,Sen. Chris Coons says he's 'gravely concerned' Russia will invade Ukraine but defends administration's response,"Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., on Sunday defended the Biden administration's response to the standoff between Russia and Ukraine but said he's ""gravely concerned"" that President Vladimir Putin will order Russian troops to invade its neighbor. ""The most important thing President Biden has been doing is to deter Putin from invading Ukraine. He has pulled together our NATO allies,"" Coons said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""I think our work in the Senate, and Biden's work to strengthen deterrence is hopefully what is going to succeed. But I am gravely concerned that Putin will show aggression again in Europe and cross the boundary into Ukraine in the coming days or weeks."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva last week as U.S.-Russia tensions continue to rise over the standoff with Ukraine. While diplomatic talks continue, Biden did concede Wednesday that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin will advance troops into Ukraine but says Putin ""does not want any full-blown war."" Blinken has warned of ""massive consequences"" if Putin invades Ukraine, but the administration has so far continued to engage in diplomatic talks with its NATO allies and the Russian government. ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz pressed Coons, who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, about his support for a bill that would impose ""crippling sanctions"" on Russia, but only if Putin chooses to invade Ukraine. ""Why not impose sanctions now?"" she asked. Coons, a close ally of President Joe Biden, said passing a bipartisan bill would ""show resolve and determination,"" but only ""some sanctions"" should come now. ""The very strongest sanctions, the sort of sanctions we used to bring Iran to the table, is something we should hold out as a deterrent to prevent Putin from taking the last step of invading Ukraine,"" he said. Asked about reports that British intelligence believes Russia plans to install a pro-Moscow government in Ukraine, Coons said it's important that the United States and its allies continue to ""call out"" Russia's plans. ""One of the things that we are doing to show resolve and bipartisan determination is engagement with Zelensky to support him,"" Coons said, noting members of Congress have engaged virtually and in person with the Ukrainian president. ""I think it's important... that the United Kingdom and the United States that our intelligence communities call out in advance things that we are learning Russia is planning to make it clear to the rest of Europe just how aggressive and just how creative Putin intends to be in both overt and covert means in trying to overthrow Ukraine’s government, its independence and to violate its sovereignty,"" he added. After a failed vote in Congress last week to pass voting rights legislation amid a wave of restrictive voting laws being passed throughout the country, Raddatz also asked Coons about the fate of voting rights. Coons emphasized the importance of Congress passing national legislation and defended Democrats' recent efforts to pass a bill, saying, ""We're going to keep trying, keep working at it."" ""This was an important fight to show that sharp contrast between Democrats and Republicans this last week on the floor of the Senate,"" he said. The voting rights legislation was supported by all 50 Democrats in the Senate but ultimately failed to pass as Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., opposed removing the filibuster to pave a path for passage with a simple majority. Expanding voting access and making it overall easier to participate in elections has become a central issue for Democrats, who've accused Republican lawmakers are trying to suppress votes. Raddatz pressed Coons on this, asking, ""But ... have you really seen evidence of suppression?"" ""Absolutely,"" the senator responded. ""We've seen abundant evidence that there are laws being passed that roll back things like ballot drop boxes, drive-through voting, 24-hour early voting, restricting access to the ballot box who particularly in an ongoing pandemic are medically vulnerable."" ""We made significant progress to make it easier to vote in the pandemic in 2020. Why would we be rolling that back in a dozen states when the pandemic isn't over? Why would we be erecting new barriers for people to be able to vote? We've seen cleverly crafted laws that will do things like automatically remove people from the voting rolls or make it harder for them to apply for mail-in ballots that I believe are designed to suppress the vote,"" he added. Since the 2020 election, 19 states have enacted over 30 laws making it more difficult to vote according to the Brennan Center for Justice. President Joe Biden expressed ""disappointment"" after the legislation failed on Wednesday and said he will use ""every tool at our disposal to stand up for democracy."" But Raddatz pressed Coons on a comment Biden made during his hourslong press conference last week when he discussed efforts to ""alter the outcome"" of the next election. ""Democrats have been united against former President Trump's efforts to cast doubt on the last election. But in his press conference, President Biden cast some doubt of his own about the next one,"" she said, noting that the president later tried to walk back the comment. ""Well, Martha, what you're hearing there is President Biden's passionate commitment to making sure that we are pushing back on voter suppression and that we secure access to the ballot for as many Americans as is possible. That's something I’m also passionately committed to and we need to make it clear to the American people what's at stake here and why we're fighting so hard to secure the right to vote,"" Coons said.",7
2022-01-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-warns-russian-cyberattack-us-responds-ukraine-invasion/story?id=82441727,DHS warns of Russian cyberattack on US if it responds to Ukraine invasion,"As tensions rise in the standoff over Ukraine, the Department of Homeland Security has warned that the U.S. response to a possible Russian invasion could result in a cyberattack launched against the U.S. by the Russian government or its proxies. ""We assess that Russia would consider initiating a cyber attack against the Homeland if it perceived a US or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security,"" a DHS Intelligence and Analysis bulletin sent to law enforcement agencies around the country and obtained by ABC News said. The bulletin was dated Jan. 23, 2022. Russia, DHS said, has a ""range of offensive cyber tools that it could employ against US networks,"" and the attacks could range from a low level denial of service attack, to ""destructive"" attacks targeting critical infrastructure. ""We assess that Russia's threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive cyber attacks in the Homeland probably remains very high and we have not observed Moscow directly employ these types of cyber attacks against US critical infrastructure—notwithstanding cyber espionage and potential prepositioning operations in the past,"" the bulletin said. Last year, cybercriminals based in Russia caused two of the most destructive cyberattacks in recent memory, the U.S. has said. Colonial Pipeline was the victim of a ransomware attack in May 2021, shutting down operations and causing widespread outages across the country, and meat supplier JBS had its operations shutdown due to Russian based hackers. Russia is also responsible for the SolarWinds breach in late 202o, the U.S. has said, where the U.S. says Russian-backed cybercriminals gained access to 10 U.S. government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Commerce. DHS says Russia ""continues to target"" and gain access to critical infrastructure in the United States, but Russia does not limit itself to conducting cyber operations just in the U.S. The bulletin says in 2015 and 2016, Russian military intelligence assets launched a cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid. Although the bulletin doesn't mention it, Ukrainian officials most recently pointed the finger at Russia for another cyber outage, shutting down government websites. The Department regularly shares information regarding a variety of issues, with federal, local and state partners, a DHS spokesperson said. ""We have increased operational partnerships between private sector companies and the federal government to strengthen our nation’s cyber defenses, including through CISA’s newly established Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC),"" the spokesperson continued. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters last week that the United States is on a ""heightened alert"" for cyberattacks given ""geopolitical landscape."" He told reporters at the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday that it is ""difficult to calibrate the likelihood"" of something happening. ""The whole point is, when the specter of harm arises, we call for vigilance and quite frankly, in the cybersecurity arena. ever present vigilance is what we call for,"" he said.",12
2022-01-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-turn-biden-agenda-stalls-note/story?id=82427641,Democrats turn on each other as Biden agenda stalls: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein On this they see eye to eye: President Joe Biden says he's not Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Sanders says he's not Biden. That may be as far as agreements take the Democratic Party for now -- even though the Biden and Sanders wings of the party have been working in lockstep in recent months. Different Democrats see different threats from different foes, both inside and outside their party, with implications for policy or the lack thereof. In Arizona, the fallout from Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's vote to keep Senate rules intact now includes a formal censure from the state Democratic executive committee. Her fellow Democrats over the weekend approved that move while citing what they call ""her failure to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of our democracy."" Sanders says he is fed up as well, telling CNN on Sunday that Sinema and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., ""have sabotaged the president's effort to address the needs of working families."" Sanders also said that Democrats have ""failed politically"" over the past six months, and his solution in part is to bring up repeated votes to put his colleagues on the record ""and let Manchin and Sinema decide which side they are on."" Biden also has said he wants to break down his Build Back Better bill into ""chunks,"" but his inclination is more toward cutting compromises that all Democratic senators, starting with Manchin, will back. Then there is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is discouraging attacks on fellow Democrats though she is also skeptical of the approach of breaking Build Back Better into component parts. Toward the end of his news conference last week, Biden said it's clear to him that the public doesn't want a ""president-senator"": ""They want me to be the president and let senators be senators,"" he said. Letting the Senate be the Senate hasn't worked of late, though. It has Democrats looking at themselves when it comes to confronting challenges in the second year of Biden's presidency. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper In defense of restrictive voting legislation in Republican-led states, GOP lawmakers often cite even stricter voting procedures in some Democratic states, but the argument is flawed. On ABC's ""This Week,"" Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, reiterated the talking point when discussing sweeping voting legislation in her home state with co-anchor Martha Raddatz. ""I will also say that even with those changes in [Iowa's] law, our voting election systems are much more liberal than President Joe Biden's home state of Delaware, as well as Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's home state of New York,"" said Ernst. To properly evaluate if a state is making changes that restrict access to the ballot box, one must look at the history of access in that specific state. For example, since the passage of the state's sweeping elections law last year, Iowa now only has 20 days of early voting -- down from 29 days. Before the passage of a 2017 voter ID law, the state offered 40 days of early voting. The number of early voting days in other states is a red herring. The crux of the argument in favor of restrictive voting legislation has been that it makes voting ""more secure,"" though many Republicans have struggled to articulate how exactly these measures do that. ""Well, it is the same level of security,"" said Ernst when asked by Raddatz how these changes make voting more secure. Ernst later suggested changing the number of early voting days in her home state was part of an effort to keep polling locations staffed. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Rep. Henry Cuellar is continuing with his reelection campaign for Texas' 28th Congressional District against the backdrop of a federal grand jury probe. As reported by ABC's Mike Levine, federal officials have begun issuing subpoenas, seeking records related to the congressman, his wife and at least one of his campaign staffers. An attorney representing Cuellar, Joshua Berman, told ABC News that ""the congressman and his family are fully cooperating"" with the investigation. On Wednesday, FBI agents raided Cuellar's home and campaign office. Those developments, paired with a competitive primary season, appear to be giving progressives hope of seeing an upset in the south Texas contest. Cuellar's top competitor, Jessica Cisneros, came within four points of winning the Democratic primary in 2020 and is heading into 2022 with the backing of heavyweight progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Cuellar's political success is largely centered on being one of the few lawmakers publicly willing to work across the aisle. But with the nation's first primary election just weeks away, progressives could look at the race as a bellwether for potential primary upsets elsewhere.

The embassy has also authorized non-emergency employees to depart, according to an internal cable obtained by ABC News. In an updated travel advisory issued later Sunday, the State Department confirmed the drawdown and urged U.S. citizens in Ukraine to consider departing the country now using commercial flights. ""These are prudent precautions that in no way undermine our support for, our commitment to Ukraine,"" a senior State Department official said Sunday. The department made the decision now ""based on this military buildup, based on how we see these developments,"" they added, calling it the ""right moment."" Ukraine has been on the State Department's highest travel advisory -- Level 4: Do Not Travel -- for months because of COVID-19. Last month, the embassy updated that warning to say, ""Russia is planning significant military action against Ukraine,"" which ""would severely impact the U.S. Embassy's ability to provide consular services"" to Americans. A State Department spokesperson said Saturday that the U.S. will not evacuate Americans like in the operation conducted out of Afghanistan last August. ""American citizens should not anticipate that there will be U.S. government-sponsored evacuations. Currently commercial flights are available to support departures,"" the spokesperson said. The change in the embassy's status has upset some Ukrainian officials, many who are skeptical that Russia is planning an attack and think it is instead continuing to raise the pressure to destabilize the country. ""The U.S. embassy in Kyiv is going to continue to operate in an uninterrupted way to support Ukraine at this critical moment,"" the senior State Department official said.",12
2022-01-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/canadas-foreign-affairs-department-hit-cyberattack/story?id=82450324,Canada’s foreign affairs department hit with cyberattack,"Canada's foreign affairs department was hit with a cyberattack last week, according to the Treasury Board of Canada. The hack of Global Affairs Canada, the government entity responsible for diplomatic and global relations, occurred on Wednesday, according to a statement provided by the Treasury Board to ABC News. The statement does not identify who carried out the cyberattack. As a result of the attack, some access the internet and internet-based services are not currently available, but mitigation measures were being taken to restore them. The Treasury Board said no other government department experienced a cyberattack. ""We are constantly reviewing measures to protect Canadians and our critical infrastructure from electronic threats, hacking, and cyber espionage. We encourage all government and non-government partners to use cyber security best practices,"" the statement says. The attack comes amid tensions over Ukraine and two days after the Canada Centre for Cyber Security warned malware was being used to target Ukrainian organizations. On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security warned that the U.S. could be a target of Russian cyberattacks if the government responds to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.",12
2022-01-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mayors-anti-violence-blueprint-shape-democratic-messaging-note/story?id=82442729,Mayor's anti-violence 'blueprint' could shape Democratic messaging: The Note,"The TAKE with Averi Harper If successful, New York City Mayor Eric Adams' plan to combat crime, dubbed the ""blueprint to end gun violence,"" could become the blueprint to reorient Democratic messaging on public safety. Adams, a former NYPD captain, unveiled his strategy Monday in the wake of a shooting that left one NYPD officer dead and another critically injured. Echoing the tough-on-crime posture that arguably helped put him in office, Adams announced plans to increase police presence all over the nation's largest city. ""New Yorkers feel as if a sea of violence is engulfing our city,"" Adams said. ""But as your mayor, I promise you I will not let this happen. We will not surrender our city to the violent feud. We won't go back to the bad old days."" His plan includes the reinstatement of a controversial plainclothes anti-crime police unit that was disbanded shortly after the killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests calling for police reform. The unit's tactics, including stop-and-frisk, were declared unconstitutional. At the time, NYPD officials said the unit was responsible for a disproportionate number of fatal shootings by police and civilian complaints. Adams said the officers in the new iteration of this unit will wear body cameras and promised consequences for officers who take inappropriate action. The idea isn't without critics concerned about the return of the unit known for its aggressiveness, particularly with New Yorkers of color. But beyond the possible impact on public safety in New York's five boroughs, if employed by other Democrats, it could serve as a means to dismantle broad-brush assertions from the right that claim Democrats are soft on crime and that the GOP is the party of so-called ""law and order."" The RUNDOWN with Rick Klein The search for bipartisanship got exactly nowhere on Build Back Better or voting rights at the federal level. But while political attention was trained on domestic matters, a foreign crisis could still feature the parties working together. Democratic and Republican senators continue to talk through the recess week about a bipartisan package of sanctions to impose on Russia -- though timing and White House support for the direction they are going in are still both in flux. A bipartisan group of seven senators kept a scheduled trip to Ukraine last week despite the Senate's focus on a voting bill that failed to advance. Since then, while the chairman and top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee have different proposals on the table, senators have kept communications open about passing something that could draw support from both parties. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday that passing a bipartisan sanctions package ""will show resolve and determination."" But whether new sanctions should snap in before Russian President Vladimir Putin makes a move into Ukraine remains an issue. The Biden administration has said additional sanctions should serve as a deterrent more than a preemptive act. While many Republicans have blasted the White House for not acting faster or supporting stricter sanctions that would go into effect now, some are also agreeing with the need to send a united message. ""I think passing something is better than passing nothing,"" Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said after the senators' trip to Ukraine. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Despite former President Donald Trump not yet having indicated whether he plans to endorse any candidates in Pennsylvania's Republican Senate primary, the race is accelerating with high-profile endorsements and major campaign spending. The newest GOP contender, David McCormick, is set to campaign alongside Sen. Ted Cruz on Tuesday in the Lehigh Valley. The Texas senator backed McCormick just a week after the former hedge fund CEO announced his candidacy. McCormick already has the endorsement of Trump's original Senate pick, Sean Parnell. Parnell dropped out of the race in November. According to AdImpact, the race is already shaping up to be one of the most expensive in the country, and the two newest Republican faces on the campaign trail -- McCormick and Dr. Mehmet Oz -- appear to be driving up spending. Prior to officially announcing his campaign bid, McCormick had spent more than $1 million on cable and broadcast ad buys, AdImpact reported. Along with heavy campaign spending, Pennsylvania is also set to be in the spotlight over policy, as President Joe Biden heads to Pittsburgh on Friday to promote infrastructure spending. The decision to make the voter-critical area of southwestern Pennsylvania one of the first places the president visits during a midterm election year highlights the importance both sides of the aisle are placing on the state's political trajectory.

2022-01-26,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/twists-shape-politics-covid-schools-note/story?id=82467564,New twists shape politics of COVID and schools: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein As a soundbite made famous in last year's Virginia governor's race made clear, no politician in either party wants to be seen as standing against parents. But while some Republicans see an easy opening in the COVID era, neither party has a definite hold on issues relevant to parents. That's in part because they are not the kind of issues that have easy answers, or that allow for an easy taking of sides. Dozens of Republican lawmakers at the state and federal level are using ""National School Choice Week"" to press for bills that would allow parents to disregard COVID mandates when it comes to their own children. The issue is playing out in legal fights in a number of states, including Virginia, where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has signed an executive order allowing students to attend school without masks. Seven school districts are suing for the right to keep mask mandates at their schools in place. ""To parents, I say: We respect you,"" Youngkin wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Tuesday. A different twist is developing in San Francisco, where three progressive school board members are facing a recall vote next month. Frustrations over the handling of school reopenings and COVID accommodations have left many Democrats -- including Mayor London Breed -- supporting the recall push. ""Competence matters,"" the editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote this week in endorsing the recalls. ""That's as true for those pursuing a progressive agenda as it is for anyone else."" Another sign of the changing politics of COVID comes in how President Joe Biden has handled questions on the topic of late. The president has said numerous times in recent weeks that whatever the threats of a new variant, schools should remain open. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., isn't up for reelection until 2024, but political groups and donors are already laying the groundwork in hopes of removing her. On the heels of Sinema's censure by Arizona's Democratic Party for her refusal to support a Senate rule change that could have made way for the passage of voting reform legislation, an advocacy group for Latino voters -- Voto Latino -- has launched a campaign called ""Adios Sinema."" The group is planning a six-figure investment during her primary, citing Sinema's stance on not only voting rights but also minimum wage, pandemic relief for the undocumented and ""other reforms"" impacting the Latino community. ""Sinema's actions directly undermine and suppress the right and wellbeing of Latinos that elected her into office,"" reads a statement on the group's website. In an interview with CNN, Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., confirmed reports that he met with some of Sinema's donors in New York. Gallego is a Harvard grad, a veteran and the son of Hispanic immigrants who has flirted with the idea of running against Sinema in a primary. Gallego said he wouldn't make a decision on a primary bid until next year but that he's gotten assurances from donors they will support him if he gets in the race. ""I'll have meetings with anybody that's interested in talking to me about that race,"" Gallego said. ""And it hasn't just been donors. It's been everyday Arizonans. It's been labor unions and, you know, a lot of groups that have helped turn Arizona into a blue state so those conversations will be ongoing."" The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The aftershocks of states' redistricting efforts are manifesting across the country with just months to go until the midterm primaries are in full swing. In some cases, the new maps are forcing incumbents to reassess their reelection plans -- like in the case of Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper, who announced on Tuesday he would not be seeking reelection in his new Tennessee district. ""Despite my strength at the polls, I could not stop the General Assembly from dismembering Nashville. No one tried harder to keep our city whole. I explored every possible way, including lawsuits, to stop the gerrymandering and to win one of the three new congressional districts that now divide Nashville,"" Cooper said in a statement, adding, ""there's no way, at least for me in this election cycle, but there may be a path for other worthy candidates."" Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, redistricting is also taking a toll on election administration after last month's warnings from the former acting secretary of state appeared to do little to speed up the implementation of new maps. An impasse between Republican lawmakers and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf over what the final version of the new map should look like is making it more likely the state's Commonwealth Court may ultimately have to draw it. In December, the secretary of state's office said redistricting needed to be completed by Jan. 24 so candidates could have enough time to officially begin filing paperwork to run in their districts. With that deadline in the rearview mirror, it is now unclear whether lawmakers would be willing to adjust the state's election calendar. The last time they pushed back election dates was in 2020 to accommodate for fallout from the emerging pandemic. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast. Wednesday's Start Here begins with Col.

2022-01-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-intel-official-warns-deficiencies-classification-system-pose/story?id=82516981,Top intel official warns 'deficiencies' in classification system pose national security threat,"In a scathing rebuke of the nation's current classification procedures, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines has told lawmakers that the current system classifies so much information it puts national security at risk -- because of how long it can take to process. ""It is my view that deficiencies in the current classification system undermine our national security, as well as critical democratic objectives, by impeding our ability to share information in a timely manner, be that sharing with our intelligence partners, our oversight bodies, or, when appropriate, with the general public,"" she writes in a letter dated Jan. 5 and sent to Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Jerry Moran, R-Kan. The classification system, she wrote, reduces the intelligence communities capacity to ""effectively support senior policy maker decision making, and further erodes the basic trust our citizens have in their government."" The challenge on how to protect national security information, but appropriately share it is not a new challenge, nor is it easy, she said. The senators wrote the Haines in October to express concern about the current classification system, noting numerous reviews of the process have ""documented concerns across the entire lifecycle of the current system."" ""In the meantime, the volume of classified material produced continues to grow exponentially in a digital first environment, bringing with it the expanding burden of mandatory declassification requirements,"" Haines said. Haines said there are already efforts currently underway, but those were not disclosed in the letter obtained by ABC News. She says the issue of classification is also ""great importance"" to President Biden. The letter was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",12
2022-01-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-pittsburgh-push-infrastructure-improvements-local-bridge-collapses/story?id=82532407,Biden pushes infrastructure law after visiting site of collapsed bridge in Pittsburgh,"Just hours ahead of President Joe Biden traveling to Pittsburgh to stress improvements needed for the nation's infrastructure, a bridge in the area collapsed on Friday morning, coincidentally providing Biden an opportunity to tout how his bipartisan infrastructure law provides funding for badly needed repairs. Before his scheduled afternoon remarks at Carnegie Mellon University, Biden stopped by the collapsed bridge near Pittsburg's Frick's Park. Ten people were reported injured in the collapse, according to local authorities. He said the collapsed bridge was a prime example of one of the thousands of bridges in need of repair across Pennsylvania -- bridges that would benefit from the billions of dollars in his infrastructure law, including $1.6 billion for Pennsylvania to repair bridges. ""It had been rated in poor condition for the past 10 years,"" Biden said in prepared remarks. ""What you all know, if you don't you should know, there are another 3,300 bridges here in Pennsylvania, some of which are just as old, and just as decrepit -- decrepit condition as that bridge was, including here in Pittsburgh, the city of bridges."" ""We've got to get it on with it,"" Biden added. ""We got to move. The next time, we don't need headlines saying that someone was killed when the next bridge collapses."" As Biden arrived at the site earlier, he immediately greeted officials and first responders on the ground. Penn. Gov. Tom Wolf, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey, and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman -- clad in a hoodie and shorts, after Thursday saying scheduling conflicts would preclude him from partaking in Biden's visit -- walked up to the edge of the site to see the collapsed bridge with Biden after he greeted first responders. Asked his reaction by ABC News White House Reporter/Producer Justin Gomez, Biden called it ""incredible"" and went on talk about the importance of infrastructure funding in towns like Pittsburgh. ""First of all, these guys deserve an incredible amount of credit here and that -- by the way, when this was going on, they tell me the gas leak was,"" Biden said, looking to a police officer on the scene. ""Explain what you said to me about the noise."" ""It was just a very loud -- like a jet engine,"" the officer said, later adding a jogger stopped after the collapse to help the police get people out of their cars. ""I'll be damned,"" Biden said. ""It's a miracle, Mr. President. It's a miracle,"" the officer said. While the president's domestic agenda has taken the back burner over the past week in the face of threats from Russia on the Ukrainian border and major Supreme Court news, Biden's appearance puts the spotlight back on his victory in getting the bipartisan infrastructure law passed. The legislation would provide $1.63 billion to Pennsylvania in federal funding for bridges alone, including $327 million this year, the third-highest figure for any state. Pennsylvania has 3,353 bridges in poor condition, the second most after Iowa, according to administration data. The bridge program will provide $27 billion across the country. ""I've been coming to Pittsburgh a long time, and as a former Pennsylvanian, but I didn't realize there are literally more bridges in Pittsburgh than any other city in the world. Did you know that? More than in Venice,"" Biden said at the damaged bridge site. ""And we're going to -- you're going to fix them all. Not a joke,"" Biden said. ""This is going to be a gigantic change. And there's 43,000 nationwide. And we're sending the money, and by the way, we're gonna get you guys, more money too, the cops,"" he added. Pennsylvania, Biden's home state, has long been a politically symbolic state for him. Pittsburgh was where he kicked off his 2020 candidacy, and the Keystone State ultimately cinched his presidency. He also unveiled what became the bipartisan infrastructure law there last March. While some of Pennsylvania's high-profile Democratic candidates have praised Biden's infrastructure agenda, two told ABC News earlier this week that while they support the president and his policy efforts, they also wouldn't be in attendance for Friday's event in Pittsburgh, citing ""scheduling conflicts."" A campaign spokesperson for Attorney General Josh Shapiro -- who is likely to become the Democratic gubernatorial nominee -- told ABC News the attorney general is ""focused on the issues that matter to Pennsylvania families"" but won't be in Pittsburgh on Friday. ""Like every American should, Josh wants our president to be successful and we'll continue welcoming President Biden to his home state of Pennsylvania as he touts small businesses and jobs that have been saved by the bipartisan American Rescue Plan and the tens of thousands of Pennsylvania jobs that will be created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,"" the campaign spokesperson said. Fetterman, a leading candidate in the Democratic Senate primary, had told ABC News Thursday he was planning to be in Harrisburg on Friday meeting with Democrats and talking about the 2022 midterm election before he ultimately joined Biden Friday at the collapsed bridge site. With Pennsylvania's primary elections are still months away, the unfavorable poll numbers looming over the Biden administration could factor into how Democrats interact with the president on the campaign trail.",7
2022-01-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-fight-starts-tame-biden-note/story?id=82515556,Supreme Court fight starts out tame for Biden: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein President Joe Biden seemed nostalgic for a bygone era -- ""in those days, we tried to do things together"" -- in celebrating the career of Justice Stephen Breyer at Breyer's formal retirement announcement on Thursday. There will be no throwbacks when it comes to confirming Breyer's replacement, whom Biden has committed to name by the end of February. But there are early reasons to think the recent streak of scorched-earth battles followed by near-party-line votes could be broken. Both parties see reasons to turn down the temperature. Democrats, of course, want to deliver quickly on a central promise that has the added benefit of making history, given the president's commitment to name a Black woman. Republicans see an upside in making vulnerable Democrats own Biden's pick, and few things fire up small-dollar donations like a Supreme Court vacancy. Still, confirming a new justice won't chip away at the conservatives' 6-3 majority, and if Democrats are united, Biden will get his choice confirmed no matter what GOP senators do about it. While vetting brings up inevitable twists and turns, leaders in both parties see the near future and don't particularly mind an easy confirmation. The predominant conservative worldview is that the high court is about to deliver on an array of huge issues this year -- and they also happen to like their chances in taking back the Senate this fall. Getting even a few Republican senators to vote to confirm a new justice will be a monumental lift. But it's notable that in this supercharged and divisive political era, it's possible that the coming push for confirmation is defined by a mutual de-escalation. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper After Biden's remarks on Justice Breyer's retirement, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., weighed in on how Biden should approach his first Supreme Court nomination. ""The President must not outsource this important decision to the radical left,"" McConnell said in a statement. The comment garnered a sharp response from White House press secretary Jen Psaki. ""If anyone is saying they plan to characterize whoever he nominates after thorough consideration with both parties as radical before they know literally anything about who she is, they just obliterated their own credibility,"" Psaki said at Thursday's press briefing. McConnell's call for Biden to refrain from ""outsourcing"" the search process stands in conflict with Republican efforts to reshape the judiciary during the Trump administration. It is no secret that the conservative legal group The Federalist Society played a pivotal role in identifying the scores of judges Trump put on the bench, including the three nominees who ascended to the nation's highest court during his term. Biden said Tuesday he would consult both Democratic and Republican senators, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris during the process. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema After Biden told reporters last week he plans to get out of Washington, D.C., more frequently, the president heads to Pittsburgh on Friday, where he will promote the policy achievements of his administration. The trip to Pennsylvania -- the state that landed him the presidency -- is his second visit of the year to a 2022 midterm battleground. But the move also comes as the president bears the burden of low approval ratings during a crucial election cycle in which Democrats are defending their Senate majority. The overlap could put a sharper spotlight on which Democratic candidates appear with Biden on the campaign trail. According to an AP report, at least one Senate candidate plans to attend the event -- Rep. Conor Lamb, who represents a western-Pennsylvania district in Congress. Meanwhile, others tell ABC News they support the president's efforts but will not be in attendance. ""It's great that President Biden is coming to Pittsburgh to talk about infrastructure. If infrastructure is Elvis, then Pittsburgh is Graceland. It's great to come to the city that helped build America to talk about rebuilding America. I'll be in Harrisburg on Friday meeting with Democrats from across the commonwealth at State Committee and talking about the 2022 midterm election,"" said Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta said he attended a Zoom meeting with the president and a small group of his early supporters last week to mark the one-year anniversary of his presidency, but would not be in attendance for Friday's event. ""I welcome the President back to Pennsylvania; every time he is on the road talking about the basic bargain is a good thing for Democrats and for the country,"" Kenyatta said.

2022-01-30,https://abcnews.go.com/US/majority-americans-biden-nominees-supreme-court-vacancy-poll/story?id=82553398,Majority of Americans want Biden to consider 'all possible nominees' for Supreme Court vacancy: POLL,"A new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds that a plurality of Americans view the Supreme Court as motivated by partisanship, while President Joe Biden's campaign trail vow to select a Black woman to fill a high-court vacancy without reviewing all potential candidates evokes a sharply negative reaction from voters. The ABC News/Ipsos poll, which was conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel, comes days after the most senior member of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, announced his retirement at the end of the current term. Breyer's announcement provides Biden the opportunity to change the demographic makeup of the conservative-leaning bench. During the spring 2020 presidential primaries, days before his set of big wins on Super Tuesday, Biden pledged to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, if elected. Now, with the chance to do so, just over three-quarters of Americans (76%) want Biden to consider ""all possible nominees."" Just 23% want him to automatically follow through on his history-making commitment that the White House seems keen on seeing through. At a ceremony honoring the retiring justice, Biden told reporters he is able to honor his promise without compromising on quality. ""The person I will nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity. And that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court,"" Biden said. ""It's long overdue in my view. I made that commitment during the campaign for president, and I will keep that commitment."" Although the poll's sample size was not large enough to break out results for Black people, only a little more than 1 in 4 nonwhite Americans (28%) wish for Biden to consider only Black women for the vacancy. Democrats are more supportive of Biden's vow (46%) than Americans as a whole, but still a majority of Democrats (54%) also prefer that Biden consider all possible nominees. Democrats hope that the nomination will re-engage Democrats, who are sorely in need of a boost in the run-up to what is shaping up to be a very challenging midterm election for the party. Also, when it comes to assessments of the Supreme Court, 43% of voters believe justices rule ""on the basis of their partisan political views"" rather than ""on the basis of the law,"" a position held by only 38% of respondents. Eighteen percent did not know enough to express a view one way or the other. And this new ABC/Ipsos poll shows high disapproval of Biden's handling of a range of issues. A glaring weak spot for Biden is inflation, where 69% of Americans disapprove of his handling of this key issue. Speaking in Pittsburgh Friday, Biden acknowledged the crush of inflation, pitching his Build Back Better social spending plan as part of the remedy. ""Inflation is a problem,"" said Biden. ""It's real and a lot of people are being hurt by it."" Troublingly for the White House, only 1% of Americans view the state of the nation's economy as ""excellent,""and only 23% say it's ""good."" Three out of four Americans said the state of the economy was ""not so good / poor."" Biden sees other troublesome disapproval numbers surrounding his handling of gun violence (69%), crime (64%), immigration (64%), the situation with Russia and Ukraine (56%) and the country's economic recovery (56%.) The country is split on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with 50% approving and 49% disapproving. And while support from Democrats trends higher than the population as a whole, Biden's support within his own ranks is softening. In August, 91% of Democrats approved of Biden's handling of the pandemic. Now, that figure has dropped to 82%. The drop in support among Democrats around Biden's handling of the economic recovery is even clearer, from 89% in August to 73% now. As the U.S. weighs its options on the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Americans are less clear where they stand on the issue of sending ground troops to Eastern Europe to try to discourage a Russian invasion of Ukraine. One in three (32%) Americans ""don't know"" enough to say while 38% oppose sending group troops and 29% support it. Biden said Friday that he plans on moving troops into NATO allied nations in the ""near term."" Biden is to meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the coming weeks and will discuss Russia's building agitation, according to the White House. This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted using Ipsos Public Affairs' KnowledgePanel® January 28-29, 2022, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 510 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 4.9 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 27-26-37%, Democrats-Republicans-independents.

2022-01-31,https://abcnews.go.com/US/american-woman-arrested-allegedly-trained-women-isis/story?id=82566924,"American woman arrested, allegedly trained women of ISIS","A Kansas woman was charged with providing material support to ISIS, according to charges unsealed by the Justice Department on Friday night. On six separate occasions between 2014 and 2017, authorities say Allison Fluke-Ekren, 42, allegedly expressed interest in carrying out terrorist attacks in the United States in support of ISIS, the foreign terrorist organization that's based in Iraq, Syria and other locations in Africa and the Middle East. Fluke-Ekren moved to Syria in 2012 and married a ""prominent"" ISIS leader, court documents said. She can reportedly speak four languages, and the documents alleged she rose up the ranks to command her own battalion. ""Fluke-Ekren's main objective in this role was to teach the women of ISIS how to defend themselves against ISIS' enemies,"" the complaint stated. ""There are American citizens who want to do damage to our country and whether they're here inside the country, trying to commit attacks or outside of the country,"" Tony Mattivi, the former DOJ National Security Coordinator for the District of Kansas said. She also allegedly housed, translated for and trained women to fire automatic weapons, the Justice Department said. ""Recent charges brought against Allison Fluke-Ekren demonstrate the appeal ISIS had to a broad section of foreign extremists around the world, including women and those from the United States,"" said Javed Ali, former senior counterterrorism director at the National Security Council and a professor at the University of Michigan's Ford School of Public Policy. ""Despite their similar jihadist outlooks, unlike al Qaida, ISIS held little to no prohibitions for more operational roles for women in the group, and there were many other women who performed similar functions in ISIS like Fluke-Ekren,"" Ali told ABC News. Among the attacks she was interested in carrying out were ideas to bomb a mall and a college in the U.S. ""To conduct the attack, Fluke-Ekren explained that she could go to a shopping mall in the United States, park a vehicle full of explosives in the basement or parking garage level of the structure, and detonate the explosives in the vehicle with a cellphone triggering device, "" she allegedly told a witness, according to court documents. Fluke-Ekren also allegedly once presented an FBI informant with a plan ""targeting a U.S.-based college."" She ""stated that they would dress like infidels and drop off a backpack with explosives,"" court documents said. She also ""fantasized"" about committing an attack where there was a large amount of people, the documents stated. ""Fluke-Ekren considered any attack that did not kill a large number of individuals to be a waste of resources,"" they said. The documents against Fluke-Ekren were filed in 2019. She was arrested in Syria and is expected to make her first federal court appearance in Alexandria, Virginia, on Monday, when she will be appointed an attorney.",0
2022-02-02,https://abcnews.go.com/US/alexander-vindman-sues-donald-trump-jr-alleged-witness/story?id=82623601,"Alexander Vindman sues Donald Trump Jr., others for alleged witness intimidation over impeachment testimony","Former Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman has filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani, former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino and former Trump White House official Julia Hahn, alleging they engaged in a conspiracy of witness intimidation against him over his testimony in then-President Donald Trump's 2019 impeachment. Vindman, who was one of the few officials to directly listen into the July 2019 phone call between former President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, outlines in the lawsuit what he describes as ""an intentional, concerted campaign of unlawful intimidation and retaliation"" over his role in Trump's impeachment. ""This campaign of intimidation and retaliation has had severe and deeply personal ramifications for Lt. Col. Vindman,"" Vindman's lawsuit says. ""It also left a stain on our democracy."" Vindman is asking a federal judge to rule that Trump Jr., Giuliani, Scavino and Hahn all engaged in the conspiracy campaign, and to award him financial damages in an amount that would be determined after trial. The lawsuit against the four alleges that they violated sections 1 and 2 of the Ku Klux Klan Act, which is intended to bar threats or intimidation against government officials carrying out their constitutional duties. Neither Trump Jr., Giuliani, Scavino or Hahn immediately responded to ABC News' request for comment. Vindman, in the suit, also ties the alleged harassment campaign against him to the ongoing investigation by the House select committee on the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The suit claims that the message sent to Vindman ""reverberates to this day, as witnesses subpoenaed by Congress in connection with its investigation into the events of January 6, 2021, continue to heed former President Trump's instructions to defy those subpoenas, undermining Congress's constitutional oversight role and the fundamental principle of checks and balances between three co-equal branches of government.""",0
2022-02-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-big-lie-now-big-dare-lawmakers-note/story?id=82608073,Trump’s ‘big lie’ now a big dare to lawmakers: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Not changing the law means former President Donald Trump could try to do what he failed to get done all over again. Changing it could be seen as an acknowledgment that he could have done what he wanted if only the right other people had gone along. And the next election might bring more of those people into the kinds of positions where they could make a difference in time for 2024. That's the logical pretzel Trump has concocted with what he's now saying about the Electoral Count Act and his insistence that former Vice President Mike Pence -- in his words -- ""could have overturned the Election!"" His suggestion that the Jan. 6 committee investigate why Pence didn't do so won't be taken seriously. But the substance of what Trump is saying about the much-debated 1887 law -- that debating it proves his ask of Pence was appropriate -- is harder to ignore. There is broad bipartisan consensus that the Electoral Count Act is overly vague and even potentially dangerous. That consensus extends to the notion that it's probably overdue for a rewrite that would, among other things, clarify that a vice president's role in counting votes is purely ceremonial. While talks among key senators in both parties continue, and a group of Democrats put forward a draft bill on Tuesday, some in their party have resisted reform efforts because they sense a trap set by Republicans seeking to dodge more meaningful voting rights debates. Many in the GOP, meanwhile, are hesitant to do anything seen as taking aim at Trump. Revelations just in the last few days -- ripped-up White House records, extensive efforts to take federal control of voting machines, Trump's suggestion that he might pardon Jan. 6 participants -- underscore the urgency of what the Jan. 6 committee is investigating. Likewise, the former president's own most recent words serve as a reminder that even relatively narrow voting reforms could make a big difference. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper After suffering a stroke, Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., is expected to make a full recovery. But the senator's temporary absence will further illuminate the razor-thin margin in this 50-50 Senate. Democrats aren't close to a deal on a scaled-back Build Back Better plan, and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told a group of reporters Tuesday that the president's social spending plan is ""dead."" But even if he were on board, it now wouldn't get passed without Lujan. ""What Build Back Better bill?"" Manchin said Tuesday about the president's signature policy plan. When asked if he had participated in any talks on the topic, he said, ""No, no, no, no. It's dead."" Manchin's declaration comes after he tanked Biden's social spending plan in December by saying he couldn't support the legislation. Biden has remained optimistic that movement on his signature policy plan was possible. ""Senator Manchin and I are going to get something done,"" Biden told ABC News in December. But that something -- a smaller plan -- hasn't yet materialized, and Manchin indicated Tuesday that he wants to see other issues, like inflation, tackled first. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Despite primary elections being just around the corner, some states are still ironing out their redistricting plans, and the push to cross the finish line is heightening the impact of state courts. This week alone, at least three states have redistricting developments hanging in the balance. In North Carolina, the state Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments Wednesday about the newly revised congressional and state legislative districts. The core of the litigation involves challenges to the Republican-backed maps passed by the legislature which critics say lessen the voting impact of Black North Carolinians. Last week, a federal district court in Alabama blocked the state's new congressional map, saying it violated the Voting Rights Act by proposing racially gerrymandered districts. Alabama is appealing the ruling to the Supreme Court, and the attorney general has asked for a stay while that process plays out. Wednesday will mark the deadline for plaintiffs to respond to that request, as directed by the Supreme Court. As reported by FiveThirtyEight, if the ruling is sustained, a ""political earthquake"" would ensue. Meanwhile, Ohio's Supreme Court could rule on whether to uphold newly drawn maps after striking down the enactment of a GOP-backed map passed last month. The court ruled that map overwhelmingly skewed in favor of Republicans and violated the state's constitution. Since then, Republicans have asked the court to decide by Feb. 11 or issue a stay on current state legislative maps until after the 2022 elections out of fear that delays will interfere with this year's election calendar. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight Fewer than 10%. That's the share of Democratic senators who backed Trump's three Supreme Court picks. Notably, too, the share of Democratic senators who backed Trump's nominees dropped with each subsequent nomination, with not a single Democratic senator backing Amy Coney Barrett.

2022-02-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-stroke-highlights-constraints-evenly-divided-senate/story?id=82624265,Lawmaker's stroke highlights constraints of evenly divided Senate,"The absence of Sen. Ben Ray Lujan from the Senate is casting new light on the constraints of the evenly divided chamber, with the Democrat's absence already sidelining some committee activity and throwing the timeline for other Democratic priorities into question. Lujan, a New Mexico Democrat, suffered a stroke Thursday and underwent surgery to relieve pressure following the incident. It is unclear how long the 49-year-old will be gone as he recuperates, though his office reports he is expected to make a full recovery and return to work in four to six weeks, barring something unforeseen, according to a senior aide to the senator. Democrats currently hold the narrowest of possible majorities in the Senate, and an absence of an unknown length from even one Democratic senator threatens to sideline priorities that Democrats may have needed the strength of their full caucus to push through. In floor remarks Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wished Lujan a swift recovery but did not address the way his absence could impact the Senate schedule. ""All of us are hopeful and optimistic that he will be back to his old self before long,"" Schumer said. ""In the meantime, the U.S. Senate will continue to move forward on carrying out its business on behalf of the American people."" Already, the Senate Commerce Committee on which Lujan serves has had to delay votes on multiple nominees who are not supported by Republicans. An aide for the committee told ABC News that committee votes on three different nominees were rescheduled from Wednesday morning ""to take into consideration the need for all Democratic votes in order to move certain nominees forward."" Nominees are a central concern, with many federal and judicial nominees scheduled for votes on the Senate floor in the coming days. It's unclear how Lujan's absence might affect Democrats' ability to confirm those who are not supported by Republicans. The matter puts increased focus on Senate Democrats' effort to swiftly fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court left by retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. But Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin told reporters Wednesday that Democrats ""don't anticipate any difficulties"" moving forward with the nomination. Lujan does not serve on the Judiciary Committee, which will hold hearings and ultimately vote on Biden's yet-to-be-named nominee before they are considered by the full Senate. Biden said he may not name the nominee until the end of the month, and from there, Durbin is aiming for a 40-day confirmation process, which buys Democrats considerable time. ""We hope Sen. Lujan is back soon, we are waiting for the nominee from the President and the clock will start running when we receive it,"" Durbin said. It's also not yet clear whether any Republicans will support the nominee. The support of even one Republican would make it possible for the nominee to be confirmed in Lujan's absence, and several Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, have signaled some willingness to work with Democrats on the matter. Democrats had also hoped February could yield renewed conversations on Biden's social spending agenda, which would require the unanimous support of all 50 Senate Democrats to pass. But that agenda is stalled with or without Lujan. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., whose opposition to the Build Back Better plan quashed its chances in December, declared that Build Back Better, at least as it's currently understood, is ""dead"" on Tuesday. Manchin said he isn't currently engaged in talks on the matter and, until his demands are satiated, Lujan's absence is a moot point. Still, other key priorities Democrats are hoping to move through the chamber this month are not yet being sidelined by Lujan's absence because they will require at least 60 votes on the Senate floor. In fact, Lujan's absence only stands to highlight the work of multiple bipartisan working groups that have emerged in recent weeks to chart a path forward on items like voting rights, government funding and Russian sanctions. A bipartisan group led by Collins is looking at possible reforms to the Electoral Count Act which governs how Congress handles the tabulation of electoral votes. This new effort emerged from the ashes of a failed attempt at voting reform effort led by Democrats last month, which came after they were unable to modify the Senate filibuster rules. A bipartisan group met on these renewed, narrower election reform efforts earlier this week and is holding another round of meetings with the Democratic chair and Republican ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee on the matter later Wednesday. Bipartisan meetings between leaders in both the House and Senate are also ongoing to discuss a path forward on government funding. Lawmakers will need to cobble together a solution to extend government funding before Feb. 18 in order to avoid a government shutdown, and by all accounts, they expect a bipartisan outcome to avert one. Republican buy-in will also be a necessity to authorize sanctions against Russia. The country's increased hostility toward Ukraine has prompted bipartisan work between Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Menendez and Ranking Member Jim Risch that has brought other lawmakers from both sides of the aisle into the fold. ABC News' Rachel Scott and Trish Turner contributed to this report.",26
2022-02-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nations-holding-diplomatic-boycott-beijing-games/story?id=82461768,"Why US, other nations are holding diplomatic boycott of Beijing Games","The 2022 Winter Olympic opening ceremonies will be dotted with empty seats as some major world VIPs skip the festivities in protest against the Chinese government's human rights violations. In December, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced America wouldn’t send an official delegation to the Beijing Games citing the government's mass detention camps and forced sterilization campaign against Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in the country's western province. High-ranking officials often attend Olympic Games' opening ceremonies, including presidents, vice presidents, secretaries of state, ambassadors and other officials. First lady Jill Biden attended the Tokyo Olympics as leader of the U.S. delegation. Human rights activists around the globe have called for athletes and leaders to boycott the Games because of the government's policies. ""As the president has told President Xi [Jinping], standing up for human rights is in the DNA of Americans. We have a fundamental commitment to promoting human rights,"" Psaki told reporters on Dec. 6. The United States' move, however, stopped short of prohibiting athletes from competing. ""The athletes on Team USA have our full support, we will be behind them 100% as we cheer them on from home,"" Psaki said. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., tweeted out a response to the Biden administration shortly after its announcement claiming they ""are doing so for their own political interests and posturing."" In 1980, Team USA boycotted the Summer Olympic Games in Moscow to protest Russia's invasion of Afghanistan. Russian, in turn, boycotted the following Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2014, top U.S. officials didn't attend the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, in protest of Russia's policies of discrimination against its LGTBQ population. Russia criticized the U.S. diplomatic boycott in Beijing, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov telling reporters in December, ""The Olympic Games should be free of politics."" Other countries join in Several major nations have joined the U.S. in its diplomatic boycott of the Games. One day after the U.S. announced its plans, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he would not send an official diplomatic representative to the Games, also citing the Chinese government's human rights violations. On Dec. 8, the United Kingdom and Canada joined the diplomatic boycott. The Japanese government said it wouldn't send a delegation to the Games but hasn't declared a boycott, as of January. By the end of January, several other European countries joined in the diplomatic boycott, including Estonia, Latvia, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark.",1
2022-02-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/end-game-iran-nuclear-talks-nearing-resolution-nuclear/story?id=82610029,"'End game': Iran nuclear talks nearing resolution or nuclear crisis, US warns","While President Joe Biden works to address the crisis over Russia menacing Ukraine, there is another critical one looming, with a senior State Department official telling reporters the ""end game"" is just weeks away. Iran nuclear talks are scheduled to resume this week for their ninth round -- with the U.S. and Iran still negotiating indirectly about both countries returning to the Obama-era nuclear deal that is in tatters. This could be the final round before a deal is reached or the U.S. and its European allies call it quits -- because after 10 months of negotiating with two different Iranian governments, the country's nuclear program is advancing to the point of no return, the U.S. says. ""This can't go on forever because of Iran's nuclear advances. This is not a prediction. It's not a threat. It's not an artificial deadline. It's just a requirement... Given the pace of Iran's advances, its nuclear advances, we only have a handful of weeks left to get a deal -- after which point it will unfortunately be no longer possible to return to the JCPOA and to recapture the nonproliferation benefits that the deal provided for us,"" said the senior State Department official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks using an acronym for the deal's formal name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Some critics have said the U.S. should have called it quits long ago, with Iran enriching uranium up to 60% and enriching uranium metal, spinning more advanced centrifuges and more of them, and obstructing access for the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Nuclear weapons-grade uranium is enriched at 90%, while the nuclear deal capped Iran's enrichment at 3.67% for 15 years. With those steps, Iran is now a matter of weeks away from having enough fissile material to build a nuclear bomb, the official said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others have warned for a couple of weeks now that Iran is just a ""few weeks"" away from that critical threshold -- although the senior State Department official said it would take some additional time to actually build a nuclear bomb, declining to provide a timeline for that. ""Do the math. There are many fewer weeks left now than there were when we first said it,"" they added. That puts the pressure on this new round of talks to reach a conclusion before time runs out. The Iranian delegation returned to Tehran after the eighth round broke up last Friday, just as chief U.S. negotiator Rob Malley returned to Washington. Ahead of talks resuming, the senior State Department official said Biden remains ready to make that decision and return to compliance by lifting sanctions on Iran. ""Now is a time for political decisions. Now is the time to decide whether -- for Iran to decide whether it's prepared to make those decisions necessary for a mutual return to compliance,"" they said. But notably, they repeatedly took the occasion to bash the ""prior administration's catastrophic error"" and ""terrible mistake"" of withdrawing from the deal -- seeming to lay the groundwork for a blame game if talks blow up and Iran's enrichment only grows. Former President Donald Trump exited the deal in May 2019 and reimposed strong U.S. sanctions on Iran, driving down its oil exports and sparking tit-for-tat attacks across the Middle East region. His administration repeatedly said its campaign of ""maximum pressure"" would drive Iran to negotiate a new deal, but Iran refused to meet U.S. officials, even after Biden took office. With talks expected to resume this week, according to Enrique Mora, the senior EU diplomat who coordinates the talks, one key sign to watch will be whether the U.S. and Iran finally engage directly. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian expressed an openness to it last week if Iran sees a ""good deal"" in sight, but the senior State Department official said there's no indication so far the Iranians will sit down. The U.S. has consistently said it's prepared to meet directly, calling the indirect talks an impediment to reaching a deal so far. If a deal isn't reached soon, the U.S. is ""ready"" to ""fortify our response, and that means more pressure -- economic, diplomatic, and otherwise,"" the senior official said, adding, ""We will use the tools that we have to ensure that our interests are preserved and that Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon."" Notably, the Biden administration has refused to say out loud whether that includes supporting the use of force, including by Israel -- just that no option is off the table. The one thing the U.S., European allies in the talks, France, the U.K., Germany, and even China and Russia seem to agree on is that time is running out. But while the senior State Department official called a deal a ""big if,"" Russia's envoy was been more buoyant about a resolution. ""My instinct tells me that agreement will be reached soon after mid February,"" Ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov tweeted Friday as the talks ended. That's in stark contrast to the heavy pessimism in early December after talks finally resumed under Iran's new government, with its much more hard-line approach. But the Iranians now are ""back in a serious, businesslike negotiation in which there are still significant gaps -- so I don't want to in any way understates those -- but we are in a position where... we can see a path to a deal if those decisions are made and if it's done quickly,"" the senior State Department official said. In the meantime, the U.S. continues to press for the release of four U.S. citizens detained by Iran on specious charges, including father and son Baquer and Siamak Namazi. At 84-years old, Baquer is in particularly vulnerable health and had emergency heart surgery in Tehran in October to clear a ""life-threatening"" blockage in his carotid artery, according to his lawyer Jared Genser. This month marks his sixth year in Iranian custody, while his son Siamak has been held since October 2015. ""We are negotiating on the release of the detainees separately from the JCPOA, but as we’ve said, it is very hard for us to imagine a return to the JCPOA while four innocent Americans are behind bars or are detained in Iran,"" the senior State Department official said. In addition to the Namazi's, Iran has detained conservationist Morad Tahbaz and businessman Emad Shargi. All four men are dual U.S.-Iranian citizens whose detentions have been called ""hostage diplomacy"" by Tehran.",23
2022-02-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-crisis-exposes-rifts-inside-parties-note/story?id=82630338,Ukraine crisis exposes rifts inside both parties: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein If there's potential for foreign policy to be a wedge issue for either party, it might feature angles that wind up cutting in both directions. The current standoff over Ukraine is creating unusual political circumstances. President Joe Biden's latest troop deployments are getting a measure of bipartisan support, and a sanctions package could still draw the support of top Democrats and top Republicans in the Senate. Yet it's hard to say at the moment where the center of gravity is on the issues at hand inside either party. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he was ""glad"" to see Biden's troop movements to the region, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he supports them ""completely."" Meanwhile, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called it a ""mistake to send more American troops to Europe,"" ABC News' Allison Pecorin reports. Among Democrats, even close allies of the Biden White House have been offering conflicting views on whether sanctions should be imposed on Russia before or after an invasion. Progressives have been quieter than usual, though the Congressional Progressive Caucus put out a statement last week warning, in part, that ""there is no military solution out of this crisis."" The notion of sending U.S. troops to Eastern Europe to support Ukraine drew the support of only 28% of Republicans and 41% of Democrats in the ABC/Ipsos poll conducted last week. It's a reminder that the Trump era exposed serious differences of vision among Republicans -- and that the Biden era hasn't made Democrats' disagreements on foreign policy fade away. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper President Joe Biden's visit with Mayor Eric Adams in New York City on Tuesday to discuss anti-violence strategy is an opportunity for the commander in chief, who has experienced sinking approval numbers on gun violence and crime, to revive his standing on the issue with moderates. Biden's visit comes shortly after an ABC/Ipsos poll that showed 69% of respondents disapproved of his handling of gun violence and 64% disapproved of his handling of crime more generally. ""The great beneficiary here isn't Eric Adams, it's Joe Biden,"" Hank Sheinkopf, a New York political consultant, told ABC News. ""Adams symbolically embodies for Biden the things he needs to cling to right now, which is rational policy on crime while talking about social remedies."" Biden's visit comes after two NYPD officers were killed in the line of duty while responding to a domestic situation and after Adams, a former police officer, unveiled his ""blueprint to end gun violence"" to combat the flow of firearms into the city. The Biden administration is marking the visit by rolling out an anti-gun violence plan of its own. On a call with reporters, senior administration officials said the Department of Justice would crack down on the flow of illegal guns trafficked up the East Coast and prioritize the prosecution of those who use ghost guns to commit crimes and who unlawfully sell firearms used in violent crimes. The TIP with Brittany Shepherd A family feud awaits the Grand Old Party at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, which kicked off Wednesday in Salt Lake City, Utah. There, key members across the wide spectrum of Republican ideology are expected to meet and consider a resolution to endorse removing from the GOP conference House Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger -- two members of Congress consistently outspoken against former President Donald Trump and the baseless notion that the election was ""stolen"" from him. The pair caught flack from the GOP at large, partly because they supported Trump's impeachment. To that end, Cheney faces a burdensome primary to defend her House seat in Wyoming, while Kinzinger announced he is not seeking reelection in Illinois. The highly anticipated resolution, pushed by Maryland RNC member David Bossie and reportedly supported by several other members of the party, is likely to be introduced Thursday at a Rules Committee meeting. If given the thumbs up by the committee, the resolution would be presented before the entire voting body of the RNC during a session Friday. Of course, the RNC cannot formally control who serves in Congress, so any potential resolution would not be binding but more ceremonial in nature. Yet it is not without political consequence. The potential dissonance puts RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel in a tough spot. Back in November, she still considered Cheney a Republican. But forces from inside her conference may force her to change her tune. It also opens the RNC up for lines of attack from Democrats who accuse the party of being under Trump's thumb.

2022-02-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senators-close-mother-sanctions-bill-russia/story?id=82651215,Senators close in on 'mother of all sanctions' bill against Russia,"A bipartisan group of senators is within striking distance of a deal on a bill that would impose crippling sanctions on Russia for its hostilities against Ukraine. ""We are finding the path forward very clearly,"" said Sen. Jim Risch, top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, indicating that the White House and other key agencies were involved in the negotiations to agree on a deal ahead of any potential invasion by Russia, which has amassed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border. Asked if a deal could be announced as early as Thursday, Risch said, ""I'd have to say that's possible,"" though aides to three senators involved said it was unlikely. Top Biden administration officials briefed members of Congress on Thursday about the escalating tensions in and around the former Soviet Republic. Lawmakers leaving the more than hourlong briefing in the Congressional Visitor Center said the gravity of the message from those top officials, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and CIA Director Avril Haines, added urgency to their efforts. ""Collectively, what I heard made the case that this is more pressing, more timely, and that time in this regard, if we want to be preventative, is of the essence,"" said Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, D-N.J. Menendez, who is the chief architect of the sanctions bill along with Risch, added that he is ""cautiously optimistic that we are going to get there."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is involved in the bipartisan Senate talks, agreed, saying, ""The briefing, I think, will accelerate the bipartisan sanctions package."" Despite the closeness of a deal, differences remained among negotiators on the appropriate triggers for sanctions and when and how to penalize those developing the controversial, but as-yet-inoperable Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project that would bypass Ukraine, taking with it crucial revenue. ""I am hopeful in the next coming days we can introduce a sanctions package that imposes sanctions now for the (Russian) provocation with post-invasion sanctions that will destroy the Russian economy as we know it,"" said Graham, who like many Republicans after the briefing, said he thought a Russian invasion of Ukraine was now a matter of ""when"" not ""if."" Some Democrats and the Biden administration want to hold back sanctions, arguing that they are more powerful as a deterrent against Russian aggression. ""Deterrence is the idea that if you do X, we will do Y. If you put penalties in place in advance, at least significant penalties, you obviously take away the stick of deterrence,"" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. ""I think it's very important that (the) United States put a very strong sanctions package in place,"" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told CNN, adding that any sanctions need to be announced in advance ""to have a deterrent effect."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said sanctions against Russia must be ""much more forceful than they have been"" but also insisted that any sanctions be imposed after an invasion. ""I think it's really important for us to use the sanctions if the Russians strike,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters Thursday. ""It is important because it's where leverage is at maximum. If they do this, then we strike."" Pelosi said that thinking is also in line with most U.S. allies. ""This is deadly serious,"" Pelosi said. ""So, they have to feel the pain, and it has to be felt right up to the richest man in the world: Vladimir Putin. Nobody knows what he's going to do except for him."" Indeed, lawmakers have said the legislation, a bill Menendez said puts in place ""the mother of all sanctions,"" would contain a strong recommendation that Russia be kicked out of the global financial consortium known as SWIFT, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. Based in Belgium, it connects more than 11,000 financial institutions and is used as a messaging platform for the transfer of funds around the world. If that recommendation is included in the bill, the Biden administration would still have to take action to have Russia removed, an extreme action lawmakers have said is on the table. The White House confirmed Thursday that it is in close consultation with senators but stopped short of endorsing any deal. ""We are in very close touch with members of Congress about this legislation, which I don't think has been formally even proposed yet,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters en route to New York aboard Air Force One. ""So we are in close contact and in conversations with them."" Psaki, however, continued to express the administration's support for post-invasion sanctions, saying that the ""deterrent"" approach of ""the crippling economic sanctions package"" and noting that the impact is already being felt in the Russian financial markets. Still, a number of Democrats were moving closer to the GOP position that pre-invasion sanctions were a must even if the most serious sanctions are reserved in the event of an invasion. ""I think Putin and Putin's Russia have already committed sufficient aggression against Ukraine justifying some sanctions,"" said top Biden ally Chris Coons, D-Del. ""I think we should hold back the most aggressive and most punishing sanctions for now as a deterrent because the whole goal here is to keep open some space for diplomacy and to deter aggression."" Menendez and Risch have been briefing members of their panel this week. One member -- Mitt Romney, R-Utah -- told ABC News he met with Risch on Wednesday night and the smaller group negotiating the package is ""making good progress."" The legislation would include a measure authored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Ben Cardin, D-Md., modeled on the World War II-era ""lend-lease"" program, which would use existing presidential authorities to allow the administration to provide lethal military equipment to Ukraine to protect the population from a Russian invasion. Members hope to move any sanctions deal -- which, according to two aides involved in the matter, is still in the legislative drafting stage -- to the Senate floor quickly, and Sen Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who recently returned from Ukraine and is part of the talks, told ABC News he had spoken earlier in the week with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who committed to bringing any bipartisan deal to the floor for a vote quickly. And after Thursday's high-level briefing, it is clear that members are ready to act swiftly. Coons said he's ""very"" concerned about the situation on the ground in and around Ukraine, adding, ""It's really hard to listen to all of that and not conclude that we need to do more.""

2022-02-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-set-square-off-partys-left-note/story?id=82655129,Biden set to square off with party's left: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The alliance has never been an easy one, and long-ago history and current realities have conspired to keep it that way. Still, there are fresh pitfalls and opportunities emerging for President Joe Biden to have to -- or perhaps even want to -- square off with his party's progressive wing. In Eastern Europe, Biden is mobilizing U.S. forces for the kind of possible military actions the left has long stood against. The collapse of Build Back Better negotiations leaves the White House potentially restarting negotiations with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., or left with nothing at all. One of the president's most influential allies, House Minority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., is publicly urging Biden to elevate Judge J. Michelle Childs to the Supreme Court. A few Republicans are signaling they would support her, too -- but early reaction has focused on Childs' private sector work for employers viewed as hostile to labor unions. Now come new issues of crime and policing, with Biden making a public show of appearing alongside New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer who is staking his mayoralty on cracking down on crime. ""The answer is not to defund the police,"" the president said alongside Adams on Thursday. If there's a course correction afoot, it may be one that puts Biden more squarely where he has long found his policy home. But it's also going to test the patience of a whole lot of allies who claim a piece of credit for landing him in the White House. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The government funding deadline is fast approaching, and signs point to another short-term continuing resolution to keep the government running. With only two weeks until the Feb. 18 deadline, negotiations on spending are ongoing. On the status of those negotiations, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said there is still much to iron out. ""We haven't resolved anything yet,"" Shelby said. Shelby indicated Thursday that when it comes to a continuing resolution, the committee was ""probably headed that direction."" The length of any potential stopgap measure would be determined by Senate leadership. The patchwork of continuing resolutions that have kept government going during the entirety of Biden's first year is a barrier to carrying out major pieces of the president's agenda. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Texas Republican Gov. Abbott's toughest hurdle as an incumbent is overcoming the aftermath of last year's deadly storm that claimed more than 200 lives and left thousands of Texans without power for days or weeks. Abbott vowed there wouldn't be a repeat breakdown of the state's electrical grid in 2022, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas that is responsible for managing the grid backs that assessment. Meanwhile, his high-profile Democratic challenger, Beto O'Rourke, effectively launched his campaign on the criticism Abbott received for his handling of the storm. Since then, O'Rourke has been hammering Abbott over what will happen if there's another weather emergency. The two are now engaged in dueling information campaigns about storm preparedness. And while Abbott's role as governor gives him the power to address statewide issues, it also leaves him with the risk of having to face another disaster. On Friday, O'Rourke hits the road for a 12-day campaign swing through Texas as part of his ""Keeping the Lights On"" road trip. Although the former presidential contender plans to remind voters of the catastrophes caused by the last grid failure, he also faces the political risk of having to pivot his message if the lights do, in fact, end up staying on.

2022-02-06,https://abcnews.go.com/US/top-gop-lawmaker-bidens-ukraine-approach-deterrence/story?id=82694649,Top GOP lawmaker won't condemn calling events of Jan. 6 'legitimate political discourse',"Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, refused to condemn a censure resolution targeting two Republican colleagues, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, which ​included a statement suggesting that the events of Jan. 6 were ""legitimate political discourse​."" The RNC issued the formal censure for the lawmakers' roles on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. ""My understanding is [the statement] pertains to the legitimate protesters that I saw that day,"" McCaul told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. Raddatz pressed McCaul, noting that the ""legitimate political discourse"" line is still in the resolution, encompassing events that occurred throughout the entire day when some supporters of President Donald Trump assaulted the Capitol in an effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Although McCaul steered clear of condoning any acts of violence or criminality that eventually led to hundreds of arrests, he remained unwilling to denounce his party's resolution. ""I condemn the violence at the Capitol. And those who committed criminal offenses who were violent at the Capitol need to be prosecuted,"" he said, adding, ""And I've said that all along, that that needs to be addressed."" Last November, the Texas congressman earned the endorsement of Trump heading into the 2022 midterm election cycle. McCaul had voted against the second impeachment of the former president in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot. The lawmaker said he thinks there's a view within the GOP that Democrats are ""politicizing"" and pursuing the ""weaponization"" of Jan. 6. but that ""the truth needs to come out, you know, with respect to this."" ""Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger crossed a line. They chose to join Nancy Pelosi in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol. That's why Republican National Committee members and myself overwhelmingly support this resolution,"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement after the vote. Once more, Raddatz pressed: ""I just want to ask you this again, do you stand by the RNC's actions and statements?"" ""As I understand it, they're referring to the peaceful protesters when they said that. I do not agree with that statement if it's applied to those who committed criminal offenses and violence to overtake our shrine of democracy,"" McCaul qualified. While McCaul would not say whether he agrees with the decision to censure his colleagues, he did encourage party unity. ""Should they have been censured?"" Raddatz pressed. ""You know, that's -- that was a -- I'm not a member of the RNC,"" McCaul responded. ""I wasn't privy to the resolution."" ""I can tell you, from a messaging standpoint, the Republicans need to unify,"" McCaul said, adding, ""What are we going to do for the country to get the majority back in Congress? To get the White House back in 2024?"" On Thursday, the ranking Republican member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee moderated a classified briefing on Capitol Hill led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as Russia continues to build up its military presence around Ukraine. ""Did you come away thinking it was certain that Russia would invade?"" Raddatz asked. ""You know, I would say, the conditions are there,"" McCaul said. ""It's more likely than not. I think the noose is being prepared. It's around Ukraine right now as we speak."" President Joe Biden ordered 3,000 U.S. troop deployments to Eastern Europe on Wednesday to reassure NATO allies amid the standoff with Russia over Ukraine. But McCaul criticized the Biden administration's approach, saying he believes an invasion of Ukraine ""emboldens and it empowers Putin"" and that the U.S. isn't doing an adequate job of deterring such a move. ""The deterrence has not been there and deterrence is key,"" McCaul said. McCaul said he is working with a bipartisan group of senators that appears to be closing in on a deal that would impose crippling sanctions on Russia for its hostilities against Ukraine. ""I'm working with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on a bill that we hope to get out this week that will stand up the deterrence where the administration has failed to provide not only the lethal aid to Ukraine but also the sanctions necessary, devastating sanctions, including Nord Stream 2. That is the biggest leverage -- that energy pipeline that President Biden gave him in Europe,"" McCaul said. ""How does this end? If -- if they invade and you put those sanctions on, how does he respond?"" Raddatz asked. ""Where does this go from here? And you have a huge refugee crisis."" McCaul responded that ""at the end of the day"" we're going to see a ""resistance movement in Ukraine."" ""That's why we're sending them sniper rifles, ammunition. Remember, the majority of Ukraine is not pro-Russia anymore. Unlike before Crimea, they don't like Russia, and there's a resistance movement there,"" McCaul said.",16
2022-02-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mcconnell-speak-congressional-republicans-divided-rnc-censure-resolution/story?id=82746954,McConnell rebukes RNC for breaking tradition as GOP divided over censure resolution,"Republican lawmakers are divided on what could become a defining issue for the GOP after the Republican National Committee passed a censure resolution last week including language critics said suggested the Jan. 6 attack was ""legitimate political discourse."" Adding to the division was the top Republican in Congress rebuking the RNC on Tuesday. The resolution, censuring GOP Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois -- members of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack -- said the incumbent lawmakers were ""participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse."" The phrase has since come under fire, including Cheney juxtaposing it on social media with images of violence at the Capitol. Asked about the RNC move at a weekly leadership press conference on Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, while not referring to the ""legitimate political discourse"" language the RNC used directly, did pointedly characterize Jan. 6 as a ""violent insurrection."" ""Well, let me give him my view of what happened January the 6th. We all were here. We saw what happened. It was a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent a peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election from one administration to the next. That's what it was,"" McConnell said. He also said the RNC was out of line to single out sitting members. ""With regard to this suggestion that the RNC should be in the business of picking and choosing Republicans who ought to be supported, traditionally, the view of the national party committee is that we support all members of our party, regardless of their positions, and some issues,"" he added. Asked if had confidence in RNC Chairperson Ronna McDaniel, McConnell said, ""I do -- but the issue is whether or not the RNC should be sort of singling out members of our party who may have different views from the majority. That's not the job of the RNC."" In an interview with Spectrum News in December, McConnell signaled his personal interest in the House committee's work, despite blocking the formation of an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the attack last year, and said, ""I think that what they're seeking to find out is something the public needs to know."" ABC News Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott asked House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has struggled to maintain GOP infighting on his quest to become House speaker, whether he thought there was was ""legitimate political discourse"" on Jan. 6 after he dodged reporters questions on the topic last week. ""Everybody knows there was -- anyone who broke inside,"" McCarthy replied Tuesday. McCarthy's office called later to clarify that he meant that ""anybody who broke inside was not"" engaged in legitimate political discourse. Asked also if he was supportive of the censure of Cheney and Kinzinger, McCarthy said, ""I think I've already answered that question -- there's a reason why Adam is not running for reelection,"" in an apparent reference to an earlier interview with OAN. The No. 3 House Republican Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. -- who replaced Cheney as a member of leadership after an internal revolt last year -- told reporters Tuesday, ""The RNC has every right to take any action and the position that I have is you're ultimately held accountable to voters."" Asked also if she believes the violence on Jan. 6 was ""legitimate political discourse,"" Stefanik condemned the violence but proceeded to equate the violence of Jan. 6 to the ""violence of 2020"" -- seemingly a reference to the national protests that took place following George Floyd's murder. But while House Republicans and close allies of Trump have defended the resolution, several members of Senate Republican leadership sought to distance themselves from it, with a number refuting the ""legitimate political discourse"" description. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas -- a key ally of McConnell -- told reporters Monday that the language in the resolution wasn't appropriate. ""I just I think being accurate is really important, particularly when you are talking about something that sensitive, and I just think it was not an accurate description,"" Cornyn said. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also on the Hill Monday for an evening leadership meeting with McConnell, reacted as if the RNC's action is wholly apart from him and the Senate GOP. ""I mean it's what they want to say. I'm clear what I believe has been,"" said Scott, who has condemned rioters on Jan. 6 as ""disgraceful and un-American."" But Florida's other senator, Sen. Marco Rubio, fell in line with messaging of the RNC and former President Donald Trump, condemning the Jan. 6 committee, instead, on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday as ""a partisan scam."" Other senators have wiggled around taking a clear stance. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who announced last month he is not running for reelection to the Senate, told reporters Monday, ""Everybody has the right to peacefully protest, but they don't have the right to be violent. Of course, there was protest that day that was not violent, but there was also a terrible violent and criminal part of it."" Pressed on whether the RNC resolution and specific language was appropriate, he said, ""I haven't read what they said, but I don't think it's appropriate to call violent and criminal activity."" Senate GOP Whip John Thune, R-S.D., up for reelection this year and often a target of former President Donald Trump -- was pressed repeatedly on whether he supports the censure resolution, but demurred, saying the focus, instead, should ""be forward, not backward."" Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.V., echoed the sentiment but in a more critical tone, saying, ""We've got a lot of issues that we should be focusing on besides censuring two members of Congress because they have a different opinion."" The RNC has come under intense questioning since Friday about the inclusion of the ""legitimate political discourse"" phrase in its censure resolution to Cheney and Kinzinger. Asked Friday to elaborate on the description, the RNC official said the party is talking about ""legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol."" ""Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger crossed a line,"" McDaniel said in a statement. ""They chose to join Nancy Pelosi in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol. That's why Republican National Committee members and myself overwhelmingly support this resolution."" McDaniel's statement notably attempted to clarify the resolution's ""legitimate political discourse"" language, adding the words, ""that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol,"" though that additional phrasing did not appear in the resolution that was passed Friday. Senate and House Democrats have come out swinging against the RNC's decision. ""Ronna McDaniel should be ashamed of herself,"" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries told reporters during a press conference Tuesday. ""What makes it worse is that our Republican colleagues here in the Capitol refuse to denounce it because they are a part of the cult, as well."" Republican Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, meanwhile, sought to pivot away from the issue on ABC ""This Week"" when pressed by co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday, condemning the violence of Jan. 6 but unwilling to denounce the resolution. ""My understanding is [the statement] pertains to the legitimate protesters that I saw that day,"" McCaul said. Republican Rep. Don Young of Alaska, who voted against both of Trump's impeachments, weighed in over the weekend to say that what transpired on Jan. 6 ""was criminal, un-American, and cannot be considered legitimate protest."" A handful of the seven Senate Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for ""incitement of insurrection"" last year were also among the first to condemn the RNC language. ""What happened on January 6, 2021 was an effort to overturn a lawful election resulting in violence and destruction at the Capitol. We must not legitimize those actions which resulted in loss of life and we must learn from that horrible event so history does not repeat itself,"" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, tweeted. Hers followed Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, writing Friday morning that ""shame"" falls on the party, that his niece, McDaniel, currently presides over. ""Shame falls on a party that would censure persons of conscience, who seek truth in the face of vitriol. Honor attaches to Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for seeking truth even when doing so comes at great personal cost,"" Romney tweeted. And Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also reacted with apparent shock, tweeting, ""The RNC is censuring Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger because they are trying to find out what happened on January 6th - HUH?"" The move to censure Cheney and Kinzinger marks the first time the national RNC has had a formal censure for an incumbent member of Congress backed by its members. The day before the RNC vote, Kinzinger tweeted has ""no regrets about my decision to uphold my oath of office and defend the Constitution. Kinzinger, who is not running for reelection but has said his political career is not over, said in a statement that GOP leadership had allowed ""conspiracies and toxic tribalism"" to cloud ""their ability to see clear-eyed."" ""I've been a member of the Republican Party long before Donald Trump entered the field,"" Kinzinger said in a statement Thursday night. ""Rather than focus their efforts on how to help the American people, my fellow Republicans have chosen to censure two lifelong Members of their party for simply upholding their oaths of office."" Cheney also spoke to her identity as a ""constitutional conservative"" in a statement and said, ""I do not recognize those in my party who have abandoned the Constitution to embrace Donald Trump.""

2022-02-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blue-state-leaders-herald-end-covid-restrictions-note/story?id=82730055,Blue state leaders herald end to COVID restrictions: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The end of COVID, whatever that might mean, will not be determined by declarations of elected leaders or candidates for office. But Democratic officials who have long endorsed and upheld strict COVID restrictions are starting to change their tunes and their official guidance -- often in ways that put them at odds with the Biden administration's recommendations. On Monday, Delaware Gov. John Carney said his state's indoor mask mandate would expire this Friday, with mandates for schools ending March 31. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced that his mask mandate in schools would be lifted at the end of the month. Oregon also set a March 31 date to lift the statewide mandate. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy -- long a prominent promoter of rigorous COVID restrictions -- said his state will phase out the mask mandate in schools next month, leaving local school districts to decide. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is promising an update on mask and vaccine guidelines in her state on Wednesday. ""We are not going to manage COVID to zero,"" Murphy said on Twitter. ""We have to learn how to live with COVID as we move from a pandemic to an endemic phase of this virus."" The leaders named above are all Democrats whose moves are coming despite the CDC’s recommendation that high-quality masks continue to be worn in crowded indoor situations, so long as case numbers remain high. The moves have come in quick succession, just after new data from Johns Hopkins show the U.S. death toll from COVID surpassing 900,000. White House press secretary Jen Psaki downplayed any tensions with the governors, saying the issue has “always been up to local school districts.” It’s worth noting this Democratic push to lift mandates won’t take effect for several weeks -- presumably after the omicron wave is over and case counts are low. That would still be in line with CDC guidance to consider community transmission. But there’s no doubt President Joe Biden is now under serious pressure from members of his own party to steer the nation into a sense of normalcy. It may be that he and a range of friendly governors in nearby states are seeing both the science and the political realities in winding down some of the most controversial restrictions of the COVID era. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The fallout from the Republican National Committee's censure of Reps. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., and Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., for their involvement in the Jan. 6 congressional committee continues with more than 140 prominent Republicans signing on to a statement condemning the move. ""By censuring Congresswoman Liz Cheney and Congressman Adam Kinzinger for their role in investigating the January 6th attacks, they have betrayed the GOP's founding principles and ceded control of a once-great movement to grifters and extremists,"" reads the statement. Signatories include former members of Congress, former RNC officials and former White House officials from three Republican administrations, including former President Donald Trump's. Kinzinger himself shot back at the RNC in interviews Monday. ""I think it says that they are completely unmoored from truth. I think it shows that they have pledged allegiance to one man over any kind of principle and they can call that like loyalty, they call that conservatism,"" said Kinzinger. ""Conservatism is no longer about what you actually believe. It's about how intensely you're loyal to Donald Trump."" The House select committee is expected to deliver a report on its findings this summer, but the clock is ticking. If the GOP takes the House during midterm elections, Republicans could quash the committee altogether. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Georgia experienced another round of political musical chairs on Monday, with Vernon Jones announcing his withdrawal from the gubernatorial race. In a statement, Jones, a former Democrat-turned-Republican, said he is throwing his support behind former Sen. David Perdue, who has Trump's endorsement. Jones also announced he would be seeking another political office. ""I'd like to thank the thousands of Georgians that welcomed me into their homes and communities. I would ask for their continued support as I seek to represent them in the United States Congress,"" Jones said. Jones has yet to mention where he plans to run. Jones' backing of Perdue over Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp indicates a continued, Trump-aligned rallying cry over the fallout of the 2020 election. As a side effect, the May primary faceoff between the two remaining high-profile candidates could further polarize voters within the Republican party before potentially heading into a runoff. Georgia Democrats, including Democratic gubernatorial contender Stacey Abrams, are already seizing on that potential scenario. ""The Republican primary is now a two-candidate race of David Perdue and Brian Kemp, whose nasty fight will do nothing to help our state. As Kemp and Perdue fight each other, Stacey Abrams will be fighting for Georgia,"" Abrams' campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said in a statement. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 47. That's the percentage of Americans who identified as a Republican or said they leaned toward the GOP in Gallup's most recent quarterly political affiliation survey. It was 5 percentage points higher than the share of Americans who identified as Democrats or leaned toward the Democratic Party, which is notable considering Democrats typically have an advantage on this metric. But as Geoffrey Skelley and Mary Radcliffe write for FiveThirtyEight, it's still way too soon to know whether the numbers suggest an actual shift in how Americans are identifying politically.

2022-02-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rnc-resolution-piece-jan-fallout-note/story?id=82778584,RNC resolution only a piece of new Jan. 6 fallout: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The focus has been on words in a resolution -- specifically, who does and does not consider the events of Jan. 6 to have been ""legitimate political discourse."" It exposed divisions inside the Republican Party deep enough to carry nearly a week's worth of news cycles. But new revelations and new legal actions point toward bigger consequences for the GOP and those who might seek to whitewash the violent riot at the Capitol. In North Carolina, the state Board of Elections is moving forward with a hearing that challenges the ability of Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., to run for another House term, based on the Constitution's prohibition of anyone who ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" to serve in Congress. Cawthorn spoke at the Jan. 6 rally and then came full circle. He initially said former President Donald Trump made a ""major mistake"" in directing a ""weak-minded and pathetic"" mob to the Capitol but later emerged as a fierce defender of Trump and the events of Jan. 6. Cawthorn told ABC News' Benjamin Siegel on Thursday that he's confident he will prevail, though he also acknowledged the case has ""major implications down the road."" Meanwhile, the Jan. 6 committee's investigation has expanded to include a subpoena for another former top Trump aide, Peter Navarro, who has written his own account of his efforts to overturn the election and is saying he does not plan to cooperate. The committee's work also revealed details of the Trump White House's unusual record-keeping -- or lack thereof -- to the point where the National Archives is asking the Biden Justice Department to investigate those practices. Last Friday's Republican National Commission resolution was an attempt to mollify pro-Trump forces inside the party with a strong denunciation of Republicans working with the committee. But those lawmakers and what they believe may not represent anything close to the biggest threat to those involved with what actually happened on Jan. 6, 2021. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As New York joins the growing list of states led by Democrats ending mask mandates, the CDC is sounding the alarm that the retreat is coming too soon. ""Our hospitalizations are still high, our death rates are still high. So as we work towards that and as we are encouraged by the current trends, we are not there yet,"" said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky in a briefing Wednesday. The White House is standing by the CDC without decrying moves to pull back on mask mandates in states across the country. ""Our recommendation [is] that they abide by federal public health guidelines,"" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. But, she said, the understanding is ""that they may make decisions based on what they feel is best for their communities."" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul cited a 93% drop in cases since the omicron variant peak last month. Her announcement passes decisions on masking to localities. ""This is your prerogative,"" Hochul said. In New York, masking remains a requirement in some venues, like schools, but masking rollbacks could be a boon for those who see schools as the next place where masking requirements should be dropped. In Virginia, Democrats crossed party lines to support legislation that would allow parents to opt-out of mask-wearing for kids in the classroom. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The first in-person voters of the 2022 election cycle are heading to the polls in less than a week with the start of Texas' early voting period. This year's Lone Star State voting process presents dual issues. Not only will it set the political tone for candidates ahead of the March 1 primary election, but it will also likely put a renewed spotlight on the state's recently revised election law and others like it. A major point of contention surrounding the new law's impact on ballot access involves provisions that grant poll watchers expanded power within polling places. The secretary of state's office requires individuals to go through a training program, and watchers must present documentation when serving as well as swear an oath not to disturb the election process. But some voting rights advocates have expressed concerns that voter intimidation could still occur even if it does not translate into physical altercations. ""One thing is what you say on paper, but the other thing is what your actions portray or what your demeanor is -- who really is going to be out there monitoring these people,"" Cesar Espinoza, who serves as the executive director of the immigrant-led civil rights organization Fiel Houston, told ABC News. Elsewhere in the country -- like Wisconsin, where a high-profile Senate race is unfolding this year -- the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports there is already evidence that both sides of the aisle are raising the stakes with an influx of partisan election workers set to work the Feb. 15 mayoral primary in Milwaukee. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 1/3. That's the share of Americans who still believe the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump.

2022-02-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-bernie-sanders-warns-drumbeats-war-washington/story?id=82808559,Sen. Bernie Sanders warns of 'drumbeats' of war in Washington,"Sen. Bernie Sanders gave a speech on the Senate floor Thursday expressing grave concern over the ""drumbeats"" of war building in Washington, D.C., amid escalating tensions along the Ukrainian border. Sanders, I-Vt., the de-facto leader of the Democratic Party's progressive wing, which had kept relatively quiet on the issue to this point, pleaded with government officials to not follow a similar path of past military conflicts. ""I'm extremely concerned when I hear the familiar drumbeats in Washington, the bellicose rhetoric that gets amplified before every war, demanding that we must 'show strength,' 'get tough' and not engage in 'appeasement',"" said Sanders, who has, in the past, led the charge to defund the war in Iraq and to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan. The senator focused on the ""unintended consequences"" that have resulted from previous American military involvements and the way wars have been portrayed in the lead up to those conflicts. ""They [wars] rarely turn out the way the planners and experts tell us they will. Just ask the officials who provided rosy scenarios for the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, only to be proven horribly wrong,"" Sanders said. Sanders reaffirmed his support for the pursuit of a diplomatic solution with Russia, the latest attempts of which have been led by French President Emmanuel Macron, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy separately this week. While condemning Putin over his responsibility for the current crisis, Sanders also called on officials to ""consider the perspectives of our adversaries."" Putin has demanded the U.S. and Europeans commit to keeping Ukraine out of NATO, something the West has rejected outright. ""One of the precipitating factors of this crisis, at least from Russia's perspective, is the prospect of an enhanced security relationship between Ukraine and the United States and Western Europe,"" Sanders said. In addition to his war critique, Sanders objected to potential sanctions against Russia and the possible impact on civilians. That includes a package the Senate has been discussing that could cause economic devastation in Russia and reverberate across Europe. The legislation appears to be on hold following disagreement on a variety of issues, including the strength of the sanctions, leading some to suggest President Joe Biden should proceed on his own. On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated it would be better for Biden to take action as opposed to waiting for the passage of a sanctions package he believes wouldn't deter Putin. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., struck a similar tone. ""We're just a hair's breadth away from an agreement on strong, message-sending sanctions legislation, but I really believe the Biden administration should act now -- in fact yesterday,"" said Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Concerns about a Russian invasion into Ukraine continue to build as the Russian military began a series of exercises in Belarus on Thursday that are expected to continue until Feb. 20. ""[We] must work hard to achieve a realistic and mutually agreeable resolution...that is not weakness,"" Sanders said. ""That is not appeasement. Bringing people together to resolve conflicts nonviolently is strength, and it is the right thing to do."" ABC News' Trish Turner and Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.",7
2022-02-10,https://abcnews.go.com/International/police-investigation-downing-street-lockdown-parties-closer-boris/story?id=82796072,Police investigation into Downing Street lockdown parties gets closer to Boris Johnson,"LONDON -- Over 50 people will be questioned in connection with parties held during lockdowns in Downing Street, police said, as the criminal investigation into the conduct of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his staff gathers pace. The investigation into a number of events held in Downing Street by the prime minister’s staff while the country was under lockdown conditions throughout 2020 has dominated the headlines in the British media in recent weeks. The Metropolitan Police are investigating eight gatherings, and they are currently examining over 500 documents and 300 images provided to them by a separate, internal investigation led by the civil servant Sue Gray. Johnson, according to reports in the British media, is expected to be among the more than 50 people being asked by the police to explain their participation in the events. The prime minister’s office said he had not yet been contacted by the police. The scandal has dominated the headlines in recent weeks, even as the prime minister has sought to take a strong line on Russia over Ukraine and offer reassurance to the U.K.’s European allies. Over a dozen gatherings alleged to have broken social-distancing rules are believed to have taken place throughout 2020, including a Christmas event, two leaving parties for departing staff and a summer gathering in the Downing Street garden, where up to 100 staffers where invited to bring their own booze. All took place while the country was under varying degrees of restrictions. The full findings of Gray’s report will not be published until after the police investigation has been concluded, but an update published on Jan. 31 accused the government of ""failures of leadership and judgment"" in relation to the gatherings. “Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place,” Gray wrote. “Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did ... Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the government was asking citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behavior surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify.” The interim findings also notes that “the excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time.” In response, the prime minister apologized and promised to overhaul the culture of his department. He has faced down growing calls for his resignation from opposition lawmakers and a few members of his own party. Speaking to BBC radio on Thursday, the head of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, said that some of those questioned could end up being fined. ""Fifty people are being asked to account for what they are doing,” she said. “Some, not all, may end up with a fixed penalty notice and I recognise this has disgusted many members of the public."" The prime minister’s office has refused to elaborate on questions of whether Johnson will resign if he is among those fined for attending the gatherings, as his future as leader of the country largely depends on whether he can maintain the support of lawmakers within his own Conservative Party. In a speech to the Institute for Government, former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, in office from 1990 to 1997, accused Johnson of breaking the rules on Thursday. ""The prime minister and our present government not only challenge the law, but also seem to believe that they, and they alone, need not obey the rules, traditions, conventions - call them what you will - of public life,” he said. ""The charge that there is one law for the government, and one for everyone else is politically deadly - and it has struck home.""",3

""The fact is that we think that an assault on Ukraine is an assault on democracy,"" Pelosi told George Stephanopoulos during an exclusive interview on ABC's ""This Week."" ""We understand that the loss of life, the damage, the collateral damage to civilians, to military and the rest are severe."" ""If he decides to invade, the mothers in Russia don't like their children going into what he's had to experience that -- forgive the expression -- bodybags from the moms before, so he has to know that war is not an answer. There's very severe consequences to his aggression, and we are united in using them."" Stephanopoulos asked Pelosi: ""Do you believe that Putin is poised to invade?"" Pelosi said the U.S. has to be prepared for any potential invasion, and she believes sanctions have acted as a deterrent thus far. ""If we were not threatening the sanctions and the rest, it would guarantee that Putin would invade. Let's hope that diplomacy works. It's about diplomacy, deterrence. Diplomacy, deterrence,"" Pelosi said. ""And the president's made it very clear: There's a big price to pay for Russia to go there. So if Russia doesn't invade, it's not that he never intended to, it's just that the sanctions worked,"" Pelosi said. Stephanopoulos pressed Pelosi on whether Biden and Congress are doing enough to deter Putin. ""Well, look, I'm very proud of the work that the president has done,"" Pelosi responded. ""The unity of our allies and NATO to come to an agreement as to the severity of the sanctions is very, very important. And that is, that is something that Putin should pay very close attention to."" Pelosi noted that while President Joe Biden has the authority to issue sanctions by executive order, ""it would be better"" if Congress did so through legislation, too. The Senate has been negotiating a Russia sanctions bill, but as of last week, lawmakers concluded they hit an ""impasse"" in their talks. Senators have said they will continue to negotiate while also considering ""other"" options. On the domestic front, Pelosi defended passing historically massive spending bills to address the coronavirus and infrastructure, which some say has contributed to rising costs across the U.S. She noted that legislation the House passed recently to better compete with China, as well as the long-stalled Build Back Better Act, would help with supply chain issues and improve the economy in the long run. ""The fact that people have jobs always contributes to increase in inflation. And that's a good thing. But inflation is not a good [thing],"" Pelosi said. ""Part of the consequences of all of that investment in the infrastructure bill and the rest, is that more people have jobs and and, therefore, inflation goes up,"" Pelosi said. She urged Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to understand Congress' role in addressing inflation as opposed to contributing to it, which he claims passing the BBB, which she called a ""deficit reduction bill,"" will do. ""It's very important for us to address it. We must bring it down ... with all the respect in the world to my friend Joe Manchin -- it's not right to say that what we're doing is contributing to inflation because it is exactly the opposite,"" Pelosi said. Stephanopoulos also pressed Pelosi on the rate of rising crime in America and noted the differing opinions among some members of Congress as to how to address the issue. Some have called for an increase in the police force, while other members, such as Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, have supported the ""defund the police"" movement. ""Well, with all the respect in the world for Cori Bush, that is not the position of the Democratic Party,"" Pelosi said of the ""defund the police"" movement, which calls for a reallocation of money from police forces to local community organizations and non-policing forms of public safety. ""Community safety, to protect and defend in every way, is our oath of office,"" Pelosi said, adding that she supports Rep. Karen Bass's campaign plan to increase the force in Los Angeles, where she is running for mayor. Stephanopoulos also pointed to Biden's low approval rating as Democrats gear up for the upcoming midterm election this November. He asked Pelosi if she is concerned about losing the majority given the high number of Democrats who have already announced they are not running for reelection. ""I don't agonize. I organize,"" Pelosi countered. ""We fully intend to win this election. Nothing less is at stake."" When Stephanopoulos pointed to midterm elections in the past that have historically favored whichever party was not in the White House, Pelosi told him to ""forget history."" ""We're talking about the future...We have decided to win and that's what we will do,"" she said. Asked by Stephanopoulos if she intends to run for speaker again, Pelosi quipped: ""That's not a question. My purpose right now is just to win that election. Win that election, nothing less is at stake than our democracy.""",7
2022-02-13,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-lindsey-graham-future-bright-gop-ahead-midterms/story?id=82850371,Sen. Lindsey Graham says 'we could do more in Congress and should' to stop Russia,"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Congress should be sending a stronger signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin as fears of an imminent invasion of Ukraine persist. On ""This Week,"" anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Graham on Sunday whether he is convinced Putin will invade the neighboring Baltic state. ""No, I'm not, but I'm convinced that we could do more in Congress and should,"" Graham answered. The Senate's prospects of passing a sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill have stalled, and Graham said the White House ""keeps pushing back"" against pre- and post-invasion sanctions being considered by Congress. Stephanopoulos followed up: ""You're saying the president is pushing back against, but you also have some pushback from your Republican colleagues in the Senate?"" ""Yeah, but not in a real, meaningful way. There's 70 votes in the body for invasion sanctions, pre-invasion sanctions with a waiver, post-invasion sanctions,"" Graham responded. ""So, the problem has been secondary sanctions. It's not just enough to sanction a Russian bank. You want to sanction anybody that does business with that bank."" On Saturday, President Joe Biden spoke with Putin for a little more than an hour from Camp David, pledging to ""impose swift and severe costs"" if Russian forces invade Ukraine. Graham said the U.S.-Russia relationship ""would be forever changed,"" possibly harming the diplomatic process for decades to come, if Putin launched an invasion. ""This is not the last president America will have. If Russia invades the Ukraine, you will destroy the U.S.-Russia relationship for decades and every president in the near-term will be put in a box when it comes to dealing with Russia, so I hope Putin understands that,"" Graham said. When asked about whether the Biden administration's release of intelligence on a possible false flag operation has been effective in deterring a military advance into Ukraine, Graham said the U.S. government should be doing more. ""I don't want to ring alarm bell as much as take action. They're telling us the invasion is imminent. But they're not telling Putin with clarity what happens if you invade,"" Graham added. ""He should be punished now."" Recently, the South Carolina senator came under fire by the former President Donald Trump after disagreeing with Trump suggesting he would pardon Jan. 6 rioters if reelected to office. Trump even called Graham a ""RINO,"" a Republican in name only, during an interview with NewsMax. Stephanopoulos pressed: ""So where do things stand with you and President Trump right now? Do you support his comeback in 2024?"" ""If he wants to be the Republican nominee for the Republican Party, it's his for the taking,"" Graham responded. ""Donald Trump is the most consequential Republican in the Republican Party today. He has a great chance of being president again in 2024."" Despite some Republicans still casting doubt on the legitimate results of the last presidential election, Graham said ""the 2020 election is over for me"" and that he's not ""contesting"" the results. The key GOP senator gave advice to the former president as well, suggesting that ""if he looks backward, I think he's hurting his chances."" Given Trump's fractured relationship with longtime Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, Stephanopoulos asked Graham: ""If (Republicans) take the Senate back, will you vote for Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader? In the past, you have said that he's got to fix his relationship with President Trump if he's going to earn your vote."" ""Yes, I think any Republican leader in the House or the Senate has to have a working relationship with President Trump, because most Republicans like President Trump's policies,"" Graham said. ""And so Mitch McConnell, if he runs, or anyone else, I think, would have to show a working relationship with the president."" U.S. District Judge J. Michelle Childs, who sits on the federal court in South Carolina, is reported to be one of Biden's top contenders to replace Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, who recently announced his retirement. Graham, a fellow South Carolinian, has previously voiced his support for Childs to become Biden's nominee. Stephanopoulos asked: ""Is Judge Michelle Childs of South Carolina the only Biden nominee you could support?"" ""I think she's the one that would get the most Republican votes. I would be very inclined to support her because of her background,"" Graham said. ""She didn't go to Harvard or Yale, which I think is a plus. She went to the University of South Carolina. But we'll wait and see what President Biden does.""",7
2022-02-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-seeks-bury-defund-police-note/story?id=82864016,Pelosi seeks to bury 'defund the police': The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It was a raging debate inside the Democratic Party in 2020. The nation's top elected Democrats are doing what they can to make sure it isn't in 2022. With the first voting of the midterms starting Monday, as early voting starts in primaries in Texas, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is pronouncing as clearly as possible that ""defund the police"" is not a slogan Democrats are running on. ""With all the respect in the world for [Rep.] Cori Bush, that is not the position of the Democratic Party,"" Pelosi said on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, referring to the Missouri Democrat who said last week she will continue to use the phrase in midterm messaging. ""Make no mistake: Community safety is our responsibility."" Pelosi went a beat further, paraphrasing Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., a 33-year-old freshman House member whom Pelosi described as ""way on the left"": ""Defund the police is dead."" The comments came just 10 days after President Joe Biden traveled to New York City to associate himself with the new crime-fighting efforts of Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer. At that event, Biden declared, ""The answer is not to defund the police."" ""Defund"" sentiments have lost steam even inside progressive politics of late, despite the anger over police brutality and frustration over the failure to pass policing reform at the federal level. As Pelosi acknowledged, the issue continues to divide some in her caucus, and quotes to that effect will get outsized attention in campaign ads. But it's striking to see such definitive sentiments from both the House speaker and the president whom Democrats hope will help them keep control of Congress this year. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As former President Donald Trump turns the focus of his political vendetta to sitting South Carolina House members, Sen. Lindsey Graham seems to be looking the other way. When asked by ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos about Trump's intent to campaign against South Carolina incumbents Reps. Nancy Mace and Tom Rice, Graham did not come to the defense of his fellow South Carolina Republicans. ""It's up to him who he wants to campaign for. I'm not worried about us taking back the House,"" said Graham. The comment comes just days after Mace filmed herself praising the former president in front of Trump Tower following his endorsement of her primary challenger Katie Arrington, a former pentagon official. Both Mace's desperate plea and Graham's reluctance to go to bat for incumbents at odds with the twice-impeached former president are indicative of the grip Trump continues to have on the Republican Party. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The start of this year's midterm election season is already showing that political and legal fights over 2020-era mail voting practices continue to loom in key battleground states, even as voters begin casting ballots. One of the most high-profile examples of this dynamic is happening in Texas, where the first in-person, early voters of 2022 head to the polls on Monday ahead of the March 1 primary. Voters will be casting their ballots under the requirements of a new law put in practice for the first time this year. Several provisions of the law have long been questioned by Texas Democrats and voting rights advocates prior to the law's passage late last year. One of those provisions -- which prevented election workers from proactively soliciting voters to request mail ballot applications -- was temporarily blocked on Friday by a federal judge who ruled that portion of the law violates the First Amendment because it is too vague. Meanwhile, a different election-related legal development unfolded in Wisconsin. The state Supreme Court allowed a ban on ballot drop boxes to go into effect after this Tuesday's mayoral primary instead of holding off until the election concludes in April, as The Wisconsin Elections Commission had previously asked. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight Fifty-six, that's the share of Latinos who identified as Democrats or as independents who leaned toward the Democratic Party in Gallup's 2021 political affiliation data. It's a promising sign for Democrats that more Latinos haven't abandoned the party given their shift toward the Republican Party in the 2020 presidential election, but as Geoffrey Skelley writes for FiveThirtyEight, we shouldn't read too much into this. That's because compared to other voters, Latinos don't have strong ties to either party. Read more from Geoffrey on why the Latino voter community is one of the swingiest parts of the electorate. ONE MORE THING ""Tell the truth. Let the chips fall where they may.""

2022-02-15,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/special-counsel-democratic-lawyer-clash-allegations-data-purported/story?id=82902283,"Special counsel, Democratic lawyer clash over new allegations regarding data purported to tie Trump to Russia","A former lawyer for the Democratic Party indicted by special counsel John Durham for allegedly lying to the FBI has accused Durham's office of leveling false allegations that he claims are intended to politicize his case. Michael Sussmann, a cybersecurity lawyer who previously worked for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, was charged last year by Durham for allegedly lying to the then-FBI general counsel James Baker in a July 2016 meeting where Sussmann provided information about data that he said showed a strange link between the Trump Organization and Russia's Alfa Bank -- an allegation later investigated by the FBI but determined not to be nefarious. Sussmann, who has pleaded not guilty, is alleged to have lied to Baker by saying he was not passing along the information on behalf of any specific client, while Durham says Sussmann was in fact working on behalf of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and a tech executive named Rodney Joffe. Sussmann, however, denies that he ever told Baker he was not representing the interests of any client and, additionally, says he was not acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign in passing along the allegations to Baker. This past weekend, Durham put forward new allegations in a seemingly unrelated filing where he sought to raise potential conflict concerns over the attorneys currently representing Sussmann. Specifically, Durham claimed his office has evidence that Joffe worked with a group of cybersecurity researchers to collect internet data about the Trump Organization, and in doing so accessed so-called 'DNS traffic data' -- records showing back-and-forth communications that computers or cellphones have with internet servers -- from entities including Trump Tower, Donald Trump's Central Park West apartment building, and the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Durham alleges that Joffe's company had a contract with Executive Office of the President to provide DNS-related services, but that he ""exploited this arrangement ... for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump."" According to the Durham filing, in a meeting with the CIA in February of 2017, Sussmann allegedly passed along information and data from Joffe and others that Sussmann said appeared suspicious and showed that ""Trump and/or his associates"" may have been ""using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other locations."" Trump and numerous other Republicans went on to cite Durham's filing as proof that Hillary Clinton's campaign directed an illegal conspiracy to spy on Trump both during and possibly after his 2016 election victory, though nowhere in Durham's filing did prosecutors say that the effort was directed by or involved the Clinton campaign, that any of the alleged gathering of data took place after Trump had taken office, or that any of the alleged conduct -- even if it took place -- was illegal. Durham raised the new set of allegations as part of a filing regarding concerns over whether Sussmann's defense attorneys have a conflict of interest in representing him. No additional criminal charges have been brought against Sussmann or others related to the new allegations. Contrary to reports, nowhere in Durham's filing does he state that lawyers for the Clinton campaign paid a tech company to ""infiltrate"" servers belonging to Trump Tower and later the White House. Joffe did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News. In a statement provided to ABC News, a spokesperson for Joffe disputed Durham's allegations, calling Joffe an ""apolitical Internet security expert with decades of service to the U.S. Government who has never worked for a political party, and who legally provided access to DNS data obtained from a private client that separately was providing DNS services to the Executive Office of the President (EOP)."" ""Under the terms of the contract, the data could be accessed to identify and analyze any security breaches or threats,"" Joffe's spokesperson said. ""As a result of the hacks of EOP and DNC [Democratic National Committee] servers in 2015 and 2016, respectively, there were serious and legitimate national security concerns about Russian attempts to infiltrate the 2016 election. Upon identifying DNS queries from Russian-made Yota phones in proximity to the Trump campaign and the EOP, respected cybersecurity researchers were deeply concerned about the anomalies they found in the data and prepared a report of their findings, which was subsequently shared with the CIA."" Jody Westby and Mark Rasch, attorneys for David Dagon, a Georgia Institute of Technology analyst who was part of the research team referenced in Durham's filing, told ABC News that the team only provided data that was legally obtained during the Obama administration. Westby and Rasch said researchers were looking at attempted malware attacks that were believed to be targeting the White House, and that contrary to Durham's allegations, Joffe was never ""tasking"" the researchers in their work. ""He was simply providing data. He may have commented on it, but he did not task the researchers in what they were doing,"" Westby and Rasch said. ""They were in no way ever working for Rodney Joffe."" Both lawyers maintain that the effort to bring this information to the attention of the FBI and CIA was appropriate, and say they're concerned that Durham's actions could have a chilling effect on researchers bringing cybersecurity information to the attention of law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the future. ""What you don't want to have happen, which we already see happening, is for researchers to be chilled in bringing concerns about cybersecurity threats to appropriate government agencies,"" they said. ""And right now, the cybersecurity community is largely afraid to talk to law enforcement because of what has happened and how this case has been handled."" Late Monday, Sussmann's attorneys responded to Durham's new filing, accusing him of making ""false"" allegations that ""are plainly intended to politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool."" Sussmann's attorneys also dispute what they say appears to be Durham's leading theory, that Sussmann was acting in concert with the Clinton campaign when he took the DNS data to the CIA in February of 2017. ""...the Motion conveniently overlooks the fact that Mr. Sussmann's meeting with Agency-2 happened well after the 2016 presidential election, at a time when the Clinton Campaign had effectively ceased to exist,"" Sussmann's attorneys say in their filing. ""Unsurprisingly, the Motion also omits any mention of the fact that Mr. Sussmann never billed the Clinton Campaign for the work associated with the February 9, 2017 meeting, nor could he have (because there was no Clinton Campaign)."" The filing directly cites former President Trump's numerous statements released since Durham's filing, including where he suggested the alleged conduct ""would have been punishable by death"" in a ""stronger period of time."" Sussmann's attorneys accuse Durham of purposefully ginning up the new wave of furor, noting that the new allegations were included in a completely unrelated filing regarding potential conflicts of interest among Sussmann's legal team. ""This is not the first time in this case that the Special Counsel has sought to include allegations about uncharged conduct in public filings and done so using inflammatory and prejudicial rhetoric,"" the filing says. ""The Indictment is 27 pages long and reads as though there was a vast conspiracy, involving the Clinton Campaign and Mr. Sussmann, to defraud the FBI into investigating Donald Trump as part of an 'October surprise.' But the Indictment does not charge anyone other than Mr. Sussmann; the Indictment does not charge a conspiracy; and the Indictment does not even charge a fraud."" Sussmann's attorneys have asked the judge in the case to strike from the record Durham's latest series of allegations. A spokesperson for Durham declined to comment to ABC News when asked about the accusation put forward by Sussmann.",11
2022-02-16,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/retirements-recruiting-failures-change-landscape-parties-note/story?id=82909788,"Retirements, recruiting failures change landscape for both parties: The Note","The TAKE with Rick Klein You get to run an election with the candidates you have, not the ones you might have gotten. That lesson holds for both parties in 2022, notwithstanding the historical trends and the growing consensus that Democrats are likely to face a rough midterm year. House Democrats are having trouble holding on to their own members in historic numbers. Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., is now the 30th Democratic incumbent to announce a decision not to seek reelection to the House. That's nearly twice the number (16) who stepped aside when the party lost the House in 2010. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, are having ongoing trouble attracting top-tier recruits to targeted races. Popular Republican governors Larry Hogan of Maryland and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire have both passed on entering Senate races against incumbents. Former President Donald Trump is currently doing his best to make sure Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey joins that list by staying out of his state's race despite efforts by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to entice Ducey to run. GOP retirements announced months ago are also forcing Republicans to fight to retain Senate seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio and Missouri. The symmetry is peculiar enough that the party committees have practically copied each other's talking points on the topic. The Democratic Senatorial Committee last week said Republicans are passing on races because they ""know they cannot defeat strong Senate Democrats""; the National Republican Congressional Committee said Tuesday that Democrats are retiring ""because they know their majority is doomed."" Both of those statements could be partially true -- though, as always, the realities are more complex. Another way to read the growing list of thanks-but-no-thanks candidates is that serving in Congress these days isn't all that fulfilling or enjoyable, whatever your party's prospects look like. It's fair to assume leaders in both parties will wish they had candidates they couldn't convince to run. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema Nearly a decade after the horrific shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, a landmark settlement marked the first time a gun manufacturer has been held accountable for a mass shooting in the United States. As reported by ABC News' Aaron Katersky and Emily Shapiro, Remington Arms -- the gunmaker of the rifle used in the Sandy Hook shooting -- agreed Tuesday to settle liability claims from the families of five adults and four children killed in the school massacre, according to a new court filing. Remington agreed to pay the families $73 million. In their lawsuit, the families argued Remington negligently marketed a ""combat weapon"" to civilian consumers and in doing so violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act through the sale or wrongful marketing of the rifle. Gun violence prevention advocates celebrated the milestone as an example of possible workarounds to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which under federal law protects gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers from civil liability for crimes committed by those using their weapons. ""As I have repeatedly called for, Congress must repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act so we can fully hold gun manufacturers and dealers accountable. But, in the meantime, I will continue to urge state and local lawmakers, lawyers, and survivors of gun violence to pursue efforts to replicate the success of the Sandy Hook families,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement. The TIP with Lalee Ibssa Voters in San Francisco have ousted three school board members in a historic recall election. Initial reporting showed over 70% of voters in Tuesday's special election were in favor of recalling School Board President Gabriela López and board members Faauuga Moliga and Alison Collins, according to the San Francisco Department of Elections. This makes them the first San Francisco elected officials to be recalled. San Francisco Mayor London Breed, a supporter of the recall, is now tasked with appointing new members to serve until an election is held in November. The recall stemmed from what parents said was a prioritization of social justice causes, such as renaming schools, above school reopenings. The push from parents to have more say in their kids’ education comes as national debates over issues like critical race theory and COVID-19 regulations have put a spotlight on school boards, turning them into political battlegrounds. With school board recalls underway in Michigan, Maine and Virginia, Tuesday's success could signal a turning point for parents when it comes to academic choice. In 2022 alone, there were at least 25 school board recall efforts launched against 66 officials nationwide, according to data tracked by Ballotpedia. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 21. That's how many billions of dollars states have spent on operation and administration so far as part of the funding allocated under President Joe Biden's 2021 COVID-19 stimulus package. They've also spent $11 billion on water and sewer infrastructure, $8 billion on broadband internet and $9 billion on infrastructure more broadly.

2022-02-17,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-official-warns-companies-foolish-shore-cybersecurity-amid/story?id=82959520,DOJ official warns companies 'foolish' not to shore up cybersecurity amid Russia tensions,"A top Justice Department official issued a stark warning Thursday to companies in the U.S. and abroad, calling on them to immediately shore up their cybersecurity defenses amid a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""Given the very high tensions that we are experiencing, companies of any size and of all sizes would be foolish not to be preparing right now as we speak -- to increase their defenses, to do things like patching, to heighten their alert systems, to be monitoring in real-time their cybersecurity,"" deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco said in remarks at the Munich Cybersecurity Conference. ""They need to be as we say, 'shields up' and to be really on the most heightened level of alert that they can be and taking all necessary precautions."" Monaco said the threat was in no way ""hypothetical,"" citing the devastating NotPetya cyberattack in 2017 that started in Ukraine before spreading globally and causing billions of dollars worth of damage. ""I think cybercriminals need to know that -- and cyber malicious actors need to know -- that attacks on critical infrastructure are unacceptable and will be met with response,"" Monaco said. It comes as various U.S. agencies warned earlier this week of a cyberattack happening at the same time as a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. On a call with state and local officials on Monday, top cybersecurity officials from the Department of Homeland Security and FBI warned of potential attacks on U.S. cyber infrastructure in concert with a physical invasion of Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the call. Last Friday, DHS explicitly warned of Russian cyber-attack and made a veiled mention at the ongoing geopolitical climate. ""The Russian government has used cyber as a key component of their force projection over the last decade, including previously in Ukraine in the 2015 timeframe,"" the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned in an online post. ""The Russian government understands that disabling or destroying critical infrastructure—including power and communications—can augment pressure on a country's government, military and population and accelerate their acceding to Russian objectives."" Ukrainian officials believed they were already the victim of a Russian cyber-attack earlier this year, when suspected Russian hackers defaced Ukrainian government websites, according to officials. Wednesday, the FBI, CISA and the National Security Agency are warned defense contractors of that Russian state sponsored actors continue to attempt and exploit their networks. From 2020 to at least February 2022, Russian state sponsored cyber actors have targeted U.S. cleared defense contractors, according to Wednesday's joint release. The agencies say Russians have targeted various sectors in the defense and intelligence world including intelligence, weapons and missile development and software development. The agencies warn that Russian threat actors use Microsoft 365 to first enter the system and gain official credentials and then send malware to compromise devices without the person knowing. ""Historically, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have used common but effective tactics to gain access to target networks, including spear phishing, credential harvesting, brute force/password spray techniques, and known vulnerability exploitation against accounts and networks with weak security,"" the joint bulletin says. ""These continued intrusions have enabled the actors to acquire sensitive, unclassified information, as well as CDC-proprietary and export-controlled technology,"" the FBI, NSA and CISA said.",12
2022-02-17,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-fallout-wait-putin-note/story?id=82936984,Ukraine fallout doesn't wait on Putin: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The will-he or when-will-he expectations surrounding Russian President Vladimir Putin's next moves may seem like an endless cycle. It's not one that has frozen politics in place, though. Weeks of waiting, forecasting and preparing have revealed stark divisions and stubborn truths surrounding the Biden presidency at a precarious time on the world stage. A long-sought bipartisan Senate response fizzled, replaced by a potential nonbinding ""sense of the Senate"" resolution voicing support for Ukraine against Putin. Lawmakers are now focused on keeping government running beyond Friday, with COVID mandates a potential sticking point that could lead to a shutdown nobody really wants. Gas prices and jittery markets have underscored what a conflict with Russia over Ukraine might mean. Any hit from new sanctions would come on top of inflation worries that have Democrats seeking elusive election-year solutions. A new Quinnipiac University poll finds 54% disapproval of President Joe Biden's handling of tensions between Russia and Ukraine, with just 34% approval. Biden's numbers on the economy are even weaker, with 61% disapproval against 33% approval. The Biden administration, long frustrated by Putin's geopolitical chess, has taken an unusual course of trying to call out his moves publicly in advance. But the wait itself has had consequences, regardless of how the current crisis ends. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema The ouster of three San Francisco Education Board members demonstrated the peak of ongoing intra-party battles for Democrats. But in the aftermath, it was Republicans who most visibly celebrated the outcome. As reported by ABC News' Nicholas Kerr and Zohreen Shah, the removal of the school board members is the first of its kind in the city's history and marks the first major political fallout of the 2022 election cycle. The debate leading to that outcome was rooted in parents' outrage that the board was prioritizing a push for social justice causes -- including renaming schools -- rather than focusing on opening schools to students. Although the fight was sparked by Democrats in one of the nation's bluest political regions, Republicans at both state and national levels seized on the development as proof of voters' disappointment in Democratic policies. In a floor speech on Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said it wasn't surprising that ""parents are watching this nonsense and demanding change."" ""American parents are speaking out. But instead of listening to them, the political left is lashing out,"" McConnell alleged. According to Quinnipiac polling released Wednesday, Americans currently rank inflation, immigration and COVID-19 as the most urgent issues facing the country. Financial documents reviewed by ABC News show the recall effort in San Francisco was largely bankrolled by big donors who don't have children in the district. The episode further highlights an ongoing 2022 theme in which debates over school policies have become ground zero for voter mobilization efforts. The TIP with Lalee Ibssa Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman has chosen who he wants his successor to be: Jane Timken. Portman, who isn't seeking reelection for a third term citing partisan gridlock in Congress, endorsed the former chair of the Ohio Republican Party on Wednesday. The race for Portman's old seat features a crowded Republican primary, including former state treasurer Josh Mandel, ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author J.D. Vance, state Sen. Matt Dolan and investment banker Mike Gibbons, most of whom are running as Trump conservatives. Ohio's Republican Senate primary is one of the few high-profile races Trump has yet to endorse in. As a more moderate member of the Republican Party who has strayed away from fully embracing Trump, Portman's endorsement of Timken makes it less likely Trump will back her as well. Nevertheless, Timken still seems to be trying to play to both sides. In a statement, Timken thanked Portman for his endorsement, adding that Portman ""successfully led the effort to pass President Trump's tax cuts"" and ""worked with President Trump to advance three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court.""

2022-02-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-correct-uneven-terrain-note/story?id=82962679,Democrats course-correct on uneven terrain: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The issues may be settling in. The directions they point toward continue to move in ways that defy prediction. The news of recent days adds up to a disturbing mix for the Democratic Party. There's inflation, COVID anger, political paralysis, a crisis in Ukraine with implications for energy markets and national security. The party in power is adjusting -- sometimes willingly, sometimes less so. Democratic governors continue to roll back COVID restrictions; progressive parents in San Francisco recalled school board members who were viewed as focusing on the wrong priorities; the White House is acknowledging inflation and gas-price worries and recasting plans to address both; the State of the Union address March 1 will now feature a full House chamber. There's potentially some good political news ahead for Democrats. President Joe Biden is expected to pick a new Supreme Court justice in the next week, and there's growing optimism about there being an effective end to the pandemic. But there's enough uncertainty, courtesy of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a jittery economy among other factors, to ensure that any course-correction by Democrats is built on shaky ground at this point. ""The state of the union is stressed,"" David Axelrod, a senior adviser and strategist in the Obama-Biden White House, wrote in a widely shared New York Times op-ed this week. ""To claim otherwise — to highlight the progress we have made, without fully acknowledging the hard road we have traveled and the distance we need to go — would seem off-key and out of touch."" Axelrod's prescription -- ""humility"" -- might fit the Biden brand. But Democrats can't be sure if it fits the moment, in part because it's still hard to say what the moment looks like at any point in time. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper While Biden works toward announcing his Supreme Court pick, Senate Democrats are making it known that they intend to move quickly on confirmation. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told reporters Thursday he wants to see the confirmation process complete by April 9. ""I'd like to get this done before the Easter break because that adds two weeks to the process, and I think we can do it,"" Durbin told reporters. White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One that President Biden ""could begin interviewing potential nominees as soon as this week."" Biden needs a simple majority to confirm his pick, but Democrats will need to be unified in order to confirm her without Republican votes. Concerns about the potential absence of Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., after he suffered a stroke -- which would trigger a need for Republican support -- have seemingly been staved off for now. In a video released by Lujan's office, the recovering senator pledges to return to Washington in time to vote for Biden's Supreme Court pick. Even so, the president told NBC he believes his still-unnamed nominee will garner GOP votes. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema With the clock slowly winding down on the Supreme Court issuing a decision in the Mississippi case that could overturn Roe v. Wade, another state is advancing legislation to ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. On Thursday, Florida's House of Representatives passed HB 5, a GOP-backed bill that would cut the state's current 24-week abortion access timeline nearly in half. The legislation mirrors the Mississippi law currently before the Supreme Court. And although Florida's bill allows exceptions involving risk to a pregnant person's life, it does not include exceptions for rape or incest. Regional Planned Parenthood doctors say the law would severely impact pregnant people who do not have means to travel outside of Florida to seek abortions. The bill's implementation would also limit abortion access for people from surrounding states. The measure could be passed by both chambers as soon as next week, and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who previously expressed support for this kind of legislation, is likely to sign it into law. West Virginia and Arizona have also recently advanced 15-week abortion bans.

2022-02-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-responds-sanctions-putin-recognizes-breakaway-ukraine-regions/story?id=83027213,Biden responds with limited sanctions after Putin recognizes breakaway Ukraine regions,"President Joe Biden on Monday reacted swiftly to Russian President Vladimir Putin declaring he would recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, possibly using the move as a pretext for an invasion the U.S. has warned was likely coming at any hour. The White House said Biden would soon issue an executive order ""that will prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in"" the two Ukrainian regions under the control of Russian-backed separatists, Donetsk and Luhansk. The order ""will also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. She added that the U.S. ""will also soon announce additional measures related to today’s blatant violation of Russia’s international commitments."" But the White House added these sanctions were not the same punishing ones the U.S. has threatened for weeks -- crippling Russia's banking sector, restricting access to semiconductors, targeting Putin and those close to him, and more -- if Russia actually launched an invasion. ""These measures,"" Psaki said, ""are separate from and would be in addition to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in coordination with allies and partners should Russia further invade Ukraine."" The European Union said it, too, would ""react with sanctions against those involved in this illegal act"" of recognizing the Ukrainian regions' independence, which are under the separatists' partial control. The announcements came soon after Putin said during a televised address that he would recognize the regions' independence. “I believe that it’s necessary to take a decision that has long been coming — to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donesk’s People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic,” Putin said, using the names the separatists use for the regions. Moscow already de facto controls the two self-declared republics, which make up only a portion of the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, with the authorities answerable to Russian operatives. Putin's announcement and subsequent decrees he signed recognizing the regions' independence -- expected to be ratified by Russia's parliament on Tuesday -- raised the question of whether he would then take the more provocative step of formally annexing them, and sending Russian troops into Ukraine. The American sanctions were comparable to the actions the U.S. took after Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, and most people impacted would already have likely been subject to sanctions anyway, according to Thomas Graham, who served as the White House National Security Council's director for Russia under George W. Bush. ""These aren't going to have much of an impact, if at all,"" on what Russia does moving forward, Graham, an expert on Russia at the Council on Foreign Relations, told ABC News. During Putin's lengthy speech, Biden spoke on the phone for 35 minutes with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to the White House. Biden also spoke for half an hour today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanel Macron, according to the White House; both spoke with Putin over the past couple days. Earlier, Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, CIA Director William Burns, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, all arrived at the White House for a meeting of Biden's national security team on Presidents Day morning Previously, while the U.S. and Western allies have said they would be united in imposing severe sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine, they had been more ambiguous about what steps they would take if Russia stopped short of a full-on invasion. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that Russia recognizing the regions' independence would ""necessitate a swift and firm response from the United States in full coordination with our allies and partners."" The White House meeting came a day after officials said Biden was, ""in principle,"" open to a summit with Putin, brokered by France's President Emmanuel Macron, on the condition that Russia did not invade. Russian officials were cool to the idea on Monday. During their meeting with Putin, Russia's defense minister, foreign minister, chiefs of intelligence agencies, and the heads of parliament and senate, all called on Putin to recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk. Biden said Friday the U.S. had ""reason to believe"" that Russia would invade ""within days."" On Sunday, U.S. officials told ABC News that lower-level Russian tactical commanders had been making plans on the ground, at the local level, to invade Ukraine. A senior Biden administration official said Sunday that no plans existed yet for a potential Biden-Putin summit, and that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov would discuss the format and timing later this week – as long as Russia did not invade. The diplomatic proposal emerged from two calls Macron held with Putin and one with Biden Sunday; his second with Putin began around 1 a.m. Moscow time Monday morning, according to the Elysée Palace. Biden told Macron that, ""in principle, he would be prepared to meet with Putin if President Putin stood down from his invasion,"" Biden's top national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in an interview with ""Good Morning America"" on Monday. But, Sullivan added, ""We can't say anything other than indications on the ground look like Russia is still moving forward."" Meanwhile, during their meeting in Moscow, Putin and top Russian national security officials bluntly questioned the usefulness of holding any new summit with Biden, suggesting it would be pointless unless the United States had changed its position. Putin said that Macron suggested there were some ""changes"" in the U.S. position, although he added he could not see what they would be. Russia's foreign minister said he would speak to his French counterpart today – but was sure the U.S. would not provide positive responses to Russia's needs. Even as U.S. officials warned a Russian invasion appears imminent, they also said they were still open to talking. ""We never give up hope on diplomacy until the missiles fly or the tanks roll,"" Sullivan said. ""We've been working hard for months with our allies and partners to get Russia to sit down in a serious way at the table."" But, he added, ""The likelihood there's a diplomatic solution, given the troop movements of the Russians, is diminishing hour by hour.""

2022-02-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/eyes-putin-chances-diplomatic-solution-dissolve-note/story?id=82962754,All eyes on Putin as chances of diplomatic solution dissolve: The Note,"The TAKE with Averi Harper Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognize the independence of Russian-controlled Ukrainian separatist states Monday have been widely interpreted as an escalation of tensions and have triggered limited sanctions from both the White House and the European Union. These aren’t the ""severe"" sanctions promised if Russia invades Ukraine, but a warning shot. Still, the threat of far-reaching sanctions and the offer of a diplomatic out -- a soft agreement of a meeting between President Joe Biden and Putin if the Russian leader stands down -- hasn’t deterred a progression of Russian troops around Ukraine. ""We never give up hope on diplomacy until the missiles fly or the tanks roll,"" National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told ""Good Morning America"" anchor Michael Strahan. He later added, ""The likelihood there's a diplomatic solution given the troop movements of the Russians is diminishing hour by hour."" In an interview with ABC News' Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned of a potentially dangerous situation for civilians in Ukraine’s capital city. He indicated that Russia has the capability to have a ""significant amount of combat power move very quickly to take Kyiv."" A conflict wouldn’t just have an impact in Ukraine and Russia. There is also a threat of global economic impact. Look no further than the already soaring gas prices. A Russian invasion and subsequent severe sanctions could result in energy prices in the U.S. going even higher, a possibility Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. The risk of higher gas prices amid inflation worries could worsen what some would describe as dismal prospects for political gains for Biden and Democrats during this high-stakes election year. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema Although much of Washington's focus is turning to global affairs, Americans continue to grapple with evolving parameters surrounding COVID-19 restrictions. Virtually all states have announced intentions to end indoor mask mandates, but the issue of coronavirus-related mandates remains a particularly charged topic among some groups. As reported by ABC News' Rachel Scott, Luke Barr and Beatrice Peterson, the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department is bulking up resources ahead of potential trucker protests similar to those that occurred in Ottawa, Canada, in protest of the country's coronavirus-related restrictions. The effort is happening as a group of American truckers from California announced a cross-country tour in protest of ongoing COVID-19 mandates. The tour is slated to make stops in six states before concluding in Maryland. The group is not expected to enter the city limits of Washington, D.C., but authorities are still on alert. Officers in the Metropolitan Police Department will start increasing patrols across areas surrounding the nation's capital starting Tuesday through March 5, shortly after the president's State of the Union address. D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee told reporters Friday that mitigation efforts are in the early stages, and though Washington has alternative modes of transportation available to citizens, ""we have to be realistic"" that there could be ""disruptions to traffic."" ""I think we need to be very candid with the public about what some of the expectations based upon what we've seen in Ottawa ... some of those things could be [what] we might see here in the district,"" Contee said. The TIP with Lalee Ibssa The Ohio Redistricting Commission will meet Tuesday after failing to comply with the state Supreme Court's order to pass new state House and Senate maps by last week. The commission, which includes Gov. Mike DeWine, faces a Wednesday noon deadline to explain to the court why it should not be held in contempt for the missed deadline. It comes as the court previously rejected two sets of Republican-approved legislative maps and one congressional map, citing unconstitutional gerrymandering toward Republicans. Now, top election officials in the state are warning that the ongoing redistricting battle is jeopardizing the ability to hold the state's primary election in May. ""Let me be impeccably clear about something. With just four weeks until ballots are required to be sent to our men and women in uniform and their families overseas, and with much to be done in preparation, we are dangerously close to possibly violating federal law,"" Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said in last week's redistricting meeting. ""We need finality."" North Carolina already moved its primary from March until May of 2022 due to ongoing redistricting litigation in the state. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 30.

2022-02-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-nears-supreme-court-pick-interviews-short-list/story?id=83047608,Biden nears Supreme Court pick after interviews with short-list candidates,"President Joe Biden is zeroing in on his first pick for the U.S. Supreme Court, completing interviews with candidates on his short list and moving toward a final decision this week, a person familiar with the process confirmed to ABC News on Tuesday. Biden said this month he was considering ""about four"" names -- all Black women -- to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, studying their writings, legal experience and personal backgrounds. U.S. District Court Judge J. Michelle Childs, 55, is the only person publicly confirmed by the White House as under formal consideration and is endorsed by South Carolina Democratic Rep. James Clyburn, an influential Biden ally. U.S. Appeals Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, 51, and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, 45, are also getting a close look, sources have told ABC News. Jackson, a former Breyer clerk who previously met one-on-one with Biden at the White House ahead of her appeals court nomination, is widely considered the front-runner. A spokesman said the president has been impressed with her ""experience in roles at all levels of the justice system, her character and her legal brilliance."" The completion of several interviews means the president is nearing a decision, but a White House spokesman said late Tuesday that ""the president has not yet chosen a nominee."" ""He continues to evaluate eminently qualified individuals in the mold of Justice Breyer who have the strongest records, intellect, character, and dedication to the rule of law that anyone could ask for - and all of whom would be deserving of bipartisan support,"" White House spokesman Andrew Bates tweeted. The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources, reported that Jackson and Childs have been interviewed. The White House and allies close to the process declined to comment on the report to ABC News. Despite the fact that Biden's schedule and attention have been dominated by the crisis between Russia and Ukraine, aides say announcement of the nomination -- promised by the end of the month -- is expected this week. Exact timing and format of a nomination event have not been determined because the president has not formally made his pick, sources said. The president's allies on Capitol Hill and among grassroots groups have begun mobilizing to promote and defend the nominee, gearing up for a media blitz to mark both the historic nature of the nomination and counter expected Republican attacks, some of which have already been racially-charged.",28

Trump's comments came Tuesday during an appearance on the conservative talk radio program ""The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show,"" during which Trump praised the Russian president while simultaneously slamming President Joe Biden for the situation. ""You gotta say, that's pretty savvy,"" Trump said of Putin's decision to declare certain breakaway regions in Ukraine as independent, a move that has severely raised tensions on the Russian-Ukraine border. ""And you know what the response was from Biden? There was no response. They didn't have one for that. No, it's very sad. Very sad."" ""This is genius,"" Trump said. ""Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine ... Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful."" Biden announced Tuesday that Russia's latest moves amounted to ""the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" and said he would send additional U.S. troops to the region. The U.S. and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia as Ukraine's top security official announced Wednesday that a nationwide state of emergency will be declared due to the threat of a Russian invasion. Biden said Tuesday that the latest U.S. sanctions would target two Russian banks, Russia's sovereign debt, and members of the Russian elite and their relatives. Republican leaders have been critical of Biden, saying his response to the situation has been too weak. Trump has long expressed an admiration for Putin, saying on Tuesday that as president, he got along ""great"" with the Russian leader. ""He liked me. I liked him. I mean, you know, he's a tough cookie, got a lot of great charm and a lot of pride,"" Trump said. ""And he loves his country, you know? He loves his country.""

2022-02-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/analysis-inside-process-shutting-us-embassy/story?id=83060002,ANALYSIS: How the US government shut down the US Embassy in Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been threatening aggressive action against Ukraine for weeks in an attempt to ensure Russian security. These overtones have increased by the day, forcing the United States and the rest of the world to react and respond to a growing threat to Ukrainian sovereignty, its residents and the tens of thousands of American personnel and citizens living and working in the country. The need to protect American assets and personnel in country has become more necessary, resulting in a Feb. 12 “Do Not Travel” notification, the highest the State Department issues. An order was also issued, mandating the immediate evacuation of almost all government personnel in the country and the closure of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. Under any departure circumstance, the Chief of Mission (ambassador) coordinates with the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) Regional Security officer and the Embassy’s Emergency Action Committee (EAC), which is responsible for planning for and directing emergency responses in times of crisis or during threats against an embassy and/or its personnel. DSS special agents are the most widely deployed American assets throughout the world, protecting over 275 U.S. diplomatic missions in over 170 countries and 30 U.S. cities. These missions include investigation and protection and enable the agents to get involved in all aspects of American foreign policy, from international criminal identification and apprehension of criminals and terrorists to the protection of important U.S. figures and citizens, such as the secretary of state, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and other senior diplomats. Similar to the recent drawdown of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, the situation in the Ukraine is forcing the DSS Agents to adapt and respond. In Kabul, the drawdown triggered the immediate evacuation of all staff from the embassy. In Ukraine, the State Department initially ordered an authorized departure, allowing voluntary relocation of families and some staff, and then moved to an ordered departure, the highest level of non-emergency departure for State Department personnel. Like a drawdown, an ordered departure is not voluntary. This departure mandates that all family members and non-essential staff are ordered to depart on evacuation status. Typically, the ambassador will designate the DSS RSO as the incident commander for contingency operations impacting the embassy and its personnel, including during drawdowns or departures. As the Incident Commander, an RSO is empowered and authorized to do all that is necessary to protect people, property, materials and assets located at the embassy or in country. The first step is to secure and destroy all sensitive information and equipment at the embassy, including those used by the intelligence agencies. This includes facilitating the removal of sensitive intelligence or gear deemed of national security significance back to the United States with the use of DSS Diplomatic Couriers. To assist, the RSO is empowered and authorized by law to supervise and direct any and all Department of Defense (DOD) assets to include the Marine Security Guard Detachment. In most cases, when a drawdown or departure is authorized, RSOs will call in a supplemental Marine Security Augmentation Unit (MSAU) which can be a force multiplier during the closure of an embassy. RSOs can also call in additional DSS assets, including elite Mobile Security Deployments (MSD) teams, which is the State Department’s dedicated on-call crisis response tactical element. MSD teams are available to deploy anywhere in the world within 12 hours notice and provide RSOs with supplemental equipment, skills and capability similar to a military Special Operations team. Unlike their DOD counterparts, these MSD teams are exclusively made up of specially selected and trained DSS special agents, not soldiers. While securing the embassy and destroying sensitive information and equipment is critical, the evacuation of Kyiv embassy personnel is also a priority. Depending on the circumstances on the ground, the evacuation of personnel can be facilitated by commercial or DOD assets. In the case of Kabul, DOD assets were used but the sensitivity of the situation in the Ukraine means the RSOs had to coordinate and rely on commercial modes of travel outside of the capital to Lviv or other parts of Eastern Europe. And while the RSOs are handling the evacuation of embassy personnel and the closure of the embassy, the fate of American citizens, an estimated 30,000 in Ukraine, must also be factored into the planning and execution. Under the State Departments’ “No Double Standard” policy, American citizens were warned to leave the country due to the threat. They can leave by commercial means or, if an emergency happens, work with the U.S. Embassy to get out. As the embassy in Kyiv was secured, the last Americans to leave were the DSS agents assigned there. One of their final tasks was to lower the United States flag and ensure the ambassador safely takes it and then secure compound. But even with the embassy closed and flag removed, the State Department has announced this is hopefully a temporary measure, meaning that when the circumstances are right, the embassy building could be reopened. When that happens, the DSS personnel will be the first back in. Donald J.

2022-02-23,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-american-doctor-concerned-family-living-threat-war/story?id=83066445,Ukrainian American doctor concerned for family living under threat of war with Russia,"This is a MedPage Today story. Dr. Roksolana Vaskul, an anesthesiologist at RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey, was recently FaceTiming with her 34-year-old niece who lives in western Ukraine. The niece's 7-year-old daughter came home from school and told her mother her class was taught ""how to run out of the school, to see how fast they could go,"" Vaskul told MedPage Today. Her niece didn't ask ""where they were running to, because she didn't want to traumatize her more than she already was."" Vaskul's other sister, who also lives in western Ukraine, said her 11- and 13-year-old children were being trained in school ""what to do if there would be a bombing, and what to do if they were at home, or at school or on the streets"" when it happened. ""We were having a casual conversation about that,"" Vaskul said. ""It's so surreal because this is like a European country and you wouldn't expect something like this to happen in our lifetime."" The threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine has Ukrainian Americans -- especially those who still have family in Ukraine -- on edge. Vaskul, who is the board chairwoman for the Ukrainian American Cultural Center of New Jersey, is sharing her story in the hopes that her colleagues would recognize the difficulties facing the nation she once called home, and the importance of American support. ""The lives of so many people are in one person's hands,"" she noted, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vaskul has two daughters who were born in the U.S., ages 16 and 23. Some of their cousins from Ukraine recently came to visit for the holidays and stayed with them for a couple of weeks, so to hear that they're living under the threat of war has been devastating to her girls. ""When they hear all of this, they are just terrified,"" Vaskul said. ""My 16-year-old starts crying."" Vaskul came to the U.S. in December 1991, just four months after the country declared its independence from the former Soviet Union. At that time, independence was very fragile, she explained. While she only planned to visit the U.S., she ultimately decided to stay -- partially because she didn't feel truly ""free"" at home. By the time she came to the U.S., she had already completed medical school and a residency. Medical school was taught in Russian; all her textbooks were in Russian, she said. ""They would announce during your first day of medical school, this is your KGB agent,"" she said. ""You had a KGB agent assigned to your village, everyone knew who he was."" ""This was just the announced person,"" she added. ""Then you had multiple unannounced people working for the KGB. You're talking complete control."" At that time, people living under Soviet rule weren't allowed to travel, read foreign newspapers or practice religion, she explained. Vaskul and her family would celebrate Christmas ""underground"" in her grandmother's basement. No one could listen to ""foreign"" music like the Beatles, she said. ""If someone would catch you listening to 'American propaganda,' you would be kicked out of university,"" she said. Vaskul was able to support herself in the U.S. by working in restaurants for about a year, while studying for the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. Ultimately, she passed and was able to do a preliminary year in surgery, followed by a three-year residency in anesthesiology at St. Barnabas Medical Center, which is part of the health system where she now works. Vaskul met her husband, who is also of Ukrainian descent, in the U.S., had her daughters in America and hasn't looked back. She's grateful to the U.S. for the opportunities she's had and strongly hopes the nation will support and defend Ukraine should Putin strike. She believes the U.S. is obligated to do so by its endorsement of the Budapest Memorandum, signed by American, British, Ukrainian and Russian leaders in 1994. Under the terms of the agreement, Ukraine turned over its nuclear arsenal to Russia, in exchange for military protection from the U.S. and U.K. However, there has been some controversy over the exact protections guaranteed by the document. To Vaskul, the possibility of an attack is likely and very real. It's difficult imagining Ukrainian cities full of bombed-out ruins, and how drastically life would change for her sisters and their children, who've been living a Western lifestyle. ""It's a different generation now,"" she said. ""Young people there speak English now. They travel. They have Facebook and Instagram. The majority of the Ukrainian people want to be with Europe. They don't want to go back to this old regime."" On Tuesday, the Biden administration condemned the beginnings of a Russian ""invasion"" of Ukraine, and imposed stronger sanctions, along with other allied nations. Vaskul said that while it's difficult to predict what will happen next, the threat of war touching her family's lives remains very real. ""I'm concerned and I'm scared and I'm devastated, for my family and for all the Ukrainian people,"" Vaskul said.",22
2022-02-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/beginning-russias-invasion-ukraine-note/story?id=82963166,The 'beginning' of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is here: The Note,"The TAKE with Averi Harper The will he, won’t he question surrounding Russian President Vladimir Putin and potential invasion of Ukraine is a thing of the past, according to President Joe Biden. ""This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" Biden said in sobering remarks from the White House on Tuesday. In his speech, Biden announced that additional troops would be sent to Eastern Europe and that sanctions targeting Russian banks, sovereign debt and oligarchs with connections to the Kremlin would go into effect. The announcement came as Germany halted certification of Nord Stream 2, a natural gas pipeline between Germany and Russia. The European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada have also issued sanctions in response to Russia’s actions. ""Who, in the Lord's name, does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbors?"" Biden said. ""This is a flagrant violation of international law and demands a firm response from the international community."" In an indication that the door to diplomacy has slammed shut, at least for now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced he would no longer meet with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Blinken warned that even more sanctions could be coming. ""Any further escalatory steps by Russia will be met with further swift and severe measures, coordinated with allies and partners,"" Blinken told reporters. One Biden administration official left open the possibility of sanctioning Putin himself when asked by ABC News' Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl. The official said ""all options remain on the table."" What remains to be seen is if these sanctions will be effective in deterring further Russian aggression. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema Amid evolving global tensions, President Joe Biden continues to weigh a major domestic priority -- his nomination to the Supreme Court. Earlier this month, the president said he was considering ""about four"" candidates to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, after publicly promising his pick would be a Black woman. As reported by ABC News' Devin Dwyer and Rachel Scott, a person familiar with the process confirmed Biden has begun interviews with candidates on his short list for potential nomination and has interviewed at least three women for the role. A source closely involved with the selection and planned announcement of the president's pick also said the process remains on track and is likely to come this week, even as the president's schedule remains dominated by the situation unfolding between Russia and Ukraine. So far, the White House has only publicly confirmed U.S. District Court Judge J. Michelle Childs as being under formal consideration. Childs is endorsed by House Majority Whip James Clyburn. As previously reported by ABC News, Federal Appeals Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger are also under consideration, according to sources. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged that the timeline set by the White House to make the announcement by the end of the month is coming up, but she declined to reveal additional details. ""The president has not made a decision about who he's going to nominate,"" Psaki told reporters. The TIP with Lalee Ibssa Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds is being tapped to deliver the Republican response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address next week, a position often awarded to the party’s rising star. ""While Washington Democrats fail working Americans, Republican governors are fighting and winning for families,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in the announcement statement. ""Gov. Kim Reynolds’ brave, bold and successful leadership for Iowans has put her right at the front of that pack."" The honor comes as Reynolds was thrust into the national spotlight during the coronavirus pandemic for her opposition to mandates and for requiring schools to reopen for in-person learning. Reynolds, the first female governor of Iowa, received praise from Republican leadership for her policies they say puts ""freedom over lockdowns."" She also received ovation from her party for banning schools from teaching ""divisive topics"" such as systemic racism or sexism. Reynolds’ policies signal the type of legislative priorities Republicans hope to run on ahead of this year’s crucial midterm election. Next week’s address will not only provide a national platform for Reynolds, who is up for re-election this year, but it's also an opportunity for Republicans to highlight these campaign promises as they fight to win back control of Congress.

2022-02-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announces-sanctions-russian-banks-elites-putin/story?id=83085065,"Biden announces new sanctions on Russian banks, elites but not yet on Putin himself","After weeks of warning of ""severe"" sanctions if Russia invaded Ukraine, President Joe Biden addressed the nation and the world from the White House Thursday in what's unfolding as a defining moment in his presidency as President Vladimir Putin pressed a large-scale attack. Biden announced escalated sanctions to correspond with the escalated Russian aggression, but not the full economic punishment Ukraine and others have called for and none yet on Putin himself, although he did say that option was ""not a bluff. It's on the table."" ""Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,"" Biden said. ""Today, I am authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia. This is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time."" Biden announced new sanctions on four large Russian banks including VTB and SberBank, additional Russian elites and family members, and restrictions on Russia's sovereign debt to state-owned enterprises, which are companies whose assets exceed $1.4 trillion, to keep them from raising money. However, Biden stopped short not only of sanctioning Putin himself but also of cutting Russia off from the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) international banking system -- which would significantly hinder Russia's participation in global markets. Pressed by reporters why not sanction Putin directly now, Biden deflected. ""Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point,"" said ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega. ""What is going to stop him? How and when does this end? And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine?"" ""No one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening,"" Biden replied. ""It has to -- it's going to take time, and we have to show resolve. So, he knows what is coming. And so the people of Russia know what he's brought on them."" Biden: 'Putin chose this war' As a whole, Biden estimated the sanctions would ""cut off more than half of Russia's high-tech imports."" He said, ""We'll strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It will degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program. It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin's long-term strategic ambitions."" But it's still unclear whether the sanctions will make any difference in what Putin claimed overnight would be a ""special military operation"" in eastern Ukraine, which is proving to be much more widespread. ""To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside, if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history,"" Putin warned the world. While it was also still unclear just how far Putin would go beyond eastern Ukraine, Russian forces attacked near the capital city Kyiv -- raising new fears he would try to topple Ukraine's government. Biden has maintained that U.S. forces will not fight Russians on the ground but announced he was authorizing additional U.S. force capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO's response force. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East. As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,"" Biden said, adding the U.S. is prepared ""for additional moves, should they become necessary, to protect our NATO allies and support the greatest military alliance in the history of the world."" The president also said that NATO would convene a summit Friday. ""This aggression cannot go unanswered,"" he added. ""If it did, the consequences would be much worse."" Will Biden sanction Putin personally? The Biden administration had threatened further sanctions on major Russian financial institutions and banks and to take steps to restrict Russian access to technology -- as it did Thursday -- but it had also weighed cutting Russia off from SWIFT and to directly sanction Putin's inner circle -- or the Russian president himself. Pressed on why Biden hasn't gone that far, he reminded that some decisions must be made in unison with European allies. ""The sanctions that we are proposing on all their banks have the equal consequence, maybe more consequence than SWIFT, number one. Number two, it is always an option but right now that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,"" Biden said. Biden told reporters late last month that he would consider personally sanctioning Putin if Russia invaded Ukraine -- a day after 8,500 American forces were put on ""heightened alert"" in the region -- but those efforts did not appear to deter the Russian leader, nor did economic sanctions imposed this week by the U.S. and European allies, including halting the certification of Nord Stream 2, a major natural gas pipeline running from Russia to Germany. The administration has begun to roll out a ""first tranche"" of sanctions, related to Russian banks, oligarchs and the natural gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, as some lawmakers have criticized Biden of not going far enough on sanctions, which haven't resulted in Russia reversing course. With Thursday's announcement, the U.S. has targeted ten of Russia's largest financial institutions ""holding nearly 80% of Russian banking sector assets,"" the White House said. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell at a press event in Kentucky ahead of Biden's remarks called on the administration to ""ratchet the sanctions all the way up"" on Russia. ""Don't hold any back. Every single available tough sanction should be employed and should be employed now,"" McConnell said. He said ""we honestly don't know"" if sanctions would be enough to deter Putin but argued harsher ones were still necessary. Russian forces have already advanced from three directions -- from the south heading north, from Belarus heading south to Kyiv and from northeast of Ukraine heading to the south -- as Ukrainians woke up to a nation at war. Biden argued Putin's ambitions are larger than Ukraine. ""He wants to in fact reestablish the former Soviet Union. That is what this is about,"" Biden said. US military and intelligence assessment, diplomatic moves U.S. intelligence believes these three axes were ""designed to take key population centers,"" a senior defense official said Thursday. The White House promised ""united and decisive"" sanctions, but it remains to be seen how the West can punish Putin, who seems intent on moving ahead with his plans, despite weeks of attempted diplomacy from the international community and a set of sanctions already imposed. As the Russian attack began overnight, Biden was on the phone within minutes with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had reached out to him after receiving ""silence,"" he said, on a phone call to Putin. Russia has two tactical goals in Ukraine, according to Zelenskyy's office: seizing territory and toppling Ukrainian leadership. Consequences -- for Americans After their call, Biden released a statement saying that Putin ""has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering."" The American president has acknowledged that there will be ""consequences at home"" -- particularly in energy prices -- as a result of the Russian invasion and subsequent sanctions, but vowed Thursday ""to do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump."" However, ahead of his remarks, U.S. crude oil prices topped $100 a barrel, sending gasoline prices to an average of $3.54 a gallon, according to the American Automobile Association. At least three states had average gas prices of $4 or higher. Meanwhile, U.S. stock and Dow futures also plunged. Addressing those concerns, Biden said the U.S. is working with countries to elevate collective release from the strategic petroleum reserves and that the U.S. will release additional barrels of oil ""as conditions warrant."" He also warned American oil and gas companies not to ""exploit this moment"" for profit. Throughout the crisis, Biden has reminded Americans that the U.S. has a responsibility to defend its NATO allies -- and democracy around the world. ""America stands up to bullies,"" Biden said Thursday. ""We stand up for freedom. This is who we are."" ""Liberty, democracy, human dignity. These are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression,"" he said. ""They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies.""

2022-02-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/concerns-mount-fighting-chernobyl-exclusion-zone/story?id=83085943,Concerns mount over conflict in Chernobyl exclusion zone,"As Russian troops continue to inch their way through its invasion of Ukraine, a secondary catastrophe to the fighting between the ex-Soviet neighbors is possible: another nuclear reaction at Chernobyl. On Thursday afternoon, Russian armed forces entered the deserted exclusion zone around the Chernobyl power plant, where the world's worst nuclear accident took place in 1986. By night, Russian forces had taken full control of the area, including the plant itself, according to Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. The heavy fighting inside the ""exclusion zone,"" a vast and empty land surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear plant that includes the ghost city of Pripyat, is causing concern that it could spark another nuclear disaster. International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano is watching the situation with ""grave concern, appealing for ""maximum restraint"" amid the conflict to avoid putting the nuclear facility at risk. ""It is of vital importance that the safe and secure operations of the nuclear facilities in that zone should not be affected or disrupted in any way,"" Mariano said in a statement. On April 26, 1986, reactor No. 4 at the power plant, about 65 miles north of the capital Kyiv, exploded, spewing enormous amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere and causing more than 100,000 people in a 1,000-square-mile radius to evacuate. The destroyed reactor itself was sealed in 2019 under a $2 billion arch-shaped shelter, a stadium-sized metal structure that was built over it to contain, but the other three untouched reactors remain ""fully exposed,"" said Tim Mousseau, a professor of biological sciences at the University of South Carolina who has been studying Chernobyl for more than 20 years. ""There are more than 5 million pounds of spent nuclear fuel, also uranium and plutonium and a few other nasty isotopes, sitting in the cooling ponds of the the three reactors that didn't blow up in 1986,"" Mousseau said. The fighting represents an ""existential threat"" to the environment, Mousseau told ABC News. Should missiles hit the structure over reactor No. 4, where ""quite a bit"" of radioactive material is left, or the facility where the spent nuclear fuel that accumulated over the decades of operation there is stored, it would cause large amounts of radioactive nuclear dust to spread throughout the region, Mousseau said. ""If this storage area were to be hit with any kind of any kind of missile, this could release vast quantities of highly radioactive material would spread far and wide, potentially causing an even larger disaster than the 1986 disaster,"" he said. In addition, the area surrounding the power plant is ""absolutely the most radioactive place on the planet,"" Mousseau said. That, combined with the ""tinderbox"" conditions left by severe forest fires in recent years, could allow a fast-sweeping wildfires to spew radio nuclides back into the atmosphere and ""spread it again far and wide,"" Mousseau said. Russian forces in Chernobyl prove an additional worrying sign for Ukraine, as they are now about an hour's drive from the capital. Russian special forces have also managed to keep hold of a key military airport just 20 miles from the very center of Kyiv, despite fierce fighting. ""Unfortunately, we are obliged to inform that as things stand the Chernobyl Zone, the so-called 'Exclusion Zone' and all the Chernobyl nuclear power station have been taken under the control of the Russian armed groups,"" Shmyhal told UNIAN, Ukraine's main news wire. Russia's decision to enter Ukraine through such a vulnerable region as Chernobyl could be emblematic of additional escalation to come, Mousseau said, describing the situation facing the disaster site as ""the worst nightmare come true."" ""No one in their right mind would want to engage in warfare in that region for fear of unleashing potentially the largest nuclear disaster ever,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted that Ukrainian troops were fighting and ""giving their lives"" to avoid another 1986 Chernobyl disaster. ""This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe,"" Zelenskyy wrote of the occupation. U.S. officials had predicted before the invasion that Russia would use special forces to land into the capital before forces from Belarus, which borders the northern side of the exclusion zone, would sweep down rapidly in an effort to back Russia's lightning strike to seize the city.

2022-02-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-democrats-republicans-stiffer-sanctions-gop-divided-biden/story?id=83091847,"Top Democrats and Republicans want stiffer sanctions, but GOP divided on Biden","Shortly after President Joe Biden on Thursday announced new sanctions on Russian banks and elites -- but not on Russian President Vladimir Putin himself -- a top Senate Democrat pointedly called on him to go further. ""As we seek to impose maximum costs on Putin, there is more that we can and should do. Congress and the Biden administration must not shy away from any options—including sanctioning the Russian Central Bank, removing Russian banks from the SWIFT [international banking] system, crippling Russia's key industries, sanctioning Putin personally, and taking all steps to deprive Putin and his inner circle of their assets,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged the administration in a statement. The Democratic chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Adam Schiff, told reporters Thursday that he, too, would support removing Russia from the SWIFT banking system as many Republicans have called for as tensions worsened. ""We must provide Ukraine with support to defend itself. We also are going to need to, I think, dramatically escalate the sanctions that we place on Russia for this act of naked aggression by the Kremlin dictator. We need to move, I think, to sanction the largest banks in Russia, we have to cut off Russia from the International financing system and its ability to access Western capital. We need to attack its ability to gather sophisticated technology for its weapons systems,"" Schiff told reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday. Asked why SWIFT was not included in his announcement, Biden argued the actions the U.S. had taken Thursday were more significant, but said it was an option that remained on the table, although allies hadn't agreed on making the move. ""It's always an option but right now that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,"" Biden told reporters Thursday during remarks in the East Room of the White House. Biden briefed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on the evolving situation in Ukraine during a phone call Thursday afternoon. McConnell described it as ""a briefing from the president for the four of us on the events of today and the way forward"" but declined to share further details. He noted that he urged the president, both publicly and privately, to ""ratchet up the sanctions."" A spokesman for Pelosi confirmed to ABC News that the call was ""classified"" in nature. Across the board, Republicans and Democrats in both chambers of Congress say the administration must act boldly and with more urgency to punish Putin and Russian oligarchs as the deadly attack in Ukraine unfolds. And while many Republicans have been critical of Biden's steps up to this point, the actual invasion attack has seen many joining with Democrats in calls to sideline partisan squabbling in the name of NATO unity. While agreeing to do so, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, couldn't resist seizing an ""I told you so"" moment. In a statement released just moments after news of Russia's advancement into Ukraine broke Wednesday evening. Romney harkened back to his 2012 presidential debate with President Barack Obama, who mocked Romney for citing Russia as the United States' ""number one geopolitical foe."" At the time, Obama quipped on stage that ""the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back."" Ten years later, Romney argued that Putin's prior aggression laid the groundwork for the current conflict he's waging in Ukraine. ""The '80s called' and we didn't answer,"" he said. Still, the statement ended on a unifying note, calling on America and its allies to ""protect freedom"" by working in tandem to impose harsh sanctions on Russia. Many GOP lawmakers are modeling Romney's tone, calling for unity despite disagreement with the administration. In a statement Thursday, following Biden's remarks, McConnell acknowledged Romney's consistent warnings about Ukraine, but like Romney, looked ahead. ""Moving forward, how America leads the response from all freedom-loving nations will be measured carefully by our friends, by our adversaries, and by history itself,"" McConnell said. ""We cannot afford to fail this test."" Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee also released a statement early Thursday going after Putin. Earlier in the week, they had been more critical of Biden. ""The last few hours have laid bare for the world to witness the true evil that is Vladimir Putin. Today, we stand resolute with the Ukrainian people and resolve to provide them with the tools they need to withstand and repel this unprovoked attack. Every drop of Ukrainian and Russian blood spilled in this conflict is on Putin's hands, and his alone,"" the Republican members said. GOP divided on attacking Biden But some Republicans are choosing a more divisive rhetoric, largely unseen in previous international conflicts. Among a newer breed of Republicans, many of whom have found themselves closely aligned with former President Donald Trump, criticism is extending beyond Putin and to Biden himself. The third-ranking House Republican, Rep. Elise Stefanik, slammed Biden in a statement Thursday. ""After just one year of a weak, feckless, and unfit President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief, the world is less safe. Rather than peace through strength, we are witnessing Joe Biden's foreign policy of war through weakness. For the past year, our adversaries around the world have been assessing and measuring Joe Biden's leadership on the world stage, and he has abysmally failed on every metric,"" Stefanik said. It was only later in her statement, Stefanik turned her ire to Putin, saying ""Vladimir Putin is a war criminal and deranged thug."" ""Joe Biden has shown nothing but weakness and indecision,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said in a tweet Wednesday night. ""Now is the time to show strong purpose."" GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene blamed the Russian invasion of Ukraine entirely on Biden himself, while giving kudos to his predecessor. ""Everything happening to the poor people of Ukraine is a direct result of a WEAK America under the WEAK leadership of Joe Biden. Under President Trump, America was STRONG and the world was at PEACE,"" Greene tweeted Thursday. Top Senate Democrat Schumer said that this sort of political rhetoric from Republicans attacking Biden at this moment in time, ""weakens the attempts we are making to be unified against Putin."" ""That is not the time for this rhetoric,"" Schumer said. ""Americans should be united as we were united at 9/11, as we have been united in the past."" House Republican Leader McCarthy released a statement Thursday going after Putin -- this time not choosing to level his attacks at the sitting U.S. president, which he often does. ""Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is reckless and evil. The United States stands with the people of Ukraine and prays for their safety and resolve. Putin's actions must be met with serious consequence. This act of war is intended to rewrite history and more concerning, upend the balance of power in Europe. Putin must be held accountable for his actions,"" McCarthy said in a statement. While Republicans have condemned Putin, one major player in the Republican Party has refused to do so -- the former president of the United States. He called Putin's actions ""genius"" during a radio interview Tuesday. ""I said, 'This is genius.' Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful. So Putin is now saying it's independent, a large section of Ukraine. I said, 'How smart is that?' And he's going to go in and be a peacekeeper,"" Trump said on the ""The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show."" At a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser Wednesday, he continued his praise of Putin, calling him ""pretty smart"" in ""taking over a country for $2 worth of sanctions."" How will Congress respond to Russia? Whether and how to further punish Russia and supply aid for Ukraine will be some of the first challenges Congress will have to attend to when it returns from its week-long recess on Monday. They say they are united in their resolve. ""Our Congress is united that we will reply to this with both standing firm by NATO continuing to provide armaments to the Ukrainians to defend itself,"" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said Thursday. ""We will launch the most unprecedented level of economic sanctions targeting oligarchs, people close to Putin, the banking system, the ability to get technology into the Russian defense industry."" But differences in policy will be laid bare when members return next week and it's not yet clear if Congress will act separately from the administration to impose additional sanctions. Negotiations on a bipartisan sanctions bill stalled last week, and Republicans, led by the Foreign Relations Committee top Republican Jim Risch, proposed a separate partisan bill they still hope will go forward. ""Diplomacy has failed. Those of us who called for more definitive action from the Biden Administration and our allies have unfortunately been proven right,"" Risch said Thursday. ""We cannot afford to wait any longer, we must take more decisive action.""",16
2022-02-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/reporters-notebook-moscow-protests-ukraine-attack/story?id=83093006,Reporter's notebook: Watching Russians protest the Ukraine invasion,"It takes a certain kind of bravery to protest in President Vladimir Putin's Russia, especially on the day he sends his country to war. I watched hundreds of people on a bitterly cold evening in Moscow on Thursday, as they marched against what the government here describes as a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. Over 1,200 have already been arrested in more than 50 towns and cities across the country for publicly opposing the attack. Most of them were young. Kids who, in another country, would have bright, happy futures. A group of them came up to speak to me after the protests. They were in their early 20s. Modern, cool, bright. They felt Putin's decision to invade, and the sanctions now invoked, would cripple their lives. It's crushing for them. In this job I'm constantly reminded of the accident of birth: it's only luck that separates us. It was inspiring to see their need to come out and protest, even in the face of great danger from aggressive riot police. Putin is used to certain groups finding his rule unacceptable. His is a Russia now defined by an almost total lack of real political opposition and a brutal response to any criticism. The vocal minority who oppose his rule are often easily dealt with. But this time he is walking a fine line. Ukraine is not some distant country about which his people know nothing. He may hate the idea of Ukraine as an independent nation, but Russians view them as their cousins. The shared history and culture that Putin gave as the reason for needing to carry out this offensive is the very reason why the messaging about this war is being so tightly controlled. Even those who support Putin feel a close bond with Ukraine, and he does not want to lose their trust. That's why there is no mention of an ""invasion"" on state media. No maps to show where troops are or reports about their progress and the bloody fight that is now ensuing. The Russian public is being told this is simply a ""special military operation,"" at the invitation of their separatist allies. They are not here to occupy. They will not kill civilians. And far from invaders, Russia is helping to stop a genocide against Russian speakers in Ukraine, they say. So the picture the Russian public is given is of a necessary, limited assault; a reluctant counterattack. But if it drags on and Russia gets bogged down in a protracted conflict that leaves many dead, Putin's media machine may not be enough to mask the truth from a people who share so much with their southern neighbors. It is probably a stretch to imagine public support for him would evaporate. But the image of a calculating, ultra-rational politician who only acts in his own best interests is being tested with this war. His other persona -- that of imperialist dictator keen to rebuild a Russian Empire -- is on full display.",7
2022-02-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainians-us-fear-loved-back-home-amid-russian/story?id=83085007,Ukrainians in US fear for loved ones back home amid Russian invasion,"For many Ukrainians living in the United States, the early hours of Thursday morning were spent reaching out to family members and watching news developments as Russia crossed the border into Ukraine and began the first attacks on the country. Oksana Sukhina, a Ukranian immigrant who came to the U.S. two years ago, told ABC News she learned the news of the invasion through a neighborhood watch group chat from back home. ""I saw messages that someone was asking, 'Oh, what's that booming?' and someone responding, 'Well, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin started the military operation,'"" Sukhina told ABC News. She couldn't fall asleep that night. Sukhina, who is a member of the non-profit U.S.-Ukraine Foundation, said that most of her family is back in Ukraine, and though she fears for the safety of her loved ones, she trusts in the Ukrainian army and in NATO forces. ""We hope that this insanity stops. It's a civilizational attack,"" Sukhina told ABC News. ""We're reading some disturbing messages about Russian troops being over on the ground."" She said her son, who is in the U.S., is even seeking out ways to get back to Ukraine to help. Alex Ponomarenko, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union region that is now Ukraine, told ABC News that as soon as he heard reports of the invasion, he began reaching out to loved ones. Because of past aggression from Russia, including the annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, many Ukrainians say they had the eerie feeling that something would soon erupt. ""No one was expecting this to happen, but it was always on the table,"" Ponomarenko told ABC News in an interview. ""My fear is the loss of life."" Tamara Olexy, executive director of the nonprofit Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, also told ABC News that the invasion isn't necessarily a surprise, but she still feels shaken by the attacks. ""It was a complete shock that in the 21st century, you can watch a war unfolding right before your eyes,"" Olexy said. Her family in Western Ukraine is safe, she said. At least 40 people have been killed so far in Russia's attack on Ukraine, Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Thursday. ""We're urging our governments to put in the harshest sanctions possible against Putin, and the Russian regime, and doing whatever we can to get the real truth out about what's going on in Ukraine,"" Olexy added. Many said they hope Ukraine's past of resilience and victory will pull the country through. ""Ukrainians are fighting back,"" Olexy said. ""Ukrainians aren't going to give up the land easily. This is going to be a very long-drawn-out war … Ukrainians have fought long and hard to gain their independence -- or regain their independence, I should say -- 30 years ago, and they're not going to give it up easily."" Sukhina added, ""[Ukraine] has prevailed so far, we will prevail further on."" Many Ukrainian descendants, immigrants and refugees said they are channeling their initial feelings of pain into action. They're set on figuring out how best to help their loved ones back home. The goal is to not only make sure they're safe now but also to financially and resourcefully support their continued safety.

2022-02-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-overhauling-covid-strategy-nation-moves-pandemic/story?id=83083431,White House overhauling COVID strategy as nation moves out of pandemic crisis,"Ahead of President Joe Biden’s planned State of the Union address on Tuesday, the White House has begun a sweeping overhaul of its COVID strategy that will signal the nation is moving past crisis mode and into a more manageable phase in the pandemic, ABC News has learned. The new strategy was expected to acknowledge that the virus -- which has killed at least 936,162 Americans in the past two years -- is less of an urgent threat to most Americans because of widespread access to vaccines, booster shots, and testing, as well as increasing availability of therapeutics. At the same time, the White House on Wednesday began working behind the scenes with some of the nation's most prominent pandemic experts to game out the various paths the virus could take to ensure the government is prepared. In a private online meeting, Jeff Zients, the White House coordinator on the federal COVID response, led the group in discussing potential trajectories in the pandemic -- from the best case scenario that the virus evolves into a mild flu-like illness, to the worst case that an aggressive new variant could evade effectiveness of the vaccine. The overall consensus was that COVID has fundamentally altered U.S. public health. ""There's no scenario where we say 'oh my gosh, let's go back to normal,'"" said one person involved in the effort. The White House described Wednesday's online meeting as part of a series of outreach efforts with governors and business leaders to discuss the pandemic. Included in Wednesday's discussion were several former advisers to Biden during his transition after the election, but who had more recently called on the administration to shift gears and tackle COVID as part of the nation's ""new normal."" Among those in attendance included Zients; David Kessler, Biden's chief scientific adviser; Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and medical ethicist with the University of Pennsylvania; Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Centers for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota; Dr. Luciana Borio, a former senior official at the National Security Council and former acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration now with the Council on Foreign Relations; and David Michaels, an epidemiologist and former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration now with George Washington University's School of Public Health. The meeting was confirmed by several people familiar with the effort, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on private White House meetings. Among the issues discussed were what resources the U.S. might need to ensure access to life-saving therapeutics and shoring up any vulnerabilities in the supply chain. ""We've seen things come down before only to be surprised,"" one person said, describing the meetings as helping the administration to prepare for next steps. Timing of the White House announcement of its updated COVID strategy was unclear as the Ukraine crisis escalated Thursday with Russia's invasion. Biden had been expected to address aspects of the new COVID approach in his State of the Union address on March 1. In a separate effort, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing new guidance intended to help local officials decide when it's safe to pull back on restrictions, such as indoor masking mandates. Those updated recommendations, expected within the week, were expected to emphasize local hospital capacity and focus less on case counts when measuring a community's ability to withstand increased COVID transmission. ""We must consider hospital capacity as an additional important barometer. Our hospitals need to be able to take care of people with heart attacks and strokes,"" Walensky told reporters last week. The shift comes as Biden and Democratic governors are under increasing pressure by voters fed up with restrictions due to the virus. Several states have moved preemptively to lift restrictions, even as the CDC continues to recommend indoor masking, particularly in schools. According to a recent Gallup poll, more Americans disapproved of Biden's handling of the virus -- 52% -- than those who approve. In recent weeks, Democratic strategists have advised party officials to shift their focus away from COVID and focus on curbing inflation instead. Zients hinted at the upcoming shift in federal COVID strategy at a press briefing last week. ""We're moving toward a time when COVID isn't a crisis but is something we can protect against and treat,"" Zients told reporters on Feb. 16. Biden officials say the administration is still keenly aware of the balancing act involved. COVID-related hospitalizations are now nearing the lowest level since before the omicron surge – a positive sign that the nation has turned a corner in the two-year pandemic. At the same time, concerns of another variant remain, as well as the lack of a vaccine available to children ages 4 and under. Data on a Pfizer pediatric vaccine for the population isn't expected until April. Meanwhile, hospitalization rates for that age group are at its highest throughout the pandemic. ""We definitely are heading into a new phase of the pandemic,"" said Julie Morita, executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who has previously advised Biden on COVID. But, ""I think we've fallen into the trap of thinking that it was over prematurely in the past, and it's just hurt us,"" she added.

Now, after Russian President Vladimir Putin's declaration of a ""special military operation,"" Biden has his chance to deliver on that promise. Biden is slated to lay out ""further consequences"" for Russia in remarks from the White House Thursday. Explosions could be heard in Kyiv overnight, a possible signifier of a broader attack. The president issued a sobering statement in response, calling the attack ""unprovoked and unjustified."" ""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable,"" Biden said in a statement. The Biden administration had begun to roll out a ""first tranche"" sanctions, related to Russian banks, oligarchs and the natural gas pipeline Nord Stream 2. Some GOP lawmakers have criticized Biden of not going far enough on sanctions, which haven't resulted in Russia reversing course. But even as tensions escalate and Ukraine braces for a full-scale attack, the White House reiterated Biden's pledge not to send U.S. troops into Ukraine. ""We are not going to be in a war with Russia or putting military troops on the ground in Ukraine fighting Russia,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema The uncertainty of this year's election calendar following redistricting is coming to a close as two political battlegrounds gain a clearer picture of their new maps. In Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court settled on a congressional map in a 4-3 ruling following a monthslong redistricting saga. The map chosen by the court was submitted by a group of citizens and was drawn by Stanford University professor Jonathan Rodden. The new map reflects the outcome of the 2020 Census, in which Pennsylvania lost a congressional seat. Although the court did not move the May 17 primary date, it did delay the timeline for when candidates needed to gather and file documentation to get on the ballot by a few weeks. As reported by FiveThirtyEight, the state now has eight Republican-leaning seats, six Democratic-leaning seats and three highly competitive seats. The 17th District, which is currently represented by Rep. Conor Lamb, who is running for Senate, is one of those highly competitive areas. Meanwhile, in North Carolina, political tensions over redistricting continued on Wednesday, as a three-judge panel rejected a GOP-backed congressional map and instituted remedial maps in its place. Overnight, the state Supreme Court denied appeals from Republican lawmakers to delay the use of the maps issued by the trial panel. The TIP with Brittany Shepherd It's conservatives' time to shine in the Sunshine State with the kickoff of the Conservative Political Action Conference later Thursday morning. Republican ideology is getting its first primary of sorts as moderate to far-right GOP members (and even some Democrats) flock to Orlando and plot their way toward victory for the upcoming midterm election, where they anticipate fruitful returns. Former President Donald Trump, his son Don. Jr, party allies Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz and Sen. Marco Rubio are among those receiving top billing for this dayslong celebration in Trump's new home state. Rumored GOP 2024 contenders Govs. Ron DeSantis and Kristi Noem will be in attendance. Noticeably absent is former Vice President Mike Pence, whose relationship with his former ticket-mate continues to publicly fracture. In a speech in Orlando a few weeks ago, Pence said Trump was ""wrong"" for suggesting he had any power in overturning election results. It's unclear if any of the Republicans present will echo Pence's message or instead dig further into false claims. This year's CPAC is slated to have several conversations around culture-war issues that light up Republican voting bases. The event has such panels as ""School Board for Dummies,"" ""War Through Weakness, Elections Matter,"" ""They Can't Shut Us Up!,"" ""The Government is Dangerous to Your Health,"" ""Sorry Stacey, you are not the Governor"" and ""Fire Fauci.""

2022-02-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/russia-ukraine-conflict-impacts-sports-entertainment/story?id=83116339,"Russia-Ukraine conflict impacts sports, entertainment","The effects of the Russian attack on Ukraine are rippling out to the sports and entertainment world, where figures have spoken out and events have been changed this week. Alex Ovechkin, one of the highest-profile Russians in sports, who has been a supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and whose family is located in Russia, has been facing calls from hockey fans to address the violence as he leads the Washington Capitals. In a press session Friday, he called for ""no more war"" but stopped short of commenting on Putin. ""It doesn’t matter who is in the war -- Russia, Ukraine, different countries, I think we live in a world, like, we have to live in peace and a great world,"" he said, according to The Washington Post. When asked about Putin, Ovechkin acknowledged him as ""my president"" and added: ""I am not in politics. I am an athlete, and you know, how I said, I hope everything is going to be done soon. It’s hard situation right now for both sides and everything, like how I said, everything I hope is going to be end. I’m not in control of this situation."" Meanwhile, on Friday, Russian tennis player Andrey Rublev took an opportunity to call for peace. After winning a semifinal match at the Dubai Championships, when given a marker to write on a TV camera -- a new custom in tennis for match winners -- he wrote, ""No War Please."" Sacramento Kings center Alex Len and Toronto Raptors forward Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk, the only two Ukrainians in the NBA, released a joint statement Thursday, writing in part, ""A great tragedy befell our dear homeland Ukraine. We categorically condemn the war. Ukraine is a peaceful sovereign state inhabited by people who want to decide their own destiny."" Meanwhile, Pavlo Dziuba, a Ukrainian college basketball player at Maryland, wrote ""NO WAR PEACE"" and ""PRAY FOR UKRAINE"" on his shoes in the team's game against Indiana Thursday night. Elsewhere, Russian figures in the arts are facing fallout. The conductor Valery Gergiev, who is Russian and a supporter of Putin, was replaced in a series of Vienna Philharmonic concerts taking place at New York City's Carnegie Hall this week. No reason was given for the conductor replacement, The New York Times reported. Russian pianist Denis Matsuev, who was scheduled to perform in those shows, was also replaced. Yannick Nézet-Séguin will instead conduct the shows. Gergiev faces continued pushback, with the mayor of Munich calling on him to distance himself from the invasion or lose his position with the city's philharmonic while the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra made a similar statement. ""In the event that Valéry Gergiev does not openly distance himself from President Putin's actions in Ukraine, we will be forced to cancel all concerts conducted by Valéry Gergiev including the Gergiev Festival that would take place in September,"" the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra statement says. Several big events have also been moved out of Russia. In soccer, the UEFA Champions League final, which is supposed to take place in late May, was relocated from St. Petersburg, Russia, to Saint-Denis, France, after the organization's executive committee ""held an extraordinary meeting following the grave escalation of the security situation in Europe"" on Friday. ""The UEFA Executive Committee also decided that Russian and Ukrainian clubs and national teams competing in UEFA competitions will be required to play their home matches at neutral venues until further notice,"" a statement from the UEFA said. Also on Friday, Formula One, the racing organization, canceled its Russian Grand Prix while ""watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to the present situation."" Finally, the International Olympic Committee, after condemning Russia's breach of the Olympic Truce -- a U.N. resolution adopted in December 2021 that was supposed to be in effect until seven days after the close of the 2022 Paralympic Games, which begin next week -- called on all International Sports Federations ""to relocate or cancel their sports events currently planned in Russia or Belarus."" ""The IOC EB expresses its deep concerns about the safety of the members of the Olympic Community in Ukraine and stands in full solidarity,"" their Friday statement reads. ""It notes that the special IOC task force is in contact with the Olympic Community in the country to coordinate humanitarian assistance where possible.""",17
2022-02-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/negative-views-russia-cold-war-levels-amid-ukraine/story?id=83108605,Negative views of Russia near Cold War levels amid Ukraine crisis: POLL,"Negative views of Russia have advanced to levels last seen during the Cold War and Americans broadly support sanctions in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine -- although support subsides to half if those sanctions raise energy prices in the United States. President Joe Biden, for his part, gets more negative than positive ratings in this ABC News/Washington Post poll of his handling of the situation: Thirty-three percent approve while 47% disapprove, with the rest unsure. See PDF for full results, charts and tables. More broadly, nearly half, 48%, say U.S. leadership in the world has weakened under Biden’s presidency, twice as many as say it’s grown stronger. And he’s underwater in trust to handle a crisis, 43-52%, a tenuous position given the week’s events. Sixty-seven percent support the United States and its European allies imposing economic sanctions on Russia, with 20% opposed and the rest unsure. If sanctions produced higher energy prices, however -- as Biden has warned -- support declines to 51%, with 33% opposed. That reflects economic discontent, with inflation at its highest in nearly 40 years. This poll was fielded Sunday through Thursday night, including the periods in which Russia was menacing Ukraine and then, on Thursday, invaded. Attitudes may evolve as the crisis unfolds. Most striking are views of Russia: Eighty percent see it as unfriendly or an enemy of the United States -- the most since 1983 (measured then as the Soviet Union), although it was similar, 77%, a few months after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. The current result includes 41% who now see Russia as an enemy of the United States, up from single digits in the early 2000s and early 1990's alike. Just 12% call Russia friendly toward (or an ally of) the United States in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates. That’s down from 62% in 2002 (a period of post-9/11 solidarity) and a high of 66% in 1993, two years after the fall of the Soviet Union. Partisanship largely falls away in views of Russia -- large majorities of Democrats (86%), independents (81%) and Republicans (78%) call it either unfriendly or an enemy of the United States. So do 80 to 88% of political liberals, moderates and conservatives alike, an unusual level of agreement in these typically divided groups. There’s a somewhat larger political gap on sanctions, which Biden initiated Tuesday, then increased Thursday -- 79% of Democrats support them, declining to 63% of independents and 62% of Republicans. Support for sanctions if they bring higher energy prices, for its part, is 15 percentage points lower among people already experiencing economic hardship because of inflation, compared with those not experiencing hardship. On Biden personally, views revert to typical sharp partisanship, with independents -- usually the fulcrum in national politics -- siding negatively. Sixty-six percent of Democrats approve of Biden’s handling of the situation, dropping to 30% of independents and 8% of Republicans. Instead, 75% of Republicans and 54% of independents disapprove, compared with 13% of Democrats; the rest in each case are undecided. Divisions are similar on trust in Biden to handle a crisis and on America’s world leadership. On the latter, 82% of Republicans say the country’s leadership in the world has gotten weaker under Biden, as do 53% of independents, compared with 11% of Democrats. When the same question was asked in 2017 and 2018 about U.S. leadership under President Donald Trump, these divisions were essentially reversed. Overall, though, at Trump’s best, 30% said U.S. leadership had grown stronger, more than the 23% who say that of Biden today. This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Feb. 20-24, 2022, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,011 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 4.0 percentage points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 27-26-40 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents. The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling and data collection by Abt Associates of Rockville, Md.

2022-02-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-order-personal-sanctions-putin-russian-forces-close/story?id=83111481,Biden to order personal sanctions on Putin as Russian forces close in on Kyiv,"Amid pressure at home and abroad, the White House announced Friday that the U.S. will personally sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, following in the footsteps of a European Union move to freeze their assets, as the West puts on a united front in the face of Russian aggression. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at an afternoon press briefing that President Joe Biden would join European allies, including the United Kingdom, in ordering direct sanctions on ""President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov and members of the national security team"" and said to expect more details later in the day. Earlier Friday, Biden called a desperate but defiant President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Russian forces closed in on Ukraine's capital Kyiv and after he publicly pleaded with U.S. and European nations to do more to help, including imposing more sanctions. Zelenskyy also called on Putin to negotiate, but Putin showed no interest in a diplomatic solution. He appeared, instead, to call for a coup in Ukraine in a statement Friday, calling on Ukraine's military to turn on Zelenskyy, who was elected democratically, and terming his government a ""gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people."" In an address to his people Friday morning, Zelenskyy called on Putin ""to sit at the table for negotiations to stop people dying,"" but did not order Ukrainian troops to stop fighting, telling them to ""stand tough. You're everything we have, you're everything that is defending us."" Lavrov said Friday that Russia will begin negotiations again once the ""democratic order is restored"" in Ukraine, suggesting that only once it has forced Ukraine's government to surrender and conceded to demands, will it negotiate, with the Kremlin claiming Zelenskyy wants to discuss Ukraine's ""neutrality."" Russia had demanded Ukraine agree to never join NATO before Putin invaded, which Zelenskyy would not agree to, though Zelenskyy wasn't seemingly close called to NATO membership, at one point calling it a ""dream"" for Ukraine. On Russia's demand that Ukraine be barred from joining NATO, White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said repeatedly that ""that is a decision for NATO to make."" State Department spokesman Ned Price on Friday dismissed Russian talk of negotiations. ""Now, we see Moscow suggesting that diplomacy take place at the barrel of a gun, or as Moscow's rockets, mortars, artillery, target the Ukrainian people. This is not real diplomacy. Those are not the conditions for real diplomacy,"" he said. ""If President Putin is serious about diplomacy, he knows what he can do. He should immediately stop the bombing campaign against civilians, order the withdrawal of his forces from Ukraine, and indicate very clearly -- unambiguously to the world, that Moscow is prepared to de-escalate. We have not seen that yet."" As Russian troops got ever closer to the capital, the Ukrainian president reportedly told European leaders in a call Thursday night, ""This may be the last time you see me alive."" ""We have information the enemy as defined me as number one target and my family as a number two target,"" he said in a video address to the nation Friday. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state."" ""I will stay in the capital,"" Zelenskyy added. ""My family is also in Ukraine."" Even as Zelenskyy pleaded with Western allies to do more to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's attack, now in its second day, Biden has emphasized that sanctions on Russia will take time to have an impact, but he faced continuing questions as to why not sanction the Russian leader now. Thousands of Ukrainians forced to flee their homes appear to be running out of time as Russian forces advance on the capital city Kyiv, and U.S. officials express concerns that Kyiv could fall to Russia within days. Zelenskyy had urged allies including the U.S. to enact sanctions before Russia invaded, lamenting last week that the ""system is slow and failing us time and again, because of arrogance and irresponsibility of countries on a global level"" -- but that, largely, did not happen. The Biden administration, at first, said that its sanctions were meant to deter war, and once triggered, the deterrent effect would be lost -- but under questioning from ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega Thursday, who noted that ""sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point,"" Biden replied, ""No one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening."" However, Vice President Kamala Harris said on CBS Sunday that ""the purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence,"" echoing language from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and several other administration officials over several weeks -- in sharp contrast to Biden's claim. The White House official in charge of crafting the sanctions against Russia, Daleep Singh, playing a kind of clean-up Thursday evening, said that the sanctions were never meant to deter war and laid out multiple reasons why the administration didn't move preemptively. ""Had we unleashed our entire package of financial sanctions preemptively,"" he said, ""President Putin might have said, 'Look, these people are not serious about diplomacy, they're not engaging in a good faith effort to promote peace. Instead, they're escalating.' And that could provide a justification for him to escalate and invade."" ""Secondly, he could look at it as a sum cost. In other words, President Putin could think I've already paid the price, why don't I take what I paid for, which is Ukraine's freedom. So that's what we wanted to avoid,"" Singh added. But even Democratic lawmakers are calling on Biden to do more to sanction Russia. ""There is more that we can and should do,"" said Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Congress and the Biden administration must not shy away from any options—including sanctioning the Russian Central Bank, removing Russian banks from the SWIFT [international banking] system, crippling Russia's key industries, sanctioning Putin personally, and taking all steps to deprive Putin and his inner circle of their assets."" Even with Biden set to sanction Putin on Friday, there are still major questions about what more the U.S. and Europe can do to not only punish Russia and Putin, but whether any of the sanctions can change his calculus -- or make him retreat from the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

2022-02-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/shields-cyberattack-affect-americans-prepare/story?id=83085211,Shields up: How a possible cyberattack could affect Americans and how to prepare,"As Russia's military continues to strike Ukrainian cities, national security officials are keeping eyes on a different battlefield. Senior U.S. law enforcement and Homeland Security officials have told ABC News that there is growing concern that Russia could launch further cyberattacks against the West. The potential targets include electrical grids, banking systems and mobile networks, according to the officials. Currently, there is no cyber threat to the U.S. homeland, according to the Department of Homeland security. Cybersecurity experts tell ABC News that people shouldn't panic over a potential cyberattack, but they should start preparing for one. ""Freaking out is not a productive thing to do. There are lots of reasons to think that the fact that something is out there but that doesn't mean it could happen,"" Stuart Madnick, the founding director of Cybersecurity at MIT Sloan, told ABC News. ""But there are still a number of things that people can do to stay safe and protected."" Madnick, whose group has consulted with U.S. agencies and private companies such as Nasdaq, said the world is in uncharted territory when it comes to cyber security since this involves alleged cyberattacks by a major superpower. However, what has transpired so far is similar to previous cyber security incidents, he said. There are two types of cyberattacks, he said: ones that have an indirect impact on people's livelihood and attacks targeting the tech of specific people. The biggest indirect hacking examples in the past have targeted key infrastructure points such as the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May 2021, which affected everything from gas prices to flights. ""In the last two years, we've been seeing more of these attacks around the world,"" Madnick said. ""You need to realize how many of our systems are connected to computers and just one hack can have bigger effects."" U.S. and international officials have accused the Russian government of committing cyber attacks that targeted Ukraine's banks in recent weeks. On Friday, Ukrainian officials warned of a phishing scheme emanating from Belarus, which pretended to be a member of the Ukrainian cybersecurity agency. Javed Ali, the former senior director of counterterrorism at the National Security Council, told ABC News that the attacks could escalate to affect utilities, such as gas and electricity. ""Those will be escalatory steps from Russia and that will also likely be integrated with physical military operations all designed to bring cascading effects against Ukraine,"" he said. Madnick warned that cyberattacks on the Ukrainian computer systems could potentially spill over to other regions depending on how close computer networks work. However, he noted, that U.S. officials are paying close attention to online activity. Ali said it's hard to predict if Russia would take such an action on the West since it would mean an immediate retaliation from countries with their own state-of-the-art tools and tactics. ""The thresholds for those operations being launched, the effects, [and] the duration those are all things would have to be thought through very carefully,"" Ali said. ""But U.S. Cyber Command is the lead for military operations from the United States, has a world-class capability."" The Department of Homeland Security, the agency tasked with the domestic response to the invasion in Ukraine, has set up a page on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s website specifically warning of cyber-attacks emanating from Russia. Earlier this week, the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency sent an advisory to businesses and organizations urging them to enact a ""shields up"" guidance. ""While there are not currently any specific credible threats to the U.S. homeland, we are mindful of the potential for the Russian government to consider escalating its destabilizing actions in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine,"" the agency said in its letter. The federal government has called on businesses to make sure their information technology teams update their computer software to close any vulnerabilities and train their employees to watch out for any malware. Madnick said the preparedness of such attacks varies by sector and their experience as cyberattack victims. ""Organizations like banks that have been targeted for a long time have done a better job in shoring up their cybersecurity,"" he said. ""Others, like hospitals and smaller municipalities that haven’t been attacked in the past tend not to do well."" Madnick said when it comes to individual Americans, there is very little they could do to prevent an indirect attack on the country's infrastructure systems, but they should always prepare for the possibility. He likened it to preparing for a big storm and suggested that individuals who are concerned about their money should always have cash available for emergencies. Madnick also urged people to back up their important computer files, including bank statements, important e-mails and other documents frequently and to offline sources such as an external drive. ""Everyone should be doing this regardless of increasing cyber threats,"" he said. Madnick said cyber attackers linked to foreign agencies wouldn't likely conduct attacks that target individual Americans, but people should still be mindful of the vulnerabilities in their tech. Having updated anti-virus and malware software, staying on top of computer updates and avoiding any suspicious links and e-mails, go a long way he said. ""Cyberattacks and cyber security are not something we talk about a lot, but we need to,"" he said. ""This is not a brand new issue."" ABC News' Pierre Thomas contributed to this report.",12
2022-02-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/pope-makes-surprise-visit-russian-embassy-vatican/story?id=83115722,Pope makes surprise visit to Russian Embassy to the Vatican,"The Vatican press office confirmed that Pope Francis made a visit to the Russian Embassy to the Holy See to express his concern about the fighting in Ukraine on Friday morning. The Russian Embassy to the Holy See is a short distance outside of Vatican City situated on the road leading into St. Peter's Square, and this was seen by most as a strong personal papal initiative. Aside from saying the visit lasted just over an hour, the Vatican provided no further information nor distributed any video or photographs. The pope was seen leaving the embassy building seated in the front seat of a small, white car. Ambassador Aleksandr Avdeyev, the Russian diplomat at the embassy, told Russian media that ""the pope personally wanted to ask about the situation in Donbas and Ukraine"" and expressed his great concern about the humanitarian situation and conditions of the population. He reportedly urged for the care of children, the sick and the people who were suffering. The pope's surprise and unprecedented visit to the embassy took many Vatican watchers by surprise, as it is normal protocol for ambassadors to come to the Vatican to meet with the pope. However, Pope Francis has in the past dropped in to see people in Vatican offices outside the walls of the tiny state when he has urgent matters he wishes to discuss. On Thursday, Cardinal Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, said in a video statement released after the start of Russian military operations in Ukraine that although the tragic scenarios everyone feared were becoming reality ""there is still time for goodwill, there is still room for negotiation."" He said he hoped those who hold the destiny of the world in their hands would have a ""glimmer of conscience."" Commentators have noted that the pope and the Vatican have been careful about publicly criticizing and naming Russia, some say, so as not to antagonize the Russian Orthodox Church. On Wednesday at the end of his general audience in the Vatican, Pope Francis called on believers and nonbelievers to pray and fast for peace in Ukraine on Ash Wednesday to combat the ""diabolical insistence, the diabolical senselessness of violence,"" saying that ""once again the peace of all is threatened by partisan interests."" He appealed to those with political responsibilities to do a serious examination of conscience before God and urged world leaders to ""refrain from any action that would cause even more suffering to the people, destabilizing the coexistence between nations and discrediting international law."" Earlier Friday, the Vatican press office announced the pope would not make his scheduled one-day trip to Florence Sunday and would have to skip the Ash Wednesday ceremony in the Vatican at the start of Lent due to a flare up of knee pain.

""It's our assessment that they have every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance, which would explain these early moves toward Kyiv,"" a senior defense official told ABC News. Putin's persistence in the face of sanctions not only from the U.S., but also from a host of nations begs the question: What could stop him? In response to that question from ABC Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega, Biden insisted sanctions would take ""time"" to have an effect. ""No one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. It has to -- it's going to take time, and we have to show resolve. So he knows what is coming. And so the people of Russia know what he's brought on them,"" Biden replied. Ukraine has already paid and will continue to pay heavy price in the form of casualties. Officials report nearly 140 killed and more than 300 injured. At the same time, the economic impact of this invasion has been felt far beyond the Eastern European nation. The invasion roiled financial markets and hiked up fuel prices. Biden pledged Thursday to address rising energy costs with the help of other nations. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema With just a few days left until February ends, it remains unclear when Biden will announce his pick for the Supreme Court, which the White House previously said would be made public by the end of the month. But sources tell ABC News' Devin Dwyer and Rachel Scott the president has reached a decision about who he intends to nominate. The White House previously said the announcement would be made before the president's State of the Union address on March 1. However, a format or time of day have yet to be decided. The optics of the announcement remain delicate given the ongoing situation in Ukraine. The shifting national focus to rapidly evolving global tensions risks overshadowing the president's groundbreaking appointment and makes timing tough to predict. So far, the White House has only publicly confirmed U.S. District Court Judge J. Michelle Childs as being under formal consideration. Childs is endorsed by House Majority Whip James Clyburn. As previously reported by ABC News, Federal Appeals Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger are also under consideration, according to sources. When asked at Thursday's press briefing if Biden has made a final decision, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said no offer had been made yet. ""Not a final, final. No offer, no job offer has been made,"" she told reporters. The TIP with Brittany Shepherd A gnarly political battle awaits the Republican party. At least, that's what Conservative Political Action Conference speakers wanted their audience to believe on the first day of the conference themed ""Awake, Not Woke."" On Thursday, GOP speakers put ""critical race theory"" -- a curriculum that teaches students about the realities of race in America -- in the center of its crosshairs. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said Democrats are ""radical"" when it comes to CRT and urged the audience to be proud and ""stand up"" for America's history. ""We're not a nation of oppressors. We're a nation of liberators,"" Hawley said. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Democrats want to teach critical race theory ""because they want to divide the country."" Yet, the war against the left doesn't stop at critical race theory. In his remarks, DeSantis said ""wokeism"" is Democrats' new religion, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said it's necessary to fight in the trenches against the ""woke mob,"" Cruz offered one battle strategy to CPAC attendees: ""Don't ever apologize to the woke mob. It doesn't work ... They want to destroy you. They want to silence you. They want to subjugate you. Respond with joy. Laugh at them."" What remains to be seen is if other Republican stars -- including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who both speak Friday -- will also embrace the militaristic messaging or opt for the less dire attack lines of CPAC's past. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 57. That's the percentage of Americans who told the Economist/YouGov this week that imposing economic sanctions on Russia was a good idea. As FiveThirtyEight's Geoffrey Skelley wrote Thursday, most Americans back economic sanctions on Russia, but they remain reluctant when it comes to deploying U.S. troops to the region. But that, of course, might change depending on how the situation evolves in Ukraine. We'll be tracking that and more at FiveThirtyEight. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-02-26,https://abcnews.go.com/International/seizure-chernobyl-russian-troops-sparks-health-concerns-people/story?id=83094054,Seizure of Chernobyl by Russian troops sparks health concerns for people near the nuclear plant,"As Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine, concerns are growing now that the conflict has reached Chernobyl. This week, Russian forces seized control of the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster. The disaster occurred after a reactor exploded and expelled massive amounts of radiation into the air and soil. The surrounding areas after the explosion were evacuated, but radiation continued to spread far and wide. In the three decades since, there has been a reported rise in thyroid cancers, radiation-associated cataracts and other effects from radiation poisoning. Now with activity occurring in the exclusion zone -- the 1,000-square-mile barren area around the plant which includes the nearby ghost town of Pripyat -- there are fears not of a potential second Chernobyl disaster but of radioactive material spreading from fighting in the area. The United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Friday radiation measurements were slightly elevated, possibly because of tank movement on radiates soil. But the agency said levels remain low and within the exclusion zone's normal operational range -- making clear they don't pose any danger to the public. But nuclear experts and Ukrainian government officials have expressed concern about potential health hazards from radioactive material spreading amid the fighting. ""Conventional war and nuclear power are not a good combination,"" Dr. Kate Brown, a professor of science, technology and society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has been studying Chernobyl for more than 15 years, told ABC News. ""Nuclear power requires security, stability and peace. It's a tall order."" If any military activity sparks a fire, it could release radioactivity from the wooded areas of the exclusion zone, which could then spread, she said. ""There's been hotter, drier weather with climate change in Ukraine and elsewhere,"" said Brown. ""From 2017 to 2020, they've had pretty serious forest fires in the contaminated areas, and they've released a great deal of radioactivity that's stored in the leaf litter, in pine needles, in the wood itself and, when those burn, they volatilize and become ash and smoke and can travel long distances."" If there is a fire, it could be difficult for firefighters or other emergency personnel to reach the area because they'll be busy treating civilian casualties, which could prolong the fire and release more contaminated material into the air, she said. Additionally, there is radioactive material that has been lodged underneath the soil in the contaminated zone for several years, Brown said. Soldiers walking through or tanks driving through the area could also kick it up to the atmosphere and cause it to spread, experts say. ""War is a dirty endeavor,"" Dr. Ron Chesser, Professor Emeritus at Texas Tech University who has studied Chernobyl for more than 20 years, told ABC News. ""It's going to throw up a lot of dust and dirt, and driving tanks and digging defenses and so forth is going to disturb the soil and release radiation and radioactive materials that would make it available for ingestion and in inhalation and potentially have some long-term negative impacts."" There are also concerns about whether the Russians soldiers are properly protecting themselves at the plant like workers would, Dr. Lydia Zablotska, a professor in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, said. ""I don't know whether Russian soldiers know anything about radiation, whether they have protective equipment, or whether they have a radiation deposition map of the area,"" Zablotska told ABC News."" It is complete madness for them to go there."" Zablotska, a radiation expert, said she is also worried that military activities could disrupt the sarcophagus, the steel and concrete structure that covers the reactor that caused the 1986 disaster. A hole being poked in the sarcophagus could cause radioactive contamination to leak into the environment, she said. ""It is necessary to keep the area around the sarcophagus and the area for radioactive waste storage safe and secure,"" Zablotska said. ""No one should be allowed in the exclusion zone unless they are permitted to be there."" But some experts say they don't believe that Russia is trying to take possession of the nuclear inventory in Chernobyl and they are not worried about the plant being used as a nuclear weapon. Chesser, the first American scientist given full access to the Chernobyl exclusion zone in 1992, says he believes the Russians' motives are two-fold. ""One is that they don't want that material to be used in some kind of offensive way against their troops in a dirty bomb,"" he said. A ""dirty bomb"" is defined by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a weapon that combined a ""conventional explosive, such as dynamite, with radioactive material."" Ukraine has denied that it intends to develop a dirty bomb. In a tweet Saturday, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said this was a false claim from Russia used to justify war. ""Russian propaganda has gone off the rails and speculates Ukraine might be preparing to drop a 'dirty bomb' on the Russian territory,"" he wrote. ""This is a sick fake. Ukraine doesn't have nuclear weapons, doesn't conduct any work to create/acquire them. We are a responsible member of the [Non-Proliferation Treaty]."" Chesser thinks another other reason Russians seized control of Chernobyl could be because of how symbolic it is to both Russians and Ukrainians. ""It's highly symbolic in that taking over the Chernobyl site is going to be a major news item even though that strategically it really has very little value for the Russian government,"" he said.",10
2022-02-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-tom-cotton-condemn-trumps-praise-putin/story?id=83130202,GOP Sen. Tom Cotton won't condemn Trump's praise of Putin,"Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has refused to condemn former President Donald Trump's praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin amid his invasion of Ukraine. ""George, if you want to know what Donald Trump thinks about Vladimir Putin or any other topic, I'd encourage you to invite him on your show,"" Cotton told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. ""I don't speak on behalf of other politicians. They can speak for themselves."" Trump called the actions of the Russian president ""genius"" and ""savvy"" during an interview with the conservative radio program ""The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show"" on Tuesday. And on Saturday night at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump finally condemned the invasion but also said, ""The problem is not that Putin is smart, which of course he’s smart. But the real problem is that our leaders are dumb."" Stephanopoulos pressed Cotton, who he noted has been steadfast in his opposition to Putin, to condemn the comments. ""You're a senior member of the Republican Party. Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party,"" he said, noting that Trump ""suggested"" Saturday night he would run for president again. ""When Fox News asked him if he had a message for Vladimir Putin, he said he has no message."" ""Why can't you condemn that? I feel quite confident that if Donald -- that if Barack Obama or Joe Biden said something like that, you'd be first in line to criticize them,"" Stephanopoulos said. Cotton, who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, doubled down. ""Again, George, if you want to talk to the former president about his views or his message, you can have him on your show,"" Cotton said. ""My message to Vladimir Putin is quite clear: He needs to leave Ukraine unless he wants to face moms and teenagers with Molotov cocktails and grandmothers and grandfathers with AK-47s for years to come."" Stephanopoulos followed up again. ""I simply don't understand why you can't condemn his praise of Vladimir Putin,"" he said. ""George, again, I don't speak on behalf of other politicians, they can all speak for themselves,"" Cotton responded, ​again dodging Stephanopoulos' question. ""I'm delivering my message to you, which I said has been clear, whether Barack Obama was president, whether Donald Trump was president, and now whether Joe Biden was president, that Vladimir Putin has been a ruthless dictator for years. Too many people have not taken the threat seriously. And that's why you see the images we see in Ukraine now. And where we need to focus is on stopping that aggression, supporting the Ukrainians as best we can."" In an earlier interview on ""This Week,"" Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., pleaded for American businesses to stop backing Russian-owned enterprises both at home and abroad. Cotton agreed with the ambassador, encouraging ""every American company to scrub all of their operations to provide no support whatsoever to Vladimir Putin's regime"" while Russia continues carrying out an ""unprovoked war of aggression."" ""But we can do more than prayers and hashtags and lighting up buildings, George. It's time for the president and some of our European partners to quit pussyfooting around,"" Cotton later added. ""The financial sanctions announced last night are riddled with loopholes."" The United States and other Western nations announced Saturday they would significantly escalate restrictions against Russia's financial system. Sanctions against major Russian banks, members of the Russian elite and Putin had already been imposed by the United States and its allies. The U.S. and other nations have also stepped up military aid to Ukraine. The countries, however, have yet to launch crippling sanctions against Russia's oil and gas industry, which Cotton has been advocating for. Russia provides more than a third of Europe's natural gas. Putin announced Sunday he had ordered his military to put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces in a state of heightened readiness in response to what he called ""aggressive statements"" from NATO countries. ""It's time to remove all Russian financial institutions from the international payment system. It's time to impose sanctions on his oil and gas exports which he uses as his primary means of financial support,"" Cotton said. ""We need to rush those weapons that were announced for delivery yesterday to the front: anti-tank, anti-aircraft missiles, sniper rifles ammunition, fuel supplies, it should have been done weeks ago so better later than never but the Ukrainians have no time.""

2022-02-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/economic-concerns-hurt-bidens-approval-democrats-peril-ahead/story?id=83128327,"Economic concerns hurt Biden’s approval, keep Democrats in peril ahead of midterms: POLL","Economic discontent is hurting President Joe Biden and his party's midterm election prospects, with six in 10 Americans reporting inflation hardships, three-quarters saying the economy’s in bad shape and a nearly 20-point lead for the Republican Party in trust to handle it. Biden has other problems, with underwater ratings for his handling of the invasion of Ukraine, a split on the pandemic and weak scores on personal attributes including leadership, handling a crisis and mental sharpness. But 40-year-high inflation leads his headaches: Americans are twice as likely to say they’re worse off than better off under his presidency, by 35-17% See PDF for full results, charts and tables. The result: A career-low 37% of Americans approve of Biden’s job performance overall, with 55% disapproving. That includes just 30% approval among political independents and 10% from Republicans. Even in his own party, nearly a quarter of Democrats either disapprove of Biden (19%) or are withholding judgment (4%). Analyzing data going back to Harry Truman's administration, only two presidents have had approval ratings this low heading into their first State of the Union address, which Biden delivers Tuesday. Those two were Donald Trump, at 36%, and Gerald Ford, at 37%. Disapproval has been higher, by a nonsignificant 3 percentage points, only for Trump. (More were undecided about Ford, then just five months in office.) Biden’s fortunes in turn spell trouble for his party in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates. Republican congressional candidates have a 49-42% advantage over Democrats among registered voters, widening to 54-41% among those who say they both are registered and certain to vote in November. The result among registered voters is very similar to what it was in November, 51-41% -- as reported at the time, the largest Republican lead in midterm election vote preferences in ABC/Post polls dating back 40 years. In the new data, among independents who are registered to vote -- often swing voters -- GOP candidates lead by 14 points. These results are buttressed by a shift in partisan self-identification. In four ABC/Post polls from January through September last year, Democrats outnumbered Republicans by an average of 7 points. In November and again in this poll, by contrast, it’s a nonsignificant 1 point. In line with vote preferences, Americans by 50-40% say they’d rather see the next Congress controlled by the Republicans, to act as a check on Biden, than by the Democrats, to support Biden’s agenda. The Democrats led by 16 points on this measure going into Trump’s midterm in 2018, when they won 40 seats. It looks more now like it did under Barack Obama in 2014 and 2010, when the Republicans won 13 and 63 seats, respectively. Seventy-five percent of Americans rate the economy’s condition as not so good or poor, the most in ABC/Post polls since 2013. The public by a 3-1 margin says it’s gotten worse rather than better since Biden took office, 54-17% (with the rest saying it’s stayed the same). That “gotten worse” number is more than double what it was when measured during Trump’s presidency in 2019 (22%) and 11 points higher than under Obama in 2012. Personal impacts are apparent as well. As noted, just 17% report being better off financially now than when Biden took office; twice as many, 35%, are worse off. A negative score on this measure has reliably indicated political trouble since Ronald Reagan popularized the concept in his successful 1980 presidential campaign. Among other notable instances, it was negative for George H.W. Bush on his way to losing re-election in 1992, and damaging to Obama early in his presidency as the country struggled out of the Great Recession. To be sure, there’s a political aspect to economic attitudes, particularly when the president is mentioned by name. Fifty-four percent of Republicans say they’ve gotten worse off under Biden; only 9% of Democrats go there. But it’s 42% among independents, and among Democrats, just 33% say they’re better off. Even with the comparatively robust job market, inflation is a singular irritant. Fifty-nine percent say it’s caused hardship for their household; 30% of those call it a serious hardship, rising to 43% of those with annual household incomes less than $50,000, a group that encompasses four in 10 adults. Tellingly, Biden’s approval rating is down 24 points among these lower-income earners since last June, compared with an 8-point drop among those with higher incomes. (In other groups, Biden’s lost 21 points among young adults and 18 points among moderates.) He has a 37% approval rating among all adults for handling the economy, matching his overall job approval; 58% disapprove, a steep 21-point hole. More troubling for his party, Americans trust the Republican Party over the Democrats to handle the economy by 54-35%. Notably, Biden doesn’t take all the heat for inflation. Fifty percent assign him a great deal or good amount of direct blame for it; more blame corporations trying to increase their profits -- 68% -- and disruptions from the pandemic, 73%. Nonetheless, with 7.5% annual inflation on his watch, even if indirectly, Biden gets blowback. The economy is the big issue, but not the only one, and on others the Democrats fare less poorly. Americans divide 43-37% between the parties in trust to handle the pandemic, a slight 6-point Democratic lead, and 44-41% in trust to handle education and schools, not a significant difference. There’s also the matter of Biden’s personal attributes, which track generally with his approval overall. Forty-three percent say he can be trusted in a crisis; 52% think not. Just 36% call him a strong leader, down 7 points since last measured during the 2020 campaign; 59% don’t see him this way. And 40% think he has the mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively, down 11 points from spring 2020; 54% think not. Finally, given his problematic ratings, just 14% of Americans say they’d be more likely to vote for a congressional candidate Biden has endorsed, compared to 32% less likely. That 18-point net negative score almost exactly matches the net negative impact (19 points, 18 vs. 37%) of an endorsement from another political figure -- Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump. This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Feb. 20-24, 2022, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,011 adults, including 904 registered voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 4.0 percentage points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 27-26-40% for the full sample, Democrats-Republicans-independents, and 27-27-39% for registered voters.

2022-02-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/putins-nuclear-alert-part-pattern-manufacturing-threats-psaki/story?id=83130027,Putin's nuclear alert part of 'pattern' of 'manufacturing threats': Psaki,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to put his nation's nuclear deterrent forces on a state of heightened alert was part of a ""pattern"" of ""manufacturing threats that don't exist."" ""This is really a pattern that we've seen from President Putin through the course of this conflict, which is manufacturing threats that don't exist in order to justify further aggression,"" Psaki told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. ""And the global community and the American people should look at it through that prism."" Putin announced Sunday he had ordered his military to put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces in a state of heightened readiness in response to what he called ""aggressive statements"" from NATO countries. ""We've seen him do this time and time again,"" Psaki said. ""At no point has Russia been under threat from NATO, has Russia been under threat from Ukraine. This is all a pattern from President Putin."" The move came as Western nations rolled out waves of financial sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine that have the potential to cripple Russia's economy. The U.S. and other nations have also stepped up military aid to Ukraine. Observers have questioned whether Putin is acting rationally, with a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, saying this week that he did not think the Russian president was. ""I wish I could share more,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted Friday, ""but for now I can say it's pretty obvious to many that something is off with Putin."" Pressed by Stephanopoulos on whether the U.S. government believed Putin was mentally unbalanced in some way, Psaki said the Russian leader had made clear his ""ambitions beyond"" solely justifying the invasion of Ukraine. ""I'm not going to make an assessment of his mental stability,"" she said, ""but I will tell you, certainly, the rhetoric, the actions, the justification that he's making for his actions are certainly deeply concerning to us."" Asked by Stephanopoulos if President Joe Biden was confident his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was safe, Psaki declined to say and instead praised the Ukrainian leader. ""He has been in close touch,"" Psaki said. ""While not getting into his security -- the security of President Zelenskyy -- I'm just going to note, George, as the American people have seen and tuned in to, he is standing up courageously against the invasion of President Putin and Russian leadership, leading his country and continuing to."" In an earlier interview on ""This Week,"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told Stephanopoulos that Zelenskyy is ""is as safe as our country."" ""That's the choice he made to stay in Kyiv, to stay in Ukraine and lead the nation in this very difficult moment,"" she said. The United States and its Western allies said Saturday they would target Russia’s central bank and bar some of the country’s banks from participating in a system that facilitates international transactions. But aside from halting a Russian pipeline that had not yet started pumping gas to Europe, the countries have stopped short of launching crippling sanctions against Russia's oil and gas industry, a major sector of its economy. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has called for the Biden administration to sanction the Russian energy sector while lifting restrictions on drilling on U.S. federal lands and reopening the Keystone Pipeline, which Biden revoked the permit for in June. Stephanopoulos pressed Psaki on those proposals. ""The Keystone Pipeline was not processing oil through the system,"" Psaki said. ""That does not solve any problems. That's a misdiagnosis...of what needs to happen,"" she said. ""I would also note that on oil leases, what this actually justifies, in President Biden's view, is the fact that we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, on oil in general, and we need to look at other ways of processing -- of having energy in our country and others."" Much of Western Europe, especially Germany, relies on Russian gas, and the United States has stayed away from hitting Russia's oil and gas sector in order to avoid prices spiking in Europe and the U.S. ""We want to take every step to maximize the impact and the consequences on President Putin, while minimizing the impact on the American people and the global community,"" Psaki said. ""And so energy sanctions are certainly on the table. We have not taken those off. But we also want to do that and make sure we're minimizing the impact on the global marketplace and do it in a united way.""

2022-02-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-faces-ukraine-pressures-eve-sotu-note/story?id=83144118,Biden faces new Ukraine pressures on eve of SOTU: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It won't be the State of the Union that President Joe Biden might have envisioned -- and quite suddenly, COVID restrictions are almost the least of it. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made this a moment that showcases foreign policy and broad questions of national security. And the divisions inside the Republican Party -- even those driven by former President Donald Trump -- aren't enough to shield Biden from pressures to act more boldly on multiple fronts. That's in part because the pressure isn't solely political. Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said on ABC's ""This Week"" that her country is ""grateful"" for the support it's gotten but that government and business entities can and should provide much more. ""We need more defensive weapons,"" she said. ""It's time to take sides, and it's time to take Ukrainians' side."" Republicans like Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., have been pressing Biden to get more weapons to Ukraine and to impose more severe sanctions against financial entities than those already laid out. Democratic lawmakers have also been agitating for bigger steps to be taken on a faster timeline than has been favored by the White House. Biden comes to the current crisis and Tuesday's speech with career-low approval ratings across a broad range of issues. The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll finds just 43% trust in Biden's ability to handle a crisis and growing concerns about the impact world events might have on energy prices and overall security. The White House has signaled an openness to taking further steps to protect Ukraine and rebuff Russia. Biden's challenge from here will be less about connecting the crisis to Americans' lives than in convincing voters that his steps are helping minimize what could be a far-reaching catastrophe. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The clock is ticking and Democrats want to move quickly after Biden's historic announcement of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as his pick to replace the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., wants to see Jackson confirmed before the start of the Senate's Easter recess on April 8. That amount of time would still be longer than Amy Coney Barrett's 30 days between announcement and confirmation. Jackson is expected to begin meeting with senators before the start of confirmation hearings. Jackson is no stranger to the process. She has been confirmed by the Senate three times. She was last confirmed by the Senate in June to her post as United States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit. Then, Jackson got three Republican votes, but that's not guaranteed this time around. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, signaled openness to voting in favor of Jackson's confirmation Sunday. ""Look, her nomination and her confirmation would or will be historic and like anyone nominated by the president of the United States, she deserves a very careful look, a very deep dive,"" Romney told CNN. ""And I will provide fresh eyes to that evaluation, and hope that I will be able to support her in the final analysis."" The reality is that Democrats don't need Republican buy-in. They only need a simple majority to confirm Jackson and if Democrats are unified since Vice President Kamala Harris could serve as the tie-breaking vote. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema This week, voters will head to the polls for the first midterm election day of the year, as Texans cast their ballots in the March 1 primary election. Apart from serving as a symbolic marker of the official start of the 2022 midterm cycle, the outcome of Tuesday's election will also give a better assessment of the impact of the state's new election law. So far, the most visible aspect of the law includes the tightened voter identification requirement for those who are eligible to vote by mail. In order to successfully cast their mail ballots, voters must include either their driver's license number or the last four digits of their social security number on their ballots. The number they include must then match the number they originally used to register to vote. Voters ABC News spoke with over the last month who had their ballot applications rejected were either unaware of the change or did not recall which information they first used on their voter registration -- leading to mismatched data. Although primary election voter turnout is already perpetually low in midterm election cycles, this kind of confusion from voters could compound that. The exact number of voters who cast mail ballots and were affected by this provision continues to fluctuate, but election officials in the state's largest metro area of Harris County tell ABC just over 30% of mail ballots they received were flagged for correction specifically because of the new identification requirements. It now remains to be seen how many of those ballots get corrected by the time polls close Tuesday. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 47. That's the percentage of Americans who disapprove of the way President Joe Biden has handled the crisis in Ukraine so far, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. And as FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich wrote on Friday, that is broadly in line with how Americans view Biden's handling of foreign policy more broadly, which is likely a hangover from this summer when his numbers on the issue first fell during the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. But as Nathaniel writes, Americans largely approve of the sanctions Biden has imposed on Russia, so it's possible Americans might end up giving Biden higher marks for how he manages the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

2022-02-28,https://abcnews.go.com/International/people-planet-clobbered-climate-change-report/story?id=83050608,"People, planet 'getting clobbered by climate change,' UN official says of new report","As the world follows news about Russia's invasion of Ukraine this week, a group of international scientists warn the world can't lose sight of another major threat: climate change. Climate change affects nearly every aspect of life on Earth, a new report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found. Additionally, some communities and ecosystems are being hit so hard, they may not be able to adapt, according to the report. ""Today's IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership. With fact upon fact, this report reveals how people and the planet are getting clobbered by climate change,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in remarks during a press conference Monday morning. ""The scientific evidence is unequivocal. Climate change is a threat to human well-being and the health of the planet. Any further delay in concerted global action will [mean] the brief and rapidly closing window to secure a livable future,"" the panel's co-chair, Debra Roberts said Monday. The report also states: ""Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all."" ""Starting today, every action, every choice, and every decision matters. Because each of them can take us away from or towards a climate resilient sustainable world,"" Roberts said. The report released Monday is part of a series of reports from the IPCC, a group of climate science experts who advise governments on climate-related matters such as the Paris Agreement. All parties to the Paris Agreement are scheduled to meet in Egypt in November to discuss how they will meet goals to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and how to fulfill commitments to provide financial support for countries already experiencing devastating impacts of climate change. ""This report really contains information that is a little bit like the parent yelling up the stairs, 'You're going to miss the bus.' So, this report is really telling us just how urgent it is,"" Sarah Cooley, director of climate science at Ocean Conservancy and coordinating lead author of the report's chapter on oceans, told ABC News. ""But it's also full of information about how many good options we have available right now that are already being attempted but need to be institutionalized and broadened so that we can make the most of the opportunities that remain in front of us, rather than continuing to hit snooze on climate and really leaving options out of the mix in the future,"" she added. Worsening impacts The U.N. panel warns of climate change's severe and worsening effects on human health and safety as well as damage to plants and animals that is pushing ecosystems beyond their natural ability to recover. The world has a more than 50% chance of exceeding 1.5 degree Celsius of additional warming -- the benchmark set under the Paris Agreement to prevent worsening climate change impact, the report found. Any additional warming beyond that level, according to the report, will increase the risk of severe and potentially irreversible impact on humans and the environment. ""Depending on the magnitude and duration of overshoot, some impacts will cause release of additional greenhouse gasses, and some will be irreversible, even if global warming is reduced,"" the report says. As global warming increases, the report says it can limit water availability, strain food production systems, and increase health problems and premature deaths from exposure to heat waves or diseases. The report also highlights the mental health impact of climate change, saying that climate change is placing a toll on people's mental health through the stress of being evacuated during events such as wildfires or natural disasters but also the indirect stress and anxiety associated with being exposed to lots of images and information about climate change. Average global temperatures have already increased an average of 1.1 degree Celsius compared to pre-industrial times -- and more in some areas. The report highlights that some parts of the world are more vulnerable than others, saying 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in areas considered ""highly vulnerable"" to climate change. A closing window to adapt While the report warns about the urgent risks of allowing warming to continue, it also discusses the parallel track of how to adapt to the impact of climate change that are already here and quickly becoming more severe. In some cases, the limits of adaptation have been reached and there is no known solution, such as coral reefs that are unable to recover from warming ocean temperatures. But limits to human adaptation are less tangible, and, in many cases, the report found they can be overcome through financial assistance or government intervention. ""I would say the majority of the situations that we see around the world where we do know that there are solutions that would work. We just haven't tried to implement them yet,"" Rebecca Carter, acting director of the climate resilience program at the World Resources Institute, told ABC News. Carter said the report focuses on how solutions that restore natural ecosystems can be a more effective way to adapt to climate change than engineered solutions such as building sea walls, though in some places those may still be necessary. The report's authors said the world can still limit some of the impact of climate change from becoming more dangerous if countries dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and governments take steps such as protecting vast swaths of natural areas on land and in the oceans. ""The scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human well-being and the health of the planet,""IPCC Working Group II co-chair Hans-Otto Pörtner said in a statement. ""Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a livable future,"" he said.",25
2022-02-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/reason-change-us-nuclear-alert-level-amid-putins/story?id=83159115,'No reason' to change US nuclear alert level amid Putin's threat: Psaki,"As the U.S. and other Western nations considered how to address Russian aggression, the Pentagon and White House said Monday the U.S. saw no need to change the its nuclear alert level despite Russian President Vladimir Putin making a a veiled threat Sunday that he was doing so, placing his forces on ""special combat readiness."" ""We are assessing Putin's directive and at this time we see no reason to change our own alert level,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. ""The United States nor NATO has any desire for conflict with Russia, and we think provocative rhetoric like this regarding nuclear weapons is dangerous, adds to the risk of miscalculation, should be avoided, and we'll not indulge in it,"" she said. Asked by a reporter after a Black History Month event whether Americans should be worried about nuclear was, President Joe Biden quickly responded, ""No."" Psaki also said that the $350 million in aid that Biden approved to be delivered to Ukraine will arrive ""within the next couple of days"" although that has been complicated by disputed airspace over and near Ukraine. At the same time, she effectively ruled out NATO enforcing a no-fly zone in the area. Earlier Monday, Biden held a call with allies and partners to coordinate the ongoing response to as Ukraine and Russia held talks on a possible cease-fire in the invasion. The call included European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Polish President Andrzej Duda, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. That call comes as Russian and Ukrainian leaders met for talks for six hours at the Belarusian border on Monday morning. A Ukrainian spokesman said in a statement afterward that there may be another round of negotiations. ""The Ukrainian and Russian delegations held the first round of talks today, the main purpose of which was to discuss the issues of a cease-fire on the territory of Ukraine and hostilities,"" Mikhail Podolyak said. At the State Department, the U.S. response was skeptical. ""Diplomacy at the barrel of a gun, diplomacy at the turret of a tank – that is not real diplomacy,"" spokesperson Ned Price said. Though he said that the U.S., Ukraine, and European allies still believe dialogue is the way forward, he clarified that ""diplomacy is highly unlikely to bear fruit – to prove effective – in the midst of not only confrontation, but escalation."" Later, he said, ""In order for it to bear fruit, it needed to take place in the context of de-escalation."" The White House on Monday also laid out more specifics about sanctions announced over the weekend in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions on Russia's Central Bank prevent the Russian government from access to more than $600 billion in reserves in the U.S., or in U.S. dollars in foreign countries. Officials said it was evident that Putin planned to use the central bank's assets to offset the effects of sanctions from Western countries. A senior White House official said they ""represent the most significant actions the U.S. Treasury has taken against an economy of this size, and assets of this size."" ""Today's announcement that prohibit transactions with the Central Bank of Russia in the national wealth fund will significantly hinder their ability to do that, and inhibit their access to hundreds of billions of dollars in assets from our actions alone, they will not be able to access assets that are either in United States or in US dollars,"" officials said. Beyond sanctions, the U.S., among other nations, is providing material support to Ukraine as it tries to beat back Russian forces. A senior defense official said Monday that the U.S. is continuing ""to provide security assistance to Ukraine, and that includes in just the last day or so."" ""We don't have any indications that that there's been a blockage or impediment to continued assistance coming from the west to the Ukrainian armed forces,"" the senior defense official said. ""And as I said, that support continues to flow not just from the United States, but from other nations as well."" However, the defense official was hesitant to give specifics about the details of U.S. support to Ukrainian forces given so that the support is not ""disrupted."" ""I will remain reticent to talk about the methods in which and the ways in which we're going to look for ways to continue to provide our support precisely because we want to make sure it gets into the hands of Ukrainian armed forces and Ukrainian fighters and we don't want that to be disrupted,"" a senior defense official said. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby declined to talk about the potential of that aid being disrupted during a press briefing Monday. ""We're going to continue to provide security assistance to Ukrainian armed forces, and we're still going to look for ways to do that, in the most effective, efficient way possible,"" Kirby said.

2022-03-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/ukrainian-maternity-hospital-treating-wounded-soldiers-russia-conflict/story?id=83178712,Ukrainian maternity hospital treating wounded soldiers as Russia conflict escalates,"This is a MedPage Today story. Despite the conflict surrounding them, Dr. Valery Zukin, CEO of a private maternity hospital in western Kyiv, Ukraine, -- just five to 10 kilometers from the ""zone of fire"" -- said the staff have no choice but to continue to work. Over the previous four days, doctors, nurses, midwives and cooks have stayed overnight at the hospital. Some doctors and nurses have brought their children as well. ""And for this moment, we must stay like a big family,"" Zukin told MedPage Today. Life has changed dramatically for Ukrainians in only a few days, he said. ""We could not imag[ine] for example that a few days ago ... we live by another life,"" he said. ""If, for example, you must stay in your working place without change. You could not go at home [without] special permission. You couldn't go in the shop because all [of] the shop[s] are closed. You could not move by the car ... and you must go according to some signal in the shelter and you never could imag[ine] it will happen during the day or during the night. You understand that it is a very stress[ful] situation."" Because moving around Kyiv is ""absolutely forbidden,"" the hospital must work with police to inform different posts throughout the city when a patient needs to be moved into or out of the hospital. Zukin compares life in the hospital underground to working on a Navy boat. To maintain a sense of structure and calm, ""all the [crew] they stay on the ship all the time, but they have some working hours and some ... sleeping, resting hours,"" he said. A psychologist can do Skype consultations to help staff cope with the new stress. As of Saturday, Zukin said around 60 doctors, nurses, and midwives and 25 patients and 17 babies were in the hospital. ""We have a lot of Ukrainian patient[s] from [other] cities, and for this moment, we must care for all of these people, for all of these babies,"" he said. Zukin spoke with a man whose wife had just given birth in the hospital a few days earlier. He is Italian, she is Ukrainian and they have an apartment in Kyiv, but it's on the 21st floor. Until he finds a way to leave Ukraine, the husband wants his wife to stay in the hospital. ""She has no good place to go,"" Zukin said. The hospital is not only serving pregnant women and mothers, but also wounded patients. ""Every day, we have eight, 10 of our soldiers,"" he said, clarifying that these aren't members of the Ukrainian military but volunteers for the territorial defense, who arrive with head wounds, chest wounds and injuries to their hands and legs. Because the hospital has something known as GCI certification, all doctors are trained to provide basic life support, which is akin to military medicine. So, a patient with a brain injury can be sent to the neurological hospital, but the staff there can help with the initial primary medical care. ""We have very qualified anesthesiologist and very qualified anesthesiologist nurses,"" and can provide the necessary care, he said. Last week, Zukin said his staff shared a post on Facebook calling for help with supplies, and strangers brought them food, water and medications. A car came and delivered their dinner the other night. He initially thought the delivery was from an organized charity group, but it was actually a private restaurant. ""You understand that [it] is not safe to come now in our part of Kyiv,"" he said, moved by the gesture. President Vladimir Putin's ""big mistake"" Zukin said, has been to underestimate Ukrainians' commitment to freedom. ""I promise [the driver] that we will celebrate our win in this restaurant [with] the staff who stay now in the hospital,"" he said. This was a light and hopeful moment for Zukin, but everyone is struggling. ""I think that every day [we are] waiting, it is a problem for Ukraine,"" he said, and each day more soldiers are killed. ""I think that this war must be killed in the embryonic stage,"" he said, comparing it to fire, as it grows ""more and more, it will be more difficult to stop."" If the West continues to ignore Putin, World War II will repeat itself, he said. ""We hope that all of this movement against Russia it will be very quick,"" he said. ""Ukraine is not so powerful country but in spite of this. The general feeling of all the people is to defend their country, their democracy."" Zukin continued, ""We hope for the support of [the] United States and Western Europe. Without support, we could not survive and we could not win.""",22
2022-03-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-army-vet-charged-florida-double-murder-remains/story?id=83066233,Army vet charged in Florida double murder may remain at large in Ukraine,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted thousands of people to leave the Eastern European country, but should North Carolina native Craig Lang depart Ukraine and return to the United States, he could immediately be taken into custody by federal authorities. Lang, a 32-year-old U.S. Army veteran-turned-murder suspect who previously moved to Ukraine, is one of two former soldiers accused of killing husband and wife Danny and Deana Lorenzo in southwest Florida nearly four years ago. FBI investigators say that the Lorenzos, who were also military veterans, were fatally shot in April 2018 in an Estero parking lot after they traveled nearly three hours to respond to an online firearms advertisement. Sheriff’s deputies found 63 bullet casings at the scene, with bullet holes riddling the Lorenzos’ vehicle. “She was scared. I know she had to be,” Deana Lorenzo’s sister Angie Crowder told ABC News. Residents of this Fort Myers suburb were left mystified about the alleged ambush for more than a year until the Department of Justice announced federal charges against Lang and co-defendant Alex Zwiefelhofer in connection with the Lorenzos’ deaths. Zwiefelhofer was taken into federal custody in Wisconsin in 2019 and has pleaded not guilty. Lang has yet to appear before a federal judge. He has denied involvement in the Florida murders and has fought extradition back to the United States. Relatives of the Lorenzos, including Crowder, are in anguish. “We all want answers,” Crowder said. “I would like to see him come back and stand charges.” In the spring of 2021, ABC News traveled roughly 5,000 miles to Ukraine in search of Lang. He was found to be living openly with a Ukrainian wife and child in a Kyiv neighborhood. Lang, who was previously arrested for brandishing a gun near the home of one of his American ex-wives after he went AWOL, agreed to an on-camera interview with ABC News Investigative Correspondent David Scott. However, Lang refused to answer questions during the interview about the murders in Florida. ""I can't discuss … anything about Florida [or] pretty much anything about my time in the United States in 2018,"" Lang said. ""I can't talk about any of that."" While the DOJ continues to seek his extradition, Lang told Scott that he is seeking asylum in Ukraine. ""I believe that the United States government intends to prosecute me and other veterans of this conflict here for our service in Ukraine,"" he said, arguing that he is a victim of Russian propaganda and American political persecution. After being discharged by the U.S. Army, he says he first arrived in Ukraine around 2016 and joined far-right militias such as the Azov Battalion and Right Sector. Both groups have been accused of human rights abuses by Amnesty International and have alleged ties to American white power organizations. Lang denies that he is a right-wing extremist. ""I'm going to say that the amount of, like, neo-Nazis or people with extreme views is very, very minimal, very, very minimal,” he said. “Is there extremism to a small degree? There might be some extremism, yes.” Since Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea, to bolster its defenses against those in its eastern regions seeking to separate from Ukraine and join Russia, Ukraine has relied on local militia groups, some of which have been linked to the nation’s far-right political movements by Amnesty International and The Soufan Center. Such battalions with ties to Ukraine’s far-right fringe political parties may have empowered Russian President Vladimir Putin to spread the false message that ""denazification"" was the goal of his invasion, despite Ukraine's elected government having the support of the United States and other Western democracies. Scott questioned Lang about the far-right ideology reportedly behind the Azov Battalion, but Lang said that he did not think that the group’s membership included anyone with extremist views. Over an hour into the conversation, after being pressed on racist statements reportedly made by former Azov Battalion commander Andriy Biletsky, Lang ended the interview. “I'm going to go ahead and leave,” Lang told Scott. Lang is one of a number of Americans who have reportedly either traveled to Ukraine over the last decade to fight for far-right paramilitary groups or have sought to do so. The FBI alleged that Jarrett William Smith, an Army veteran who pleaded guilty in 2020 to federal charges of distributing information related to explosives, destructive devices, and weapons of mass destruction, had a ""desire to fight in Ukraine"" and communicated about his plans with Lang on Facebook. ""It was as if [Smith] wanted to use the Army to get the training that he needed to be successful going overseas, fighting on behalf of this white supremacist organization,"" former federal prosecutor Anthony Mattivi said. Smith is not alleged to have ultimately fought in Ukraine. When asked about Smith, Lang called him an extremist and confirmed that they connected on Facebook, but said that he turned Smith away from his Ukrainian unit. ""I wasn't going out and recruiting people. I wasn't saying, 'Oh, come out and join us,"" Lang said. ""What was happening is I was simply a point of contact for a lot of foreigners that came into this country, and there's a lot of good people that came into the country."" The Soufan Center warned in a 2019 report that Ukraine had already become an attractive stop for far-right extremists. “Americans have gone to fight as mercenary soldiers in far-right and paramilitary units in Ukraine,” University of Chicago Assistant Professor Kathleen Belew said. “They do pose a threat to the homeland.” Lang and Zwiefelhofer are American, but the FBI says that the two alleged murderers initially met in eastern Ukraine more than five years ago while fighting for a far-right militia against Russian-backed separatists. Federal prosecutors allege that after returning to the United States together, Lang and Zwiefelhofer came up with the plot to rob and kill the Lorenzos in 2018 ""to fund their planned travel to Venezuela.” A superseding indictment also claimed that Zwiefelhofer and Lang conspired with each other to travel to Venezuela and commit murder, kidnapping, and maiming as part of a ""military expedition and enterprise"" there. Lang, who said that he has never been to Venezuela, declined to comment on whether he considered the South American nation to be a potential frontline for him. At some point after the Lorenzos’ deaths, Lang ended up back in Ukraine and said he became an English instructor there, despite being wanted in Florida on federal criminal charges. While many Americans left Ukraine ahead of the Russian invasion, some groups made recent efforts to encourage others to do the opposite. In January, an international message board for neo-Nazis urged American followers to join far-right militias to help fight Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, where local civilian fighters had been prepared to assist the Ukrainian military due to the mobilization of Russian forces. This effort came a month before Putin falsely claimed that he is looking to rid Ukraine of Nazis and suggested that the country’s far-right has control of its government, using these lies as pretexts for war. Ukraine’s president is Jewish and, according to the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, Russia has had its own extremist militias fighting alongside Russian-based separatists in Ukraine. One such group was the Russian Imperial Movement, which has reportedly cultivated ties with American neo-Nazis and offered to train white nationalists at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. “One important thing to understand about white power and militant right groups is that they are fundamentally opportunistic,” Belew said. “When we have a major … point of tension like we're seeing in the Ukraine right now, it's very, very likely that actors will exploit that tension.” With war now underway in Ukraine, it remains unclear when or if Lang will end up being forcibly returned to American soil to face trial in federal court. Back in Florida, Crowder says she is still grieving the loss of her sister and brother-in-law while hoping that justice will be served. “I still have my moments and sometimes, I'll just break out and cry,” Crowder said.",0
2022-03-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-hope-reset-biden-note/story?id=83164007,Democrats see hope for reset from Biden: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The crisis of the moment represents terrible timing for a president already facing a raft of challenges -- unless it brings fresh opportunity. President Joe Biden was always going to have a tough go in declaring the State of the Union strong given cascading challenges being felt in everyday lives as well as his own abysmal polling. With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there's no use avoiding the crises -- just as there's no avoiding the contrasts. For Biden, the contrasts include one that now pits Russia against much if not most of the civilized world. It's a large-scale version of the fight for democracy Biden has pinned his presidency on -- one where his predecessor is among the few prominent voices saying nice things about the other side. Inside his own party, the combination of forces including inflation, the Ukraine crisis and the brutal realities of midterm math could free the president to change Democrats' course. The hope at least among some party strategists is that Biden uses the setting of his State of the Union address on Tuesday less for sweep than for a renewed focus. The crisis in Ukraine gives the president the responsibility to ""rally the world"" against Russian President Vladimir Putin, as White House press secretary Jen Psaki put it Monday. Previews of the speech have made clear that there will be plenty of instances when the president calls on Congress to deliver specific bills to his desk. For this moment, though, rallying the country behind a broad cause could mark its own achievement. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The Republican Party will look outside of Washington to Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for its response to Biden's State of the Union address. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Reynolds ""exactly the right messenger to contrast Joe Biden"" on a call with reporters Monday. The RNC plans to hit on issues like inflation, immigration, the pandemic, crime and foreign policy. But it's Reynolds adherence to GOP positions on various culture war issues that make her a fitting choice to deliver the rebuttal on behalf of this Republican party. ""She kept her schools open, her economy is booming,"" McDaniel said. Reynolds, who is up for reelection, didn't just keep her schools open. She also signed a host of pandemic-related legislation: banning mask mandates, penalizing businesses that require customers show proof of vaccination, broadening eligibility to claim medical and religious exemptions to the vaccine and allowing people fired for vaccine noncompliance to file for unemployment. And Reynolds' fidelity to the conservative side of the culture wars doesn't stop at the pandemic. She also signed a law prohibiting so-called ""critical race theory"" and has urged Iowa lawmakers to pass legislation to ban transgender athletes in women's sports. It remains to be seen how much of the aforementioned cultural issues will make it into Reynolds' remarks. If the freshly concluded CPAC is any evidence, weaving in cultural flashpoints could help Reynolds raise her national profile with a base eager to rally around them. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The first primary of the 2022 midterm election cycle is getting underway Tuesday, putting campaign politics back in the spotlight for the first time since 2020. The outcome of several races will likely set the tone for how the next few months of the primary cycle could play out nationwide, and both parties are keenly aware of intraparty dynamics that will unfold as voters cast their ballots. The power of Trump's endorsement will be put to the test for longtime Republican allies in two high-profile statewide races as both incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton fend off Republican challenges. Abbott is more likely to avoid heading to a May runoff, but Tuesday's election could present an uphill battle for Paxton. Paxton faces challenges from Land Commissioner George P. Bush, who has been pursuing Trump-adjacent campaign messaging despite his family's public rejection of the former president. Bush, Rep. Louie Gohmert and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman are also challenging Paxton's professional record, which includes legal woes like an indictment on securities fraud charges. Meanwhile, Democrats will be watching the faceoff between progressive Jessica Cisneros and incumbent Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar in Texas' 28th congressional district. In 2020, Cuellar won the primary over Cisneros by fewer than 3,000 votes, but the political landscape could look different after this year's redistricting process left their district slightly bluer. If Cisneros is successful on Tuesday, her victory would be akin to that of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2018 and could inspire similar ripple effects for progressives ahead of November. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 25. That's the percentage of requests presidents have made during State of Union addresses that Congress has moved to enact since former President Lyndon Johnson's address in 1965.

2022-03-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-economy-center-stage-bidens-state-union-address/story?id=83158290,"Ukraine, economy to take center stage in Biden's State of the Union address","It was one of the most consequential weeks of President Joe Biden's presidency, and it came right before his first State of the Union address to Congress. Biden's 9 p.m. ET speech, to be carried live on national television and seen around the world, will be delivered just days after Russia invaded Ukraine – and days after he nominated the first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court. But he'll also be speaking to Americans suffering from historic inflation as the nation continues to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic. With his job approval at an all-time low of 37%, Biden faces the difficult task of balancing their pain with his desire to reap the political benefits of his legislative wins so far -- a massive COVID relief package and a once-in-a-generation investment in the nation's infrastructure -- while also demonstrating his leadership on one of the greatest threats to European stability since World War II. While a president's annual address to Congress typically ticks through a laundry list of domestic priorities and accomplishments, the war in Ukraine will likely compel Biden to make foreign policy a dominant theme. ""There's no question that this speech is a little different than it would have been just a few months ago,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday. It's a theme that Biden could use to his advantage, demonstrating his taking command as he keeps Western leaders united against a common foreign foe most Americans can recognize: Russian President Vladimir Putin. In addition to making the crisis something of personal test of wills between himself and Putin, Biden has not shied from presenting the conflict in consequential, historical terms, equating Ukraine's defense to the fight against autocracy; he often describes the world as facing an ""inflection point"" during which it's the United States' responsibility to show that democracy can still work. The president has made reaffirming America's traditional relationships and strengthening international institutions like NATO a hallmark of his first 13 months in office. Russia's invasion has strengthened the NATO alliance, as Western nations stand together against Russia. Biden has made working in lockstep with Europe an overarching principle of his approach, and it's delivered results: unprecedented, punitive sanctions against Russia; preemptive releases of intelligence information; and at home, some praise from Republicans usually critical of his policies. After struggling with the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and bringing Iran back to the agreement over its nuclear program, Russia's invasion presents Biden with the ability to fulfill a campaign promise of returning America to a position of leadership in the world. And it could lead to a few bipartisan applause lines from Republicans who have supported his approach -- rather than the regular, one-sided standing ovations from Democrats. But potentially overshadowing Ukraine and Russia in Biden's speech will be his attempt to show how he's addressing inflation, which is at a 40-year high, and an economy still struggling to emerge from the pandemic. Economic discontent is hurting Biden and his party's midterm election prospects, with six in 10 Americans reporting inflation hardships, three-quarters saying the economy's in bad shape and a nearly 20-point lead for the Republican Party in trust to handle it, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll. The president planned to focus on four economic themes, the White House said: increasing domestic manufacturing and strengthening supply chains; reducing costs for families while also reducing the deficit; promoting competition as another way to lower prices; and expanding access to well paying jobs. Biden will talk about new steps to promote competition in the ocean freight industry and improve nursing home care, the White House said. Much of what Biden will call for, though, according to the White House, will rely on a reluctant Congress to send him legislation. Biden fulfilled a major promise last year when he pushed a $1.9 trillion COVID relief package, known as the ""American Rescue Plan,"" through Congress. And the president's $1.2 trillion infrastructure law was a major accomplishment that will pump money into roads, bridges, airports, waterways, broadband internet, cleaning up lead pipes and more. Members of Congress, governors and other politicians of both parties have touted the benefits of the infrastructure legislation, which garnered bipartisan support. But it will take time for many of those projects to come to fruition across the country, and Biden has faced the difficult task of using it to boost his poll numbers in the short term. But since then, prices for food, gas and other consumer goods have jumped. While the U.S. economy has rebounded to a large degree -- with strong recent job growth -- wages have not kept up with inflation for most workers. Psaki said that Biden will ""absolutely"" talk about inflation, noting it's ""a huge issue on the mind of Americans."" ""He's going to make clear that one of the best ways to lower costs over the long run is to increase the productive capacity of our economy, to make more things in America, with more American workers contributing and earning a good living,"" she said. Meanwhile, though, the war in Ukraine has already contributed to higher energy costs -- including gas prices -- a political threat for Biden. Last week, two-thirds of Americans supported imposing economic sanctions on Russia, although only 51% backed them if it meant higher energy prices in the U.S., according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll. Biden has sought to persuade Americans the price is worth it -- and, together with European nations, have held back from sanctioning Russia's oil and gas sector -- fearing that prices could spike around the world. ""The American people understand,"" Biden said earlier this month, ""that defending democracy and liberty is never without cost."" Before Russia invaded Ukraine, a larger theme likely would have been his stressing a ""return to normalcy"" to try to keep Americans tired of the pandemic from making him and Democrats pay a big political cost in November's midterm elections. Ahead of Biden's speech, the White House has begun a sweeping overhaul of its COVID-19 strategy that will signal the nation is moving past crisis mode and into a more manageable phase in the pandemic, ABC News has learned. The new strategy was expected to acknowledge that the virus is less of an urgent threat to most Americans because of widespread access to vaccines, booster shots, and testing, as well as increasing availability of therapeutics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased masking recommendations for most of the country last week, a major shift in the nation's return to normalcy. Face coverings will not be required in the House chamber where Biden will speak, a symbolic switch after the president walked in with one on for his address last year. But the federal guidance came after governors of several liberal-leaning states moved ahead on their own with lifting restrictions. Biden's reluctance to get ahead of the CDC – and let science lead the way, as he had promised he would do – resulted in an ad hoc shift across the country. While the delta and omicron variants were major speed bumps to Biden's plan to bring the U.S. out of the pandemic – and actions his administration has taken on testing and masking have appeared reactive – the State of the Union address gives the president a chance to reframe his plan to curb COVID. Heading into the midterm elections later this year – when Republicans could retake Congress – Biden has left many promises unfulfilled. His ""Build Back Better"" social plan has fallen by the wayside, after passing the House and stalling out in the Senate. It would provide hundreds of billions of dollars for child care, paid family leave, education, health care and combating climate change; without its passage, a number of Biden's campaign pledges remain unmet. A pair of voting rights bills that passed the House have also languished in the Senate, and efforts to reform policing and guns have not met with success. Biden had promised to tackle climate change and racial equity as key priorities, but he has not been able to gain bipartisan support to do so, despite his pledge to soften political divisions.

Paul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared at an event organized by a white nationalist, Republican party leaders are condemning them for attending. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell released a statement Monday criticizing white supremacist hate. ""There's no place in the Republican Party for white supremacists or anti-Semitism,"" McConnell said in a statement first reported by Politico. Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Monday afternoon that he found Greene and Gosar's attendance ""unacceptable."" McCarthy suggested to reporters that he plans to speak with both Gosar and Greene later this week. ""To me, it was appalling and wrong,"" McCarthy told reporters. ""There's no place in our party for any of this."" ""The party should not be associated any time any place with somebody who is anti-Semitic...This is unacceptable,"" he added. McCarthy was in Israel last week with a congressional delegation. He told Punchbowl News that the news of Greene and Gosar's attendance was particularly upsetting because of his recent visit. Greene and Gosar have both previously been stripped of their committee assignments for their egregious behavior. McCarthy, however, has previously said he would restore their assignments if Republicans take back the House in November. McCarthy told CNN and another reporter outside his office that even though Greene claimed not to know who the event organizer was ""with that introduction, you should have walked off stage."" Shortly before introducing Greene, Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist who organized the event, led participants in applause for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and chanted Russian President Vladimir Putin's name. Republican Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, when asked about Greene's behavior Monday, also condemned the event but stopped short of condemning her members. ""White supremacy. Neo Nazism, hate speech, and bigotry are disgusting. They have no place or home and our party."" McDaniel didn't say whether the party would take any further action against its members, such as censuring them. Instead, she said she ""would let the process play out"" and see if any members brought any censures forward at a party meeting in August. The criticism follows recent comments by former President Donald Trump, who continues to praise Putin. During an interview with the conservative radio show ""The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show"" on Tuesday, Trump labeled Putin's tactics ""genius"" and ""savvy."" Trump ultimately slammed the invasion on Saturday night at the Conservative Political Action Conference but called Putin ""smart."" Greene and Gosar's appearance at the conference Friday night is now renewing calls for them to be reprimanded by fellow Republicans in Congress. ""In any other world, Greene speaking at a white supremacist conference where attendees have defended Vladimir Putin and praised Adolf Hitler would warrant expulsion from the caucus, to say nothing of her advocacy for violence and consistent anti-Semitism is disgusting,"" Democratic National Committee spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. Greene, however, has doubled down on her appearance. ""I won't cancel others in the conservative movement, even if I find some of their statements tasteless, misguided or even repulsive at times. I encourage them to seek wisdom, and apologize to those who have been hurt by their words, as I've had to do,"" she said. ""Our faith calls for charity and forgiveness."" ""We're not going to be deterred by journalists and Washington insiders who fear the name of Our Lord, and relentlessly attack those of us who proclaim His name. We know that Christ is our only judge,"" she added. Over the weekend, in addition to claiming she didn't know who Fuentes was, Greene said she went to the event to reach his young audience and to discuss ""American First"" policies. Last month, Fuentes was subpoenaed by the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. ABC News' Mariam Khan contributed to this report.",16
2022-03-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-capitol-police-officer-arrested-israel-working-advance/story?id=83188736,US Capitol police officer detained in Israel while working in advance of Nancy Pelosi trip,"A member of the U.S. Capitol Police Dignitary Protection Detail was detained in Israel last month after allegedly being intoxicated and getting into a fight while working in an advance role ahead of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to the Middle East, according to four sources familiar with the situation. This information was later confirmed by the U.S. Capitol Police in a statement to ABC News. The officer wasn't charged with a crime in the encounter. Typically, when someone is under protective detail, agents are sent to the location ahead of time to scout out secure locations for the protectee. The speaker and seven other Democratic lawmakers traveled to Israel while the House was out of session in February. ABC News does not know the name of the DPD agent. The detail member was hospitalized before being released and given a plane ticket back to the United States, according to two sources briefed on the incident. Capitol police told ABC News in a statement they would not be releasing the agent's name since he wasn't charged with a crime and it was a ""discipline/personnel matter."" However, the agency said they had been with the USCP since April 2018 and had worked three details for members of Congress. ""On February 14, a United States Capitol Police Dignitary Protection special agent was doing advance work for a Congressional Delegation in Israel when the agent was accused of having a physical altercation while the agent was believed to be under the influence of alcohol,"" Capitol police said in the statement. ""The agent was not charged by the Israeli National Police, however U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger immediately sent the agent home, revoked the agent’s police powers and suspended the agent pending the outcome of an internal investigation by the USCP’s Office of Professional Responsibility."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office declined to comment. U.S. Capitol Police have been under fire since the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection when a Senate report found Capitol police were underprepared for the riot. Since then they have implemented sweeping changes to the agency, including hiring a new police chief.",0
2022-03-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-trims-sails-fresh-bid-unity-analysis/story?id=83183281,Biden trims sails with fresh bid for 'unity': ANALYSIS,"It was barely 10 months ago that President Joe Biden walked into a similar setting in the House chamber -- with far fewer guests though far more masks -- to declare that the nation was ""ready for takeoff."" ""America is on the move again,"" Biden said marking the eve of his 100th day in office, ""turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength."" Peril, crises and setbacks have dominated the ensuing months -- alongside frustration, anger, drift and even dread. They converged to create the chaotic forces that surrounded Biden's first official State of the Union address. Biden's prescription Tuesday night was to go smaller -- not so much in terms of rhetoric, but in terms of achievable goals. Bold proposals for trillions in new spending were replaced by new inflation-controlling proposals, somewhat vague goals included in a ""unity agenda for the nation"" plus the promise that measures already passed will deliver bigger results. On the major world crisis of the moment, Biden sought to channel the measure of unity on the side of Ukraine into something bigger. He drew bipartisan applause as he outlined new steps aimed at isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin and those around him. ""American diplomacy matters,"" the president said. ""Putin was wrong. We are ready."" It was a speech crafted for a particular perilous moment, mindful of the challenges the nation is facing, and of the possible if not inevitable political blowback against the party in power. Even as Putin's forces advance on Kiev, the president warned that the current conflict in Ukraine will incur ""costs around the world"" -- including soaring gas prices. ""I know the news about what's happening can seem alarming to all Americans,"" Biden said. ""But I want you to know, we're going to be OK. We're going to be OK."" The president seemed to answer questions about whether Democrats should brag about their accomplishments with a definitive ""yes."" ""The American Rescue Plan helped working people -- and left no one behind,"" Biden said, drawing broad applause from Democrats and a few jeers from Republicans in the House chamber. ""And it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs."" But Biden didn't tout the ""Build Back Better"" plan that he spent much of last year trying in vain to get through Congress. Instead, he pleaded with Congress to pass smaller measures to promote innovation and competition, to raise taxes on corporate America and to control costs after what he acknowledged has been a ""punishing"" two years of the pandemic. ""My top priority is getting prices under control,"" Biden said. Notably, Biden rebuked some voices on the progressive left by declaring that ""we should all agree"" not to ""defund the police."" He drew Republican applause for that, along with his vow to both ""secure the border and fix the immigration system."" The major planks of Biden's ""unity agenda"" outlined Tuesday night are arguably as popular as they will be difficult to achieve. Ending the opioid crisis, supporting veterans, ending cancer ""as we know it,"" tackling mental health among children in particular -- all are noble goals that aren't the kinds of things that ever get completely done. In a similar vein, while Biden and virtually all attending were maskless in a full House chamber on Tuesday, he ushered in what he cast as a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. After memorably saying the nation was close to ""declaring our independence from a deadly virus"" last July 4, the president is now outlining new strategies that ""combat the virus as we do other diseases."" ""I know you're tired, frustrated and exhausted,"" he said. ""But I also know this. Because of the progress we've made, because of your resilience and the tools that we have been provided by this Congress, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines."" For their part, Republicans are leaving little mystery about how they plan to attack Biden and his fellow Democrats -- or how much they look forward to the midterm elections that are just eight months away. In the official GOP response, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds enumerated what she described as Biden failures, included pointed blame for the fact that many American children are not back to regular, learning in maskless environments. ""Instead of moving America forward, it feels like President Biden and his party have sent us back in time to the late '70s and early '80s,"" Reynolds said in a speech delivered in Des Moines. Politically, Biden limped into his State of the Union -- carrying an approval rating of just 37% in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, with Republicans holding a 50%-40% edge on the question of who should control Congress and three in four Americans viewing the economy in a negative light. In a moment that would seem to demand leadership, just 36% of Americans in the poll said they see him as a strong leader, while only 43% said he can be trusted in a crisis. With Democrats still in control of Congress, plus the broad unity engendered by the crisis in Ukraine, Biden's political woes seemed distant through much of Tuesday's night speech. But that fact was implicit through much of what the president outlined -- and chose not to address -- at his first State of the Union. Biden waited until the nearly the end of his speech to deliver the line most presidents employ -- ""the State of the Union is strong"" -- and then quickly offered a coda about why that is and what it means. ""Because you, the American people, are strong,"" Biden continued. ""We are stronger today than we were a year ago. And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.""",21
2022-03-02,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-refugees-face-humanitarian-crisis-advocates/story?id=83158186,"Ukrainian refugees may face humanitarian crisis, advocates say","Since Russia invaded Ukraine last week, an estimated 660,000 refugees have fled to other countries -- with the number only expected to grow. The UNHCR said in a statement Tuesday the conflict could lead to ""Europe's largest refugee crisis this century"" as displaced people pour into Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova. Non-profit organizations and other groups are warning many could wind up lacking access to basic health and medical needs including food, clean water, shelter, hygiene supplies and medication. And they say cases of communicable diseases, such as COVID-19 and polio, have the potential to grow along with gastrointestinal ailments. That's on top of trekking, on foot in cases, in the middle of winter in Eastern Europe. ""Fleeing your home is a last act of desperation,"" Chris Skopec, executive vice-president of global health at Project Hope, a humanitarian nonprofit organization providing assistance to Ukrainian refugees, told ABC News. ""All of your support networks are within your immediate community and, once you leave that, you excessively become more vulnerable to all kinds of things."" Refugees may not have access to food, water or sanitation Humanitarian groups say there are many health concerns for refugees fleeing the crisis in Ukraine. Although there are public transit buses, trains and taxis that have been taking people to border checkpoints, some refugees have had to reach checkpoints on foot. Additionally, stories have circulated Ukrainians waiting up to 60 hours at border crossings just to get into a neighboring country, Skopec said. ""If you have less than sanitary conditions, if you're walking on the road for days or sitting in your car, you don't have access maybe to clean drinking water or the ability to wash or access proper hygiene facilities,"" he said. ""Then you've got concerns about gastrointestinal diseases, which can lead to other health conditions and really overall weaken the body."" Refugees could also fall ill as they wait in long lines at the border in freezing temperatures. Temperatures usually don't go much higher than 38 degrees Fahrenheit and fall to the low 20s at night. ""We're talking about winter in central Europe,"" Dr. Andrea Barschdorf-Hager, CEO of Care Austria, a nonprofit also helping Ukrainian refugees, told ABC News. ""The weather conditions are hard and people are literally fleeing with just one winter jacket."" When Russia invaded, Ukraine was already dealing with two public health crises, the first linked to the COVID pandemic. Even while daily average COVID cases peaked at 37,000 last month, as data from Johns Hopkins University shows, less than 40% of Ukrainians aged 60 and older have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, according to the World Health Organization. The country has also been trying to beat back a polio outbreak since October 2021 due to low immunization rates. During that time frame, at least one child was identified with paralytic polio and 19 other children have been infected, but not paralyzed, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. People traveling in large groups without masks or social distancing, drinking contaminated water or coming in contact with an infected person could lead to surges of these diseases in the refugee population. ""When you have a large population in mass movement fleeing the country, you don't have the kind of personal protective equipment required to prevent the spread of infections,"" Skopec said. Right now, there are no reports that COVID-19 is spreading among the refugee population. 'Stress and anxiety' for those fleeing their homes There are mental health concerns for refugees as well. Skopec said one of the concerns is for those with chronic mental health conditions, who will be traveling without access to care or their medications. The other concern is broader and affects all those who are stressed due to fleeing. ""Everybody doing this is going through a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety,"" Skopec said. Barschdorf-Hagersaid said it will be important to provide psychosocial support to refugees when they cross the border. ""Not everyone is traumatized, but they have to digest what has happened,"" she said. ""We need to set up social workers for people who want to talk to a social worker. The refugees need help to integrate and some moments will haunt them for the rest of their lives. She continued, ""We are in a war situation and we have to make them feel welcome and let them know they have a safe space to stay, come and go."" Refugees need to be met with care packages and hygiene kits Skopec said Project Hope is currently deploying four different teams to Poland, Moldova, Romania and Ukraine, and focusing on the medical and health needs of refugees, including those who have not crossed into neighboring countries. ""So in Poland, we are simultaneously looking to get medical supplies into Ukraine to distribute to medical facilities while at the same time offering support to the Polish health authorities in terms of receiving refugees and making sure that they've got proper screening and proper basic care available for them,"" he said. Skopec added the organization has also put together interagency emergency kits, which are described by the WHO as being filled with medicines such as ibuprofen and morphine and medications to treat conditions including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and pulmonary diseases. Each kit can treat 30,000 people for one month and Project Hope has seven kits on standby whenever governments request them. Meanwhile, Barschdorf-Hagersaid said CARE Austria is working with its partner organization, People in Need, to supply care packages of clean water and food, including baby food, to refugees as well as hygiene kits. ""I don't know of any border where there are enough sanitation places. There are not enough toilets, not enough washing stalls,"" she said. ""So the kits include diapers for babies, sanitary pads for young girls and women and so on."" Barschdorf-Hagersaid also said the refugees need cash assistance so they can buy tickets to get their families living elsewhere in Europe or so they can buy things. ""Cash assistance is important to meet the needs of the moment because banks are not functioning in Ukraine,"" she said. ""It's really key that people get cash assistance.""",25
2022-03-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-bidens-1st-state-union/story?id=83183224,5 key takeaways from Biden's 1st State of the Union,"President Joe Biden's first State of the Union address looked very different Tuesday night than it would have a few weeks ago -- before Russia invaded Ukraine, inflation kept rising and coronavirus guidance dramatically shifted. From the war in Ukraine to rising prices at home, here's a look at the key takeaways from Biden's first State of the Union address to Congress. The president kicked off his speech with strong words of support for the Ukrainian people and their president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian,"" he said, ""their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, literally inspires the world. The president praised his strategy of standing in lockstep with Europe and NATO allies in imposing harsh sanctions on Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, arguing they solidified the NATO alliance and that the Russian president was now ""more isolated from the world than he has ever been."" ""Putin's latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked,"" Biden said. ""He rejected repeated -- repeated efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn't respond. He thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber, in this nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well. But Putin was wrong. We are ready."" The president also announced the U.S. would ban Russian airlines from American airspace, after Europe and Canada took similar steps Sunday. ""When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos,"" Biden said. First lady Jill Biden hosted Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, as a guest in her box. She received a standing ovation from Democrats and Republicans, many of whom wore the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag. The president devoted about one-fifth of his speech to Ukraine -- and received rare bipartisan applause for much of what he said -- a significant chunk in an address typically focused on partisan domestic issues. With low approval ratings for his handling of the economy – and inflation top of mind for Americans – Biden proclaimed: ""I get it."" ""Too many families are struggling to keep up with their bills,"" he said. ""Inflation is robbing them of gains they thought otherwise they would be able to feel."" He said his ""top priority is getting prices under control."" But many of his proposals will rely on a Congress that has been reluctant to pass much of his social spending proposals. Emphasizing the need to boost domestic manufacturing, Biden also called for some specific items that would have been part of his stalled ""Build Back Better"" plan: cutting the cost of prescription drugs, combating climate change in order to lower energy costs, lowering the cost of child care, and instituting free, universal pre-K, among other initiatives. He touted the nation's economic recovery but acknowledged that factories had closed, supply chains had been disrupted and prices had gone up. Biden said his ""plan to fight inflation"" was, ""Lower your costs, not your wages."" Biden acknowledged Americans were ""tired, frustrated and exhausted"" from the coronavirus pandemic -- but also signaled the U.S. was entering a new phase. ""We've reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, where severe cases are down to a level not seen since July of last year,"" he said. He announced his administration was launching a ""test-to-treat"" program where Americans who test positive for COVID at drugstores could then receive free antiviral pills to treat the virus. The president also said Americans would be able to order even more free rapid tests from COVIDTests.gov starting next week. He warned the U.S. must ""prepare for new variants"" -- and noted that scientists could ""deploy new vaccines within 100 days"" if necessary. ""Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 no longer need control our lives,"" Biden said. ""Last year, COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we're finally together again."" Few masks made appearances in the House of Representatives chamber where Biden spoke. Under new protocols announced Sunday, attendees did not have to wear face coverings. Biden did not don one like he did last year; attendance was also much more restricted in 2021. The president hobnobbed with members of Congress at close range in a scene reminiscent of pre-pandemic State of the Union events. All attendees had to show a negative PCR coronavirus test to gain admittance, and several Republicans boycotted the speech by refusing to test. But the testing did turn up at least four positive cases among lawmakers. Biden has made a quest for bipartisanship a hallmark of his presidency, and during his speech he proposed what he called ""a unity agenda for the nation."" In addition to listing a variety of proposals that would have been part of a larger ""Build Back Better"" bill that passed the House but stalled in the Senate because of opposition from Republicans and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va, he called for legislation to to invest in cancer research, support veterans, combat domestic violence and more. ""We can do these things,"" Biden said. ""It's within our power.""",21
2022-03-03,https://abcnews.go.com/International/fighting-ukraines-nuclear-plants-raises-global-concerns/story?id=83211363,Fighting around Ukraine's nuclear plants raises global concerns,"As skirmishes broke out around Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, heated words were exchanged Wednesday during a meeting of the United Nations Environment Program between representatives of the warring countries, and a U.N. nuclear watchdog group warned the ""unprecedented"" nature of the fighting could lead to ""severe consequences."" With worries already at an alarming level over Russian President Vladimir Putin putting his nuclear forces on high alert, a battle being waged in Ukraine for Europe's largest nuclear power plant is upping the anxiety over a possible calamity that would likely wreak havoc far beyond the boundaries of the war zone. During a closing session with representatives of the U.N. Environment Program in Nairobi, delegates were given a chance to give final words and a Ukrainian representative took the opportunity to make a strong statement about what was happening in his country. ""Barbarians who pretended to be rescuers, right now attack our cities, destroy infrastructure, kill my fellow citizens and try to destroy everything,"" Andrii Pravendnyk, Ukraine's ambassador and permanent representative to the UNEP, told delegates. Andrii Pravendnyk said Russian troops are trying to seize the country's nuclear power plants, adding, ""Russia is conducting genocide against humanity."" ""They say they've come to save Ukraine, but they are here to destroy my beautiful country,"" said Pravendnyk, who received a standing ovation at the end of his remarks. Dmitry Maximychev, Russia's ambassador and permanent representative to the UNEP, responded that Ukraine's military forces have been attacking so-called pro-Russian ""separatists"" in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine for eight years without any protest from the international community. ""The war, which led to the death of 12,000 people in the east of the country, killed by the hands of Ukraine soldiers and neo-Nazi units,"" the Maximychev told the assembly, espousing claims the U.S. and its Western allies say are false and were concocted by the Kremlin as an excuse to invade Ukraine. ""You have just supported them, distinguished delegates. It's them that you were offering your ovation. We didn't begin that war,"" Maximychev said. Fighting continued Wednesday at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in Enerhodar, Ukraine, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, both sides claimed. The battle over the Zaporizhzhia plant prompted the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog group, to issue a warning over the ""unprecedented"" nature of this situation. Rafael Grossi, director-general of the IAEA, said he and members of the agency are ""gravely concerned"" that a military conflict is happening for the first time amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power program. During an emergency IAEA board of governors meeting, Grossi said an incident affecting nuclear facilities ""could have severe consequences, aggravating human suffering and causing environmental harm"" beyond Ukraine's borders. He said Russia informed the agency Tuesday that it had taken control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant, but ABC News has not been able to independently confirm the report. Last week, Russia seized control of the Chernobyl power plant, now shut down and sealed with a containment dome after an infamous disaster in April 1986. Ukraine's nuclear regulatory agency SNRIU has requested ""immediate assistance"" from the IAEA to ensure the safety of Chernobyl and other nuclear facilities, Grossi said. He said the IAEA is assessing the request. ""Despite the extraordinary circumstances of an armed conflict causing increasing challenges and dangers, Ukraine's nuclear power plants are operating normally,"" Grossi said. ""But while we may use expressions like 'normal operations' in a technical context, I want to emphasize there is nothing normal about the circumstances under which the professionals at Ukraine's four nuclear power plants are managing to keep the reactors that produce half of Ukraine's electricity working.""",10
2022-03-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-sees-internal-divides-broader-trump-note/story?id=83212895,GOP sees internal divides broader than Trump: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It is possible, in theory, to tell a story about Republican Party angst that does not center on former President Donald Trump. Overshadowed in a week about the unfolding crisis in Ukraine and the State of the Union address is a separate storyline about divisions inside the GOP ranks that aren't specifically about Trump -- or at least aren't exclusively about him. The last few days have featured high-profile examples of elected Republicans earning themselves new rebukes and condemnations from leaders of their own party, including after several attended a white nationalist conference. Then came the ugly incident during President Joe Biden's speech Tuesday night, where Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., heckled Biden during a portion of the speech where he talked about the death of his son. (Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was spotted on camera nearby appearing to say ""shut up."") Earlier that same day, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell shredded an election-year agenda offered last week by the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. ""We will not have as part of my agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years,"" McConnell said, pointedly reinforcing talking points that Democrats have developed about Scott's plan. And Wednesday night, it was three Republicans who kept the House from voting unanimously to approve a non-binding resolution expressing support for the people of Ukraine. Much of the debate about the future of the Republican Party continues to be about Trump. But just beneath the surface, there's a potentially more important series of debates happening about what the party should be and be like next. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Democrats have always pledged to move quickly on the confirmation of Biden's Supreme Court pick Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, and now the dates are set for hearings. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced that hearings for Jackson will start March 21 and conclude March 24. The dates set are on pace make Jackson's confirmation the second fastest on record, after Justice Amy Coney Barrett. There were 30 days between Barrett's announcement and her confirmation. In a letter to colleagues, Durbin wrote of his desire for ""respectful and dignified hearings"" -- a hope that is likely more wishful thinking than a probability given the current contours of this deeply divided Senate. Jackson will face a familiar cast of characters as she prepares for the fourth set of confirmation hearings. Her last confirmation was in June 2021. Among the GOP members, and the one of the most inflammatory voices on the committee, is Jackson's law school classmate Sen. Ted Cruz, who said that Biden's pledge to nominate a Black woman to the court is ""offensive"" and a ""discriminatory quota."" He voted no on Jackson during her last confirmation process. Democrats, by way of Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote, can confirm Jackson without a single Republican vote. Jackson was on Capitol Hill Wednesday and met with Sens. Chuck Schumer, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley and Durbin. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' Wednesday event aimed to announce a multimillion-dollar investment in cybersecurity education, but it was quickly overshadowed by the governor's own actions toward a group of masked students standing near his lectern. ""You do not have to wear those masks. Please take them off. Honestly, it's not doing anything. And we've got to stop with this COVID theater. If you want to wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous,"" DeSantis told the students before turning away and shaking his head. Over the course of the last year, DeSantis has firmly rejected the implementation of mask mandates, signaling an unwavering stance in the ongoing culture war over pandemic restrictions. The governor's actions included signing an executive order that threatened to withhold funding from schools that implemented such measures, and last month DeSantis voiced support for parents to be able to sue school districts over mask mandates. As reported by ABC News, the American Academy of Pediatrics recently asked for empathy from leaders and communities about students' and families' individual choices despite changing CDC guidelines regarding masking protocols. ""We encourage each family to make a plan that works best for them, while also modeling empathy and discouraging bullying of any child who chooses to mask to protect themselves and their family even when not required to do so,"" said AAP President Moira Szilagyi in a statement.

As FiveThirtyEight's Maggie Koerth writes, it's not that kids have lost ground during the pandemic, they're just not progressing as fast, and this is especially true of Black, Hispanic and American Indian and Alaskan Native students.

2022-03-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/amid-war-ukraine-us-marine-detained-russia-faces/story?id=83227483,"Amid war in Ukraine, US Marine detained by Russia faces urgent health needs","Trevor Reed's fate hangs in the balance amid sky-high tensions between the U.S. and Russia, where the 30-year old former U.S. Marine has been detained on trumped up charges for over two and a half years. But now, amid a stalled push to secure his release, Reed's health is dangerously deteriorating, according to his family, with fears that he may have contracted tuberculosis in the remote penal colony where he's been held without direct communication with his family for nearly eight months now. ""We are desperately worried about Trevor's health -- our son is out of time, and the [Biden] Administration needs to act now,"" Joey and Paula Reed said in a statement Thursday. Reed had a close-contact exposure to tuberculosis in December, and he told an attorney who visited Wednesday that he coughs up blood several times a day, experiences pain in his lungs, and believes he has a fever, the Reed family said. Russian authorities have declined to give him a tuberculosis test or access to medicine, phone calls to his family, or even written communications with his attorneys in recent weeks, they added. Reed and another former Marine, Paul Whelan, have spent years in Russian custody now on charges that their families and American officials say were fabricated by Russia in order to seize them as bargaining chips. ""For several months now, we have been asking for a meeting with our President. Our son's job in the Marines was to take a bullet for then-VP Biden, and Trevor is now worried he's been left behind by the government he's spent his whole adult life serving,"" Joey and Paula Reed said. Pleading with President Joe Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden, they added, ""From one set of military parents to another -- we need your help. Only you can save his life!"" Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin discussed the two Americans' detention and the possibility of a prisoner swap to free them at their summit in Switzerland last June, but a deal never materialized. In July, one month after that that summit, Reed was moved to a prison camp in Mordovia, a region about 350 miles from Moscow. Whelan has spent over a year and a half in a camp in the same region. Reed fell into the hands of Russian police in the summer of 2019 following a drunken party in Moscow where he was visiting his girlfriend. Police initially said they were taking him to sober up at a station, but after agents from Russia's FSB intelligence agency arrived to question him, Reed was charged with assaulting a police officer, according to his family. He was put on trial on charges that U.S. officials have said were absurd. A court in July 2020 sentenced Reed to nine years in prison. Reed, whose family lives in Texas, spent nearly two years in detention in pre-trial jails in Moscow. But last June, a court rejected his appeal, clearing the way for him to be moved to a prison camp. That's around the last time they heard directly from their son, the family said. ""We told him to stay strong -- we're going to fight for him,"" Paula Reed said last week during a press conference, her voice filling with emotion. The Biden administration has said freeing Reed and Whelan is a priority, and U.S. ambassador to Russia John Sullivan has visited both Reed and Whelan in Mordovia twice, driving eight hours from Moscow in an armored vehicle to meet both men and report back to their families. As U.S. and Western sanctions on Russia have ramped up, the Reed's have grown concerned that any hope to negotiating his release is fading. Calls to sever diplomatic relations in particular could make it hard for the family to even learn about Trevor's condition, they said. ""We need to leave those embassies in those countries because we need to have direct chains of communications,"" Joey Reed said during a press conference last week. Whelan, 51, was security executive for the auto parts company BorgWarner when he was arrested in late December 2018 in his hotel room by FSB agents while visiting Moscow for a friend's wedding. He was accused of espionage and sentenced to 16 years in prison in a closed trial on charges his family and U.S. officials have said were fabricated. From early in their detention, Russia has suggested trading Reed and Whelan for Russians serving prison sentences in the United States. Since 2019, Russian officials have named several Russians they would like to see released, including Viktor Bout, one of the world's most notorious arms dealers, and Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot jailed on drug smuggling charges. Russia state media has more recently highlighted another Russian citizen jailed in the U.S., Roman Seleznev, who is serving a 27-year sentence on criminal hacking charges. Bout's release has been seen as a non-starter for American officials because of the severity of his crimes. But Yaroshenko and Seleznev are seen as more likely to be included in any trade. Yaroshenko was arrested in a 2010 Drug Enforcement Administration sting in Liberia during which he agreed to ship cocaine to Africa and the U.S. He is serving a 20-year sentence. Seleznev was captured by U.S. law enforcement agents in Maldives in 2014 and convicted of running a massive hacking scheme to steal credit card data from small businesses in the U.S. All three men are suspected to have links to Russian intelligence. During Seleznev's trial, prosecutors provided documents alleging that Seleznev was tipped off to an earlier FBI investigation against him by Russia's Federal Security Service or FSB, after FBI agents met with the Russian agency.",2
2022-03-03,https://abcnews.go.com/International/mental-health-effects-ukraine-war-zone-children/story?id=83203801,Mental health effects of Ukraine war zone on children,"As the Russian invasion of Ukraine intensifies, children are experiencing devastating consequences of being caught up in the war zone. At least seven children have been killed, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and several more have been injured during air strikes and blasts. Dozens of children are hiding in bomb shelters, basements, metro stations and other underground areas while others have fled their homes for neighboring countries. Psychologists and other experts say there are also mental health concerns these children face and that it's important they have as much structure as possible to keep a sense of stability in their lives. And adults can better provide for their children by taking care of their own mental health needs. ""Children are extremely vulnerable to insecurity, not only the physical trauma but the psychological trauma, and it can reverberate and have repercussions for a long time,"" Dr. Paul Wise, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University, told ABC News. Mental health risks for children in war zones There are physical risks for children that come with living in war zones, such as breathing in smoke and ash from fires and blasts that can affect the nose and lungs. But there are also mental health risks. Studies have shown that children and families living in or fleeing war regions have an increased risk of suffering from mental health problems. ""We've seen past war situations like what is happening in Ukraine, an increase in depression, anxiety,"" Dr. Monica Barreto, a clinical psychologist at Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children, told ABC News. And while not all children will be traumatized, they may react differently to the traumatic situations they're witnessing. ""Some children may be more agitated, they may be harder to calm down, just more unsettled,"" said Dr. Jack Shonkoff, director for the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University. ""Some children in these circumstances tend to be more withdrawn, they're not crying as much, they're not demanding much attention."" He continued, ""Sometimes people might look at that and say, 'This child is managing pretty well.' Sometimes that's a sign of the things to worry about the most because these children are withdrawing, they're internalizing a lot of what's going on."" Taking care of adults' needs helps children Shonkoff, who is also a professor of child health and development, said one way to ensure a good outcome for children in a war zone is by making sure the adults are being taken care of too. ""The most important factor that determines how children are going to basically survive and go forward after a war experience is the nature of the adults who are caring for them,"" he said. ""If the parents and the caregivers are significantly traumatized, they can't provide that sense of support. The adults' needs become critically important to protect the children."" He likens it to a safety presentation on a flight, when flight attendants tell passengers to secure their own oxygen masks before helping others. ""That's not a way of saying you're more important than your child. It's a way of saying if you pass out, your child won't be OK,"" Shonkoff said. As for babies, he explained they are highly attuned to what's going on and if adults are not engaging with them, it can hurt the babies' development. ""If the parent is so traumatized or depressed, they can't coo back, can't smile back. That signals danger to the brain even though the baby doesn't know what's going on. That can create excessive stress in the body, raise inflammation and blood pressure levels,"" Shonkoff said. Wise adds that children look to adults not only for protection but also for how frightened they should be and ""for understanding what's happening to them in a time of profound insecurity, and children will feel the best protected with a strong, coherent community life and family life."" Children need as much as structure as possible The experts say it's important to make sure that children are provided structure as much as possible while living in war zones to help with their development and well-being. Barreto mentioned videos she's seen online of Ukrainian families in bunkers trying to provide play and teachers trying to teach lessons. ""Children are no longer in school, they're no longer in a safe environment,"" she said. ""Maintaining some of that structure can be very helpful and protective during these times."" Barreto added that the same recommendations apply for children in refugee camps, making sure they are set up with their families and that some time is provided so they can experience ""normality"" whether that is playtime or having lessons.",7
2022-03-03,https://abcnews.go.com/International/anna-netrebko-metropolitan-opera/story?id=83230315,Anna Netrebko is out at the Metropolitan Opera,"After a chaotic week, Russian soprano Anna Netrebko has withdrawn from performances at New York City's Metropolitan Opera House. ""It is a great artistic loss for the Met and for opera,"" Met Opera general manager Peter Gelb said in a statement Thursday. ""Anna is one of the greatest singers in Met history, but with Putin killing innocent victims in Ukraine, there was no way forward."" On Sunday, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Gelb posted a message to the Met's social media saying, ""We can no longer engage with artists or institutions that support Putin or are supported by him -- not until the invasion and killing has been stopped, order has been restored and restitutions have been made."" The statement was met with confusion from some specifically because Netrebko -- who has previously voiced support for Putin and in 2014 supported the arts in the separatist region of Ukraine -- has become a widely recognized face of the Met over the last two decades, including opening the season several years in a row. She was set to perform in the Met's ""Turandot"" later in the spring and was scheduled to perform in the 2022-23 season, which the Met announced Feb. 23. The Met's message now that she has been withdrawn from performances after ""not complying with the Met's condition that she repudiate her public support for Vladimir Putin while he wages war on Ukraine,"" is sending loud reverberations through the industry. In a series of Instagram posts over the weekend, Netrebko called for peace and voiced her opposition to the war, but did not mention Putin. ""Forcing artists, or any public figure, to voice their political opinions in public and to denounce their homeland is not right. This should be a free choice. Like many of my colleagues, I am not a political person. I am not an expert in politics. I am an artist and my purpose is to unite people across political divides,"" she wrote on an Instagram post Saturday. She went on to say in an Instagram story, ""It's especially despicable from people from the West, seated comfortable in their home, not fearing for their lives, to pretend to be brave and pretending to 'fight' by putting in trouble artists who asked nothing."" Netrebko's Instagram, where she has over 750,000 followers, was later set to private. Netrebko's withdrawal from the Met, which includes the ""Turandot"" this spring as well as a ""Don Carlo"" in the next season, comes as Russian conductor Valery Gergiev faces similar career impacts from the invasion. He was replaced in a series of Vienna Philharmonic concerts at New York City's Carnegie Hall last week and fired as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after also refusing to denounce Putin. The two -- who are among the most globally famous classical artists currently performing -- have faced, and stand to face, further repercussions as the opera and classical industry take stands against the Russian invasion. Polish tenor Piotr Beczała, Latvian mezzo Elīna Garanča and Georgian mezzo Anita Rachvelishvili all announced they would not be performing in Russia, with Rachvelishvili calling Putin a ""dictator"" who ""is killing our people."" ""I am not a politician and I have no influence on political decisions. But I am an artist and I can use my voice to express my opposition to the war that takes place just across the border of my beloved motherland,"" Beczała wrote. Russian American conductor Lidiya Yankovskaya, music director of the Chicago Opera Theater, wrote on Twitter that she was ""terrified for all my family and friends in Ukraine, where I spent so many happy summers as a child."" Finnish soprano Karita Mattila also took to Twitter with a memory: ""I refused to perform with (Maestro) Gergiev in 2014 at Carnegie Hall concert because he publicly supported Russian invasion of Crimea. I wanted to show solidarity towards my Ukrainian colleagues. My action had long lasting consequences: I received threats."" Netrebko has brushed controversy before, both with her 2014 actions and with her opinions on skin-darkening makeup. Gelb told The New York Times it's ""hard to imagine a scenario in which (Netrebko) will return to the Met,"" a stunning remark given her staying power at the house that made her an international star. The Met on Monday opened its first opera after a scheduled monthlong break with a performance of the Ukrainian national anthem. For the springtime ""Turandot,"" Netrebko will be replaced by Liudmyla Monastyrska -- a Ukrainian soprano.",1
2022-03-04,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-tennis-star-sergiy-stakhovsky-returns-country-fight/story?id=83232189,Ukrainian tennis star Sergiy Stakhovsky returns to his country to fight Russia,"Ukrainian tennis star Sergiy Stakhovsky is known for representing his nation on the court, but now he's preparing to do the same on the battlefield. ""I just had this strong feeling that I have to do it,"" Stakhovsky said in an interview on ABC News Live on Thursday. Stakhovsky was vacationing with his family in Dubai when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Almost immediately, he made the tough decision to say goodbye to his wife and children to defend their country. He's become a member of the army reservists, helping to protect Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. ""I didn't really say goodbye to the kids. I just kissed them goodbye, and I said that I'll be right back. They were watching cartoons and reading books, not really paying attention,"" Stakhovsky said, explaining they were unaware of why their father was leaving their trip early. Stakhovsky said leaving his wife was more difficult because as soon as the war started, she was able to tell he wanted to leave and fight. ""We didn't have an open discussion about it. But she had that feeling and I just didn't want to bring up the topic way too early, too, we were on vacation. Right now, it's something she understands and she accepted. And I hope I'll have a chance to ask for forgiveness in person,"" said Stakhovsky. Leaving loved ones to fight for Ukraine is a scene thousands have been forced to face over the last eight days. While women and children fleeing the nation have been able to cross the border and find safety in neighboring countries, men ages 18 to 60 have had to pick up a weapon and fight. Because Stakhovsky was on vacation and already outside the country, he could have stayed back with his family. But he said he thought of his brother, father and the other people fighting for freedom and made the decision to drive back home, into a war zone. Stakhovsky said it was ""one of the toughest decisions"" he's made with no obvious right answer. He feels guilty for leaving his family, but, he said, ""If I stayed I would have felt guilt that I left my father and brother in Ukraine."" ""Crossing the border was a tough choice because I knew that's the point where, you know, you don't go back,"" he said. ""But by driving through Ukraine, driving through the country, seeing all the people coming into groups, doing their own resistance units with hunting guns, barricading the roads, it's really inspirational."" Stakhovsky retired from professional tennis at the Australian Open in January. He won four career singles titles and four doubles titles and had a career-high singles ranking of No. 31 in the world in 2010. Now, he's learning to use military weapons to protect a nation under attack. ""I feel I am not prepared enough, that's for sure. But I guess no one is prepared enough,"" Stakhovsky said, talking on Zoom while hunkering down with fellow soldiers in Kyiv. He said having Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zeleskyy ""willing to go the distance and willing to risk his life staying in the capital while being surrounded by troops of Russia"" is helping push him and the other reservationists forward. He believes his troop is the last to join the reserves and they hope they don't have to fight, but if the moment comes, he said he's ready to do whatever it takes to help protect the freedom of Ukrainians.",7
2022-03-04,https://abcnews.go.com/International/war-pandemic-experts-warn-perfect-storm/story?id=83227639,A war during a pandemic: experts warn of a perfect storm,"In the midst of an ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, public health experts are now warning that the COVID-19 pandemic could soon accelerate in the region. While medical care for casualties of war is now the first priority, experts say the crisis could accelerate the spread of infectious disease, including COVID-19 -- especially as a growing number of Ukrainians are displaced and forced in cramped, fraught situations. Ukraine was already struggling with the pandemic before the war started, with the highly transmissible omicron variant causing a surge in cases. In the past four weeks alone, Ukraine reported more than 900,000 COVID-19 cases, more than one-fifth of total cases from the entire pandemic. Only 35% of Ukrainians are fully vaccinated. ""Migration and congregation of populations is likely to significantly contribute to disease spread, especially given the current surge of the highly transmissible omicron variant,"" said John Brownstein, PhD, epidemiologist, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and ABC News contributor. WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned Wednesday there's likely to be significant undetected transmissions. Tarik Jasarevic, WHO spokesperson, told ABC News Live, ""We will probably see less of testing, less of sequencing, less of a heavily epidemiological picture of COVID-19."" Should the COVID-19 crisis escalate, experts also worry about the capacity to plan ahead and treat sick patients. ""Our ability to respond will be hampered by the lack of testing and surveillance, which means that we are likely to be flying blind as to the impact of the virus for weeks to come,"" Brownstein said. The WHO has warned of a critical oxygen shortage, with three major oxygen plants in the country now closed. ""We have to really understand this population is already vulnerable,"" Jasarevic said, noting the health system has been overstretched through the pandemic. The WHO has sent its first shipment of supplies to neighboring Poland, including 40 tons of supplies for trauma care and emergency surgery. ""It's really important that we do our best to support those heroic health workers who are risking their lives just by going to work and they are under immense personal pressure as well because they are also affected their families in conflict zones,"" Jasarevic said. ABC News' Arielle Mitropoulos and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.",25
2022-03-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-energy-debate-puts-squeeze-white-house-note/story?id=83232647,Russia energy debate puts squeeze on White House: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The bipartisanship breaking out after Russia's invasion of Ukraine is extending perhaps a little too far for immediate White House comfort. A bipartisan group of senators -- extending across a true ideological spectrum -- is pushing a new bill that would halt Russian energy imports. They are arguing that with Russian President Vladimir Putin using ""energy as a weapon of war,"" the U.S. should be acting in like it -- in ways that hurt Putin more than boycotts of vodka or caviar. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are leading the effort. Other Democrats involved include Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly; Republican names attached include South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Montana Sen. Steve Daines. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is signaling an openness to the bill, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to like the concept as well: ""I'm all for that -- ban it. Ban the oil coming from Russia,"" she told reporters Thursday. The White House, though, isn't ready to go there. Press secretary Jen Psaki said sanctioning Russian gas and oil could cause a shortage that is counter to U.S. strategic interests, warning that it ""would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people."" Banning Russian imports might also increase pressure to expand domestic energy production. That's a major concern in the environmental community, with progressives worried that the current crisis could force backsliding on climate goals. The current conflict involving an old foe is forcing a new twist in a familiar debate over energy policy. The crisis brings opportunities -- a chance, even, to bring Manchin back into negotiations with the White House -- but also real risks to the relative unity of the moment. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper With Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey's announcement that he will not run for Senate, Republicans aiming to recruit moderate governors to run as Senate candidates have been dealt another blow. ""If you're going to run for public office, you have to really want the job,"" Ducey wrote in a letter to donors. ""Right now I have the job I want, and my intention is to close my years of service to Arizona with a very productive final legislative session."" Questions had long surrounded Ducey over whether he would launch a challenge to Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., who is widely considered vulnerable this midterm election cycle. Ducey isn't the first popular GOP governor to reject a 2022 Senate bid despite the urging of prominent Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee. In February, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced he wouldn't run against Democratic incumbent Sen. Chris Van Hollen. In November, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu announced he wouldn't challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan. ""Arizona voters have excellent candidates to choose from in the Republican primary, and the NRSC is confident any of these outstanding candidates can beat Mark Kelly in November,"" said National Republican Senatorial Committee press secretary Katharine Cooksey in a statement to ABC News. Former President Donald Trump's influence could loom large in this race. Trump repeatedly lambasted Ducey and hasn't made an endorsement in the Arizona Senate race. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema In a sign of what is likely to come on the 2022 campaign trail, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is digging in on his anti-masking rhetoric, capitalizing on a viral moment from his Wednesday cybersecurity education event when he told a group of students to take off their masks, calling it ""COVID theater."" As of Thursday, DeSantis launched a fundraising effort based on the coverage of his interaction with the students. In an email to supporters, the governor alleged he is being targeted by the media, and in the same breath took a swipe at Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor in Georgia. Last month, Abrams faced backlash for posing for a photo maskless while surrounded by masked schoolchildren. DeSantis also released an ad featured on his social media with a mashup of images from this week's State of the Union address during which no lawmakers were masked. Although members on both sides of the aisle went maskless, the Florida governor's ad specifically took aim at prominent Democrats in Washington, as well as in other states. The ad closes with a clip of DeSantis saying ""Florida led when it counted"" in an apparent reference to his aversion to imposing mask mandates on his home state throughout the pandemic. As Americans adjust to yet another version of ""the new normal,"" the rhetoric espoused by the incumbent governor serves as a preface to his likely future challenges aimed at Democratic gubernatorial contenders who will have to defend precautions no longer in place in much of the country. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 58. That's the percentage of Americans who said Russia's invasion matters a lot to the interests of the U.S. in a recent YouGov/CBS News poll.

2022-03-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/graham-faces-backlash-suggesting-assassinate-putin/story?id=83252288,Graham faces backlash for suggesting someone should assassinate Putin,"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham was swiftly rebuked by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for remarks he made suggesting that Russians with access to President Vladimir Putin should assassinate him. ""Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military? The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out. You would be doing your country - and the world - a great service,"" Graham tweeted Thursday evening. ""Unless you want to live in darkness for the rest of your life, be isolated from the rest of the world in abject poverty, and live in darkness you need to step up to the plate. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted, ""I really wish our members of Congress would cool it and regulate their remarks as the administration works to avoid WWIII. As the world pays attention to how the US and its leaders are responding, Lindsey's remarks and remarks made by some House members aren't helpful."" But some of Graham's fellow Republicans were equally miffed by his comments. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz called Graham's suggestion an ""exceptionally bad idea"". ""Use massive economic sanctions; BOYCOTT Russian oil & gas; and provide military aid so the Ukrainians can defend themselves,"" Cruz tweeted. ""But we should not be calling for the assassination of heads of state."" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., known for her frequently controversial positions on Twitter, also rebuked Graham, calling his position ""irresponsible, dangerous & unhinged."" ""We need leaders with calm minds & steady wisdom. Not blood thirsty warmongering politicians trying to tweet tough by demanding assassinations,"" Greene tweeted. ""Americans don't want war."" The administration has imposed a series of sanctions on Russia aimed at chocking their economy. Some lawmakers have called for the Biden White House to go even further, urging additional sanctions and a ban on Russian oil imports to the United States. But Graham's call, which he repeated on Fox News last night, are far beyond what other lawmakers have sought. Asked about Graham calling for Putin's assassination, the White House said that wasn't the U.S. government's position. ""That is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you'd hear from- - come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. Later, she added, ""We are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or regime change. That is not the policy of the United States."" The White House earlier this week stopped short of even calling for Putin's ouster. During an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday, co-anchor George Stephanopoulos pressed Vice President Kamala Harris on what the United States hopes is the end game for Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. ""What is the best possible outcome here? Does the United States want the Russian people and Putin's fellow oligarchs to rise up and depose him?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""Well, what we want is that he will leave Ukraine. What we want is that the Ukrainian people will be free and that they will be safe,"" Harris said, stopping short of calling for Putin to be removed from power. Graham has been a vocal critic of Putin for years, and has in recent weeks called on the administration to impose harsher sanctions of the Russian leader, his oligarchs, and his exports. On Thursday, Graham led a bipartisan group of senators in introducing a resolution encouraging the investigation of Russia for war crimes abuses in Ukraine.",7
2022-03-04,https://abcnews.go.com/International/memes-weapons-ukraine-russia-conflict/story?id=83184578,Memes become weapons in Ukraine-Russia conflict,"Typically used for fun on social media, memes out of Ukraine are serious business amid Russia's attack. In fact, history and media experts who spoke with ABC News said the social media posts about Ukraine's resistance against Russian forces are war tools. Jennifer Grygiel, an associate professor of communications at Syracuse University who specializes in social media and memes, told ABC News that social media campaigns, undertaken by big governments or grassroots groups, are critical in gaining worldwide support. ""That's how warfare is conducted in the information space. It's about narratives and public belief,"" Grygiel said. As social media warfare heats up, Grygiel and other experts say the world needs to be on high alert and prevent spreading false information. U.S. and European officials also say the Russian government began using social media videos in the last couple of months to plant false flag stories that bolster Putin's claims that his invasion is legitimate. In one video posted in February, Russian-backed separatists claimed they were ordering an ""immediate evacuation"" to Russia because of unrest in Ukraine. But metadata embedded in the video files showed they had been created two days earlier, according to Western intelligence officials. V.S. Subrahmanian, a faculty fellow at Northwestern University's Buffett Institute for Global Affairs and cybersecurity expert, told ABC News that these tactics aren't new. He said during World War II, Western and Nazi forces would airdrop leaflets onto the battlefield and in towns to promote their respective country and to intimidate the enemy. ""What's happening today is these leaflets are now tweets, or Facebook posts or posts on TikTok and they are sowing the disinformation campaign long before any invasion tactics, "" Subrahmanian said. The biggest difference in this tactic, according to Subrahmanian, is that years of Russian government disinformation campaigns have added up and the world is not taking the bait. And it may have spurred Ukrainians to take back that online narrative. Since the invasion began, there have been viral posts from social media users in the country that have highlighted the Ukrainians' resolve. In addition to publishing photos and videos of resistance forces taking down Russian troops and tanks, social media users are also promoting the acts of civilians. ""The most important mission of any warfare is success on the ground,"" Daniel Johnson, a Roy H. Park Fellow at UNC Hussman's School of Journalism and former U.S. Army journalist told ABC News. ""Russia is running into the issue where they are fighting battles that they thought it would be winning. So when they put out messages saying they're winning, people around the world know it's false."" Johnson said the U.S. Army and other military units are tasked with putting out the social media from the front lines, but what makes the situation interesting in Ukraine is that the posts are coming from civilians voluntarily. This is their form of nationalistic pride and duty, he said. ""In previous wars, we'd have people help with giving supplies or letters. Now you have a video post,"" he said. Johnson said that the Ukrainian social media posts are keeping the Russian disinformation campaign at bay as Ukrainian victories posted online have been livestreamed and captured by multiple users from different angles. ""It's hard to lie when I have 150 videos showing that you're not in Kyiv and you're not winning,"" he said. Some of the posts are getting more attention. In one video, a group of Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island in the Black Sea were seen responding to a Russian warship's threats of a bombing by telling the ship's crew to ""go (expletive) yourself."" In another post, a Ukrainian woman is seen scolding a Russian soldier, telling him to ""put sunflower seeds in your pocket so they grow when you die."" The ongoing stories of the Ukrainian fighter pilot nicknamed ""the Ghost of Kyiv,"" have also been trending, for their reported successful airstrikes against Russian forces. Military experts haven't been able to confirm if the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" is a real person. Johnson said these figures, real or not, play an important role in boosting the resistance's spirits and have done so in the past with examples like ""Rosie the Riveter."" ""Legends have a morale power,"" he said. ""It's what they represent more than anything."" Grygiel said one of the most important effects of Ukrainian social media and memes is showing the world how devastating Russian attacks are on the populace and cities. For many people around the world, this is their first taste of the atrocities of war in real time, Grygiel said. ""There is something human about seeing who you're about to harm,"" they said. Grygiel and the other experts said there will be a greater emphasis on media and Internet messaging campaigns during the current conflict and future international wars. Meta, Facebook's parent company, announced this week that it had shut down accounts that spread misinformation about Ukraine. Governments and social media companies need to go further and keep an eye on the content that they're promoting Grygiel said. ""When it comes to propaganda and disinformation there is no limit,"" Grygiel said. ABC News' Jesse Convertino contributed to this report.",27
2022-03-04,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-woman-forced-cancel-wedding-leave-fianc-amid/story?id=83254302,Ukrainian woman forced to cancel wedding and leave fiancé behind amid Russian invasion,"Anastasiia Novitska was supposed to be wearing a lace wedding dress last week, surrounded by family and friends, while she exchanged vows with her future husband. She was instead forced to cancel the wedding and leave her fiancé behind as Russia invaded Ukraine. “Basically, my life was destroyed just in one single night,” Novitska told ABC News Live in an interview on Friday. “We were getting everything ready for the wedding, we already started decorating the hall, all of the guests were booked, some of them were already in the city waiting for the wedding day and when I woke up early in the morning, I realized unfortunately, it’s no longer going to happen.” The Russian invasion was a shock to Novitska, just like most of Ukrainians. She described the second day of the invasion, when her neighborhood was beginning to come under attack. “I thought that everything would be safe in my city. But then on the second day of the war, on the 25th of February, while I was asleep I heard that bombs were attacking the airport next to me,” she recalled. “The attack was so hard that all of us were awake just in two seconds, we went into the underground, but thank God everyone was safe.” She then made the tough but necessary decision to leave her home and entire life behind to find safety in Poland. Her fiancé stayed behind to fight in the war. The United Nations says over one million people have fled from Ukraine sight the fighting began. More than half of those refugees have fled to Poland, the U.N. says. “I had to leave everything I had in my country, I had to leave my fiancé, I had to leave my relatives, my friends,” Novitska said. “When I walked into my room to say bye to my dress, which was hanging next to the wardrobe, I started crying because God knows when I will wear it again and if I will see those people who I left in my house.” Novitska said she’s still in contact with her fiancé, and that he has called and texted her every day since they’ve been separated. “At the moment he’s helping the volunteers to gather the clothes, food, water, and all needed stuff for our soldiers,” she said. “He’s going to build the barracks to save the city in case tanks and soldiers come in. Hopefully, he will be safe, and I will see him again and he will stay alive,” Novitska added, while holding back tears. While speaking with ABC News Live, a loud alarm that sounded like a siren began to go off on her phone. It was an alert from her hometown. “They are having air bombs attacking,” she explained. “This was an alarm to go to the underground. There is a possibility bombs will come into our city. To be safe, it rings on my phone and radio to force all the people currently outside on in the house or in the flats to go immediately underground.” Although she’s safe in Poland now, that’s one way she’s able to keep track of what’s happening back home. Novitska said she hopes one day soon she will be reunited with her loved ones and be able to have the wedding she was forced to say goodbye to last week. “I’m still hoping the next day that I will hear the magic words that the war has finished and that I can return back and start planning my completely new life,” said Novitska. “I know that everyone is praying for this, but we’re just hoping for better.”",22

Marco Rubio, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine amid Russia's unprovoked invasion could lead to the ""beginning of World War III."" ""I think people need to understand what a no-fly zone means ... it's not some rule you pass that everybody has to oblige by,"" Rubio, R-Fla., told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. ""It's the willingness to shoot down the aircrafts of the Russian Federation, which is basically the beginning of World War III."" In a Zoom call with U.S. lawmakers that Rubio participated in Saturday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his request for the West to implement a no-fly zone over his country. But if that can't be done, Zelenskyy asked for planes instead, several members of Congress said after the call. Stephanopoulos asked Rubio about a potential deal with Poland to supply aircraft, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is ""actively looking at."" ""How about this provision of fighter jets? We would provide the fighter jets to Poland, other Eastern European nations, they would send the jets they now have to Ukraine, do you support that?"" Stephanopoulos pressed. ""I do. If that can be done, that would be great,"" Rubio answered. ""I do have concerns about a couple of things. And that is sort of, you know, can they actually fly them given the amount of anti-aircraft capability that the Russians possess and continue to have deployed in the region? ... But generally speaking, it's something I'd be supportive of."" Bipartisan support to ban Russian oil imports continues to grow among U.S. lawmakers, but the White House has yet to back it. ""The president has resisted banning Russian oil imports, of course, that would send gas prices soaring even more here in this country. Do you support that?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""I do and I don't think -- you know, I think that's something that you can construct a plan to phase that in pretty rapidly,"" Rubio said. ""And you could use reserves for the purposes of buffering that. But we have more than enough ability in this country to produce enough oil to make up for the percentage that we buy from Russia."" Rubio said the Biden administration's unwillingness to stop importing barrels of Russian oil each day is simply ""an admission that this guy, that this killer, that this butcher, Vladimir Putin, has leverage over us."" ""Why would we want that leverage to continue,"" Rubio asked. ""Why would we have someone like him to have the power to raise gas prices on Americans which is basically if he cuts us off, what would happen in the reserve?"" ""So I think we have enough that we should produce more American oil and buy less Russian oil or none, actually, none at all,"" he added. When asked whether it was ""responsible"" for Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to suggest in a tweet that someone should assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin and ""take this guy out,"" Rubio did not condemn the comments, as others, like Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, did. ""Well, look, people are watching what's happening in Ukraine and what this man is doing to these people, what this monster is doing to human beings, and they're very angry about it,"" Rubio said, adding that ""at the end of the day I do think Vladimir Putin is going to face some problems internally in Russia."" ""How the Russians seek to take care of it is up to them,"" Rubio continued. ""I'm not sure he was calling for a U.S. action in that regard. I think what he was basically trying to say, at least my reading of it is, I wish someone would take this guy out and remove him from power one way or the other. I think the whole world wishes that.""",7

""President Biden has been very, very clear that American troops will not be put on the ground or in the air to escalate this war and make this an American war against -- against the Russians,"" she told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. ""But we've also been very clear that we will support Ukraine in every other way possible."" Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. will continue to support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ""in every other way possible"" after Zelenskyy angrily denounced NATO's refusal to impose a no-fly zone and blamed the West for ""all the people who will die from this day."" In a Zoom briefing with members of Congress on Saturday, Zelenskyy said if a no-fly zone couldn't be implemented, Ukraine needs fighter jets to defend itself against Russia's invasion. The White House told ABC News the administration is working with Poland to transfer Soviet-era jets from that country and looking into possibly repaying Poland for them. Asked by Stephanopoulos, ""Is that on the table, is that going to happen?"" Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. is in ""close consultations"" with the Polish government and NATO allies. ""We have not in any way opposed the Polish government providing these -- these jets to -- to Ukraine and we're working, as you noted, to see how we can backfill for them."" Pressure is growing from Democrats and Republicans for the White House to impose tougher sanctions on the Kremlin, including a ban on oil imports from Russia, but Thomas-Greenfield reiterated the White House's hesitation to do so. ""The president has been clear with President Putin that the consequences of his actions in Ukraine will be felt and it will be felt by the Russians. At the same time, we're trying our best to minimize the impact on our own country, on our own energy security, as well as the energy security around the world."" She said Biden remains in discussions with NATO partners and his closest advisors on how to address energy issues while adding that sanctions imposed by the U.S. and allies have already had an impact on the Russian economy. ""The ruble is worth less than a penny right now. The Russian Central Bank is -- is not being -- not functioning completely, the stock market has been closed. So the sanctions are having the impact and Putin is feeling the results of those sanctions."" Biden said last week it was still ""too early"" to determine if Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine, even after the targeting of civilian areas and a nuclear power plant. When Stephanopoulos pressed her on evidence of shelled kindergartens, orphanages and hospitals, asking, ""Isn’t that a war crime?"" Thomas-Greenfield said, ""any attack on civilians is a war crime."" ""We're working with partners to collect and provide information on this so that we could investigate this and have it ready in the event that war crimes are brought before this government."" When asked by Stephanopoulos ""what kind of incentives can the United States and the West offer"" Putin to move forward with a negotiated peace treaty, Thomas-Greenfield said a return to negotiations is ""still on the table."" ""Putin has made the decision that he wants to continue with confrontation, with escalation with attacks on civilians and to move forward with this war that Russia is feeling as much as anyone. We're seeing that hundreds of Russian troops are being killed every day. Russians are demonstrating in the streets against this. So clearly President Putin is feeling the consequences of his actions, but I can't explain why he's -- he has continued to move forward in the aggressive way that he's continuing to do in Ukraine.""",7
2022-03-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tough-decision-biden-russia-oil-ban-trigger-higher/story?id=83296953,Tough decision for Biden: Russia oil ban would trigger higher gas prices,"Calls mounted Monday for the U.S. to ban the import of Russian oil, but while President Joe Biden's administration signaled a new openness to doing so, the president faced the tough decision of taking a step that would raise the price Americans pay at the gas pump. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress announced they had come to a deal on bipartisan legislation that would punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, by banning the import of Russian oil and other energy products -- as well as suspending normal trade relations with Russia. The White House said Biden had not yet decided whether to impose a ban. But an official with the White House's National Security Council told ABC News that the Biden administration was considering doing so even if Europe did not also impose a ban -- which would mark a departure from Biden's strategy of imposing sanctions in lockstep with European nations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that he had spoken with Biden and other Cabinet members the day before about a potential U.S. ban. ""We are now talking to our European partners and allies to look in a coordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil, while making sure that there is a still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets,"" he said during an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""That's a very active discussion as we speak,"" Blinken added. In Congress, Democrats and Republicans in both houses have in recent days increasingly called for a ban. A bipartisan group of senators last week proposed legislation that would impose a ban, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, too, said she supported the move. As the pressure to act mounts from both sides of the aisle, Biden faces a political quandary. After nearly two weeks of placing crushing sanctions on Russia in concert with Western allies, not moving to ban Russian oil imports, too, could appear as it he is not doing all he can to inflict pain on Russia's economy and its president, Vladimir Putin. A ban would raise energy prices for Americans, analysts say, and the White House has cited that risk as a reason Biden has not imposed one. About 8% of U.S. imports of crude oil and petroleum products came from Russia last year, according to preliminary U.S. government data; 3% of U.S. oil came from Russia. “What the president is most focused on,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday, ""is ensuring we are continuing to take steps to deliver punishing economic consequences on Putin while taking all action necessary to limit the impact to prices at the gas pump."" The Biden administration has been looking for alternative sources of energy, according to the White House. In the past few weeks, senior American officials have traveled to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to, in part, discuss energy, Psaki said. White House officials also say the impact on Russia, which sent just 1% of its oil exports to the U.S. in 2020, would not be great -- especially when its oil and gas sector is already ""de facto sanctioned"" because of harsh restrictions on Russian banks. But in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll last week, 69% of Americans said they supported economic sanctions on Russia even if they resulted in higher energy prices in the U.S. Biden has also said a priority of his is to keep the West united in imposing penalties on Russia for its invasion. There is less appetite in Europe for a ban on Russian oil and gas imports, since European nations rely heavily on Russia for their energy needs -- nearly half of Russian oil exports go to Europe, according to U.S. government figures -- and analysts say a ban would raise Europe's energy prices significantly. Biden discussed the possibility of an oil import ban during a Monday video teleconference call with the leaders of Germany, France and the United Kingdom, according to Psaki. The Democratic chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees and the most senior Republicans on those committees said Tuesday that they had come to an agreement on legislation that would not just ban the import of Russian energy products but that would also suspend normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus, which has aided Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. The legislation would also provide Biden with the authority to increase tariffs on products from Russia and Belarus and aim to suspend Russia's participation with the World Trade Organization. The House could vote on the legislation as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday. ABC News' Mariam Khan contributed to this report.",15
2022-03-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-ukraine-conflict/story?id=83252006,Where the Russia-Ukraine conflict goes from here,"As war in Ukraine rages on, several peace talks and increasing economic sanctions against Russia have failed thus far to stop the aggression. Ukrainians have withstood days of airstrikes and shelling across multiple cities since the invasion began on Feb. 24. The better-equipped Russian military has shown no signs of de-escalation and has claimed to have taken control of several areas of Ukraine, though it has also been slowed by Ukrainian resistance. How far Russian President Vladimir Putin will go, how much longer Ukrainian forces can hold out and what exactly it would take to end the conflict are key questions in the war. ""No one has a crystal ball, and it is very difficult to predict outcomes of conflict,"" said retired Gen. Robert Abrams, an ABC News contributor and the former commander of U.S. forces in Korea. Amid ""unprecedented"" sanctions against Russia and the stronger-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, ""what appears to be happening is Putin is becoming even more resolved,"" Abrams said. He pointed to threatening comments Putin made Saturday about Ukraine's statehood, which ""in plain speak means Russia is intent to invade, occupy and make Ukraine part of Russia, and erase the name Ukraine and replace it with Russia. That's new. And that is an indication that it will be difficult to judge how far Putin will go."" When asked at a Thursday news conference by ABC News senior foreign correspondent Ian Pannell how long Ukraine can hold out against the Russian advance, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, ""I don't know."" One key factor in Ukraine's fight is the level of support from the international community, including NATO, the European Union and the United Nations, Abrams said. The United States has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, and millions more in lethal aid has been sent by NATO and several EU countries. ""I think there are many other things that we can do to support the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian people,"" like arms, ammunition, enhanced communications and food, Abrams said. ""It's going to require continuous and predictable resupply into Ukraine to be able to give them the means necessary to defend themselves."" During a Zoom call Saturday with more than 300 U.S. lawmakers, Zelenskyy pleaded for more air support, including drones and planes, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., a co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, told ABC News Live. Quigley said the president also repeated his call for a no-fly zone over Ukraine -- something experts have argued could very quickly escalate into a ""World War III""-type scenario. ""To those who are advocating for a no-fly zone, we just need to all ask the question, are we prepared for the consequence -- basically starting World War III?"" Abrams said. ""I don't think we are, I don't think it's worth the risk of that sort of level of conflict, because that's what is coming. President Putin has made it clear that anybody that intervenes militarily will be treated as an enemy. That's not a bluff."" ""And he is prepared to escalate this conflict as high as anybody wants to go,"" he continued. Sanctions, which have been imposed against Russian banks, oligarchs and Putin himself, are ""very effective and powerful,"" but could take months to have an impact, Michael Kimmage, a specialist on U.S.-Russia relations who formerly served in the State Department, told NPR's ""Fresh Air"" last week. ""I think even in the most optimistic assessment, that the sanctions, that they will change the Russian calculus, perhaps in three, four months, possibly over the course of several years, and the war is occurring absolutely in real-time,"" Kimmage said in the interview. ""Three months is too long, in a sense, for Ukraine."" Another key factor in the outcome of the conflict is how long Ukrainians can ""maintain their will,"" Abrams said. ""How much are they willing to sacrifice for their country?"" he said. ""It is crystal clear that they have been galvanized, that the country has been galvanized, the Ukrainian people are fighting for their country and for their way of life. ... What will that look like on day 60? Day 120? That is difficult to predict."" President Joe Biden remarked during his State of the Union last week that the Ukrainians' ""fearlessness, their courage, their determination, literally inspires the world."" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been a key part of maintaining morale, Abrams said. ""He has been masterful in leading his country in this conflict,"" Abrams said. ""He is sharing the same hardships, he is communicating with his people. He's constantly communicating with the international community."" That connection can help Ukraine prevail, he said, though ""we're in for some very, very difficult, tough days and tough images, for those of us outside looking in."" Meanwhile, Russia's military, though superior, has been dogged by logistical challenges, including food and fuel shortages, and a ""lack of cohesion and discipline,"" which could work in Ukraine's favor, Abrams said. ""I think that's the bigger picture that people really need to understand about the dynamics and what makes soldiers fight with the ferocity and intensity that we would expect to see,"" he said. ""It boils down to, do you believe in what you're fighting for? And in this case, I think what we're seeing is not necessarily extensive effects of lack of food or fuel -- that certainly does have a role to play -- but I don't think the Russian military believes in what they're fighting for."" As the conflict drags on and Ukraine continues to put up resistance, in particular around its capital, the ""appetite for the war in Moscow might diminish,"" Kimmage said on ""Fresh Air."" ""Putin might face real pressures from his population, from the economy, to backtrack, and I don't think that he would call it a retreat, but maybe he would come to terms and try to work out something diplomatically. He's pretty far from that at the moment, but that would be the scenario in which Ukraine wins,"" he said. The ""Russian playbook"" indicates that its military will continue to bomb and shell Ukrainian cities and ""choke them out,"" according to Abrams -- pointing to Aleppo, Syria, and Grozny, Chechnya, as examples -- in order to take over and instate its own puppet government. The international community, in particular NATO members, has been closely watching the conflict in hopes of preventing it from escalating beyond Ukraine's borders as well. A senior White House official told ABC News the administration has been discussing efforts to make sure Putin is not completely boxed in with no way out but to fight. Abrams said he thinks there is a chance for a potential ""off-ramp"" for Russia, ""but it will require compromise."" That could look like Putin getting at least one of his demands met, such as Ukraine recognizing the two breakaway regions in the Donbas region as separate states, a guarantee of neutrality in Ukraine or a commitment that Ukraine never joins NATO. ""History tells us to end these wars, there's always going to have to be compromise, because I don't think we're going to find either side giving unconditional surrender. That's the other alternative, and I think that's highly, highly unlikely,"" Abrams said. Though much remains unclear at this time, two things are certain, Abrams said. ""I think we can be certain that the vast majority of the cities in Ukraine are likely to be decimated and destroyed,"" he said. ""I say that because the Ukrainian resistance, their armed forces and their people, has been so strong, so capable, and it has come as a complete surprise to the Russian military ... and as a result, the Russian military has already basically taken the gloves off and they're using what we call dumb bombs -- non-precision-guided munitions, rockets and artillery -- in suburban areas and housing areas, destroying civilian infrastructure."" Additionally, the conflict is going to displace millions of people, he said. So far, over 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine, and the United Nations has predicted that 10 million Ukrainians ultimately could be displaced by the war. ""There's nothing good coming out of this war,"" Abrams said. ""The stories of the courage and heroism and just the grit, the real grit of the Ukrainian people -- it's inspiring. But their country is slowly being destroyed, one village at a time.""",7
2022-03-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-unity-ukraine-frays-crisis-continues-note/story?id=83283121,US unity on Ukraine frays as crisis continues: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It turns out that achieving unity may have been the easy part, for once. The last week has displayed remarkable resolve on the part of the world community and even broad political agreement back home. The rallying behind Ukraine has served one big purpose: to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin. What comes next, though, is less clear -- and holds potential for reverting back to political grooves in ways unlikely to be helpful to the Biden White House. Bipartisan pressure has been building for days to halt Russian energy imports. There are signs the Biden administration is ready to embrace the concept, though not without worries about gas prices and what such a move would mean for the president's climate agenda. On the military front, consensus remains around keeping the U.S. from directly engaging with Russia. A no-fly zone, though requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is being rejected by lawmakers including Sen. Marco Rubio, who said on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday that enforcing it ""means starting World War III."" But with the administration already seeing evidence of war crimes committed by Putin and far worse suffering likely, the consequences of ruling out U.S. military involvement will grow more complicated. Decisions around what types of weapons to provide and how to support Ukrainian forces short of fighting alongside them will take on greater meaning. President Joe Biden used his State of the Union address last week to assure the American people that, despite the current crisis, ""we're going to be OK."" That can't and won't be the last assurances over what could be an extended period of violence and unease. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Vice President Kamala Harris marked the solemn anniversary of Bloody Sunday with remarks on voting rights in Selma, Alabama. ""President Biden and I are working for this cause every day, we have put the full power of the executive branch behind our shared effort,"" Harris said. ""And if we all continue to work together, to march together, to fight together, we will secure the freedom to vote."" It has been exactly 57 years since state troopers assaulted hundreds of peaceful demonstrators who were calling for equal access to the ballot box for Black Americans. Among the protestors brutalized on March 7, 1965, was John Lewis, the civil rights icon and congressman. It has been nearly two years since his death. President Joe Biden did not go to Alabama to participate in the commemoration. The White House issued a statement instead. ""We are determined to honor that legacy by passing legislation to protect the right to vote and uphold the integrity of our elections, including the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act,"" Biden wrote. The reality is that voting reform legislation, including the legislation that bears Lewis' name, has languished in the Senate without any clear path forward before many Americans head to the polls for midterm elections. The ""determination"" of the White House on this issue has not garnered support from Republicans, who remain staunchly opposed, nor has it moved Democratic holdouts Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to join their party in support of changing Senate rules to pass voting legislation with a simple majority. The likelihood of passing sweeping reform could lessen after Election Day as Democrats brace for the possibility of losing control of one or both chambers of Congress. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema For the first time this year, a Republican governor is poised to veto legislation that would ban transgender student-athletes from competing in girls' sports. The decision by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox comes as his party increasingly seizes on the culture war issue in an apparent attempt to mobilize the base. The Utah governor previously supported the creation of a state commission of experts who would make individual decisions on transgender students participating in sports leagues. However, on Friday, GOP lawmakers ended up passing an alternative proposal that imposed an overall ban on transgender girls' participation in school sports. Cox's vow to veto the legislation was met with praise from LGBTQ advocacy groups, including the Human Rights Campaign. ""Gov. Cox has shown he sees the humanity of the transgender youth impacted by this legislation — something Governors in states like South Dakota and Iowa have not,"" Human Rights Campaign State Legislative Director Cathryn Oakley said in a statement. More than 100 bills ""attacking transgender people have been introduced in state legislatures since 2020,"" according to the American Civil Liberties Union. As reported by the Associated Press, at least 11 states have passed legislation that bans transgender girls from participating in girls' sports leagues, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 42. That's the number of states, including Washington, D.C., that impose restrictions on abortion in the U.S., and as FiveThirtyEight's Anna Wiederkehr and Amelia Thompson-DeVeaux write, these restrictions aren't just about when a woman can (and can't) have an abortion. They're also about time, resources and often creating an undue burden for women seeking abortions. And if the Supreme Court later this year upholds Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks, it will become just that much more challenging for many women to obtain an abortion.

2022-03-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-identified-specific-threat-information-related-jan-watchdog/story?id=83324444,DHS 'identified specific threat information' related to Jan. 6: Watchdog,"The Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis ""identified specific threat information related to the events on January 6, 2021, but did not issue any intelligence products about these threats until January 8,"" according to a DHS inspector general report released Tuesday. ""Open source collectors in I&A's Current and Emerging Threats Center collected open source threat information but did not produce any actionable information,"" the inspector general's report concluded, saying the information was identified ""weeks"" before the attack on the U.S. Capitol. The report said that was because of an inexperienced intelligence collector who didn't receive proper training as well as a ""hesitancy"" to report information after the 2020 summer of unrest. During the summer of 2020, the unit faced criticism for compiling intelligence on journalists reporting on the events, as well as non-violent protesters. The report was first reported by CNN. The mission of the Intelligence and Analysis unit at DHS, according to the IG, is to provide information to state and local law enforcement partners on various issues of national attention. ""I&A's Counterterrorism Mission Center (CTMC) identified indicators that the January 6, 2021 events might turn violent but did not issue an intelligence product outside I&A, even though it had done so for other events,"" the report said. They did email information the agency had to local Washington, D.C., law enforcement agencies but that is as far as the communication went, the report said. On the morning of Jan. 6, the deputy secretary of Homeland Security was briefed on potential violence at the Capitol, but did not disseminate any intelligence products relating to the threat of violence, the inspector general found. Some of the information collected by the unit were online calls by event organizers to bring weapons to the event and more lethal weapons. ""An individual claimed there would not be enough law enforcement officers to stop the number of armed people arriving in the area,"" an assessment of the online activity from December 30th says. In another instance, an I&A intelligence collector messaged colleagues indicating individuals were sharing a map of the U.S. Capitol online. ""I feel like people are actually going to try and hurt politicians. Jan 6th is gonna be crazy, not to mention the inauguration,"" an unnamed intelligence collector wrote on Jan. 2. A day later, collectors found chatter discussing ""hanging politicians,"" but maintained these threats did not meet their reporting threshold. Ultimately, according to the inspector general, the collectors did not think storming the Capitol was remotely possible and dismissed these notions. Comparatively, the inspector general said DHS distributed information on possible violence stemming from the riots in Portland, Oregon, over the summer, but it had less threat indicators than that of perspective violence at the Capitol. The inspector general also says DHS shared ""limited"" information with state and local partners. Shortly after the FBI Norfolk office published an intelligence product about individuals who wanted to establish a ""quick reaction force"" in Northern Virginia, which did prove true according to court documents, I&A analysts shared their information in a limited scope with local law enforcement. As a response to the inspector general report, I&A is improving their information sharing and training capabilities. In a message to all Intelligence and Analysis Unit staff, acting Director John Cohen said they are working to strengthen the I&A capabilities. ""We have embarked on many improvements to bolster our intelligence collection and analysis, clarify guidance for intelligence officers, improve information sharing and operational coordination, and identify new resources to combat domestic violent extremism (DVE),"" Cohen wrote in an email obtained by ABC News. ""We will continue to build on the positive momentum we made in 2021, implement new and necessary changes as we adapt to the next generation of threats, and remain focused on the defense of the Homeland."" ""As Secretary Mayorkas has said, the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 was a violent assault on our democracy. Over the past fourteen months, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has strengthened intelligence analysis, information sharing, and operational preparedness to help prevent acts of violence and keep our communities safe,"" a DHS spokesperson told ABC News in response to the report's release. The spokesperson said the agency has increased their information sharing with partners from across government and bringing all the department's resources to bare in ways that ""protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties, and adhere to applicable laws.""",12
2022-03-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-challenges-us-limits-ukraine-note/story?id=83302732,Zelenskyy challenges US limits on Ukraine: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has earned admiration and respect across a spectrum of leaders in the kind of way most American politicians would envy these days. Now he's making a direct appeal to the American people at a moment when his country is in real danger and his words might carry particular weight -- or so he hopes. In an interview with ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir, Zelenskyy made clear he believes there’s more that President Joe Biden can do to help Ukraine, in terms of both military support -- ""security in the sky"" -- and economic pressure on Russia. He also made clear that there’s much more he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin might do if that doesn’t happen. ""Many things depend not just on us,"" Zelenskyy told Muir. ""Today, the war is here. Tomorrow, it will be in Lithuania, then in Poland, then in Germany. This is serious."" Zelenskyy was asked about concerns about a no-fly zone -- recall that Sen. Marco Rubio said imposing one would mean the start of ""World War III"" -- but he countered by citing missile strikes on a pediatric clinic and a university. ""You have to preserve lives,"" Zelenskyy told Muir. ""We will come first, you will come second, because the more this beast will eat, he wants more, more and more."" “We are not far from you,” he said in English, directly to the American people. The Biden White House continues to benefit from a degree of national unity surrounding the crisis in Ukraine. It seems Zelenskyy is aware of that -- and also not afraid to shake it if it means potentially helping his country. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper New York has joined cities and states across the country -- including some led by Democrats -- that have begun to roll back COVID-related restrictions. Still, for some on the right, the pace of those receding restrictions isn’t fast enough. Truckers hoped to speed up a return to normalcy by slowing traffic on Washington, D.C., area roadways Monday. The convoy wants an end of the COVID-19 emergency declaration first enacted in 2020. According to D.C. officials, their efforts didn’t make a significant impact. After a viral video in which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis scolded students wearing masks, claiming that they were participating in ""COVID theater,"" Desantis’ administration is going a step further. Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo announced plans to recommend against vaccinating healthy children for COVID-19 -- a plan at odds with CDC guidance. The White House called it ""absolutely not"" a good policy. ""It's deeply disturbing that there are politicians peddling conspiracy theories out there and casting doubt on vaccinations when it is our best tool against the virus and the best tool to prevent even teenagers from being hospitalized,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday. In a move that exploited Democratic absences last Thursday, Senate Republicans passed a measure calling for the end of the COVID-19 emergency declaration. The measure unlikely to pass the Democrat-controlled House or garner the signature of President Joe Biden. The criticism from the right comes as the Biden administration is requesting more than $22 billion to provide funding for ongoing free testing and COVID-19 treatment for the uninsured. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The jury selection in the trial of a group of men who were accused of planning to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer prior to the 2020 election begins Tuesday, putting a renewed spotlight on one of the nation's highest-profile governors who is in the midst of a reelection campaign. According to a release from the FBI in October 2020, the agency had begun an investigation earlier that year ""after becoming aware through social media that a group of individuals was discussing the violent overthrow of certain government and law enforcement components."" As described by the agency, ""on two occasions, members of the alleged conspiracy conducted coordinated surveillance on the governor’s vacation home,"" and along with the Michigan State Police, the FBI ""executed arrests as multiple conspirators met to pool funds for explosives and exchange tactical gear."" In the aftermath of authorities thwarting the plot, Whitmer gave an interview to ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" in which she referred to the group of charged individuals as a ""domestic terror organization"" while alleging the plot would have involved a darker outcome. ""This was a very serious thought-out plot to kill police officers, to bomb our Capitol, killing Democrats and Republicans alike, and to kidnap and ultimately put me on trial and kill me as well,"" Whitmer said at the time. Throughout 2020, Whitmer was a frequent target for former President Donald Trump's attacks over COVID-19 restrictions. Those precautions often garnered large protests at the Michigan Capitol and highlighted the now ongoing partisan divide over state governments' handling of pandemic-era policies. Although Whitmer rarely discusses the trial, she is likely going to have to revisit that underlying political context ahead of November. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 6. That’s the number of primary challengers former President Donald Trump has endorsed in House races where the Republican incumbent voted to impeach Trump and is still running. (Three have already said they won’t run for reelection.) And as FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley writes, opposition to these incumbents is ramping up as Trump has backed a primary challenger in every single House race but one.

2022-03-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/costs-putins-war-grow-us-note/story?id=83322980,Costs of 'Putin's war' grow in US: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It's a war Americans won't fight -- but that Americans are already feeling and are bound to feel more. Notwithstanding the seeming political inevitability of President Joe Biden's move to halt Russian energy imports, there is the truth he spoke in announcing it: ""It's going to cost us as well in the United States."" ""Putin's price hike,"" as the president labeled it, will be borne by American consumers. It's even possible that, with global prices rising and other markets available, President Vladimir Putin's Russia actually will make more from the same product than if U.S. imports were to continue. Another piece of the price tag will be borne by U.S. taxpayers more broadly, in the form of an aid package for Ukraine that's growing to $14 billion in the Senate. Congressional action on that continues to move quickly this week. There could be other kinds of costs as well. The questions around the arrangement in which Poland is ready to transfer Russian-made jets to a U.S. air base in Germany for delivery to Ukraine is just a taste of the difficult logistical, military and diplomatic maneuvering ahead. As the humanitarian cost of Russia's invasion grows, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that ""there's a Holocaust going on"" in Ukraine -- a situation he said is ""below humanity"" and ""below dignity,"" ABC News' Allison Pecorin reports. Assessments like that will only raise more questions about what else the United States could and should be doing -- and what that will mean both at home and abroad. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The proposed legislation critics have dubbed the ""Don't say gay"" bill is heading to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' desk for signage. The bill passed Florida's Senate on Tuesday and would restrict discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation in the classroom -- a move many consider discriminatory and harmful. The bill also creates legal liability for schools and teachers by allowing parents to sue if LGBTQ issues are taught. Florida's bill is a part of an onslaught of proposals put forth by Republican lawmakers in states across the country pertaining to the LGBTQ community. Proposed legislation runs the gamut from banning LGBTQ viewpoints in curricula to prohibiting participation of transgender youth in girls' and women's sports. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott has even directed state agencies to investigate gender-affirming care for trans youth as child abuse. Florida's bill, officially named the Parental Rights in Education Bill, has drawn criticism from Democrats and advocates. White House press secretary Jen Psaki called steps in Florida and Texas ""deeply concerning."" DeSantis, who is up for reelection, was also called out by his Democratic challenger, Charlie Crist, who wants the Florida Republican to veto the bill. ""Governor DeSantis, it's time for you to stand with Florida's LGBTQ+ community, not against it,"" said Crist. ""Stop dividing our state, and work to bring us together."" A public rebuke from Democrats is unlikely to deter DeSantis, a potential Republican presidential contender, who has made similar efforts to quash the discussion of racial issues in the classroom. Both draw on a broader effort on the part of Republicans to energize their base with cultural issues. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema A week after Texans headed to the polls for the first primary election of the 2022 midterm election cycle, Harris County Elections Administrator Isabel Longoria announced she would resign from her post following a series of administrative hurdles. Although voters did not encounter widespread issues when casting in-person ballots on Election Day, the state's largest county is now facing bipartisan pressure after announcing 10,000 mail-in ballots were left out of its vote tally. The discrepancy in the vote count was flagged by the secretary of state's office, and officials say 6,000 Democratic votes and 4,000 Republican votes were scanned but did not get added to the final election-night results. In the aftermath, Harris County Democrats are calling for a review of the election, as Republicans file a lawsuit against Longoria that alleges various violations of the Texas election code. The diverging responses could further amplify existing partisan sentiments about the state's election administration -- including potential impacts of the state's revised election law, S.B. 1. ""The election is very legitimate, it's clean, it's above board, there's nothing going on, but if these types of errors occur, they feed conspiracy theories that there is something untoward occurring, and that undermines public confidence,"" Mark Jones, a Baker Institute fellow in political science at Rice University, told ABC News' Houston affiliate, KTRK. As for voters -- their ballots will get counted. Election officials still have until Thursday to tabulate an official tally for last week's election. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 79. That's the percentage of Americans who supported a U.S. military response to a hypothetical Russian attack on a NATO country in a recent Quinnipiac University poll, but as FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich writes, that doesn't mean Americans think of all NATO allies equally. Americans are more likely to say they support defending Great Britain or France from a Russian attack than other Eastern European countries, including Ukraine.

2022-03-09,https://abcnews.go.com/International/refugees-fighters-survivors-ukrainian-women-document-life-war/story?id=83322529,"As refugees, fighters and survivors, Ukrainian women document life in war","When one Ukrainian woman woke up and answered a frantic call from her mother on the morning of Feb. 24 -- before the sun had even risen -- she heard screams and tears on the other side of the line, telling her what she feared the most. ""My mom called me crying and screaming: 'Run away right now to the bomb shelter, because the war has been started,'"" she said. The woman looked through her kitchen window and saw half the sky had already been overtaken by dust from explosions in the region. Since that day, when her life shifted drastically, she and other four women have been documenting video diaries of their journeys to safety as they escape the war. ""My country is at war right now,"" one woman said. ""We forgot what is sleep. We forgot what is food. We forgot what is normal life. We forgot what is work. We forgot what is not to shake with any noise outside. We now know what is death."" In less than two weeks since the invasion started, more than 2 million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, with their lives packed in a few bags on the way to neighboring countries. Out of the 2 million refugees, approximately 1 million are children -- including 8-year-old Eva. ""On Feb. 24, I woke up to the sounds of sirens,"" she said. ""For five days, I haven’t slept in my bed. My dad does everything to keep me safe. None of this would have happened if the Russian president did not start the war."" Poland has welcomed the highest number of refugees since Feb. 24, with over 1.2 million Ukrainians having crossed the border, according to the UNHCR. Others have fled to the nearby countries of Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Moldova. The agency also reported that almost 100,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled to Russia since the invasion began. Some, though, have no other choice except to seek shelter as their cities are bombarded with Russian missiles. The sound of explosions, buildings falling and screams of fear have been a constant, they said. A 19-year-old woman was forced to leave her flat in Kyiv to seek safer shelter amid the Russian shelling. ""Rockets, tanks, gunfire. It's no longer nightmare. It's my reality. The reality of all Ukrainians now,"" she said. ""We are strong nation and we will not give up. I would like to convey to the world we are at war now, and tomorrow, it can be with you. Let's stop it together."" Others have decided to join the fight to defend their country. On the front lines of the war, some women are taking up arms and making Molotov cocktails. When Russia began its invasion, the Ukraine State Border Guard Service announced that all men between the ages of 18-60 were banned from leaving the country and must instead join the troops. Women make up close to 15% of Ukraine's military personnel -- over 30,000 soldiers -- according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. In one video diary, another woman said she has friends who have taken on the responsibility to defend their country against Russian troops. She said she is afraid of whether she will ever see her friends again. ""We just can't close eyes and let the authoritative regime do anything they like,"" she said. ""I have friends who are 90 years old, 20 years old, and they are now defending Kyiv. No one knows whether they will be alive and that’s horrible,"" she said. ""I can't imagine how it can happen in the civilized world when everyone should obey international law."" As of March 9, the U.N. has verified more than 1,400 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 516 deaths and 908 injuries, but says the real toll is much higher. Fear continues to rage as the conflict escalates. The unity among the citizens of Ukraine, however, has been a source of motivation for many, according to one woman. ""We are scared. We're really scared. But more than we are scared, we are motivated. We are motivated to defend our lands, to defend our country and to defend the ones who we love,"" she said. ""It is horrible [and] I would never wish for anyone to experience.""",22
2022-03-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/scammers-posing-law-enforcement-extort-personal-information-fbi/story?id=83339242,Scammers posing as law enforcement to extort personal information: FBI,"Scammers are impersonating law enforcement and government officials, in an effort to extort money and personal information, the FBI warns. Often times, the scammers will “spoof” authentic numbers and credentials “of well-known government and law enforcement agencies,"" the agency said in an announcement Monday. The FBI says scammers will say a person's identity was used in crime, such as a drug deal or money laundering scam, and they will ask for personal information to verify their identity such as their Social Security number and date of birth. ""The victim is threatened with arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment if they do not pay to remove charges or assist in the investigation against the ""real"" criminals,"" the FBI said. ""Payment is demanded in various forms, with the most prevalent being prepaid cards, wire transfers, and cash, sent by mail or inserted into cryptocurrency ATMs. Victims are asked to read prepaid card numbers over the phone or text a picture of the card. Mailed cash will be hidden or packaged to avoid detection by normal mail scanning devices. Wire transfers are often sent overseas so funds almost immediately vanish,"" the announcement said. Scams also come in the form of text messages requiring government IDs to fix a passport renewal. The FBI urges consumers to protect themselves saying that ""officials will never contact members of the public or medical practitioners by telephone to demand any form of payment, or to request personal or sensitive information.""",12
2022-03-09,https://abcnews.go.com/International/college-basketball-star-mo-creek-escapes-ukraine-russia/story?id=83298526,Former college basketball star Mo Creek escapes Ukraine as Russia invades,"Sitting in his living room at home in the U.S., Maurice ""Mo"" Creek holds his mother's hand days after escaping Ukraine as she holds back tears. ""I still sit here and I cry every day,"" Pammy Morgan told ABC News. ""Maurice was over there and it was not looking good. It was sickening. I mean, I've lost like 10 pounds. We couldn't sleep. We couldn't eat -- phone's ringing off the hook. Creek, who played for the University of Indiana and George Washington University, spent last Saturday and Sunday in and out of a bomb shelter in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. He said he then traveled 130 miles to Odessa on Monday before arriving at the Moldovan border, where he spent nine hours in the immigration line. By Tuesday, Creek was in Iasi, a city in eastern Romania, miles away from the madness with plans of catching the first flight to the United States. He was reunited with his family last Thursday. ""When he made it here, it was a breath of fresh air. I knew he was safe"" his mom said. ""The thing that kept me together was my spiritual glue,"" Morgan said. ""I had to keep it strong for him and I was telling people please pray, fast pray. You know, I know media doesn't like to hear that a lot. I didn't care. I needed my son home."" Creek, who moved to Mykolaiv in December to play basketball for MBC Mykolaiv, a professional basketball team in Ukraine, said he is grateful that he got to escape. However, he still thinks about his teammates and friends who remain at war. ""I just pray for them every day and their families,"" Creek told ABC News. ""Because when I saw them for the last time, I shedded some tears because it's like not only will I maybe not ever see you again on the basketball level. I may not never see you on the livelihood level because of what's going on right now."" While in Ukraine, Creek said what he saw reminded him of the popular military combat video game, Call of Duty. Hearing sirens, seeing pilot jets dart above his head, and having to stay at a bomb shelter himself, Creek said being terrified was an understatement. ""You start really feeling the actual effects of the war. Like, I was getting jets going across my building, then I have to go to the bomb shelter and I look on social media, you see one jet hit one lady's house like with a bomb like you know, with a missile,"" Creek said. ""And it's like, dude, I'm not sleeping today. I'm not doing that. I'm paranoid, terrified."" But Creek said that wasn't the scariest part of being an American trapped in Ukraine. He said he was scared every night since the city was pitch black due to Marshall law. ""The scariest moments for me that I felt was when it hit at nighttime and it's no light; it is no lights,"" he said. ""I'm talking about it looked like if you had a plug, and you could plug every light to the city like somebody just took the plug out and the whole city was black."" ""So now you can't feel nothing and you can't see nothing. I'm like, 'Yo, I can't even see if a Russian is coming up in my building trying to shoot,'"" he said ""Because they have night vision,"" his mom said. ""Exactly,"" he echoed. ""They are going to see everything and you ain't going to see them because they have dark suits on because they are trying to figure out where are the Ukrainians and shoot them and Ukrainians are trying to do that back."" Creek said what got him through his time in Ukraine was the phone calls, emails, texts, social media outreach and most importantly, the prayers from people. Creek said his biggest advice for anyone who is currently stuck in Ukraine and is losing hope as he once felt, is to keep your hope alive. ""Don't lose faith and keep hope,"" said Creek. ""My motto is strive or starve. You either strive and do what you need to do or you are going to starve by not doing what you need to do, but always keep hope, anything is possible at the end of the day."" The Russian invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation."" Since then, more than 2 million refugees have fled the country, including more than 1.2 million children, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. About half of those who have fled the country have gone to bordering Poland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.K. Parliament Tuesday that his country will not give up the fight. ""We will not give up. We will continue fighting for our land whatever the costs. We will fight in the fields, in the seas, in the streets. We will fight on the banks of different rivers,"" Zelenskyy said.",7
2022-03-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-blames-biden-gas-prices-pushing-russian-oil/story?id=83324400,GOP blames Biden for gas prices after pushing for Russian oil ban,"The House is set to vote as soon as Wednesday on a bill that would codify the Biden administration's ban on the import of Russian oil and energy products into the U.S., review Russia's access to the World Trade organization and strengthen the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act so that the U.S. can further sanction Russia. The vote would be remarkably fast-paced for legislation -- bypassing the usual legislative process in a clear indication that lawmakers want to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and quickly. The measure has broad bipartisan support across both sides of the aisle and is expected to pass in the House. But Republicans, while they commended the administration for its Tuesday announcement to ban Russian oil, quickly turned critical of gas price hikes, as some members of the House accused President Joe Biden of allegedly turning his back on U.S. oil and gas production as the administration potentially weighs making oil deals with Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. ""First of all: President Biden, stop begging dictators to produce the energy that we need here in America. Don't go to Russia. Don't go to Iran. Don't go to Venezuela when the answer is right beneath our feet. It's time for President Biden to say yes to American energy,"" House Republican Whip Steve Scalise told reporters during a press conference. One after another, House Republicans took turns to criticize the administration. ""Never should we think that foreign oil is better than American independence when it comes to energy,"" Rep. Yvette Herrell of New Mexico said. ""We're sleeping in the bed that we made,"" Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas said. ""That's what happens when you allow energy policy to be dictated by children in Europe, by woke investors on Wall Street, and by politicians who actually think that electric passenger vehicles are going to solve an energy crisis and the climate crisis."" ""We don't need to be buying Russian energy, but we don't need to be buying Iranian energy or Venezuelan energy. We need to produce energy of all forms and all types here in the US and do it better than anybody else in the world,"" Westerman added. Rep. August Pfluger of Texas said Biden should meet with oil and gas executives and companies while he is down in Texas today. ""In addition to his pre-planned meetings, what he should be doing is meeting with oil and gas executives and companies,"" Pfluger said. ""Instead of calling on terrorist regimes to fulfill our needs, what he should be doing is calling on the domestic producers who know better than anybody else in the world, how to produce the supply of energy that not only we need, but that our partners and allies around the world need."" ""The president's first phone call should have been to the mayor of Midland, Texas, not to Maduro,"" he added. On the House floor Tuesday, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy hit Biden for shuttering the Keystone XL pipeline last year. ""Democrats want to blame surging prices on Russia. But the truth is, they're out of touch policies are why we are here in the first place. On Day 1, the President canceled the Keystone Pipeline and stopped new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. Then, he gave the green light to Putin's pipeline,"" McCarthy said. ""If we want to lower prices and protect the environment, we must prioritize American energy independence. We have the natural resources under our feet. We have the best workers in the world: drilling the wells, building the pipelines, running the rigs, and extracting the gas in the cleanest way possible,"" he said. ""We just need politicians who will get out of the way,"" he added. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the legislation in a letter sent to democrats Tuesday. Her announcement to codify a ban comes on the heels of Biden's announcement earlier Tuesday to ban Russian oil and energy imports. Pelosi last week forcefully threw her weight behind a potential oil ban and at the time, signaled legislation would be imminent. ""Because this legislation is an urgent imperative – both morally and for our security interests – the House will consider this legislation on the floor today. It is our hope that we have a strong, bipartisan vote,"" Pelosi said in a letter sent to Democrats. The vote in the House on Wednesday comes after the White House urged lawmakers not to go forward with the legislation that was crafted with Republicans over the weekend, according to several Congressional aides familiar with discussions. One of the White House's main concerns was that the package would not allow the president to roll back the new Russia sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin deescalated in Ukraine - it would've required another act of Congress. The White House, according to an aide, felt like the legislation would box them in. Democrats have since made changes to the legislation as originally envisioned based on conversations with the White House, making it unclear how many Republicans will support the bill on the floor tomorrow. It's also unclear if the House bill would move forward in the Senate. ""We first have to see what the House passes, and then we'll discuss things with the administration and find the best way to make sure that the oil import ban is tight and tough,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday. House Democrats commended Biden's announcement and rebuffed criticisms that the administration only acted after lawmakers introduced bipartisan legislation to force its hand. ""I don't think that anything has created any pressure,"" House Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Tuesday morning. ""He's been very clear-eyed and transparent with the American people all along the way,"" Jeffries said of Biden. ""I'm very confident in President Biden's continued leadership and I don't think anyone has pressured him into doing anything."" The decision to ban Russian oil and energy imports is likely to cause more pain at the pump for Americans, which lawmakers are keenly aware of. Jeffries acknowledged the high gas prices Americans are currently facing and vowed that the Democratic Party would do what it can to relieve the pressure on wallets. ""It's certainly my hope that my Republican colleagues won't continue to play politics with an existential crisis for Ukraine, for Europe, for the West and for democracy because that is what is at stake right now. And we have to apply maximum pressure on Vladimir Putin and Russia until it ceases and desists with respect to its aggression and the slaughtering of innocent individuals in Ukraine. It may be some sacrifice that is required across the world,"" Jeffries said. ""Certainly, we are seeing incredible sacrifice by the Ukrainian people,"" he added. Jeffries also hinted that the administration could potentially ask Americans to work from home for the time being to help ease the gas crisis and avoid the daily commute. Asked if he thinks the federal government and businesses should consider changing their policies, even as the COVID crisis has eased up, Jeffries said: ""I don't want to comment on any specific steps that the administration may be contemplating, but I think everything should be on the table in terms of an all-hands-on-deck approach. It's not just an all of government moment. It's an all of America moment."" But White House press secretary Jen Psaki made clear Tuesday that the White House isn't about to ask Americans to cut down on their gas consumption. ""Well, we're neither going to make a prediction...nor are we going to tell Americans to stay home,"" Psaki said. ABC News' Sarah Kolinovsky contributed to this report.",7

With the federal government set to run out of funding as soon as Friday, the $1.5 trillion package will avert a shutdown through September, while also adding billions in humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine after Russia's invasion. The House also passed a four-day stopgap measure to give the Senate time to approve the larger package. The bill, which includes $13.6 billion in humanitarian and defense aid to Ukraine, received bipartisan support and passed 361-69. The House approved the non-defense portion of the package 260-171, with one member voting present. Later, the House approved a proposal to ban Russian oil and energy imports in a 414-17 vote. The new aid to Ukraine, billions more than initially requested by the Biden administration, is evenly split between humanitarian and military aid, includes millions to help feed and resettle displaced Ukrainians and nearly $2 billion in potential economic relief for Ukraine and neighboring countries. Of the $6.5 billion in emergency defense assistance, the package directs $3.5 billion to help arm Ukrainians and allied forces in the region with U.S. military stocks, and another $3 billion to support the deployment of additional U.S. troops and materials to Europe. In a setback for the Biden administration's COVID strategy, House Democrats were forced to scrap $15 billion in COVID-19 funding for therapeutics and research in the spending package after an internal revolt from members who objected to repurposing unspent relief Congress had previously approved for states to use at their discretion. Pelosi, who called the removal of COVID-19 funds ""heartbreaking,"" told reporters the change was necessary in order for the package to clear the Senate, where a 50-50 split forces Democrats to rely on the votes of at least 10 Republicans. ""We're in a legislative process. We have a deadline. We're keeping government open,"" she said. ""We had a lively negotiation."" ""Some of the members are disappointed,"" Pelosi continued. ""'I didn't get what I wanted in the bill' -- you're telling Noah about the flood."" Pelosi, however, said the House would take up a standalone COVID funding bill Wednesday with a plan for the bill to be debated and voted on next week. Separately, the chamber also approved a measure to ban the import of Russian oil and energy products one day after President Joe Biden signed an executive order to the same effect. The bill would also direct the administration to consider taking steps to suspend Russia from the World Trade Organization and expand on language in the Magnitsky Act -- a sanctions law approved by Congress in 2012 -- to allow the Biden administration to impose additional sanctions on Russian officials and individuals linked to the war in Ukraine. Democratic leaders made changes to that legislation -- initially crafted with Republicans in both chambers -- after the White House raised concerns that it would make it harder for Biden to ease sanctions on Russia if the Kremlin deescalated in Ukraine. Another provision to suspend trade relations with Russia and Belarus was adjusted at the White House's request, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters Wednesday. ""It was taken out because the president rightfully wants to talk to our allies about that action, which I think was appropriate,"" he said. Democrats were expected to pass the measures earlier than expected Wednesday night, allowing them to salvage their caucus retreat in Philadelphia that was initially slated to begin Wednesday afternoon. Biden will address the caucus in Philadelphia on Friday.",26
2022-03-10,https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-adviser-michael-flynn-meets-jan-committee-sources/story?id=83367606,"Former Trump adviser Michael Flynn meets with Jan. 6 committee, takes 5th","President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, appeared Thursday before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and exercised his Fifth Amendment right in response to the panel's questions, his attorney said. The committee subpoenaed Flynn in November, requesting documents and testimony in reference to a December 18, 2020, meeting he reportedly attended with then-President Trump in the Oval Office, where seizing voting machines used in the 2020 election was allegedly discussed. Flynn was also allegedly involved in efforts to draft several memos ordering multiple federal agencies to seize voting machines, which Trump ultimately did not sign. Flynn's lead counsel, David Warrington, said Flynn ""exercised his 5th amendment right to decline to answer the Committee's questions"" at his appearance Thursday. A committee spokesperson declined to comment on Flynn's appearance. Trump had allegedly contemplated ordering the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to seize states' voting machines as part of his efforts to challenge the 2020 election results, and Flynn publicly prodded Trump to declare martial law and order the military to oversee new elections in the battleground states that Trump had lost. One day before Trump met with Flynn, the former national security adviser told the conservative news outlet Newsmax that Trump ""could take military capabilities and he could place them in those states and basically rerun an election in each of those states."" Flynn filed a lawsuit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and members of the committee in December seeking ""declaratory and injunctive relief"" from a subpoena from the committee seeking his records and testimony. A federal judge quickly rejected Flynn's effort to get a temporary restraining order that would have barred the committee from enforcing its subpoena against him and obtaining any of his cell phone data from a third-party telecommunications company. Flynn and former Trump attorney Sidney Powell tried to enlist a Pentagon official to help overturn the election, ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl wrote in his book ""Betrayal: The Final Act of the Trump Show."" According to the book, Flynn -- who had just received an unconditional presidential pardon from Trump after pleading guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI during the Russia probe -- made a frantic phone call to a senior Trump intelligence official named Ezra Cohen (sometimes referred to as Ezra Cohen-Watnick), who previously worked under Flynn at both the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council. Flynn urged Cohen that ""he needed to get orders signed, that ballots needed to be seized, and that extraordinary measures needed to be taken to stop Democrats from stealing the election,"" Karl reported. ""Sir, the election is over,"" Cohen told Flynn, according to the book. ""It's time to move on.""",11
2022-03-10,https://abcnews.go.com/International/history-teacher-remains-mariupol-ukraine-care-children-left/story?id=83339615,"History teacher remains in Mariupol, Ukraine, to care for children left behind","LONDON -- A 33-year-old teacher remains in Ukraine's southeastern city, Mariupol, to care for children trapped there amid the conflict. The strategic port city is in dire condition. Food and water are scarce, shops have been looted, fuel is sold for over 30 times more than what it used to be two weeks ago, and dead bodies are left behind on the streets without anyone clearing them. ""I stay in town no matter what. I said I won't leave my children even if I'm killed,"" Oleksiya Kayokhtin, who said he has taught history for ten years in Mariupol, told ABC News. In a latest strike on the city, a children's hospital and maternity ward in the city were destroyed Wednesday afternoon by a Russian airstrike, Ukrainian officials said. Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova denied the hospital was hit by Russian forces, and claimed that Ukrainian forces were using it for ""firing positions."" Kayokhtin spoke with ABC News standing near a mobile connection tower -- the only way to establish a cellphone connection now in Mariupol. ""When I heard Putin's announcement of war on February 24, we evacuated a whole orphanage to Zaporizhia -- 130 kids and two buses of women and kids,"" Kayokhtin said. Soon after, attacks intensified and Russian forces took control of some of the city's roads. But still, Kayokhtin said that he refused to evacuate the town despite many of his friends advising him to leave and offering help to do so. Instead, he said he started to find a way to secure the life of the children who were not evacuated. He said with help from a local businessman ""who has a big bomb shelter"" they took the kids to the shelter, as well as senior and disabled people. Currently there are 400 kids, among them 100 who are disabled and in wheelchairs, he said. ""The children are frightened, very frightened… They often cry. This morning during another airstrike they burst out crying again,"" Kayokhtin said. With buildings in ruins after shelling, and many dead and left under debris, some children have also been left stranded on the streets. Kayokhtin said he takes these children to the shelter. ""Those who are left without parents ask, 'Where's mom, where's dad.?' The adults say that it will end soon, that we have to stay here for a moment. We don't pressure the kids asking where their parents are, maybe they ran out and never returned… We don't ask them a lot of questions not to cause a trauma,"" he said. The immediate need that Kayokhtin says he is working hard on is providing food and warm clothes for all the people in the shelter. ""We need warm clothes because the basements are damp and cold. The shops were looted, so we gave the kids all we had to warm them,"" he said. ""When we manage to get some flour, we add some water and bake dough in pans,"" he added. With the shops looted and the closed roads, prices have soared, it has become very difficult for Kayokhtin, his children and everyone else left in town to survive. ""We try to buy [food] under the table, but you can be even killed for food in the streets. People take water from the river so it's OK for now, but if someone notices that you have food… this is horror, you will be attacked,"" he described the situation. Another struggle, he said, is emerging from their bunker to find and buy food, bringing them in contact with military forces on the street. He said it is also difficult to secure fuel. ""Gas stations were blown up. We managed to get petroleum 1000 UAH (over $30 USD) per liter,"" the teacher said. Oil prices were around 30 UAH per liter before the war broke. But these are not his only concerns. ""We were driving past the so-called DPR (Donetsk People's Republic), bringing bread. And the troops started shooting for some reason, although there's a sign of humanitarian aid on our car,"" Kayokhtin described one of his drives outside to get food. ""Somehow God helped us, we drove to the side and the projectile exploded just 50m from us,"" he added. The history teacher says is helped along with two other people who have stayed with him in the bunker-- a medical worker and a driver -- both volunteers. He says all they hope for is an end to the war, so they do not need to leave the country and their children are safe. ""I hope I will stay in my native land and continue teaching,"" Kayokhtin said.",22
2022-03-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/covid-politics-reach-funding-tipping-point-note/story?id=83347303,COVID politics reach funding tipping point: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The politics of COVID moved faster than the trucker convoy, which got to Washington a good week or two after it might have left a mark on the policy conversation -- not to mention the local traffic. It also moved too fast for congressional Democrats and the White House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to drop what she called a ""deeply needed"" $15 billion pandemic funding package requested by the White House from a major spending bill. ""It is heartbreaking to remove the COVID funding, and we must continue to fight for urgently needed COVID assistance, but unfortunately that will not be included in this bill,"" Pelosi told her fellow House Democrats on Wednesday. The request's inclusion in a far larger government spending and Ukraine-aid measure was caught in complicated political currents around unspent monies, inflation worries and deficit spending. Still, the broad takeaway is a stark one: The Biden White House was unable to get what it labeled an ""urgent request"" for supplies, vaccines and treatments through the Democratic-controlled House. This time, there's no blaming Sen. Joe Manchin or Senate rules. Washington's priorities, of course, have been upended by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, along with spiraling gas prices and economic fears. A new government report coming Thursday is expected to find sky-high inflation extending through February. As it happens, Thursday also marks one year since the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan won final passage -- a high-water mark for Democrats' unity on spending to fight COVID. Those days are long gone. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper While House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy doesn't split with former President Donald Trump on much, Russian President Vladimir Putin is where he appears to draw the line. When asked by a reporter Wednesday if he agreed with Trump's assessment of Putin's moves as ""genius,"" McCarthy made his stance clear. ""I do not think anything is savvy or genius about Putin. I think Putin is evil. He is a dictator and I think he is murdering people right now,"" McCarthy said. It's a rare deviation for McCarthy, who stood by Trump after Jan. 6, visiting the former president at his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago. McCarthy's decision to publicly disavow Trump could also be an indication that Trump's influence is waning. McCarthy has walked a fine line on Trump as he needs support from the far-right wing of his party if he hopes to become Speaker of the House should the GOP take control of the chamber in November. The strength of a Trump endorsement has also been in question. A Fox News poll shows Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp leading GOP primary challenger David Perdue, who is endorsed by Trump. In North Carolina, Trump's endorsement of Rep. Ted Budd for Senate hasn't cleared the crowded field or given Budd a clear advantage. Plus, Trump's attempt to weigh in on a Wyoming voting bill that would have prevented voters from changing their affiliation on primary day also failed. The policy was seen as something that could have hurt embattled Rep. Liz Cheney, who will likely need the support of Democrats and independents to stave off her Trump-backed challenger in the state's open primary. The TIP with Ben Siegel House Democrats were scheduled to travel to Philadelphia on Wednesday afternoon, with plans to huddle with Cabinet secretaries and hear from President Biden as they work to tout their agenda and defend their slim House majority. But a dispute over how to pay for new COVID-19 programs forced Democratic leaders to rewrite spending legislation, delaying the caucus' departure from Capitol Hill to accommodate the updated voting schedule. While discussions to forge ahead with the retreat or reschedule the caucus huddle were ongoing Wednesday night, Democrats, regardless, are facing headwinds in keeping the House in November. Despite Biden's post-State-of-the-Union bump in approval ratings and the party doing better than expected in congressional redistricting, inflation, the shifting dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic and the havoc the Russian invasion of Ukraine has wreaked on energy prices represent a combustible and fluid set of issues for the Democrats -- and Republicans -- to grapple with heading into campaign season. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 66. That's the percentage of Americans who approve of the U.S. government's economic sanctions on Russia in the YouGov/Economist's latest weekly poll. But as FiveThirtyEight contributor Julia Azari writes, that's hardly an indication that Americans see eye-to-eye on how best to handle the crisis in Ukraine. Rather, the debate about how America should proceed in Ukraine has been subsumed by our larger culture-war politics which, Julia argues, is a real danger for U.S. foreign policy.

2022-03-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/putin-sustainable-end-game-ukraine-cia-director/story?id=83363796,"Putin has no 'sustainable end game' in Ukraine, CIA director says","CIA Director William Burns told lawmakers Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to agree to settlement talks with Ukraine for tactical reasons because he ""does not have a sustainable end game"" for his invasion. ""Given Putin's track record, given the fact that he's someone who hates to act out of what he believes to be weakness, that he needs to concede or admit mistakes, that's probably a long shot,"" Burns said of any chance talks might succeed. A session Thursday in Turkey between the countries' top two diplomats failed to produce a cease-fire. Burns also told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Putin, at the same time, is turning Russia into a ""propaganda bubble."" ""He's intensified his domination of the state run media and in his strangulation of independent media, especially in recent years, and particularly since the invasion of Ukraine began."" ""I don't believe he can wall off [Russians] indefinitely from the truth, especially as realities began to puncture that bubble. The realities of killed and wounded coming home in an increasing number. The realities of the economic consequences for ordinary Russians as I was discussing before, the realities of you know, the horrific scenes of hospitals and schools being bombed next door and Ukraine, enough civilian casualties there as well. I don't think he can bottle up the truth indefinitely,"" he said. Intelligence agency leaders from around the government testified in the second of two hearings detailing their annual report on ""worldwide threats,"" after speaking to the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Burns told Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that the U.S. needs to ""focus"" on Russia's potential use of chemical weapons both in terms of a ""false flag"" operation and in reality. ""This is something as all of you know very well is very much a part of Russia's playbook,"" Burns said. ""They've used those weapons against their own citizens. They've at least encouraged the use in Syria and elsewhere. So, it's something we take very seriously."" He said believes the U.S. is adequately pushing back on the Russian narrative. ""In all the years I spent as a career diplomat, I saw too many instances in which we lost information wars with the Russians. In this case, I think we have had a great deal of effect in disrupting their tactics and their calculations and demonstrating to the entire world that this is a premeditated and unprovoked aggression, built on a body of lies and false narratives,"" he said. The head of U.S. Cyber Command, Gen. Paul Nakasone, defended U.S. information-sharing with Ukraine amid Republican suggestions the U.S. was holding back. ""The intelligence that we're sharing is accurate. It's relevant, and it's actionable. I think when we look back at this, that's the key piece of, of what we've been able to do as an intelligence community,"" he said. Defense Intelligence Agency Director Gen. Scott Berrier admitted he could have done a better job assessing problems Putin's military would have overcoming the Ukrainians' will to fight. ""So, we assessed prior to the invasion that he was overestimate or underestimating, rather, the Ukrainians ... resistance,"" he said. ""We did not do as well in terms of predicting the military challenges that he has encountered with his own military."" ""We made some assumptions about his assumptions, which proved to be very, very flawed,"" Berrier said. ""Among the many profoundly flawed assumptions that President Putin made in launching this invasion, was his assumption that he had built a sanctions-proof economy,"" Burns said. Putin, Burns said, thought he built a ""very large war chest to foreign currency reserves and gold reserves, and by not anticipating that the sanctions against the Russian Central Bank, by not anticipating that the German leadership would show such resolve in particular, I think he deeply underestimated the economic consequences, and I think they're just now being felt in Russia, and that's going to intensify.""",7

2022-03-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/threat-cornered-putin-russia-ukraine-conflict-drags/story?id=83365538,What is the threat of a 'cornered' Putin as the Russia-Ukraine conflict drags on?,"Long before the first shot was fired, diplomats the world over have been trying to find a way to broker some sort of peace between Ukraine and Russia. After two grueling weeks of bitter combat, that goal is more elusive than ever. With the war seemingly poised to drag on, ABC News spoke to foreign policy experts about Russian President Vladimir Putin's next strategic steps, the fine line the West is walking to support Ukraine, and how the conflict could ripple beyond its borders. 'A cornered beast, if you will, can be dangerous' Putin's invasion into Ukraine has been met by expectedly punishing sanctions from the U.S. and its allies, as well as unexpectedly effective resistance from Ukrainian fighters. At least for now, both seem unlikely to change the Kremlin's calculations or diminish Putin's determination. While it will take time for Russia to feel the full impact of economic restrictions levied against it and Ukraine's ability to withstand a prolonged assault is an open question, Dan Hamilton, a former high-level State Department official and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said pushing Putin to the brink could have unpredictable consequences. ""In his mind, he doesn't want to go down in history as the leader who 'lost Ukraine,'"" he said. ""A cornered beast, if you will, can be dangerous."" But despite setbacks, Andrew Lohsen, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says Putin is undaunted. ""We've heard from Vladimir Putin himself that he thinks that this war is still winnable. He hasn't given up on his objectives. And his he seems still very determined to press on,"" said Lohsen. ""The indications that we have so far is that he is still really doubling down and pressing further with his invasion rather than taking a step back."" Just as they made clear what the consequences of an incursion would be before Russia advanced into Ukraine, Lohsen says world leaders will ultimately need to identify an ""off-ramp"" for Putin by indicating exactly how de-escalation will yield sanctions relief. ""We need to give the sanctions time to bite,"" he said. ""Once we start to see some sort of concern among the top levels of leadership, then I think it would be appropriate to start a conversation about the conditionality of these sanctions. What would we remove in exchange for a withdrawal of Russian forces?"" But whether Putin will elect to take that off-ramp is another question entirely. ""My concern is that Putin has painted this conflict in such hyperbolic terms, I think it's going to be really hard for him to step back from the brink. He said that Ukrainians have committed genocide, he said Ukraine has a desire to acquire nuclear weapons,"" Lohsen said, referencing the lies Putin used to justify military action. ""So when you're engaging in a war with a state with such supposedly nefarious aims, them how do you reach a negotiated solution where you leave that leadership in place and you don't completely stop that country from pressing on with the objectives you've ascribed to it?"" And for Putin, negotiating an end to the conflict he started wouldn't mean an end to its consequences. ""They want to bring Putin up on was crimes -- take him to The Hague. Those things don't go away,"" said Hamilton. ""It's very hard to see how Putin would sign an agreement when he's being prosecuted."" Should the US and allies do more? Amid an onslaught of grim reports and haunting images from the streets of Ukraine, a ""wait and see"" kind of approach can feel frustratingly futile. While the crisis has prompted a rare bipartisan outpouring of support in the U.S., funneling assistance to the country remains a delicate dance. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine to protect civilians, but the Biden administration and NATO have made it clear it's a nonstarter because enforcing airspace restrictions would almost certainly mean direct conflict with Russia. ""The fear of nuclear escalation is the number one consideration here,"" said Clint Reach, a former Russian linguist with the Department of Defense and a policy analyst at RAND. ""That's the elephant in the room when it comes to direct military intervention."" As made evident by the Pentagon rejecting Poland's plan to send fighter jets to Ukraine via a U.S.-NATO airbase in Germany, there's significant concern that roundabout assistance could also spur significant blowback. ""We don't have a full understanding of Russian red lines and how much intervention they're willing to accept,"" said Reach. Zelenskyy and Republicans on Capitol Hill have argued that funneling more military equipment into Ukraine sooner would have made a difference in the conflict. Experts aren't so certain. ""We could have just sped up the invasion timeline,"" countered Reach. ""No Russian president is ever going to allow Ukraine to become a U.S. aircraft carrier—meaning Ukraine becomes a platform for military capability that could threaten Russia. If they felt that scenario was playing out, they probably would have intervened."" ""Until Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, I think there was adequate caution in trying not to engage in anything that might provoke this scenario,"" said Lohsen. ""What we got wrong collectively was the belief that Putin could be deterred."" Could the conflict spiral beyond Ukraine? Despite the great pains taken to avoid escalation, many predict it's only a matter of time before the discord metastasizes further into Europe -- and perhaps even beyond the continent. Hamilton points out that while Moldova -- a small country abutting Ukraine's southern border -- has already seen a surge of refugees fleeing the fighting, it could also become a launching pad for Russian troops closing in on Odesa. ""Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe,"" Hamilton said. ""We already have a humanitarian crisis, and we could have a next crisis of military escalation involving troops coming not just from Belarus and Russia, but also from Moldova. That's very problematic."" And while Western powers attempt to walk a tightrope while supplying aid to Ukraine, whether they are ultimately drawn into the fight depends in part on Russia's reaction. ""The question has been would Russia try to preempt some arm transfers at the point of origin—like firing missiles into Poland at bases where they thought this military equipment was housed,"" said Reach, noting that while that would be at the severe end of the spectrum, the Kremlin could also retaliate with asymmetric attacks, like cyberstrikes. While escalatory, Reach believes it's a move Moscow could ultimately make. ""There are potentially large tradeoffs for Russia that they'd have to think long and hard about,"" he said.",7
2022-03-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-tells-democrats-job-selling-agenda-ahead-midterms/story?id=83366842,Biden tells House Democrats to do better job selling agenda ahead of midterms,"The last time Democrats gathered in-person for a caucus retreat, in 2019, the House majority crafted an agenda centered on plans for a bipartisan infrastructure bill and lowering prescription drug prices. Three years later, with full control of Congress and the White House, but facing historic headwinds in the midterm elections, an ongoing pandemic and record-high inflation, Democrats argued that they had a substantive record to sell to voters, even if their agenda remained unfinished. ""If our agenda is incomplete it doesn't mean we are broken, it means we have to keep working,"" Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of House Democrats' campaign committee, told reporters Thursday. ""We know what the stakes are."" Last year, President Joe Biden signed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan into law with bipartisan support, clearing the way for repairs to America's aging roads, bridges and airports and new investments in broadband. But the larger social policy plan has been stuck on Capitol Hill, with progressives in the House and several moderate Democrats in the Senate at odds over its scope and scale. In his State of the Union speech, Biden, who traveled to Philadelphia on Friday to address the caucus, reframed his policy agenda as a plan to fight inflation, and urged lawmakers to revisit lowering prescription drug and child care costs. In remarks to the caucus on Friday, Biden also said Democrats need to do a better job of explaining their agenda to voters. ""The American people who are just trying to stay above water don't understand this,"" he said. ""You tell them about the American Rescue Plan, and they say 'What the hell are you talking about?'"" The president also touted the progress his administration has made in reducing the deficit -- though it was not as well-received as some of his other talking points -- given progressive frustrations about resistance from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and others to the caucus's agenda. Huddling after a bruising spending bill fight over coronavirus funds that delayed the start of their retreat, Democrats held several sessions with guest speakers and experts on reaching seniors and young voters, national security and immigration. ""We just have to figure it out and see what's possible,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a leading progressive, said Thursday. ""The hard reality of 50 votes in the Senate and 218 votes in the House is the reality we'll have to focus in on."" Biden argued, as many presidents do, that the upcoming midterms would be the ""most important off-year election in modern history,"" warning that defeat in both chambers would leave him only with ""a veto pen."" Maloney, who gave members a presentation on the midterm outlook for the party, acknowledged to reporters that although the president's party traditionally loses seats in the midterm elections, Democrats are campaigning on more favorable terrain thanks to unexpected redistricting results that created more districts that were won by Biden in the previous election. ""We came out of redistricting with a better map than the one through which we currently hold the majority,"" Maloney said, while also acknowledging that Republicans are supported by outside political groups that have outraised their Democratic counterparts. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, D-N.M., argued that Democrats also have a positive story to tell voters about the state of the pandemic, and can sell the benefits of the American Rescue Plan, the massive Democratic stimulus effort pumped into the economy after the election. ""In November of 2020 it was dark, we could not be with our families, and COVID was raging,"" she told ABC News. ""Now, a year and three months later, we are able to be with family and gather."" Leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus laid out new plans to unveil proposed executive actions that the Biden administration could take to address unfinished agenda items on policing and voting rights, which have also stalled in Congress given GOP opposition and the 50-50 split Senate. Democratic Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., held out hope that some voting measures Democrats have pushed for could also be included in any potential reforms to the Electoral Count Act put forward by a bipartisan group of senators. For their part, Republicans have continued to hammer Biden and Democrats over rising gas prices and inflation, unveiling new ads targeting swing-district Democrats and predicting that prices will only increase given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Democrats repeatedly acknowledged the problem of inflation and rising prices but have attempted in recent days to reframe soaring gas prices as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- and a sacrifice that Americans should be prepared to make as the West sanctions Russia and supports Ukraine's democratic government under attack. ""What is the price that we as individuals will want to contribute in solidarity with the Ukrainian people?"" Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Calif., the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said Thursday. ""If it means paying a few extra cents at the gas tank, then we're willing to pay that."" Maloney also told Democrats they need to think more carefully about how they communicate with voters. ""We need to talk like real people, and pass what I call the Maloney brothers test: If you go home for Thanksgiving and your brothers think you sound like a jerk -- you know, what your grade point average was -- it doesn't matter to them. You have to show up and be a human being,"" he said. The president's role in the midterms, Maloney said, is to be the ""strong, decent man"" who ""crushed"" his State of the Union address and is ""leading the world to stand up to Russian aggression.""

2022-03-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/white-house-plan-eases-access-covid-19-pills/story?id=83373765,White House plan eases access to COVID-19 pills – but potential roadblocks loom,"Inside hundreds of pharmacies across the country, high-risk Americans who test positive for COVID-19 have been told they will soon be able to find and fill a prescription for oral medication directly at the store. The new White House ""test to treat"" program, touted as a one-stop shop for antiviral pills from Pfizer and Merck, aims to create a free and streamlined approach to get sick people the lifesaving care they need, when they need it. Although Pfizer and Merck's COVID-19 pills were authorized in December, scarce supply has made them difficult to access. Major pharmacies have already begun ordering their new ""test to treat"" supply directly from the federal government, and anticipate being able to start as early as this week. CVS will offer end-to-end access to the pills at their nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as soon as this week, spokesperson Matthew Blanchette told ABC News, while a Walgreens spokesperson said patients will be able to get the antiviral pills at ""select stores"" where provider partners are available to assess and prescribe medication. The idea is for everyday Americans to be able to visit their local pharmacy for a rapid test, and if positive, ""you can be treated right there on the spot,"" said Dr. Simone Wildes, an infectious disease expert from South Shore Health. As clinic doors open to this new initiative, however, numerous puzzle pieces must align to ensure the smooth rollout the president has hoped for. ""We're leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone's needs as we move forward,"" President Joe Biden said of the plan during his State of the Union address last week, emphasizing his administration has ""ordered more pills than anyone in the world has."" The program's promised scope hinges on sufficient participating locations and drug supplies. And in a development that could jeopardize the program's future, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced this week that COVID-19 funding would be stripped from an upcoming government funding and Ukraine emergency aid package -- an element hotly contested by some members. Without this additional pandemic funding, the White House has warned there could be ""dire"" consequences: the U.S. could run out of pill supplies by the end of the summer. The government has so far purchased 20 million doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 pill, Paxlovid, although it's not expected to be widely available until later this spring. And there are other hurdles. Test to treat's reach is bounded by the requirement that there must be a prescribing health care provider on site, a feature at a fraction of the tens of thousands of pharmacies in the country. Some pharmacy groups have chafed against the required authority, like a nurse practitioner or physician's assistant, who must prescribe the pills on-site. ""We were anticipating something that would really have an impact on the pandemic and on patients being able to access medications and instead we're underwhelmed with the missed opportunity of what this could have been,"" said Michael Ganio, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists' senior director of pharmacy practice and quality. While the plan is a step in the right direction, ""further action is needed"" to enhance equity and access, National Association of Chain Drug Stores' President and CEO Steven Anderson said, adding that the current test-to-treat plan ""does not leverage fully the health and wellness professionals and access points in America's pharmacies."" Conversely, the American Medical Association called the plan ""well-intentioned"" but that it ""oversimplifies challenging prescribing decisions by omitting knowledge of a patient's medical history, the complexity of drug interactions, and managing possible negative reactions."" The drugs are not appropriate for everyone. Merck's Molnupiravir, for example, is not recommended during pregnancy or for minors, while Pfizer's Paxlovid runs the risk of negatively interacting with other commonly prescribed drugs, including medicines that manage heart conditions and cholesterol, and those with severe kidney or liver problems. Another issue, doctors say, is that patients will need to start taking the pills within days of developing symptoms, which means participating stores need to be convenient enough to access quickly, and with enough rapid tests to diagnose in time. To connect patients with convenient pickup sites, the government is developing a website to help people find a site near them, set to launch later this month. ""The biggest issue is making sure that you get seen and diagnosed rapidly because you've got a five-day window of opportunity for Paxlovid to be optimally effective,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an infectious disease physician. ""If you're a high-risk individual, you want to make the diagnosis as quickly as possible,"" said Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Hospital. ""And then make contact with a health care provider."" ABC News' Trish Turner, Cheyenne Haslett, Sony Salzman and Anne Flaherty contributed to this report.",25

What he hasn't done, though, is make for an easy ending to the current conflict. That means more complicated questions ahead for the president, along with more opportunities for politics to collide with national security realities. The Biden administration's decision not to help Ukraine get Russian-made fighter jets offered up by Poland is just a taste of why staying out of a war you want over is easier said than done. U.S. officials have confirmed reports of civilians being targeted and children being killed as part of Russia's unprovoked invasion. Notably, a White House that has officials senior enough to remember the history of red lines is not engaging in hypotheticals about whether anything would change in the U.S. stance if Putin uses chemical or biological weapons. Biden's moves are already giving Republicans a fresh dose of their own unity on Ukraine: ""Enough talk. People are dying. Send them the planes that they need,"" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said Thursday. Without drawing any new lines, the president was again clear about what the outcome of this war must be: ""Ukraine will never, never be a victory for Putin,"" Biden said Thursday. But it might still be that only the United States can guarantee that outcome. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper A Florida bill that places restrictions on classroom instruction and workplace training around issues of race is heading to Gov. Ron DeSantis' desk for signage. Florida's H.B. 7, often referred to as the ""Stop Woke Act,"" bans lessons that make a student or employee feel they bear ""personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of actions, in which the individual played no part, committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin."" Once signed into law, students or employees can seek damages under Florida's civil rights laws. Republicans have framed the bill as being about ""individual freedom."" ""This bill is not about individual freedom. This is a continuation of a national agenda to whitewash history all because we don't want white children to feel uncomfortable about true Black history,"" said Florida state Sen. Shevrin Jones during debate. Jones is Black. The language in the bill mimics that of bills considered in dozens of other states across the country that have taken aim at what Republicans call ""critical race theory."" It also comes after the Florida Senate passed a bill dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill by critics. It limits instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation and creates legal liability for schools by allowing parents to sue if LGBTQ issues are taught. DeSantis, who is up for reelection in November and is considered a potential 2024 presidential contender, often defends these kinds of efforts. ""The 'woke' is the new religion of the left,"" DeSantis said at CPAC in late February. ""It's about tearing up the fabric of our society and trying to replace it with something that will be much, much more sinister."" The TIP with Alisa Wiersema With the impact of the 2020 Census results still playing out through some states' redistricting efforts, the Census Bureau announced Thursday it had undercounted Hispanic, Black and Native American populations. The bureau also said it overcounted whites and Asian Americans. Census Bureau Director Robert L. Santos noted that the ""results show statistical evidence that the quality of the 2020 Census total population count is consistent with that of recent censuses,"" which he said is ""notable, given the unprecedented challenges of 2020."" Santos also acknowledged the recent findings involve ""many of the same population groups we have historically undercounted."" Upon the release of the new information, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, who serves as chair of the House Oversight Committee, said the updated findings show Latinos -- who accounted for more than half of the nation's population growth in 2020 -- were undercounted at three times the rate of the 2010 Census. ""Now these communities could miss out on funding for critical services and suffer diluted representation at every level of government from Congress to school board,"" Maloney said. A total of 18.8 million people weren't counted -- triple the margin of a decade ago -- indicating an apparent worsening trend. Advocates had been long calling for the census process to be re-examined to better account for the country's diverse population, and now it remains to be seen whether changes will be implemented in the next decade. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 71. That's the percentage of Russians who said they approved of President Vladimir Putin in a February poll conducted by the Levada-Center, a respected independent pollster in the country. Notably, Putin's approval rating has never slipped below 59% in the Levada-Center's data either. But as FiveThirtyEight's Kaleigh Rogers writes, there's reason to think the war in Ukraine might change Putin's popularity at home, given the economic realities of the sanctions and the public protests against the war.

""Look, this is the third now military facility or airfield that the Russians had struck in western Ukraine in just the last couple of days,"" Kirby told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz, on Sunday. ""So, clearly, at least from an airstrike perspective, they're broadening their target sets."" The Yavoriv International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, located about 10 miles from Poland and an hour west of Lviv, sustained damage from the airstrike. Lviv Gov. Maksym Kozytskiy said at least 35 people were killed and another 134 injured during the attack on the Ukrainian military training base. Kirby confirmed no Americans were present. Raddatz followed up, citing Ukraine's defense minister calling the strike ""a terror attack near the NATO border"" and ""saying action must be taken to stop this, close the sky."" ""Could a no-fly zone have stopped this?"" she asked. ""No, I don't think so,"" Kirby responded. ""Look, I mean, no-fly zone has a nice air policing kind of sound to it. But I participated in one as a young officer on an aircraft carrier way back in the early '90s. It is combat. You have to be willing to shoot and to be shot at."" He added that U.S. troops in Ukraine ""leads to war with Russia."" Raddatz asked, ""If those attacks on military supply centers cross into Poland -- and I know that is a fear of the United States and the NATO allies -- what changes? Kamala Harris just reaffirmed the pledge -- the Article 5 pledge -- to defend NATO members. If they strike in Poland, what happens?"" ""We take our Article 5 commitment very seriously and the vice president was pretty firm about that on her recent visit, so has been [Defense] Secretary [Lloyd] Austin,"" Kirby answered. ""An armed attack against one is considered an armed attack against all. That is why, Martha, we continue to flow and to move and to reposition forces and capabilities along NATO's eastern flank to make sure that we can defend every inch of NATO territory if we need to."" ""Now, there's no reason we should need to because there's no reason that there should be war in Ukraine as it is, and we've made it very clear to Russia that NATO territory will be defended not just by the United States, but by our allies,"" Kirby later added. ""But this was just 10 miles from that border,"" Raddatz pressed again, saying, ""I just crossed that border the other day. Doesn't this change the way you look at things? They're getting closer and closer to our NATO allies."" ""I can tell you that we have been consistently concerned about NATO's eastern flank and that airspace and, of course, that ground space on that flank of NATO. And we continue to look for ways to bolster the defenses of our NATO allies,"" Kirby said. The U.N. Security Council scheduled a meeting Friday at Russia's request to discuss the unfounded Russian claim that the U.S. is working with Ukraine on developing biochemical weapons, an allegation the Biden administration has vehemently denied. ""It is of the Russian playbook that that which they accuse you of they're planning to do now,"" Kirby said. ""Now, again, we haven't seen anything into it indicates some sort of imminent chemical or biological attack right now, but we're watching this very, very closely."" On Friday, President Joe Biden said Russia ""would pay a severe price"" if any biochemical weapons are utilized during the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. But as Ukrainian leaders plead for a no-fly zone over their country, Markian Lubkivskyi, an adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister, said during an earlier ""This Week"" interview that Ukraine was ""still waiting for the weapons, for the aircraft, for the anti-air systems to protect Ukrainians from the air."" Kirby, however, said assistance would ""continue to flow"" to the country. ""The kinds of things we know they most need, the kinds of things that they're using so well, we're going to continue to help get them into their hands. And we know that it is working, that they are receiving them and they are using them."" ""I mean they have impressed everybody around the world and certainly they have impressed the Russians who have been increasingly flummoxed and frustrated about their lack of progress because of this Ukrainian resistance,"" he added.",7
2022-03-13,https://abcnews.go.com/US/americans-remain-critical-bidens-handling-inflation-support-ban/story?id=83409068,"Americans remain critical of Biden's handling of inflation, support ban on Russian oil: POLL","Americans overwhelmingly support the White House's proposed ban on Russian oil, though they remain very critical of President Joe Biden's handling of the economy, in general, and inflation, in particular, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll. Over the past several months, Americans' wallets have been hit by skyrocketing inflation, and now, Biden is feeling that crunch in his approval numbers. Seventy percent of Americans disapprove of his handling of inflation. The White House faces similarly concerning numbers related to economic recovery, with 58% disapproving, a 12-month high, per the ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel. This presents a political problem for Biden, who must navigate an electorate growing more frustrated across several sectors, while attempting to manage an exploding war in Europe with firmness and authority. The numbers for Biden's handling of Ukraine are slightly better, with a 48%-51% approval-disapproval split. When it comes to who is responsible for the hostilities, 4 out of 5 Americans pin ""a great deal"" of blame for the war on Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to ABC News/Ipsos data. Fewer assign ""a great deal"" of blame to Biden (16%) or former President Donald Trump (13%). Even fewer -- only 6% -- put a ""great deal"" of responsibility on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. With Putin's ownership of the war, Biden has tried to cast the Russian leader as responsible for the challenges Americans are facing at the gas pump and in the grocery store, drawing ire from Republicans who pin the fault for these ills squarely on the White House. ""Make no mistake, inflation's largely the fault of Putin,"" Biden said Friday at a meeting of House Democrats in Philadelphia. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing earlier this month: ""The reason why the price of gas is going up is not because of steps the president has taken, they are because President Putin is invading Ukraine, and that is creating a great deal of instability in the global marketplace."" But many senior members of the GOP, despite their commitments to back a White House ban of Russian oil, simply aren't buying the administration's inflation rational, and instead blame Biden and his administration for an ""over reliance"" on foreign energy sources and early administrative climate change measures like the shuttering of the Keystone Pipeline coupled with stopping new oil and gas leases on federal property. ""These are not Putin gas prices. They are President Biden gas prices,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted Friday. Still, Biden's defense may face challenges with the American people. According to ABC News/Ipsos data, 70% of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of gas prices, though even more respondents -- 77% -- support his proposal to ban Russian oil, even if it means paying more at the pump. The public is divided on a hypothetical no-fly zone over Ukraine, a provocation toward Russia that White House officials signaled they are not considering at this time. Thirty-one percent support a no-fly zone, while 34% oppose it and another 34% do not know their stance on such an action. Both this and the question on banning Russian oil imports yielded rare partisan unity, with similar levels of support, opposition and uncertainty among self-described Republicans, Democrats and independents. Regarding banning oil imports, 88% of Democrats, 72% of Republicans and 78% of independents supported the notion, while 12% of Democrats, 27% of Republicans, and 22% of independents oppose. Meanwhile, Americans are warming to Biden's handling of other issues that have faded from the news cycle due to the escalating war. As mask and vaccine mandates wane across every state, regardless of political leanings, Biden is seeing an uptick in approval of his handling of COVID-19 to 56%, up six points from January. He's also seen a similar bump in his handling of crime, which now stands at 40% approval. This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted using Ipsos Public Affairs' KnowledgePanel® March 11-12, 2022, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 622 adults with an oversample of LGBTQ+ respondents weighted to their correct proportion in the general population.

She was captured in a powerful photo taken by an Associated Press photographer after a Russian airstrike destroyed the hospital. She was carried out from the rubble of the hospital on a stretcher. In the now internationally known photo, the woman can be seen covered in dust, holding her lower abdomen as she was carried through the wreckage. She died after medics at a nearby hospital attempted to save her and her baby's life. Her name is not yet known, according to the Associated Press, as her body was taken by her husband and father. According to reporter Asya Dolina from Voice of America, AP photographer Evgeny Maloletka, who took the photos of the woman, also confirmed her death. Another pregnant woman evacuated from the wreckage, Marianna Podgurskaya, gave birth to a girl Sunday, Dolina said Ukrainian officials said the attack initially killed at least three people, including a child, and wounded at least 17 people. Mariupol deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said that at least 1,207 people have died in the city because of shelling and aerial attacks since the Russian invasion began. Half of those killed were ethnic Russians. Among the casualties was a child who died from dehydration, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy had posted a video on social media last Wednesday, which he said showed the heavily damaged children's hospital and maternity ward in the southeastern Ukrainian port city. ""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,"" he said, calling on the international community again to impose a ""no-fly"" zone over Ukraine. ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?"" The city has been burying its dead in a mass grave on the outskirts of Mariupol as it endures heavy shelling, officials said. ABC News' Meredith Deliso and Yulia Drozd contributed to this report.",22
2022-03-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/limits-emerge-blame-putin-politics-note/story?id=83419232,Limits emerge to blame-Putin politics: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Count this in Democrats' favor: Americans are blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine, and they are also backing President Joe Biden's move to ban Russian oil imports -- even if that means higher gas prices. Count this in another direction: Americans are blaming Biden for inflation, gas prices and the economy broadly -- and remain divided on how the president is handling the crisis in Ukraine. Those twin sets of findings from the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll point to political perils for Biden and the Democratic Party that are separate from the national security challenges that are themselves growing in urgency. The poll found 77% of Americans overall and 72% of Republicans backing the concept of banning Russian oil, even when asked in the context of the impact on gas prices. Only 31% of Americans give Biden either a ""good amount"" or a ""great deal"" of blame for the war; 34% assign that level of blame to former President Donald Trump, who's been out of office for nearly 14 months. But Biden's standing on issues of economic fallout is wobbly at best. Asked as two separate questions in this poll, 70% disapprove of his handling of both gas prices and inflation, while 58% disapprove of his handling of the economic recovery. The White House hasn't been subtle in assigning blame for economic challenges to Putin, via hashtags and more: ""Make no mistake, inflation's largely the fault of Putin,"" the president told House Democrats on Friday. There's reason to think blaming Putin could be effective in the kind of midterm messaging the president is outlining. There's also reason to think that won't be nearly enough to insulate Democrats from voters' backlash over higher prices. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As he prepares to sign it into law, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is doubling down on his support for what critics have dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. DeSantis criticized the Walt Disney Company for its announcement of a pause on political donations in the state in response to the bill's passage, calling the company ""woke."" ""We are hard at work creating a new framework for our political giving that will ensure our advocacy better reflects our values,"" wrote Disney CEO Bob Chapek in a memo to employees Friday. ""And today, we are pausing all political donations in the state of Florida pending this review."" The Walt Disney Company is the parent company of ABC News. The bill, officially named the Parental Rights in Education Bill, passed Florida's Senate on Tuesday and would restrict discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in the classroom. It would also allow parents to sue if LGBTQ issues are taught. The latest ABC News/Ipsos poll found that more than six in 10 Americans oppose legislation that would prohibit classroom lessons about sexual orientation or gender identity in elementary school. Georgia Republicans recently introduced a similar bill in the state legislature. Both bills are a part of a deluge of controversial LGBTQ-related proposals put forth by Republican lawmakers in states across the country. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema President Donald Trump held a rally in South Carolina over the weekend where he called on supporters to oust two incumbent Republicans in the state's June primary. So far, Trump has issued seven endorsements of House challengers, five of whom will be going up against lawmakers who voted in favor of his impeachment. Out of the seven, two challengers are targeting South Carolina Reps. Nancy Mace and Tom Rice. Rice was among the 10 House Republicans to vote for Trump's impeachment, and although Mace did not vote to impeach the former president, she repeatedly condemned Trump's role in inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump is throwing his support behind former state Rep. Katie Arrington who is challenging Mace. He's also backing current state Rep. Russell Fry, who is aiming to replace Rice. Both candidates attended Trump's weekend rally in Florence. But at least one South Carolina incumbent is heading into the primary fight with a high-profile endorsement of their own -- the day before the rally, Mace announced former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had raised more than $300,000 on her behalf. In addition to her South Carolina roots, Haley also served as U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration and is seen as a possible 2024 contender. However, despite criticizing Trump after the Jan. 6 riot, Haley went on to say last April that she ""would not run if President Trump ran, and I would talk to him about it."" NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 28. That's the number of censures county Republican and Democratic parties issued in 2021, and as FiveThirtyEight contributor Seth Masket writes, the majority of these censures (23) were issued by local Republican parties, targeting officials who either voted to impeach former President Trump or failed to challenge the 2020 presidential election result. Twenty-eight censures out of 3,000-plus counties in the U.S. might not sound like a lot, but it still marks a huge uptick from previous years when local parties issued one or two censures at most.

2022-03-15,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-1st-cuts-covid-efforts-hit-americans/story?id=83447485,White House says 1st cuts to COVID efforts will hit Americans next week as funding stalls in Congress,"Americans will feel the impact of cuts to the U.S. COVID response as early as next week, the White House said Tuesday in a letter to congressional leaders, as efforts to get more funding sit stalled. This letter is the latest push on behalf of the White House to try to persuade Congress that the U.S. desperately needs more COVID-relief money. So far, those pleas have not had much success. The funding crunch comes as cases of the BA.2 variant, a more transmissible strain of omicron, rise in other countries. ""With cases rising abroad, scientific and medical experts have been clear that in the next couple of months we could see rising cases of COVID-19 here in the United States as well,"" White House COVID coordinator Jeff Zients and acting director of the Office of Management and Budgets Shalanda Young wrote in the letter, which was obtained by ABC News. ""Waiting to provide funding until we’re in a surge will be too late,"" they wrote. The letter was sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and others. The most immediate impacts of the COVID relief running dry will be felt by uninsured Americans, who will no longer be able to submit claims for tests or COVID treatments starting next week, senior administration officials told reporters earlier on Tuesday. In two weeks, claims to cover vaccinations will no longer be accepted -- meaning the program that has been covering people without insurance throughout the pandemic will effectively end. Anyone seeking monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID will also face a tougher battle starting next week, officials said, when the government plans to cut supplies to states by 30%. And a new purchase for hundreds of thousands more monoclonal antibody treatments, planned for March 25, will be canceled, senior officials said. Making those cuts now will keep the U.S. monoclonal antibody supply on-hand until late May, officials said, when they predict the U.S. will fully run out of antibody treatments. ""These are immediate, near-term consequences, some of which we're having to act on this week, next week, and the first week of April. So time is not on our side. We need the funding immediately,"" one senior administration official said. Biden and his administration have warned for weeks that there was not enough money left to support critical COVID-19 response efforts, including testing at the current pace, purchasing more COVID-19 treatments and acquiring more booster shots. The administration officially requested $22.5 billion earlier this month, but the request was chiseled down to around $15 billion before it was cut entirely from the latest funding bill last week, leaving government relief efforts strained. Officials on Tuesday also warned about a faltering defense against any new variants, if more funding isn't granted by Congress. Lack of funding will hamper USAID efforts to vaccinate people abroad, officials said, meaning that ""large unvaccinated populations worldwide will increase the risk of new deadly emerging variants emerging that could evade our current vaccines and treatments."" And in the instance of a new variant, the U.S. would not have the money to buy new variant-specific vaccines for all Americans to get vaccinated, if that becomes necessary, officials warned. Research on new vaccines and treatments will also be affected by cuts, officials said, including progress on a pan-coronavirus vaccine, which could protect against a range of variants. On testing capacity, the administration said that current domestic supply will get Americans through June, despite earlier warnings that Americans would see less testing availability starting this month. ""Without additional funding, we do not have the ability to maintain our domestic testing capacity beyond June,"" a senior administration official said. ""And because it takes months of ramp up to rebuild capacity, failure to invest now will leave us less prepared for any potential future surges. So, providing funding only when cases rise is far too late to make a difference,"" the official said, noting that the U.S. felt the impact of that mistake firsthand during the omicron surge. But for now, the path forward for COVID-19 relief is murky. Approval for more funding hinges on agreement from Republicans in the Senate, who oppose more spending and say they weren't given clear warning on the need for more money until too recently. ""Before we would consider supporting an additional $30 billion for COVID-19 relief, Congress must receive a full accounting of how the government has already spent the first $6 trillion,"" a group of 25 Republican senators wrote in a letter to the White House in early March. But Democrats in the House were also splintered last week after leadership agreed to dip into funding that was already allotted to state governments to cover the latest request. On Tuesday, a senior administration official steered clear of any specific advice for Congress to get the funding approved, but said there is ""precedent"" for bipartisan support for COVID relief under the previous administration.",26
2022-03-15,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-head-brussels-week-show-unity-nato-leaders/story?id=83458613,Biden to head to Brussels next week for show of unity with NATO leaders,"President Joe Biden will travel to Brussels next week to meet with NATO leaders in his first European visit since Russian President Vladimir Putin started invading Ukraine, the White House announced Tuesday. At the show of unity on March 24, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden will ""reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies."" His trip follows the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic heading to Kyiv on Tuesday, as shelling continues there, in a show of support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy despite the danger on the ground. Just before the White House announcement, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted, ""I have convened an extraordinary Summit on 24 March at #NATO HQ. We will address #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO's deterrence & defence. At this critical time, North America & Europe must continue to stand together."" Biden will also join a scheduled European Council summit ""to discuss our shared concerns about Ukraine, including transatlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those affected by the violence and address other challenges related to the conflict,"" Psaki said. The goal of Biden's trip to Brussels will be to meet ""face-to-face"" with his European counterparts to assess Russia's invasion of Ukraine, she said. ""We've been incredibly aligned to date. That doesn't happen by accident,"" Psaki added. ""The president's a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy. So, it's an opportunity to do exactly that."" She said that the NATO meeting is the ""real focus right now,"" and wouldn't say if Biden will be making additional stops in Poland or to meet with refugees. Nearly three million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Russia fired a barrage of missiles into Western Ukraine over the weekend, hitting a large military base near the Polish border and raising concerns an attack could hit neighboring NATO ally Poland, potentially triggering an Article 5 response. Zelenskyy is scheduled to deliver a rare and historic, virtual address on Wednesday to members of Congress, which Biden will be watching, Psaki said. In an address to Canada’s Parliament Tuesday, Zelenskyy wasn’t shy to call out Prime Minister Justin Trudeau by name in an emotional appeal for more help to Ukraine. While the U.S. has imposed a slate of economic and trade sanctions to isolate Putin, it's unclear what still remains available at the Biden administration's disposal since it has said there would be no no-fly zone, no U.S. troops in Ukraine and no help in delivering planes that NATO ally Poland wants to get to Ukrainians.

2022-03-15,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-boxed-red-lines-ukraine-note/story?id=83440994,White House getting boxed in by red lines on Ukraine: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein For all the U.S. has done to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin, the list of what the Biden administration won't do continues to grow: There will be no no-fly zone, no U.S. troops defending Ukraine, no help in delivering planes that Poland wants to get to Ukrainians. There's likely to be more that Ukraine wants that the U.S. won't give. That figures to be a theme out of the extraordinary virtual speech to Congress that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to deliver Wednesday. The White House is bristling at questions about ""red lines"" and hypothetical situations. But defining the American reaction by what it is not and will not be has ramifications of its own. Asked by ABC White House Correspondent Mary Bruce to detail the promised ""severe consequences"" Russia might face if it uses chemical weapons, press secretary Jen Psaki said that won't be outlined in advance: ""There's no question if Russia were to decide to use chemical weapons there would be a severe reaction from the global community."" Other nations -- think North Korea, Iran and China -- are watching President Joe Biden's actions closely. And Putin himself, of course, has not so far been deterred by the unity and strong actions taken to date by the U.S. in conjunction with other nations. In outlining midterm messaging for House Democrats on Friday, Biden talked up what he is doing, and also detoured into a revealing a few sentences about what this moment cannot bring: ""The idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand -- and don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say -- that's called World War III,"" the president said. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Controversial anti-abortion bills proposed by Republican lawmakers in Missouri include measures that, if enacted, would go even further than Texas' near-total abortion ban. Missouri's H.B. 2810 would make it a felony to traffic ""abortion-inducing devices or drugs"" or perform an abortion after a woman is 10-weeks pregnant, punishable by 10 years to life in prison. The bill would also apply to women with potentially life-threatening ectopic pregnancies in which the fetus grows outside of the uterus. The bill's author, Republican state Rep. Brian Seitz, said during House debate that he didn't know what treatment for ectopic pregnancy entails. ""HB 2810 is dangerous. This is what it looks like when uneducated politicians try and legislate our bodies,"" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, in a statement. ""Ectopic pregnancies, if not treated promptly, become life-threatening. Banning any provision of care related to ectopic pregnancies will put people's lives at risk."" Separately, an amendment to several abortion-related bills creates legal liability for those seeking abortions out of state. It would allow lawsuits against those who aid, abet, perform, or induce abortions ""on a resident or citizen of Missouri, regardless of where the abortion is or will be performed."" ""If your neighboring state doesn't have pro-life protections, it minimizes the ability to protect the unborn in your state,"" said Republican state Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, who wrote the amendment. Missouri Senate leadership has said H.B. 2810 has little chance of passage. The amendment that seeks to restrict out-of-state abortions is slated to be debated on the Missouri House floor. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema President Biden delivered remarks at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser Monday night in Washington, marking his first in-person fundraising event since taking office. The event coincided with his party gearing up for a tough midterm election season that in some cases has Democrats navigating intraparty divisions and weighing whether the president's public backing will translate into favorability from constituents. That equation has been recently complicated by polls showing a majority of voters disapproving of Biden's handling of gas prices and inflation. Although the vast majority of primary contests are still on the horizon, one Democrat who easily clinched a victory in the first midterm primary of the year appears to want the president to steer clear of his race. During an SXSW discussion over the weekend, Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke said he doesn't want Biden to weigh in on the race. ""I don't want Joe Biden or anyone else from outside of Texas, coming into this state to campaign for me or anyone else. This one is on us, the people of Texas. We are going to decide our future, our fortune, our fate,"" O'Rourke said. Although Biden has yet to acknowledge his former 2020 primary competitor's bid directly, the comment from O'Rourke is one of the first major efforts by a Democratic candidate to distance themselves from the White House this midterm cycle.

Despite the temperatures at the Arctic being below freezing, the region is one of the fastest warming places on the planet as a result of global warming. The melting ice makes the region more accessible, putting Russian nuclear and conventional naval forces even closer to the U.S. border. To test submarine systems and research initiatives in the region, the Navy established a temporary ice camp, known as Ice Camp Queenfish, on top of an ice floe in the Arctic Ocean. ""The Arctic region can be unforgiving and challenging like no other place on Earth,"" Rear Adm. Richard Seif, ranking officer of ICEX 2022, said in a press release. ""ICEX 2022 provides the Navy an opportunity to increase capability and readiness in this unique environment, and to continue establishing best practices we can share with partners and allies who share the U.S.’s goal of a free and peaceful Arctic,"" he said. The camp consists of shelters, a command center and infrastructure to house over 60 personnel, according to the press release. Under the ice and amid freezing temperatures, Navy divers and two American submarines, the USS Pasadena and USS Illinois, train in launching torpedoes as well as finding and evading enemy submarines. When the torpedoes are shot, the search and recovery team go under the ice to find them. Once located, a hole is drilled over the ice, and the team begins to recover the torpedo. The USS Pasadena, a Los Angeles class fast attack submarine with a steel reinforced sail, allows it to punch up through Arctic ice as thick as 5 feet or more. The Pasadena can be equipped with up to 20 torpedoes. Vice Adm. William Houston said the exercises ensure the submarine force is ready just in case any threat arises. ""I'm not concerned about really any threat. We are ready as a submarine force. We've all executed orders as directed by our civilian leadership"" he told ABC News. ""And we are postured and ready as always."" ""We continue to watch [Russia] every single day. We are on the frontlines. We are unseen,"" Houston added. ""And that's a good thing. Because the adversary, any adversary, doesn't know where we're at. And that's the key about the Submarine Force. It is the ultimate silent service. We're exceptionally stealthy, and we're watching all the time"" As temperatures rise, scientists will travel to the far northern region to work in conjunction with the Navy in studying the cracking and melting Arctic ice. ""It's more important than ever that as a scientific community we take this data and we start to really understand the whys of how it's happening, so that we can feed that back to the broader scientific community and eventually policymakers,"" Houston said. The camp, located 160 miles away from land, honors the first Sturgeon-class submarine to operate under ice -- the USS Queenfish (SSN-651). With ICEX 2022 underway, the Navy is confident it is ready for any potential threat. ""We have the largest nuclear submarine force in the world,"" Houston said. ""You have unprecedented mobility where you don’t need to come to the surface and you can stay submerged for as long as you want. Any adversary doesn't know where we're at. We're exceptionally stealthy, and we're watching all the time.""",7
2022-03-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tough-questions-ahead-ketanji-brown-jackson-scotus-hearings/story?id=83512270,Tough questions ahead for Ketanji Brown Jackson at SCOTUS hearings: The Note,"The TAKE with Averi Harper Monday will mark the beginning of hearings for the historic Supreme Court nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Jackson has been confirmed by the Senate three times, and this time around Democrats don't need Republican buy-in to complete her ascent to the nation's highest court. They only need a simple majority to confirm Jackson, and if Democrats are unified in this 50-50 Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris could serve as the tie-breaking vote if needed. That slim Democratic majority, however, won't shield Jackson from tough lines of questioning on matters pertaining to her personal affiliations, like her ties to Harvard as the court prepares to hear a case challenging the university's use of race as a factor in undergraduate admissions, and her past professional experiences, including representing Guantanamo Bay detainees. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Sen. Dick Durbin has called for ""respectful and dignified hearings"" on Jackson, but that could be easier said than done. With several Republican committee members who could launch presidential bids in 2024, including Sens. Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley and Tom Cotton, there is plenty of potential for hearings to devolve into political theater. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema On the heels of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's emotional virtual address to Congress, on Thursday the House passed a bill ending normal trade relations with Russia and its ally, Belarus. The vote signaled the latest attempt by the U.S. government to crush Russia's economy amid the Kremlin's catastrophic invasion of Ukraine. In an overwhelming bipartisan move, the bill passed 424-8. The eight lawmakers in opposition were Republicans. The measure must still pass in the Senate before heading to President Joe Biden's desk for signature. If enacted, the legislation would allow the United States to raise tariffs on Russian and Belarusian products. Existing measures to punish Russia include bans on Russian oil and gas, as well as more than $13 billion in humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The move comes after Biden announced last week that the U.S., along with NATO allies, would revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status. Countries with that status agree to trade fairly with one another, though the designation is largely symbolic. The development helps build geopolitical momentum ahead of Biden's trip to Belgium next week, where he will attend the NATO leaders' summit. As stated by White House press secretary Jen Psaki, there the leaders will discuss ""ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine."" The TIP with Brittany Shepherd Democrats have an appetite for big change in national party tradition -- and Iowa may be next on the menu. Yesterday, New Jersey Democratic Party Chair LeRoy J. Jones Jr. wrote to Democratic National Committee Chair Jamie Harrison and pitched New Jersey for consideration as an early primary state that holds its presidential primary before Super Tuesday, ABC News has learned. Jones claims Jersey boasts a more cost-effective alternative for candidates and offers a diverse racial and geographical population more representative of the national party. ""Our party cannot cling to outdated traditions that do not help us reach new voters and motivate the diverse coalition of supporters needed to win elections and enact our pro-middle class agenda,"" Jones Jr. writes. Democrats have allowed changes to the early state calendar before, and challenges to the status quo -- plus desires to unseat Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus that ceremoniously unraveled at the start of the 2020 presidential contest -- have never been stronger. The DNC is now considering altering which states get early primary status, reportedly open to expanding the group from four to five and imposing new guidelines that would make it difficult for Iowa, a state with historic precedent but with waning relevance to the demographic makeup of the Democratic Party, to maintain its fabled placement.

2022-03-18,https://abcnews.go.com/International/egypts-newly-discovered-ancient-tombs-5000-years/story?id=83501789,"Egypt's newly discovered ancient tombs are nearly 5,000 years old","Egypt announced on Thursday the discovery of five ancient tombs in Saqqara, marking the latest in a series of discoveries in the vast necropolis south of Cairo. The stony tombs date back to the Old Kingdom (c.2700–2200 BC) and First Intermediate (c.2181–2055 BC) eras, Egypt's antiquities ministry said. They were excavated northeast of the Pyramid of Merenre, a 52.5 meters-tall structure that was built during the Sixth Dynasty. The tombs, which are engraved with colorful shapes, belong to ""top officials,"" the ministry added. Mostafa El-Waziri, the head of Egypt's Supreme Antiquities Council, said the first tomb belongs to an official named IRY. ""The tomb consists of a deep burial shaft leading to a chamber decorated with funerary scenes depicting offering tables, the seven oils and the façade of the palace. A limestone sarcophagus was also uncovered inside the tomb,"" he said in a statement. ""The second tomb belongs to a woman that could be the wife of a man named Yaret and it has a rectangular burial shaft while the third tomb belongs to Pepi Nefhany, who was the supervisor of the great house, a priest, and the purifier of the house. It has a six meters deep burial shaft."" El-Waziri said the fourth, also a six-meter deep burial shaft, belongs to a woman named Petty. She was the priest of Hathor, the goddess of fertility and love. ""The fifth is for a man named Henu, the overseer and the supervisor of the royal house. It consists of a rectangular seven meters deep burial shaft,"" El-Waziri added. ""More work and studies will be carried out to reveal more secrets of these tombs,"" he said. Egypt has carried out extensive digging operations in Saqqara in recent years, which resulted in a string of discoveries, including the unearthing of a 4,400-year-old tomb of royal priest Wahtye in 2018 and the discovery of hundreds of mummified animals and statues a year later. Last year, Egypt unearthed 52 burial shafts in Saqqara with more than 50 wooden coffins found inside. They date back 3,000 years, the oldest sarcophagi found in the ancient burial ground. They also discovered the funerary temple of Queen Nearit, the wife of King Teti -- the first pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt. Egypt is hoping the discoveries, along with the expected opening of a new mega museum near the Giza Pyramids later this year, will revive its vital tourism industry. Tourism was badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the last couple of years and could take a fresh battering because of Russia's attempted invasion of Ukraine, with citizens of both countries comprising a big chunk of visitors to Egypt. Up to 20,000 Ukrainians were stranded in Egypt's Red Sea resorts when Russia started its offensive against Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to the Ukrainian embassy in Egypt.",0
2022-03-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/30-companies-produce-generic-version-pfizers-covid-pill/story?id=83525981,More than 30 companies to produce generic version of Pfizer's COVID pill,"The United Nations-backed Medicines Patent Pool announced Thursday it has signed an agreement with 35 companies around the globe to produce generic versions of Pfizer's COVID-19 antiviral pill. The agreement will allow the treatment to be supplied to 95 low- and middle-income countries, home to more than half of the world's population, according to the MPP. Clinical trial data has shown the pill, sold under the brand name Paxlovid, reduces the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID by 89% if taken within three days of the onset of symptoms. Paxlovid is currently given as three pills twice daily over the course of five days. The pill will be easier to distribute to hard-to-reach areas than monoclonal antibodies, which are given intravenously and require a medical professional to administer the treatment. ""We have established a comprehensive strategy in partnership with worldwide governments, international global health leaders and global manufacturers to help ensure access to our oral COVID-19 treatment for patients in need around the world,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. The statement continued: ""The MPP sublicensees and the additional capacity for COVID-19 treatment they will supply will play a critical role to help ensure that people everywhere, particularly those living in the poorest parts of the world, have equitable access to an oral treatment option against COVID-19."" Paxlovid is made up of two medications: ritonavir, which is commonly used to treat HIV and AIDS, and nirmatrelvir, an antiviral that Pfizer developed to boost the strength of the first drug. Together, they prevent an enzyme the virus uses to make copies of itself inside human cells and spread throughout the body. According to the agreement, the companies will be able to take out sublicenses to produce raw ingredients of nirmatrelvir, co-package it with ritonavir or both steps. Six of the companies will produce the raw ingredients, nine companies will co-package it and the remaining companies will do both, the MPP said. The companies producing the drug span 12 countries including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, the Dominican Republic, Jordan, India, Israel, Mexico, Pakistan, Serbia, South Korea and Vietnam. The MPP said a license was offered to a 36th company in Ukraine, but it was unable to sign due to the war with Russia. Under the agreement, the 35 companies will not be required to pay Pfizer royalties as long as COVID-19 is classified as a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. However, after the emergency ends, the manufacturers will be able to sell their pills to low-income countries without royalties but will be subject to a 5% to 10% royalty for sales to middle-income countries. The MPP expects some of these companies could submit their drugs for regulatory review to health agencies in their home countries or to the WHO later this year. In January, the group signed a similar agreement with Merck for two dozen companies to produce a generic version of its COVID-19 pill, molnupiravir.",25
2022-03-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-xi-hold-high-stakes-call-china-stands/story?id=83525812,Biden warns Xi of 'consequences' if China aids Russian invasion of Ukraine,"In a high-stakes video call, President Joe Biden and China's President Xi Jinping spoke Friday morning for an hour and 50 minutes for the first time since November amid concerns that China will help Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Nearly four hours after the call ended, and hours after China put out its own version of events, the White House released a readout of the meeting. While lacking concrete details, the 164-word U.S. account stressed that Biden made clear the ""implications and consequences"" if China aligns with Russia and provides it ""material support"" for its attacks. ""President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia. He described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,"" the White House said. A readout from China, released ahead of the White House's, described the call as ""constructive"" -- a word the Biden administration did not use. A senior administration official described the video meeting as ""direct,"" ""substantive,"" and ""detailed,"" adding that Biden and Xi spend the ""preponderance of their time"" on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. After that official said Biden ""really wasn't making specific requests of China"" on the call and that he was, instead, ""laying out his assessment of the situation, what he thinks makes sense, and the implications of certain actions,"" ABC News Senior White House Correspondent asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki, ""Why not, given the stakes here?"" ""Because China has to make a decision for themselves about where they want to stand and how they want the history books to look at them and view their actions,"" Psaki replied. ""And that is a decision for President Xi and the Chinese to make."" Psaki said Biden ""made clear what the implications and the consequences would be if China provides material support to Russia"" -- a line she repeated throughout the briefing, but she would not elaborate on whether the U.S. views military or economic aid as more of a concern or which direction they could be leaning towards if they provide help. She also wouldn't say if Xi ever referred to Putin's war as an ""invasion,"" saying that the White House doesn't ""speak for other countries"" and the Chinese can ""speak for themselves."" According to China's readout, Xi told Biden the ""situation in Ukraine has developed to such a point that China does not want to see it. China has always advocated peace and opposed war."" But China has yet to directly condemn Russia for its actions in Ukraine. China supports negotiations, Xi said, but deferred to the U.S. and NATO to ""conduct dialogue with Russia to solve the crux of the Ukraine crisis and resolve the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine"" -- appearing to reaffirm China's view that the NATO expansion is the root cause of the war. The readout said Xi's used two Chinese idioms to Biden: ""One hand cannot clap,"" meaning the two sides need to come together to make any progress in ending the war, and, he said, ""Only the one who tied the bell to the tiger can untie it,"" implying that the U.S. and NATO will need to ""untie the bell"" themselves, and China will support efforts. China's president also criticized U.S. sanctions saying that it is the common people who suffer from them and that sanctions have the potential of triggering crises in the global economy, according to the readout White House press secretary Jen Psaki had said Biden would be candid and that the call provided a chance for him to ""assess where President Xi stands."" The conversation would center on ""managing the competition between our two countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine and other issues of mutual concern,"" according to the White House. Biden was expected to warn Xi that if China directly helps Russia in its assault on Ukraine there will be consequences -- but it's still unclear if he laid out specific actions the U.S. will take if China were to supply Russia with military equipment or economic assistance to offset the impact of global sanctions. In what appeared to be a warning shot to the West, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday that any foreign supplies to Ukraine containing military equipment will be considered ""legitimate targets"" for Russian strikes after Biden announced this week a slate of weapons the U.S. is supplying to Ukraine. ""We clearly said that any cargo moving into the Ukrainian territory which we would believe is carrying weapons would be fair game. This is clear because we are implementing the operation the goal of which is to remove any threat to the Russian Federation coming from the Ukrainian soil,"" Lavrov said in an English-language interview with the RT television channel. Ukrainians woke up Friday to the first strike on the outskirts city of Lviv, considered a safe haven until now, and not far from the Polish border. It follows a stark warning from the Pentagon that Russia was broadening its target and escalating attacks this week. While the Biden administration has hesitated from drawing red lines of what would change its position on not supporting a no-fly zone or troops on the ground in Ukraine, Lavrov's message raises concerns that Russia could fire at military bases in neighboring NATO ally Poland to Ukraine, triggering an Article 5 response. Earlier this week, national security adviser Jake Sullivan had a seven-hour meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Rome, which was described as ""intense."" A senior Biden administration declined to tell reporters whether China had expressed an openness to providing Russia with military or economic support or if it had already provided support to Russia since it invaded Ukraine. ""We do have deep concerns about China's alignment with Russia at this time, and the national security adviser was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions,"" the official said. That meeting had been ""long-planned"" and ""long-discussed"" as a way to maintain communication with China, but it happened to take place at ""a really timely and important moment in this crisis,"" the official added. Biden and Xi's critical call comes on the heels of Biden labeling Putin a ""war criminal,"" a ""murderous dictator,"" and a ""pure thug"" in the last 48 hours. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday he ""personally"" agrees with Biden that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine.

2022-03-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukrainian-sisters-bakery-raise-money-hurting-back-home/story?id=83395683,Ukrainian sisters use bakery to raise money for those hurting back home,"Vira Derun's parents live outside of Ukraine's capital Kyiv, where the threat of Russian bombs and missiles has become part of daily life. Her father fights in the Ukrainian army while her mother and grandmother defend their house and offer shelter to neighbors whose homes have been destroyed. Derun said she begged her family to come to the U.S. and to leave her childhood home, but they refused to use their American visas. To help raise money for those back in Ukraine, Derun and her sister, Anastasiia, started taking donations at their Washington, D.C., bakery, driven by a simple mindset. ""I would say to you,"" Derun told ABC News,""what my dad said to me when I begged him not to go: 'If I wouldn't, who would?'"" Derun and her sister own D Light Cafe & Bakery in Washington's close-knit Adams Morgan neighborhood. Recently, people lined up and down the block to support the bakery and Ukraine, she said, and in a week, Derun said the cafe raised $7,000 to support the Ukrainian cause. ""My mom, she is not an emotional woman,"" Derun explained, but said her mother has been weeping when Derun describes the support for the bakery's fundraising. ""She thanks everyone. She's like, 'please say how appreciative we are with that and see how much you're heroes that you're helping us.'"" Bill Lammers, a retired financial officer, said he has patronized D Light Cafe & Bakery since the day it opened. He and some neighbors supported a GoFundMe after an arson attack on the storefront a month ago. Now, people who can't make it to the store are using that same GoFundMe to support Ukraine. ""With COVID, we've seen a lot of people hurting, but this one being so specific with the war a lot of people have come up and stepped up,"" said Lammers. Clarice Gee visited the bakery for the first time on Tuesday. The retired nurse said she has in-laws in Ukraine and wanted to support the bakery and the Ukrainian troops. ""[The war is] impacting people in terms of having to relocate their lives, leaving their homes to businesses, families being separated. So, it is very difficult,"" said Gee. She said her support for the bakery is not a lot, but it's a show of support for the Ukrainian people. Reagan Bauer, a student at American University, said he was shopping in Adams Morgan for spring break when a friend pointed out that D Light Cafe & Bakery is Ukrainian-owned. ""As college kids, we don't have that much money to donate,"" said Bauer. ""Just coming to Ukrainian-owned businesses is a great way for us to support the cause."" While Derun said she is overwhelmed by the support, she says she cries constantly over children in her country being killed. ""You can rebuild the buildings, you can rebuild even the psychological part of the mind after war, it's fine,"" said Derun. ""There are psychologists and psychiatrists in medicine. But when you end a life, what? What wasn't a life at all like 6 years old? It's just unfair."" ""You don't you don't measure your life with the years; you measure your life in the lives you touch,"" she said. ""It's my responsibility to just save as many more children as I can.""",22
2022-03-19,https://abcnews.go.com/US/pigs-grunts-reveal-feeling-analysis/story?id=83551570,"Pigs' grunts reveal how they're feeling, new analysis says","A database of thousands of grunts, oinks, snuffles and squeals, gathered and recorded from hundreds of pigs at every stage of their lives, will be used to help farmers better understand their animals' emotional states and improve their welfare in the future, according to a new study. The researchers used an artificial intelligence system that determines with high accuracy whether the vocalizations made by pigs are expressions of positive or negative feelings, and even the circumstances where the sounds are made -- including situations such as nursing piglets, meeting their mothers or littermates, waiting around, being surprised, and huddling together. ""We decided to focus on pigs because they are very vocal,"" said animal behaviorist Elodie Briefer of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, who co-led the study published last week in the journal Scientific Reports. ""They grunt all the time."" It turns out that pigs are among the most talkative farm animals, so their vocalizations have often been studied to find out what they're saying. Briefer's team compiled 7,414 pig calls from 411 animals that had been recorded since 2013 by several different research groups. Some of the researchers had recorded the calls of newborn piglets, while others had studied the sounds made by piglets weaned from their mothers; others had recorded the sounds made by adult pigs in specific situations, such as when they were isolated or handled. Briefer and her colleagues then supplemented their database by identifying situations that were not covered by the earlier experiments. ""We checked which contexts we were missing that pigs would encounter during their lives -- for example, we added some more positive situations, and we also added some recordings from actual slaughterhouses,"" she said. ""And we also knew from the behavior of the pigs whether it was likely to represent a positive or a negative emotion."" The result is the most comprehensive audio database of pig grunts ever collected. ""We basically gathered so many contexts that we could cover almost the whole lives of pigs,"" Briefer said. The second stage of the study was determining how to make sense of the thousands of pig grunts in their database. The researchers compared two machine-learning methods that sorted through the grunts, classified each of them as either positive or negative, and tried to identify the situation where it was expressed. The database has 19 categories of contexts where pigs make distinctive grunts, including ""reunion,"" ""huddling,"" ""surprise,"" ""waiting"" and ""running"" -- but also ""fighting"" and ""castration."" The findings confirmed what was suggested by previous studies -- in general, high-pitched calls correspond to negative emotional states, while low-pitched calls correspond to positive states. But the researchers also observed a large number of calls that weren't easily categorized. For example, some high-pitched calls with short durations that didn't vary much in volume could actually be positive. In the end, the most accurate interpretation of what a pig grunt meant was obtained with a neural network that used images of the frequency of their calls compared to their duration (higher frequency calls are higher pitched, and lower frequency calls are lower pitched). The correct classifications had been made by observations when the calls were recorded, and the researchers found the neural network was able to determine whether a call was positive or negative more than 91% of the time and identify its context more than 81% of the time. ""We were really surprised to reach such high accuracy across such a huge number of calls and contexts, from the day pigs are born until the slaughterhouse,"" Briefer said. Such a high level of accuracy could be good news for pigs on farms -- the exact number is unknown, but there are estimated to be more than 650 million around the world. Briefer and her colleagues now intend to implement their pig grunt database in a software application that will monitor the vocalizations made in commercial pig herds and notify farmers when their animals express high levels of negative emotions, such as when piglets cry out that they are being crushed by their mother, a recurrent problem among pigs and one of the contexts that can be distinguished using the database. ""There have been many attempts at doing this for pigs before, but nothing quite as comprehensive as this paper,"" said animal behaviorist Alan McElligott of the City University of Hong Kong. McElligott wasn't involved in the latest study, but he's researched the vocalizations made by other farm animals, including goats, to learn more about how they express positive and negative emotions. The wide scope of the research was particularly valuable: ""It's really important to get a complete history of individual animals, from the early stage when they are piglets, to slaughter,"" he said. ""Then you can classify the differences, showing their vocalizations in stressed states compared to relatively content or happy states."" McElligott notes the welfare of pigs in commercial farms is a major concern worldwide. ""The numbers are huge,"" he said. ""This tool will allow us to improve the lives of these animals.""",25
2022-03-19,https://abcnews.go.com/International/abc-news-visual-verification-team-authenticates-photos-videos/story?id=83474955,How ABC News' Visual Verification team authenticates photos and videos from Ukraine conflict,"In the first few days of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a dramatic video purported to show an heroic Ukrainian fighter pilot shooting down a Russian jet. The problem was that it was completely fake. ABC News tracked the creator, who confirmed that it was made from a very realistic-looking flight simulator game called DCS that allows for cinematic footage to be captured. With both sides pushing propaganda and social media platforms that are designed to elevate the most emotional and dramatic images, it's essential to be especially careful when verifying content from this war. Below, we have outlined some of the internal fact-checks and processes that every image or video must pass before being published by ABC News. Provenance The verification process starts with discovery -- you can only verify the images you have. ABC News' Visual Verification team monitors curated lists of key accounts across all the major social media platforms, but probably most importantly for Ukraine, hundreds of Telegram channels where most of these videos first emerge publicly. Telegram is a social media platform founded in Russia but widely used in Eastern Europe, Turkey and is growing in popularity around the world. Once a video is found, the next challenge is to find the person who filmed it. We try to speak to that person and vet the source by asking questions about when, how and why they took the photo or video the same way any journalist vets a source. The content creator can send us original photo or video files which sometimes contain information called metadata or EXIF data, which can show the exact time and GPS coordinates where images are taken. Even though this data can be manipulated, it is generally reliable. However because most social media is first shared privately and then posted to Facebook, Instagram or Telegram anonymously it is very difficult to find the owner of the content in most cases. Reverse search The next step is to start analyzing the image itself. Most web browsers now have a reverse image search function built in which allows you to right-click on a photo and search the web for previous instances of that image. For example a Google reverse image search of a photo purporting to show a Ukrainian girl arguing with a Russian soldier will result in old articles reporting that this is an image showing a young Palestinian girl arguing with an Israeli soldier after her brother was arrested in 2012. Reverse images searches can be conducted with Google, Bing, Yandex, TinEye and others but unfortunately they almost always return no results with breaking news video. Screenshots from videos can also be used to find old videos but this has an even lower success rate. This doesn’t mean the photo is new or real, it just means you can move to the next step. Geolocation is probably the most effective tool for verifying images from Ukraine. Using a combination of mapping software such as Google maps and street view and satellite imagery it is possible to find the exact location where an image was captured. Sometimes, there will be a street sign, an advertisement or a store name in the background of a video which will help give away a location. One verification advantage in reporting on this conflict is that there is now an army of online geolocators, often referred to as ""open-source investigators"" or OSINT who are finding and posting the exact latitude and longitude of these videos online. Of course, these need to be verified as well, but more often than not they are accurate. Having Ukrainians who might recognize a local landmark helps hugely in this effort. Date Once a location is verified, the next thing to look at is the date. Sometimes the weather can help. Last week Russian Defense Forces put out a video purporting to show Russian tanks just outside Kiev. The tanks were covered in snow, but it was a sunny day in Kiev. The direction of the sunlight and the length of shadows can also help determine the time of day and to a lesser extent the time of year, but it doesn’t really help with an exact date. This is when ABC News leans on our reporting teams on the ground in Ukraine. The Verification Unit can confirm the location of a strike, but that needs to match on-the-ground reporting from that day before we can say what it actually shows. We also need reporting to contextualize videos. Sometimes we’re able to verify the date and location of a video but without context it’s often difficult to tell what is going on, in which case we can’t use it. Digital verification is hugely important, but without real-world reporting from the ground, the number of verified videos would be massively reduced.",27
2022-03-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/durbin-defends-decision-fighter-jet-deliveries-ukraine/story?id=83552583,Durbin defends Biden administration decision on fighter jet deliveries to Ukraine,"Sen. Dick Durbin on Sunday defended the Biden administration's decision to not facilitate the delivery of MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine from Poland. ""There are other ways for us to provide surface to air missiles and air defenses that will keep the Russians at bay in terms of their aerial attack,"" Durbin, D-Ill., told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. ""There are other ways to do that that are consistent with the NATO alliance and would not jeopardize expanding this into World War III or even worse."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave a virtual address to Congress on Wednesday, pleading with the U.S. for additional military aid, further sanctions and a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stop the Russian invasion. Zelenskyy also asked the U.S. to assist with the delivery of MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine from Poland, but the Biden administration has held firm against the request, insisting that is an offensive move that could lead to World War III. There is bipartisan support for sending planes, with Democratic members of Congress in favor, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. ""We're ​asking for one-third of the Polish Air Force to be sent into Ukraine,"" Durbin, the Senate majority whip, added. While President Vladimir Putin has shown no signs of backing down, Durbin said Ukraine has shown no signs of backing down ​either and the U.S. firmly stands with the Ukrainian effort to stop the Russian invasion. ""The desperate things that he's doing now killing innocent civilians and children, for goodness sakes, he will have a stained name in history forever for this,"" Durbin said of Putin. President Joe Biden and China's President Xi Jinping spoke Friday morning and Biden made clear the ""implications and consequences"" if China aligns with Russia, according to the White House readout. ""How about tougher economic sanctions right now, not only on Russia, but also potentially for China?"" Stephanopoulos pressed. ""We know that President Biden spoke with President Xi on Friday. It doesn't appear that China, at least not yet, is ready to back off their support for Putin."" Durbin told Stephanopoulos that Xi must ""decide his place in history and China's place in the world"" and he thinks Biden made that clear in the call, but did not answer whether he thinks the U.S. should implement sanctions on China. “If (China) is going to be part of Putin and his barbaric conduct in Ukraine, he's going to run the risk of discrediting his own nation,” Durbin said. Stephanopoulos pressed Durbin on GOP criticism that Biden is turning to dictators for oil while blaming high gas prices on the Russian invasion when he could ramp up American oil production. ""One of the things we've seen at home recently is, of course, inflation, higher gas prices across the board,"" Stephanopoulos pressed. ""President Biden has said that the sanctions on Putin are at least part of the issue there for causing the rise in the prices. But our next guest, Senator Barrasso, has taken that on."" Sen. John Barrasso said Tuesday that ""Biden would rather turn to dictators like those in Iran and those in Venezuela rather than turn against the climate elitists who dictate the energy policy of that Democratic Party and of his presidency. So now he's trying to pass the buck to Vladimir Putin."" Asked to respond, Durbin said the Biden administration is working to reduce the impact of cutting off Russian oil and that it is ""completely wrong"" to blame Biden's efforts to stop Putin for inflation, saying ""other countries are going through the same inflation."" Confirmation hearings for Biden's historic Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, will begin Monday. Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, will preside over the hearings. Stephanopoulos asked Durbin about recent GOP attacks on Jackson, including a series of tweets from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., that incorrectly suggest Jackson is soft on child pornography. Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler gave Hawley's assertion ""Three Pinocchios."" Durbin slammed Hawley's attacks, calling them inaccurate and unfair, and said Jackson has been scrutinized more than any person he could think of. ""There's no truth to what he says and he's part of the fringe within the Republican Party,"" Durbin said. ""This was a man who was fist-bumping the murderous mob that descended on the Capitol on Jan. 6 of the last year. He doesn't have the credibility he thinks he does.""",16
2022-03-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-john-barrasso-blames-biden-administration-inflation-high/story?id=83552750,Top Senate Republican advises President Joe Biden ahead of NATO summit,"As President Joe Biden heads to Brussels this week for an extraordinary NATO summit, Sen. John Barrasso, the third-ranking Senate Republican, said he wants the president to ""lead from the front"" and laid out certain objectives for him to do so. ""Number one is, he needs to tell NATO that we collectively are going to supply the people of Ukraine things that they know how to use, whether it's drones, planes, missile systems,"" Barrasso, R-Wyo., told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive interview Sunday. ""Number two, he has to say that he is going to go to Brussels to the eastern front of NATO to show the resolve of NATO, and the United States' commitment as well,"" he added. ""And third, he needs to say to the people of Europe who are really in a tough situation with regard to energy and the dependence that they have on Russian energy, that we are going to increase the exporting of liquified natural gas from America to them."" As the ranking Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Barrasso has been a strong critic of Biden's renewable energy agenda. Republicans, like Barrasso, are pushing the administration to increase domestic oil production while reducing foreign energy dependency. Biden already banned all Russian oil imports, and Americans are coping with inflation and steep prices at the gas pump. Earlier on ""This Week,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., dismissed claims that Biden is to blame for rising gas prices at home. But Barrasso said no matter who they blame ""Democrats have a very big problem."" ""Well, Joe Biden can't hide from the fact that he is the president of high gas prices,"" Barrasso said. ""And they're looking for anyone to blame, whether it's Putin, whether it's Republicans, whether it's energy companies, whether it's COVID. The Democrats have a very big problem with 40-year high inflation, highest gas prices ever."" Democrats, however, have blamed energy companies for price gouging and have pointed out that a barrel of oil now costs what it did before the war -- yet prices remain high. When asked by Stephanopoulos what more the U.S. should be doing to aid Ukraine, Barrasso accused Biden of being too slow to respond to the crisis so far. ""The president has had to be pushed and pulled to where he is today. It was Congress that brought about sanctions, that brought about the ban on Russian oil, that brought about weapons and all of this big aid package that I voted for a week or two ago, $13 billion,"" he said. Meanwhile, a historic Supreme Court hearing is set to start Monday on the first Black woman nominee to the high court. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri suggested on Twitter last week that Jackson has a ""long record"" of letting child porn offenders ""off the hook,"" an assertion Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler gave ""Three Pinocchios."" ""You met with Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson earlier this week. And you said -- you didn't say -- suggest how you were going to vote, but you said this should not be a process of character assassination. Is that what Senator Hawley was doing?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""I did meet with her. Clearly, very intelligent. We talked about judicial philosophy. I talked about Justice [Antonin] Scalia, that the -- it's the Constitution, a legal document, not a living document. We had a very good meeting,"" answered Barrasso, who voted against Jackson's confirmation to become a federal judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals last June. ""I'm less concerned about her statements than I am about Chuck Schumer's statements. He said she's going to rule with empathy. A judge ought to be making decisions based on the law as written, not the way they feel about it."" Republican colleagues have flagged concerns about Jackson's record as a public defender, and Barrasso said, ""that's all going to come out with the hearings"" while pledging the process will remain fair, thorough and respectful. Stephanopoulos pressed Barrasso once more, asking: ""But do you think Senator Hawley's attacks were fair?"" ""Well, he's going to have his opportunity to question the judge as will all the members of the committee,"" Barrasso responded. ""The last time we had a hearing with [Brett] Kavanaugh, he was accused of being a serial rapist with no evidence whatsoever. So, I think we're going to have a fair process and a respectful process, unlike what the Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh.""",7
2022-03-20,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-military-osprey-aircraft-missing-board-training-norway/story?id=83538933,4 US Marines killed in Osprey aircraft crash during training in Norway,"Four U.S. Marines were killed on Friday when an American MV-22 Osprey aircraft crashed during a large NATO military exercise in Norway, the Norwegian prime minister said. ""It is with great sadness we have received the message that four American soldiers died in a plane crash last night,"" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said on Saturday on Twitter. ""The soldiers participated in the NATO exercise Cold Response. Our deepest sympathies go to the soldiers' families, relatives and fellow soldiers in their unit."" The plane crashed in Nordland, a county in northern Norway, local authorities said. Police arrived at the scene around 1:30 a.m. local time and ""soon confirmed that the crew of 4 were deceased,"" Nordland Chief in Staff Bent Eilertsen said in a statement. ""As far as we know, all 4 are American."" The Norwegian government confirmed the four crew members' bodies were retrieved Sunday. The Marines then identified the deceased as Capt. Matthew J. Tomkiewicz, 27, of Fort Wayne, Indiana; Capt. Ross A. Reynolds, 27, of Leominster, Massachusetts; Gunnery Sgt. James W. Speedy, 30, of Cambridge, Ohio and Cpl. Jacob M. Moore, 24, of Catlettsburg, Kentucky. ""The pilots and crew were committed to accomplishing their mission and serving a cause greater than themselves,” Maj. Gen. Michael Cederholm, the commanding general of 2d Marine Aircraft Wing, said in a letter released Sunday to his Marines and their families. The Marines will be reunited with their families through dignified transfer in the coming days, officials said. ""We will continue to execute the mission while keeping these Marines and their service on the forefront of our minds. We will never allow these Marines’ sacrifice to go unnoticed or unappreciated,"" Cederholm said. ""Keep these Marines and their loved ones in your thoughts and prayers."" The Marines were assigned to the Second Marine Aircraft Wing. ""Though the nature of military service is inherently dangerous, the safety of our Marines, Sailors, Allies and partners is our top priority,"" the Second Marine Expeditionary Force said in a statement. ""Our hearts go out to the families affected by these events."" Maj. Jim Stenger, a U.S. Marine Corps spokesperson, said in a statement Friday that the aircraft was conducting training as part of Cold Response, a large NATO military exercise that occurs every two years, when the incident occurred. Stenger said the incident remains under investigation. Currently, there are 3,000 U.S. Marines in northern Norway participating in Cold Response 22, described as one of the largest NATO exercises since the end of the Cold War. There are 30,000 troops in total participating in this year's exercise. Held every two years, the exercise was planned long before the Russian invasion of Ukraine and helps to train multinational NATO forces in how to operate in the Arctic. Norway's Armed Forces and the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway issued statements Friday confirming they were searching for a missing Osprey aircraft that had failed to land at its destination. ""The Osprey belongs to the U.S. Marine Corps and is taking part in the Norwegian military exercise Cold Response in Norway,"" said the statement from Forsvaret, Norway's armed forces. ""The aircraft has a crew of four and was out on a training mission in Nordland County, northern Norway on Friday 18 March 2022."" The statement said the Osprey was en route to Bodø, where it was scheduled to land just before 6 p.m. local time and was reported missing at 6:26 p.m. local time with its last known position being south of Bodø. Search and rescue aircraft were launched but weather conditions in the area were described as ""challenging and are expected to get worse."" An apparent crash site south of Bodø was located from the air three hours later. ""Due to the weather conditions, it has not been possible to enter the site from the air,"" said the Norwegian armed forces statement Friday. ""Police and rescue crews are now on their way into the area."" The investigation at the crash site has been further paused due to poor weather conditions, Nordland police said. ""It is extreme avalanche danger and heavy rain in the area right now,"" Eilertsen said. ""Landslide experts have given the police a strong recommendation not to enter the landslide area."" Police will return once the weather allows, he said. The Norwegian Safety Investigation Authority has also been notified. This is a developing story. Check back for updates.",3
2022-03-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/confirmation-hearings-test-vanishing-middle-note/story?id=83564624,Confirmation hearings test vanishing middle: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein You could watch the confirmation hearings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson that start Monday to learn more about a history-making jurist who will almost certainly soon take a seat on the Supreme Court. You could watch some if not most of both the Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee tread carefully around charged politics of race, gender and judicial philosophy -- during a time when Americans' attention has been drawn elsewhere. Or you could watch to see how and why a few senators seek to blow up the script -- in the hopes of ricocheting issues of and around the high court into greater public discussion in 2022 and 2024. The declaration by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., that he sees ""a record that endangers our children"" in Jackson's writings and professional history stakes a claim on scorched-earth tactics that some Republicans think is warranted in the context of Trump-era confirmation battles. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is already firing back: ""He's part of the fringe within the Republican Party,"" Durbin told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ""This Week,"" citing Hawley's encouragement for the Jan. 6 rioters. ""He doesn't have the credibility he thinks he does."" Credibility aside, Hawley and other ambitious Republicans on the committee have access to a valuable megaphone in questioning Jackson over the coming days. It's notable that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell isn't setting that much of a softer tone, saying last week that her record suggests the judge has ""a special empathy for criminals."" Democrats, of course, have the votes to get Jackson through committee and the Senate floor without any help from Republicans. But President Joe Biden and Democrats want to send Jackson to the Supreme Court with a bipartisan message. They hope the three GOP votes she won to get confirmed to her current post is a floor and not a ceiling. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As negotiations appear to be at a standstill on funding for resources to address the pandemic, the Biden administration is sounding the alarm about what is at stake for testing, vaccine and treatment efforts. The administration is asking for billions in funding. The problem is they don't have enough support within their own party, let alone with the GOP. Without replenishment of cash, COVID care for the uninsured and free testing could be a thing of the past. The government could run out of treatment doses and may not be able to guarantee a large number of vaccines should the need for another booster arise. ""The other thing we can do -- and I hope that we get the funding from the Congress to do this, is to continue to build up our supply of antivirals, of tests and of the ability to get boosted,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser on ""This Week."" He later added, ""We really must be prepared for the possibility that we might get another variant and we don't want to be caught flatfooted on that."" Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, during an event Friday marking the first year in his post, indicated that he is willing to hear lawmakers' input to strike a deal. ""We put forward some ideas on a package that didn't quite get over the finish line. We're willing to listen to whatever people want,"" Becerra told reporters. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The tensions of the crowded Ohio Republican Senate primary were on full display during a weekend debate in which two candidates literally faced off on stage and had to be separated by the moderator amid jeers from the audience. Former state treasurer Josh Mandel and businessman Mike Gibbons got into a physical standoff after Mandel accused Gibbons of ""making millions"" from Chinese oil stocks. Gibbons denied the claims and fired back by saying Mandel couldn't understand the dealings because he hadn't worked in the private sector. The situation escalated with Mandel getting out of his seat as Gibbons told him, ""you don't know squat,"" to which Mandel responded, ""Two tours in Iraq, don’t tell me I haven’t worked.” The men continued encroaching on each other's personal space until the moderator intervened and Mandel took his seat with Gibbons going on to finish his response to the debate question. Whether the interaction affects either candidates' appeal to voters remains to be seen, but at least one of their GOP competitors is criticizing the fallout. ""They completely made clowns of themselves [...] It's just a joke, it made everyone look terrible honestly, except those of us who avoided it and kept the focus on substance,"" author J.D. Vance said in a subsequent interview with Steve Bannon. The incident could, however, put a renewed spotlight on voters' interests in debates given that in recent months, political debates appear to have been sidelined by some candidates from serving as major campaign milestones. The Republican National Committee's move to ""prohibit"" GOP nominees from participating in debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, also adds an undercurrent of tension. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 3. That's the number of Republican senators who backed Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year -- but as FiveThirtyEight's Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux writes, there's no guarantee those senators will remain on her side now that a Supreme Court seat is up for grabs. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis from February, only one of the seven justices confirmed since Justice Stephen Breyer -- Chief Justice John Roberts -- has received more than 69% of the Senate's votes. Roberts is also the only justice to have earned the backing of a majority of the other party's senators. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-03-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/prominent-putin-critic-alexei-navalny-sentenced-additional-years/story?id=83594606,Prominent Putin critic Alexey Navalny sentenced to additional 9 years,"LONDON and KYIV -- The jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny has been sentenced to an additional nine years, in a fresh trial roundly criticized by human rights organizations as politically motivated. Navalny is already imprisoned on a two-and-a-half-year sentence, incarcerated since he was immediately arrested on his return to Russia following treatment in Germany in January of last year, after being poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent in August 2020. Prosecutors sought a new 10-year sentence on fresh charges of embezzlement and contempt of court that were announced in February, granted by the court, which means Navalny will remain incarcerated until President Vladimir Putin is entering his 80s. The charges, which are widely viewed as politically motivated, accuse Navalny of embezzling donations from his Anti-Corruption Foundation, the organization that produces his high-profile investigations into the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin and his elite. Navalny was made to stand for hours as the judge detailed the new convictions, with the opposition activist cutting a noticeably thinner figure after his time in jail alongside his lawyers. Last year Navalny’s team said he was “fighting for his life” after he fell ill in prison after a protracted hunger strike. The dissident’s political organizations were formally designated as “extremist,” placing them alongside groups such as ISIS in Russia, meaning that anyone publicly supporting Navalny could face prison sentences and be barred from running in elections. Navalny is often labelled as one of Putin’s most difficult domestic critics. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, his official social media accounts have posted regular messages criticizing the war and calling on Russians to stage weekly protests against the invasion. As Navalny’s legal team were handed down the new sentence, his organization posted a new investigation that alleged a huge super-yacht under construction in Italy belongs to Putin and should be seized as Western countries clamp down on assets linked to the Russian state. The new sentencing of Russia’s most prominent pro-democracy activist comes as Kremlin is drastically clamping down on civil society organizations and the free press in the country following its invasion of Ukraine. On Monday, Facebook and Instagram were also formally designated as “extremist” groups as the Kremlin sought to control the narrative around the war. Putin has issued repeated warning against pro-Western “traitors” and “scum” seeking to bring about “the destruction of Russia.” ""Putin is intensifying his actions to destroy Russia and is essentially announcing the start of mass repressions against those who don't agree with the regime,"" he posted on Twitter. ""This has happened in our history before, and not only ours.""",0
2022-03-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/doctors-ukraine-border-mental-health-top-medical-priority/story?id=83578200,'Nation under stress': Doctors say mental health a top priority in Ukraine,"Since the war in Ukraine began, more than 3 million refugees have fled -- by bus, train, car and foot -- for neighboring countries. Some have destinations in mind, while others have no plan. But as these displaced citizens navigate different yet equally impossible conditions, doctors at the countries that border Ukraine say there's a common thread: mental health is the most often reported medical problem. ABC News interviewed doctors from the U.S. and Europe who flew to the border to volunteer. According to those doctors, among the millions of refugees, acute stress disorder has been reported as a common ailment. ""Acute stress disorder is basically a fight-or-flight reaction that lasts a few days to a month and involves having been exposed to a threat to your life or limb and not being able to stop thinking about it,"" Dr. Craig Katz, a clinical professor of psychiatry, medical education, system design and global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told ABC News. In cases where people are in a fight-or-flight mode, ""They're highly likely to have problems sleeping, being extremely anxious and not having much of an appetite, because they need to focus on survival,"" Katz said. Russia launched its full invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, exposing its citizens to death and destruction, as well as disruption to basic needs. ""It's clearly a nation under stress,"" Dr. Dan Schnorr, an emergency medicine physician with Doctors Without Borders, told ABC News. ""Every child in [Ukraine] is now experiencing multiple adverse childhood events, and that is one of the uncounted casualties that will ripple throughout generations."" “This is a true humanitarian crisis. People are leaving with only what they can carry. Families are being separated. Trying to find a way to make it,” says Dr. Preethi Pirlamarla, cardiologist and director of heart failure at Mount Sinai, Queens. Research suggests that firsthand exposure to traumatic events, such as the Ukraine war, can have lasting effects, including PTSD, anxiety, depression and relapse of alcohol abuse. According to the American Psychiatric Association, prevalence of acute stress disorder ranges from 13%-50% depending on the type of event exposed to and about half of those individuals with acute stress disorder develop PTSD. According to Katz, the risk of developing lasting effects of acute stress disorder increases depending on the extent of exposure to a traumatic event, prior trauma that was not well addressed previously, a history of psychiatric disorders and not having social support. Alternatively, being spiritual, having social support, realistic optimism, being cognitively flexible and having a sense of purpose can all help to mitigate the effects of the acute stress. ""Psychological first aid is a way to attend to people's mental health scratches and bruises so that they don't become festering wounds,"" Katz said. ""You make sure people feel safe and secure, make sure they have meals to eat, you especially make sure they -- as much as you can -- they are together with loved ones or have some sort of communication that has support."" At Palanca, the border crossing in Moldova, psychosocial clinics have been established to identify those struggling mentally and ease the effects of this trauma. ""It's more about listening and giving a shoulder to cry on,"" Dr. Axel Adolfo, an emergency medicine physician working with Doctors Without Borders, said. ""It's about having someone waiting there for them with arms fully open ... They just want to let go of the two to three weeks they spent in fear or doubt and can feel that they are close to [safety]."" The challenge now becomes helping to integrate these populations into neighboring societies. ""People always say mental health is a good idea, but they need to start planning from now,"" Katz said. Refugees are at risk of forming lasting mental health effects. Eventually, according to Katz, screening will be important to identify who may need to be connected to a psychiatrist. For now, though, ""It's about being here and saying, 'The whole world is watching, and we are here to help you, and it's OK to cry,"" Adolfo said. Nicholas P. Kondoleon, M.D., is an internal medicine resident at Cleveland Clinic and a contributor to the ABC News Medical Unit.",25
2022-03-22,https://abcnews.go.com/US/powerful-climate-change-exhibit-opens-dcs-kennedy-center/story?id=83540883,Powerful climate change exhibit opens at DC's Kennedy Center,"A man submerged up to his chin in brown, murky floodwaters and a group of miners covered head to toe in black soot -- these are a few of the images featured at a new climate-inspired photography exhibit at the Kennedy Center called Coal + Ice, which opened on March 15. ""I had young kids, and I was trying to think about the kind of world they'd be living in. I felt this increasing responsibility to try to address climate change,"" said Gideon Mendel, a 63-year-old photographer based in London, whose work is featured in the exhibit. The display, running through April 22, features a spread of photos and videos taken across the globe and documents the harmful effects of human activity on the planet. It showcases the work of more than 50 photographers and videographers from around the world and the varying ways climate change manifests. Coal + Ice comes to Washington, D.C. as reliance on fossil fuels has taken center stage amid the war in Ukraine. As the global market faces more significant uncertainty due to the volatile geopolitical landscape and dragging impacts of COVID-19, climate change has been pushed to the back burner. ""We have to walk and chew gum at the same time,"" said Kevin Rudd, the former Australian Prime Minister and President of the Asia Society Policy Institute that helped organize the exhibition. ""Dealing with geopolitics, dealing with the challenge to the inviability of national borders to be fundamentally violated in the invasion of Ukraine, and at the same time, wrestle with this pan-civilization challenge for climate change."" Here in the United States, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has sparked a debate on the sources of energy production at home. Many Republicans have called for an increase in oil and gas production to offset reliance on other nations, specifically Russia. In contrast, Democrats have pointed to this as evidence for a complete move away from non-renewable energies. ""It's not looking good. It's getting worse, and you know, at a time when the world needs actually a concerted global governance, to work together, it's actually more fractured than it's been for a long time,"" said Mendel. The exhibit allows viewers to walk around freely and move between ""pods,"" where individual collections provide an artistic exploration of the climate crisis. The content varies from scenes of coal mining operations worldwide to the rapidly melting glaciers of the Himalayas and photographs that chart their decline over the last few decades. The 30,000 square-foot tent on the Kennedy Center's ""Reach Plaza"" features a continuous background audio track that pairs with the visual displays to create an immersive experience for visitors. Though the latest installation is on the doorstep of the government here in Washington, D.C., there is concern about the exhibit's impact. ""The danger with climate change groups, it just preached to the converted. You know, so you know, that's, and you often have these closed circles. I mean, it's really complex questions of how you use your work to bring about change,"" said Mendel. The exhibit makes its first appearance on the East Coast after initially debuting in Beijing in 2011, followed by showings in Yixian, Shanghai, Paris, and San Francisco–the only other U.S. display. Smaller versions of Coal + Ice were also set up in Copenhagen and New Delhi. After the exhibition wraps, the organizers hope to take it to New York City, but have no official plans to do so.",25
2022-03-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-concerned-russian-cyberattacks-critical-us-infrastructure-wray/story?id=83604956,FBI 'concerned' about Russian cyberattacks on critical US infrastructure: Wray,"FBI Director Christopher Wray said Tuesday the FBI is ""concerned' with the possibility of Russian cyberattacks against critical U.S. infrastructure in the wake of Russia's war with Ukraine. ""The reason we're concerned about it is not just based on our longstanding understanding of how the Russians operate, but it's actually the product of specific investigative work and surveillance work that we've been doing all together,"" Wray told an audience at the Detroit Economic Club. ""Most cyberattacks don't just happen in an instant. There's activity that leads up to it. There's scanning and researching, researching a victim, scanning for vulnerabilities and systems. There's developing access to those systems. So, there's a whole range of preparatory work, which is what we've been seeing,"" he said. It comes as the FBI has seen five U.S. energy companies have their systems scanned, according to a source familiar with the situation, outlined in an agency bulletin first reported by CBS News. ABC News has confirmed the bulletin's contents. ""Today, with the ongoing conflict raging in Ukraine, we're particularly focused on the destructive cyber threat posed by the Russian intel services, and cybercriminal groups they protect and support,"" Wray said in prepared remarks. ""We have cyber personnel working closely with the Ukrainians and our other allies abroad, and with the private sector and our partners here."" On Monday, President Joe Biden urged American businesses to shore up their cyber defenses, saying the threat of a cyberattack on the U.S. has grown now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has his ""back against the wall."" ""I have previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States, including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs we've imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners,"" Biden said in a statement. ""It's part of Russia's playbook. Today, my Administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks."" Echoing his comments was the deputy national security adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuburger at Monday's White House press briefing. She did not go into details about what exactly officials are seeing, but stressed to reporters the government has stepped up preparations for a cyber attack. ""Just last week, federal agencies convened in more than 100 companies to share new cybersecurity threat information, in light of this evolving threat intelligence. During those meetings, we shared resources and tools to help companies harden their security. Like advisory sourced from sensitive threat intelligence and hands on support from local FBI field offices, and sister regional offices, including their shields up program,"" Neuberger said. Neuberger said there was not evidence of a specific cyberattack, but ""some preparatory activity"" that prompted the White House to give classified briefings to companies in sectors they thought could be impacted -- without detailing what sectors that included, despite being pressed for more specifics several times during the briefing. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jenn Easterly both said DHS has resources to combat cyberattacks for private businesses and urged companies to protect themselves. ""Organizations of every size and across every sector should continue enhancing their cybersecurity defenses,"" Mayorkas said. Last week, Mayorkas was asked about the threat of ransomware attacks as the conflict in Ukraine continues. He said in 2021 there was a 300% increase in the number of ransomware attacks from 2020 -- with ransomware losses totally close to $300 million. He urged companies to sure up their cyber defenses, especially while the conflict continues. ""Some of those measures are so simple and accessible. changing one's password making one's password strong multi factor authentication, backing up one system, there are elementary steps that one can take,"" he told reporters Thursday. ""We have been leaning so far forward in communicating with the private sector, which owns the vast majority of critical infrastructure to equip them to prevent a threat from materializing, to respond swiftly and effectively to an attack should it [occur], and to prove resilient in contemporaneous with the Russian attack and the real possibility that Russia might seek to retaliate via a cyber channel."" As a result of major cyber-attacks in 2021, the Biden administration has tightened cyberattack reporting regulations for certain portions of critical infrastructure, such as pipelines and airlines. Industry and experts are taking this warning from the White House seriously. ""While Russia has not yet launched more aggressive or destructive cyber-attacks that have impaired critical infrastructure or deleted sensitive data in Ukraine or elsewhere, the administration's comments suggest recent intelligence indicates Russian cyber operators are conducting digital reconnaissance or electronically probing electronic systems in the United States that could lead to those types of operations,"" Javed Ali, the former senior counterterrorism Director at the National Security Council told ABC News. ""These public statements that seem to give clues about Russian cyber threats and other military developments from different intelligence sources and methods are part of the Biden administration's overall strategy to put pressure on Putin and demonstrate that the United States and its partners have advance notice of Russia's intentions,"" he said. Critical infrastructure companies are monitoring the threat, including the Tennessee Valley Authority, a company that provides electricity for 153 local power companies in Tennessee and surrounding states. ""TVA continually monitors for ever-changing threats to cybersecurity,"" a company spokesperson told ABC News. ""We use a multi-layer security strategy, including a combination of hardware, software and procedural controls, to secure our critical generation, transmission and business infrastructure systems. TVA's cybersecurity team monitors the entire enterprise 24/7 and coordinates with federal security agencies to rapidly implement new protective measures for targeted cybersecurity issues.""",12
2022-03-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/reporters-notebook-escape-mariupol/story?id=83600862,Reporter's notebook: Escape from Mariupol,"Natalia's escape from Mariupol, Ukraine, as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues his attack on the country, meant taking her family's life in her hands. After more than two weeks of waiting, she said she and her neighbor decided they'd make a run to escape the besieged city. She said she crammed her elderly parents and four cats into a small car, and they drove out of Mariupol -- fast. She described to ABC News looks from people on the road as they sped past them on the outskirts of town. ""People looked at us like we had risen from the dead. They thought those inside had all been sentenced to death,"" she recalled. We talked in the small apartment she's been offered by a friend in Lviv. She's about 5'5, with silver hair, plaited down each side of her face. There is an aura of steely determination about her. She's furious. One of her cats -- Mica -- sits curled up in the afternoon sun on a makeshift mattress in the kitchen. That's where Natalia sleeps. Her parents, both in their 80s, have taken the bed next door. She told us about the dead bodies she saw lying by the side of the road. Residents had no choice but to leave the corpses there in the street among the shelling and attacks. She told us about her trips to find food and other supplies. With no electricity or heat, she'd have to brave the elements and Russian bombardment to cook outside. Her parents were too old to keep going to shelters, so they waited in their apartment with the bombs getting closer. Hers is a story about regular people banding together. Neighbors whispering rumors they'd heard about what was going on. Sharing food and information in a collective bid to survive. ""I felt helpless. And then I understood that I had to help myself,"" she said. Natalia said she would go out regularly to find service on her phone, desperate to know if anyone was coming. ""We were totally alone. We had no information."" As we speak, an air raid siren goes off. She shrugs. ""We didn't get alerts in Mariupol. They just bombed us,"" she said. I asked her if it worried her parents when they heard it. ""They're used to it now,"" she replied. I can see the relief on her face that her parents can finally rest. For now. Natalia embodies her country's story, the one we've all seen play out these last weeks: the determination to survive and to resist. And she survived the very worst of what this war is doing. But thousands more like her, are still trapped in Mariupol.",22
2022-03-23,https://abcnews.go.com/International/probe-widens-mysterious-plane-crash-southern-china/story?id=83607646,Probe widens into mysterious plane crash in southern China,"As investigators try to piece together clues on what caused a Chinese passenger plane to plunge from the sky Monday, officials told ABC News they are looking at every possible avenue, including an intentional downing. None of the 123 passengers and nine crew members aboard Eastern Airlines Flight 5735 survived when it crashed into the mountains in the Guangxi region of southern China. Early data shows the Boeing 737-800 plunged from 29,000 feet to 8,000 feet, leveled off and then went into a freefall, exploding into a fireball that was seen and filmed by people nearby. On the ground, crews have found few clues as to what caused the disaster. The plane's black boxes haven't been recovered. American intelligence agencies don't have a clear theory on what led to the plane crash, an official told ABC News. U.S. authorities studying satellite and radar data aren’t ruling anything out, including a possible intentional downing, the official told ABC News. Chinese officials said Tuesday that the plane's crew didn't answer calls from air traffic control when they noticed the rapid descent during its flight from Kunming to Guangzhou. Eastern Airlines grounded its fleet of Boeing 787-800 planes as a precaution. The Civil Aviation Administration of China has called in the assistance of several international groups, including ones from the U.S., to find out what happened. Members of the U.S. National Safety Transportation Board, the Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing and engine-maker CFM International are all joining the probe. ""The NTSB is in contact with the CAAC investigator-in-charge and we will support their investigation with our technical advisors from the Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing and CFM in all ways necessary,"" the NTSB said in a statement.

2022-03-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-heads-high-stakes-nato-summit-amid-showdown/story?id=83604405,Biden heads to high-stakes NATO summit amid showdown with Putin over Ukraine,"President Joe Biden headed to Europe Wednesday as he tries to keep NATO allies and other European partners united against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine. With fighting lasting nearly a month -- and Ukrainian forces unexpectedly holding Russia to a standoff -- Biden and other world leaders will seek to speed an end to the conflict. They'll face pressure to make announcements about new sanctions on Russia, humanitarian assistance for refugees and additional support for Ukraine's military. Putin and China will be watching, with the fate of Ukraine -- and Russia's place in the world -- hanging in the balance. And while Biden will command much of the attention this week, his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, also plans to speak to -- and potentially pressure -- Biden and other NATO leaders. Biden will spend much of Wednesday traveling from Washington to Brussels, ahead of a whirlwind day of diplomacy in the Belgian capital the next day. On Thursday, he plans to attend an extraordinary summit of all 30 NATO leaders, where he will discuss deterrence against Russia and ""reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies,"" according to the White House. Biden will also participate in a pre-scheduled meeting of the European Council -- the political body of the European Union -- and meet with leaders of the Group of Seven, or G-7, major industrial nations. Throughout the meetings, Biden hopes to achieve ""continued coordination and a unified response"" to Russia, the White House said. Biden has made working in lockstep with Europe a top priority, at times holding back sanctions -- such as on Russian energy -- to maintain that show of unity. He has also fastidiously tried to avoid a wider conflict, declining to send American troops to Ukraine or support a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over the country. Whether he'll push allies to more directly confront Russia -- by committing more troops to the region, providing even more provocative military assistance to Ukraine or otherwise directly assisting Kyiv -- remains to be seen. One challenge he may face Thursday, though, is responding to Zelenskyy's remarks to NATO leaders. The Ukrainian leader has repeatedly commanded the world's attention with moving, sometimes blunt addresses to national and international bodies. His direct demands sometimes go beyond Biden and other leaders' comfort levels, and he has not held back from naming and shaming those who he does not believe are doing enough to support Ukraine. Most major global summits are associated with major announcements, or ""deliverables,"" often the result of months of negotiations. But in this case, ""the main deliverable is the trip and its symbolism,"" Stephen Sestanovich, a Russia expert and former ambassador at the Council on Foreign Relations, said. But Biden and other leaders are expected to announce a new ""package of sanctions"" on Russia, too, including ""tightening the existing sanctions to crack down on evasion and to ensure robust enforcement,"" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday. ""One of the key elements of that announcement will focus not just on adding new sanctions,"" Sullivan said, ""but on ensuring that there is a joint effort to crack down on evasion, on sanctions-busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia, basically, undermine, weaken or get around the sanctions."" The president also ""will have the opportunity to coordinate on the next phase of military assistance to Ukraine,"" Sullivan said. And Biden will speak with leaders about ""longer-term adjustments to NATO force posture on the eastern flank,"" Sullivan said, referring to the United States and other NATO countries deploying additional troops to countries that border Russia, like Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. He will also announce a ""joint action on enhancing European energy security and reducing Europe's dependence on Russian gas,"" Sullivan added, without elaborating. In Brussels, Biden ""will announce further American contributions"" to help the 3.5 million Ukrainians who have fled the country and for the millions more who have become internally displaced, according to Sullivan. On Friday, the president will travel to Poland, where he'll ""engage with U.S. troops"" – he has deployed thousands there in response to the invasion – and on Saturday, meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Poland has taken in more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees. ""It is the right place for him to go to be able to see troops, to be able to see humanitarian experts, and to be able to meet with the frontline and very vulnerable allies,"" Sullivan said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week that there were ""no plans"" for Biden to travel into Ukraine and that the White House had ""not explored that option."" Biden said Monday that ""the one thing I'm confident, knowing Putin fairly well -- as well as, I guess, another leader could know one another -- is that he was counting on being able to split NATO. He never thought NATO would stay resolved -- stay totally, thoroughly united."" ""And I can assure you,"" he told a group of chief executives, ""NATO has never been stronger or more united in its entire history than it is today, in large part because of Vladimir Putin."" In fact, Russia's invasion has united NATO against it. And a month of crushing sanctions have crippled Russia's economy and largely isolated Putin. Whether world leaders in Brussels decide to ramp up the pressure on Putin in a way that could further change Putin's calculus -- and bring an end to war, perhaps by offering him a clear off-ramp -- could determine the length and course of the conflict. But it's not clear the decreasing number of options they have left could fundamentally sway Putin. Russian troops continue to pummel Ukrainian cities and kill civilians even as the Ukrainians have prevented them from claiming major wins and toppling the government in Kyiv. And it's not clear what that off-ramp could be. ""Putin's back is against the wall,"" Biden said Monday. The White House has warned Russia may launch cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure in the U.S. Such an attack could come in the next several weeks, although not necessarily in direct response to Biden's trip, according to Tom Graham, an expert on Russia at the Council on Foreign Relations. And China's President Xi Jinping will be watching, too. In a call last week, according to the White House, Biden warned him of the consequences of providing aid to Russia. Sullivan told ABC News' Elizabeth Schulze on Tuesday that, since last week, the U.S. had ""not seen"" China provide military equipment to Russia, as it had feared China may do. The degree to which Biden is able to get European leaders on board with potential punishments for China could also determine whether Xi decides to support Putin or stay out of the fight.",15
2022-03-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/experts-bidens-risk-averse-approach-russia-create-greater/story?id=83538052,"Biden's risk-averse approach to Russia could create greater threat, experts say","WARSAW, POLAND -- President Joe Biden's high-stakes summit with other NATO leaders on Thursday will be one of the most scrutinized meetings on the world stage in decades, and could have enormous implications for both the war in Ukraine and the global balance of power. Despite calls from Ukraine to do more to help stave off Russia's ruthless invasion, Biden has taken a cautious approach -- wary of escalating the conflict by drawing in U.S. forces as part of a more direct NATO response. But after nearly a month of fighting, some foreign policy and national security experts ABC News spoke to say it may be time for the alliance to take on a more direct role. Preparing for 'the worst case' Since before the fighting broke out, Biden has insisted that American troops would not fight Russian forces inside Ukraine, warning that going head-to-head would lead to ""a third world war."" But Barry Pavel, a former National Security Council senior official during the Bush and Obama administration and the senior vice president and director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council, says that's far from inevitable. ""There have been other cases where U.S. and Russian forces have unfortunately come into friction and World War III didn't start,"" Pavel said, characterizing the strategy as simplistic. ""There are hundreds of options that could be done between what NATO is doing now and risking World War III."" The greater threat, warns Pavel, might be in leaving Putin unchecked. ""If he is emboldened by success in Ukraine, then he will be more aggressive in his efforts to nibble and to move into areas of perceived weakness in NATO members,"" he said. ""If he achieves his goal, you'll have Russian forces on the borders of seven NATO members, including nuclear forces in Belarus, and so he'll use that new posture to really heighten European insecurity to a great degree."" And it isn’t Biden’s -- or NATO’s -- choice alone. Moscow could also escalate the conflict by striking a NATO member, either intentionally or accidentally, triggering a sweeping response. ""Article 5 -- in the most basic sense -- is NATO's 'Three Musketeers' provision, which is to say, 'all for one and one for all' -- an attack against any member is an attack against every member of NATO,"" said Sean Monaghan, a former civil servant in the U.K. Ministry of Defence and a visiting fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, calling it ""the most important red line in international politics."" ""This is a contingency that NATO forces are already preparing for,"" said Monaghan. ""That's what the military does -- prepare for the worst case."" While the response to a Russian strike wouldn’t necessarily need to be eye for an eye, Monaghan says in theory, the alliance would be obligated to provide “an overwhelming response” if any member state was hit. “The practice, some would say that NATO being collective of 30 nations, that have to reach consensus for any actions to be to be taken, that might hinder a response. But I think in this conflict, NATO has shown itself to be quite a lot more resolute and speedier of action than many people would have predicted,” he added. The next phase for NATO While the Biden administration has underscored the power of NATO’s overwhelming unity in the face of Russian aggression, when it comes to charting a path forward to counter the Kremlin, cracks within the alliance are beginning to emerge. While the summit will be an opportunity for the powers to get on the same page, it may also cast a spotlight on areas of disagreement. For instance, Poland plans to propose a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine -- a move the U.S. has effectively ruled out. Article 5 lays plain that an attack on a member merits a response, but will the alliance retaliate if Russia resorts to chemical weapons in Ukraine? And while NATO may not be willing to establish a no-fly zone over the country, Pavel says that doesn't mean there isn’t a debate to be had about what more can be done to help the country defend its own airspace. ""In terms of the weapons pipeline, we should be doing much more. We can't let the Ukrainians fly aircraft in their own defense? Forget these ridiculous restrictions on what equipment we can provide a sovereign country who asks for it to defend themselves against an invading force"" he said, referencing the U.S. and other allies' hesitancy to hand over fighter jets to Ukraine for fear of Russian retaliation. Pavel added that additional anti-aircraft and anti-ship weaponry, as well as enhanced intelligence support and humanitarian aid on the ground, could go a long way in resistance efforts. Thomas Graham, a former NSC senior director for Russia and a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says that beyond discussing support for Ukraine, NATO leaders should use the upcoming summit to make sharpen their signaling to the Kremlin. ""NATO leaders want to make sure that they've done everything that they can in order to deter the Russians,"" he said. ""Have we augmented the forces in Eastern Europe to the appropriate levels? And have we convinced the Russians that in fact we are determined to honor the Article Five guarantee and protect every inch of NATO territory?"" Monahan predicts this week's gathering will result in a reversal to a mindset not seen since the days of the Soviet Union. ""We can foresee it as the beginning of a step change, almost a return to NATO's Cold War posture of, if not territorial defense, then a much increased forward presence designed to deter a Russian regime that is clearly willing to resort to war"" he said. Battle lines of the future Beyond addressing the immediate crisis, experts say NATO must ensure it is ready to respond to a more aggressive Russia and prepare for the new geopolitical frontier it is forging. ""The war in Ukraine will end at some point will end, but Russia will remain,"" said Graham. ""And what the conflict has demonstrated is that the hopes we had had for integrating Russia into the Euro-Atlantic community are dead."" Pavel says plotting out a strategy not only for ending the conflict -- but for managing exactly how the conflict ends -- will be critical. ""When wars have ended in the past, the new boundaries have been drawn where the force set, through the middle of Germany, through the middle of Berlin,"" Pavel said. ""When the dust settles, where do we want Russian forces to be and where do we want Ukrainian and potentially NATO forces to be?"" Another repercussion may be an onslaught of arms races. Russia's alleged deployment of hypersonic missiles—a technology the U.S. has not yet mastered—is an area of competition, but Pavel says it's not the only one. ""Putin has spent 10, 15 years modernizing the Russian nuclear forces -- a lot of new types of exotic Russian nuclear weapons, pretty significant,"" he said. ""Certainly, the U.S. and some NATO members have nuclear capabilities, but they are aging. They have not been modernized at the pace that we should be doing."" ""All of this means that we'll have we'll have a lot more to do, unfortunately, on the security agenda going forward,"" Pavel added.",7

Albright was nominated for secretary of state by President Bill Clinton and served in the role from 1997 to 2001. She was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1993 to 1997. ""As the world redefined itself in the wake of the Cold War, we were partners and friends working to welcome newly liberated democracies into NATO and confront the horrors of genocide in the Balkans,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement. ""When I think of Madeleine, I will always remember her fervent faith that 'America is the indispensable nation.'"" President Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a statement called Albright ""one of the finest Secretaries of State, an outstanding UN Ambassador, a brilliant professor, and an extraordinary human being."" ""As a child in war-torn Europe, Madeleine and her family were twice forced to flee their home,"" the Clintons said. ""When the end of the Cold War ushered in a new era of global interdependence, she became America's voice at the UN, then took the helm at the State Department, where she was a passionate force for freedom, democracy, and human rights."" The Clintons commended Albright's commitment to ""ending ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo; supporting the expansion of NATO into Central Europe; fighting the proliferation of nuclear weapons; broadening U.S. efforts to strengthen civil society, reduce poverty, and relieve debt in development countries; elevating concerns about climate change and environmental degradation on the world stage; and much more."" The Clintons said, in their last conversation with Albright two weeks ago, the 84-year-old remained determined ""to go out with her boots on, supporting Ukraine in its fight to preserve freedom and democracy."" In a State Department briefing Wednesday, spokesperson Ned Price said Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken had been notified of her death. ""Madeleine Albright was a brilliant diplomat, a visionary leader, a courageous trailblazer, a dedicated mentor, and a great and good person who loved the United States deeply and devoted her life to serving it,"" Blinken said in a statement. ""She was also a wonderful friend to many, including me. I’ll miss her very much."" Price said Albright was a mentor to Blinken, his deputy Wendy Sherman and many others. ""The impact that Secretary Albright ... had on this building is felt every single day in just about every single corridor,"" Price said. ""She was as trailblazer as the first female secretary of state, and quite literally opened doors for a large element of our work force,"" Price added. ""She took so many people under her wing that you have to imagine just how large that wingspan came to be,"" Price said. ""So it's a really devastating piece of news. I know there are many people in this building who are grieving and will be grieving today. And our thoughts of course are with her family and the many, many people she touched in this building, in this country and around the world."" Former President Barack Obama said in a statement, ""Madeleine Albright helped bring peace to the Balkans, paved the way for progress in some of the most unstable corners of the world, and was a champion for democratic values. And as an immigrant herself, she brought a unique and important perspective to her trailblazing career."" Obama also recounted an interaction he said Albright had with an Ethiopian man at a naturalization ceremony. Obama said the ""man came up to Madeleine and said, 'Only in America could a refugee from Africa meet the Secretary of State.' She replied, 'Only in America could a refugee from Central Europe become Secretary of State.'"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Wednesday at the U.N. General Assembly meeting, ""Secretary Albright was a mentor. She was my boss, both as secretary of state; I worked with her in Georgetown. She was a colleague and she was a friend over several decades."" ""Our country and our United Nations are stronger for her service,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""Her story -- a story of fleeing Czechoslovakia as a refugee at a young age and rising in the highest levels of the U.S. government -- has echoed in my mind amid the current crisis in Ukraine,"" Thomas-Greenfield continued. ""I hope to do justice for her memory today. I’m sure that we will have an opportunity to remember Secretary Albright and honor her many contributions in the days ahead. But today, I grieve her as my friend and extend my condolences to her family."" Albright's family said in a statement, ""A tireless champion of democracy and human rights, she was at the time of her death a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, part of Dentons Global Advisors, chair of Albright Capital Management, president of the Harry S.

With a second full day of questions coming Wednesday at Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Republican senators have so far played to long-running culture wars in sometimes obscure but nonetheless intentional ways. Searing attacks from GOP members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have centered on her sentencing of child porn offenders and drug kingpins to her defense of terrorist suspects and her knowledge of and familiarity with critical race theory. ""Do you agree with this book that is being taught to kids, that babies are racist?"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, asked Jackson in one of the most strange and tense exchanges of a long day Tuesday. Jackson took a long pause after hearing that question. She pushed back on the notion that she adheres to ideas around critical race theory with a refrain she has already used often: ""They don't come up with my work as a judge, which I'm respectfully here to address."" Lessons on what judges do and don't do would not be news to lawyers on the committee -- like Cruz and Sens. Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton -- who peppered her with questions of criminal-justice policy that they knew she would not answer. But it was the senators who were delivering lessons in politics. Issues of race and crime are being placed prominently on the table, even though -- if not directly because -- the first Black woman nominated to the high court remains very likely to be confirmed soon. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper President Joe Biden is heading overseas for a series of high-stakes meetings with NATO allies, an effort to affirm the U.S. commitment to military assistance for Ukraine. ""The President is heading to Europe tomorrow to reinforce the incredible unity we build with allies and partners in response to Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine and to consult on next steps,"" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan Tuesday. Sullivan told reporters Biden will announce new sanctions coordinated with allies and methods to close loopholes on others. Biden is also slated to discuss European dependence on Russian energy and the humanitarian response to the war. After meetings in Brussels, Biden will head to Poland, which has become the front lines of the humanitarian crisis caused by the nearly month-old war. Biden will engage with U.S. troops and meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Biden will head to Poland just a couple of weeks after Vice President Kamala Harris visited the nation. When Biden boards Air Force One, he will do so without White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who tested positive Tuesday for COVID-19 for the second time. A virtual address from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Brussels will up the ante for the Biden administration, which has taken a more cautious approach while the Ukrainian leader calls for more. It's a move that could leave Russia unchecked and could create a greater threat. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Amid the ongoing fallout of abuse allegations stemming from a child custody battle, Republican Missouri Senate candidate Eric Greitens is challenging calls from sitting lawmakers for him to drop out by lashing out at one of his party's most powerful members. During an interview with Steve Bannon after the allegations came to light, Greitens was asked why he believes Sen. Josh Hawley ""fired shots"" at his candidacy. The former Missouri governor who has been angling for former President Donald Trump's endorsement claimed it was because he wouldn't support Sen. Mitch McConnell for majority leader if the GOP takes back the upper chamber. ""The reason why shots are being fired at us is that I was the first guy in the country to come out and say that when I'm elected to the United States Senate as an 'America First' senator, that I'm voting against Mitch McConnell,"" Greitens said. ABC News' John Parkinson reports McConnell refrained from calling on the Missouri Republican to end his campaign, instead telling reporters on Tuesday, ""I think all of it developments of the last 24 hours are things the people of Missouri are going to take into account both in the primary and I would assume would take into account in the general."" Greitens' fellow 2022 Senate GOP contender, Trump-backed Mo Brooks of Alabama, is also taking shots at the Senate's top Republican by launching a ""Fire McConnell Pledge"" effort. The move comes after the Washington Examiner reported Trump said Brooks is a ""disappointing"" endorsement. ""I will do everything in my power to ensure that Republicans choose a conservative to be leader. American can't afford a Senate leader who is a weak-kneed, debt-junkie, open-border RINO Republican,"" Brooks says in an ad outlining his pledge. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 71. That's the share of Black Americans who say they support the Senate confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, according to a recent poll from Navigator Research. This is the highest share of support among the different racial and ethnic groups Navigator Research surveyed. But as FiveThirtyEight's Alex Samuels writes, President Biden has lost the support of Black Americans in recent months, so even though representation in the judiciary is something that matters to a lot to some Black voters, it is unlikely to be enough to turn out Black voters in the midterm elections.

2022-03-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nato-respond-putin-chemical-weapons-ukraine-biden/story?id=83648189,"US, NATO 'would respond' if Putin used chemical weapons in Ukraine, Biden says","President Joe Biden took questions at a news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, addressing warnings of a possible chemical weapons attack by Russia in Ukraine, after meeting with European leaders Thursday and following Ukraine's President Zelenskky pleading with them to do more to help. Noting Biden has warned there's a ""real threat"" in Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine, the first question to him was on whether the U.S. has gathered specific intelligence that suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin is considering deploying chemical weapons and whether the U.S. or NATO respond with military action if he did use them. ""I'm not going to give you intelligence data, number one,"" Biden said. ""Number two, we would respond. We would respond if he uses it, and the nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use."" ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega followed up, and asked, ""If chemical weapons were used in Ukraine could that trigger a military response from NATO?"" ""It would trigger a response in kind,"" Biden replied. ""Whether or not -- you're asking whether NATO would cross -- we'd make that decision at the time."" But Biden did not lay out what that response might look like and whether it would involve sending U.S. troops to Ukraine, which Biden has vowed not to do. As he began, Biden announced a range of new sanctions against Russia targeting the majority of the Duma and Russian elites, that the U.S. will welcome up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine and provide $1 billion in new humanitarian aid, as he faces pressure from Zelenskyy to provide more deliverables to Ukraine. ""Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine,"" Biden said, adding later on that he was ""banking on NATO being split."" Biden also described his call last week with China's President Xi Jinping as ""very straightforward"" and said that, while ""I made no threats,"" he did make clear Xi would be ""putting himself in significant jeopardy"" if China helped Russia with its invasion of Ukraine. The president made the foreign trip to attend an extraordinary summit of all 30 NATO leaders to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to NATO allies, participate in a pre-scheduled meeting of the European Council -- the political body of the European Union -- and meet with leaders of the Group of Seven, or G-7, major industrial nations. Biden also answered a definitive ""yes,"" when asked he believes that Russia should be removed from the G20, but noted that it ""would depend on the G20"" to make that decision. He said that point was raised today by G20 leaders and that he raised the possibility that if removing Russia can't be done because of ""Indonesia and others"" not in agreement, Ukraine should be able to attend future G20 meetings. And when he was asked if Zelenskyy needs to cede any Ukrainian territory in order to gain a cease-fire with Russia, Biden said, ""that is a total judgment based on Ukraine."" According to senior U.S. administration officials, the mood at NATO's emergency summit has been ""sober"" and ""resolute"" so far. ""There was a very strong sense that we are facing a significant historical moment, and very strong support from all the leaders who spoke about the need to defend our democracy,"" one of the officials told reporters during a telephone briefing Thursday. The officials said Zelesnkyy, who addressed NATO leaders remotely, spoke ""very eloquently"" and ""repeated his requests for continued and increased Western security assistance."" ""But notably, there was not a request for a no-fly zone,"" an official added. ""There was also not a request for NATO membership."" Zelesnkyy did ask for NATO to give 1% of all its tanks and said he hasn't been given an answer. ""I have been repeating the same thing for a month now: To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance without restrictions, as Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us,"" he continued. ""Ukraine asked for your planes so that we do not lose so many people. And you have thousands of fighter jets, but we haven't been given any yet."" ""We asked for tanks so that we can unblock our cities that are now dying,"" he added. ""You have at least 20,000 tanks. Ukraine asked for a percent -- 1% -- of all your tanks to be given or sold to us. But we do not have a clear answer yet."" Speaking after Zelenskyy's speech, Biden that Thursday marks one month since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. He discussed the sanctions that have already been imposed and expressed strong support for Ukraine as well as humanitarian and military aid and reaffirmed his support for Article 5, which is the cornerstone of NATO and states that an attack on one member is an attack on all members. Since Russian President Vladimir Putin launches his invasion one month ago, 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country and millions more have become internally displaced. Biden is scheduled to travel to Poland on Friday. As the fighting continues, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Wednesday that the State Department has made a formal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.

2022-03-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-charges-russian-officials-hacking-campaigns-targeted-critical/story?id=83653235,DOJ charges Russian officials over hacking campaigns that targeted critical infrastructure,"The Justice Department unsealed two indictments Thursday charging four Russian government employees with two separate conspiracies -- outlining their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns that targeted critical infrastructure networks in the U.S. and across the globe between 2012 and 2018. Altogether, DOJ says the hacking campaigns ""targeted thousands of computers, at hundreds of companies and organizations, in approximately 135 countries."" The unsealing of the cases and their detailed hacking schemes, according to the Justice Department, are intended to serve as a warning amid the current tensions with Russia about the ""urgent ongoing need for American businesses to harden their defenses and remain vigilant."" ""The conduct alleged in these charges is the kind of conduct that we are concerned about under the current circumstances and has been addressed by various parts of the federal government,"" a senior FBI official told reporters Thursday. ""These charges show the dark art of the possible when it comes to critical infrastructure."" In the first case (reported earlier on this DL after its unsealing in D.C. district court), the Justice Department unsealed charges from June of last year against Russian government employee Evgeny Gladkikh who, along with unidentified co-conspirators, carried out hacking attacks that caused two separate emergency shutdowns at a foreign energy facility. They later failed when they allegedly sought to carry out a similar attack on a U.S. company that managed similar critical infrastructure entities. In a separate case charged in August of last year, the Justice Department charged three officers in Russia's FSB with carrying out a two-phased campaign to ""target and compromise the computers of hundreds of entities related to the energy sector worldwide."" ""Access to such systems would have provided the Russian government the ability to, among other things, disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future time of its choosing,"" the Justice Department said Thursday. The hacking attempts, according to investigators, were part of Russia's efforts to ""maintain surreptitious, unauthorized and persistent access to the computer networks of companies and organizations in the international energy sector, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and utility and power transmission companies."" The indictment alleges that in the first phase of the attacks, the FSB officers were able to install malware on ""more than 17,000 unique devices in the United States and abroad, including computer networks used by some power and energy companies. In the second phase, they carried out targeted spearphishing attacks against more than 3300 individuals from more than 500 U.S. and international companies, including U.S. agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. According to DOJ, they were actually able to successfully compromise servers that hosted websites visited by energy sector engineers -- when engineers visited a compromised website their login credentials would in some cases be secretly captured by the Russian malware. None of the individuals publicly identified by DOJ in the new indictments reside in the U.S., making it unlikely they will face arrest or extradition over the charges.",12
2022-03-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-putin-war-criminal-meeting-troops-poland/story?id=83670309,Biden calls Putin a 'war criminal' after meeting with troops in Poland,"President Joe Biden touched down Friday in Poland, what's become the epicenter for millions fleeing their home country, to meet with U.S. service members and refugees as his presence in Europe sends a powerful message that NATO is united against Russia's violent invasion. At a briefing in Rzeszów on the humanitarian response to the ongoing crisis, Biden, again, called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal,"" after the State Department announced this week its formal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. ""The single most important thing that we can do from the outset is to keep the democracies united in our opposition and our effort to curtail the devastation that is occurring at the hands of a man who I quite frankly think is a war criminal,"" Biden said, flanked by Poland’s President Andrzej Duda and USAID Administrator Samantha Powers. ""I think it will meet the legal definition of that as well."" Biden's schedule was slightly delayed Friday after the plane flying Poland’s president turned back en route to Rzeszow to make an emergency landing in Warsaw. Earlier, Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin greeted members of the 82nd Airborne division in Rzeszów to thank them for their service -- and ended up staying for a slice of pizza. ""Thank you very, very much for all you do. And it's not hyperbole to suggest you're the finest fighting force, not in the world -- in the world. That's not hyperbole,"" Biden told the room. But the president also raised eyebrows when he appeared to tell the group that American troops will be going into Ukraine, though he has repeatedly said that he will not send troops there. ""You know, with the Ukrainian people, Ukrainian people have a lot of backbone, they have a lot of guts and I'm sure you're observing it,"" Biden said. ""And you're gonna see when you're there, and some of you have been there. You're gonna see, you're gonna see women, young people standing, standing in the middle, in front of a damn tank, just saying I'm not leaving. I'm holding my ground. They're incredible. But they take a lot of inspiration from us."" Asked to clarify Biden's comment, a White spokesperson told ABC News, “the President has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.” Biden also told the room that what they are engaged in is ""much more than just whether or not you can alleviate the pain and suffering of the people of Ukraine."" ""What's at stake, and not just in what we're doing here in Ukraine to try to help the Ukrainian people and keep the massacre from continuing, but beyond that, what's at stake is...what are your kids and grandkids gonna look like in terms of their, their, their freedom."" Raising his familiar line of the current fight between autocracies and democracies, Biden told these troops what they are doing is ""really consequential"" and goes beyond just helping Ukrainians from this invasion. ""The fact of the matter is that you are the finest -- this is not hyperbole. You're the finest fighting force in the history of the world. Let me say it again, the finest fighting force in the history of the world. Part of the reason is you've had to fight so much for the last 20 years. For real,"" he said. He also brought up his late son, Beau, saying, ""Proudest thing he ever did was put that uniform on. Like many of you, he didn't have to go either,"" Biden said. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan confirmed earlier Friday that the president will meet with refugees Saturday when he is in Warsaw and deliver a ""major address"" ahead of his departure. ""He will also have the opportunity to meet with Ukrainian refugees, and with American humanitarians who are they're trying to help feed and respond to the material needs of the refugee population in Warsaw,"" Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One. ""And he will give a major address tomorrow that will speak to the stakes of this moment, the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world, and why it is so important that the free world sustain unity and resolve in the face of Russian aggression,"" Sullivan added. In neighboring Ukraine, the war continues. In one of the worst attacks yet, the city council of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol has said 300 people were killed in a devastating bombing of its drama theater, where hundreds of people were sheltering. The building was marked with the words ""Children"" written in giant Russian letters on the ground to either side. Biden and the leaders of the other 29 NATO member countries came together in Brussels Thursday in a powerful show of solidarity against Russia’s invasion. Biden announced new sanctions against Russia, targeting a majority of the Duma, the lower level of parliament, over 40 Russian defense companies and yet more Russian oligarchs. He also announced the U.S. will provide $1 billion in humanitarian aid to support people within Ukraine and those impacted by Russia’s war against Ukraine. That funding will go to food, shelter, clean water, medical supplies and other assistance. Pushed on what the U.S. and NATO would do if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, Biden would not get specific or confirm intelligence that Vladimir Putin is moving chemical weapons into Ukraine but said they ""would respond"" and that ""the nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.""",7
2022-03-25,https://abcnews.go.com/US/lev-parnas-associate-rudy-giuliani-pleads-guilty-wire/story?id=83673598,"Lev Parnas, former associate of Rudy Giuliani, pleads guilty to wire fraud","Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani who was previously convicted on campaign finance charges, pleaded guilty Friday to a wire fraud conspiracy charge that resulted from his work at a startup insurance company he co-founded. Federal prosecutors accused 50-year-old Parnas of duping investors in Fraud Guarantee, a company he established in Florida with a co-defendant, David Correia, who previously pleaded guilty. Parnas appeared by video in front of U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan and said ""between approximately 2012 and 2019 I agreed with another person to give false information"" to potential investors. ""I'm extremely sorry for my actions, your honor,"" Parnas said. Parnas and Correia tried to lure potential investors to Fraud Guarantee by hiring Giuliani as a pitchman, according to federal prosecutors. Giuliani has said he was paid $500,000. Parnas briefly became a figure in the first congressional impeachment inquiry against former President Donald Trump in connection with his role in assisting Giuliani in his effort in Ukraine to find disparaging information about President Joe Biden and his family, as well to call for the ouster of then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. At least seven victims invested a total of more than $2 million in Fraud Guarantee because Parnas and Correia misled them about the financial arrangements. The majority of investor funds were withdrawn as cash and were spent on personal expenditures such as Parnas' rent, prosecutors said. ""Various representations he made to investors were material to obtaining funds,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos said. Parnas was previously convicted of six other counts. On the wire fraud conspiracy, he faces at least five years in prison when he's sentenced June 29. ""Certainly the government will seek restitution and forfeiture,"" Roos said.",0
2022-03-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/big-lie-takes-twists-gop-note/story?id=83652270,'Big lie' takes new twists for GOP: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Just because the grievances are familiar and false doesn't make them less relevant -- sometimes even in new and surprising ways. Former President Donald Trump is set to speak in Georgia on Saturday, two months ahead of primaries in which Trump himself has put his false claims about 2020 before Republican voters. His favored candidates will be on hand to introduce him, and he will almost certainly attack incumbent Republicans who rightly say he lost. What that means to GOP lawmakers has come into even sharper focus in recent days. A group of Georgia voters has filed a challenge to the right of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to run for reelection, citing the 14th Amendment's disqualification from Congress of anyone who ""shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" against the United States. Similar challenges are also facing Trump-loyal candidates in North Carolina and Wisconsin. And those cases got a new twist courtesy of a separate development this week. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., says he lost Trump's endorsement after refusing the former president's demand that he ""rescind"" the election and reinstall Trump as president. That's getting attention inside the Jan. 6 committee and begs the question of what other Trump-endorsed candidates have committed to. The committee's work also got more interesting with the revelation of post-election text messages between then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Ginni Thomas, the conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. All of this serves as a reminder that lies about the last election still matter -- to investigators, to Trump and to voters. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As President Joe Biden emerged from an emergency NATO summit Thursday, he told reporters the group of allies was ""never more united"" against Russia's aggression in Ukraine. ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega asked President Biden in Brussels: ""If chemical weapons were used in Ukraine could that trigger a military response from NATO?"" ""It would trigger a response in kind,"" Biden responded. ""Whether or not -- you're asking whether NATO would cross -- we'd make that decision at the time."" It's unclear what that means, as the Biden administration has pledged not to send U.S. troops to Ukraine. Biden also announced a host of new sanctions and promised to welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees to the U.S., though the logistics of how that would work are also fuzzy. Biden's high-stakes foreign trip continues Friday in Poland, where the president will meet with President Andrzej Duda. Biden also hinted at the possibility of meeting with refugees. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Although the final hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court unfolded Thursday without the contentious confrontations that marked the preceding two days, an interaction between Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall raised eyebrows over another topic -- the 2020 presidential election. Marshall -- who was appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify against Jackson's nomination -- repeatedly refused when pressed by Whitehouse to acknowledge Biden is ""the duly elected and lawfully serving president of the United States of America."" In his replies, Marshall said, Biden ""is the president of this country,"" leading Whitehouse to ask whether the attorney general was ""answering that omitting the language 'duly elected and lawfully serving' purposefully."" ""I'm answering the question. He is the president of the United States,"" Marshall said. The interaction garnered attention given Marshall's prior role leading the fundraising branch of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which promoted the rally preceding the Jan. 6 insurrection through robocalls. ""We are hoping patriots like you will join us to continue to fight to protect the integrity of our elections,"" said a recording of the robocall obtained by The Associated Press last year. At the time, Marshall asked for an internal review into who authorized the call from the organization. Asked by Whitehouse whether he ""personally solicited money to support the robocall that brought people to the Capitol,"" Marshall said he did not. Marshall also rejected the idea that the organization he was connected with was involved in the violent insurrection that followed the rally. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 47. That's the percentage of Americans who support the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of 14 polls since Jackson was announced as the nominee on Feb. 25. As FiveThirtyEight's Jean Yi writes, nine different polls have found plurality support for Jackson's confirmation while five have found majority support for it. And according to Gallup, which has recorded support for Supreme Court nominees dating back to Robert Bork's nomination in 1987, Jackson had the second-highest level of support. The Senate likely won't vote on Jackson's nomination until the week of April 8, so there's still plenty of time for Americans' minds to change, but right now, support for Jackson is fairly high.

2022-03-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/klobuchar-textbook-case-justice-thomas-recuse/story?id=83690256,Ginni Thomas' texts present 'textbook case' for Justice Thomas to recuse himself: Klobuchar,"Senate Judiciary Committee member Amy Klobuchar said Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas should recuse himself from certain cases after it emerged that his wife, Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, sent text messages to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows urging him to help overturn the 2020 election results, calling it ""a textbook case for"" recusal. Meadows voluntarily turned over the messages to the committee last year before deciding not to cooperate with the inquiry. In January, the court declined to block the Jan. 6 committee from obtaining Trump White House records over the objection of only one justice: Thomas. ""The facts are clear here. This is unbelievable,"" Klobuchar, D-Minn., told ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl in an exclusive interview on Sunday. ""You have the wife of a sitting Supreme Court justice ... advocating for overturning a legal election to the sitting president's chief of staff."" ""She also knows this election -- these cases are going to come before her husband,"" she added. ""This is a textbook case for removing him, recusing him from these decisions."" Karl followed up, and ""if he doesn't recuse himself?"" Klobuchar said ""the entire integrity of the court is on the line here"" and that she's looking to leadership from Chief Justice John Roberts and the rest of the bench to speak out on the issue. ""They had better speak out on this because you cannot have a justice hearing cases related to this election and, in fact, the ethics rules that apply to all the other federal judges say that if it involves a family member, appearance of impartiality, they have to recuse themselves,"" she said. ""So not only should he recuse himself, but this Supreme Court badly needs ethics rules,"" Klobuchar added. Following a week of contentious hearings to consider President Joe Biden's Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Karl pressed Klobuchar, who was present for those hearings, on whether any Republicans would vote for Jackson, the first Black woman to be nominated to the high Court. With West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin making clear his intention to vote for Jackson, she is on track for confirmation with or without GOP support. ""I think she (will). She has in every other nomination that she's had for very levels of the court... I can't tell you who. I can't tell you how much. But I think that will be very important to this process,"" Klobuchar said, applauding Jackson as ""the pillar of strength"" for how she handled Republicans' ""attacks"" during the hearings. In a defining moment of his presidency, Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin to not ""even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory,"" during a Saturday speech from the grounds of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland. He also surprised many when he said Putin ""cannot stay in power,"" leading White House officials to clarify that the United States is not calling for regime change in Russia. But Karl noted ""that was the headline around the world,"" and ""that was the message heard in Moscow."" Klobuchar responded by saying she's been on the Polish-Ukrainian border and seen and heard firsthand the horrors from refugees escaping Ukraine ""leaving everything they have behind, everything, their little stuffed animals and their backpacks, moms with suitcases leaving their husbands behind to fight."" ""Vladimir Putin is a monster,"" she said. ""But the position of the United States government is not to send troops there. It is to give all the aid we can to Ukraine...it's the humanitarian aid, over $1 billion pledged, taking in over 100,000 refugees, that is what we are doing."" Karl pressed: ""And it's not regime change in Moscow?"" ""That has been made very clear,"" she said.

2022-03-27,https://abcnews.go.com/International/blinken-meets-israel-arab-partners-looming-renewed-iran/story?id=83692136,"Blinken meets Israel, Arab partners as looming renewed Iran deal rattles ties","JERUSALEM -- While President Joe Biden’s administration has been seized by the global response to Russia's war on Ukraine, another foreign policy crisis looms ahead over the Iran nuclear deal. Talks to revive the accord have been on pause for over two weeks now, but the sides remain close to finalizing an agreement. Without one, the administration has warned Iran is just weeks away from having enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb. But the top U.S. partners in the Middle East are largely opposed to a renewed deal, with Israel rallying concern among its new Arab partners under the banner of the Abraham Accords, the Trump era deals that established diplomatic and economic ties between Israel and several Arab countries. Secretary of State Antony Blinken walked into that minefield this weekend, arriving in the region for four days of meetings, including a historic summit with Israel and three of the Abraham Accord countries -- the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco -- as well as Egypt. In Jerusalem Sunday, he will meet Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and other senior officials, seeking to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to Israel while assuaging Israeli concerns over a renewed nuclear deal. But Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid warned Sunday that Israel ""will do anything we believe is needed to stop the Iranian nuclear problem -- anything."" The 2015 deal, signed by Iran, the U.S. and other world powers, placed restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. But former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. in 2018, reimposing severe U.S. sanctions that were meant to drive Tehran to negotiate a new deal. During his term, it never happened, and instead, Iran took its own steps out of the deal -- enriching more uranium, to higher levels, and with more advanced centrifuges. It is now enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short technical step from 90% weapons-grade, with U.S. officials warning for weeks now that Iran is just weeks away from enough enriched uranium for a bomb. At that point, Iran would still have to complete several complicated, technical steps to build a nuclear warhead, but reaching that nuclear threshold would be deeply alarming. During the 2020 campaign, Biden pledged to rejoin the nuclear deal if Iran returned to ""strict"" compliance, saying he'd then launch follow-on talks on other issues. But nearly a year after negotiations began in Vienna, Iran's nuclear program continues to expand, while the delegations have not yet reached a deal. Iran's negotiators haven't even agreed to meet the American delegation, led by U.S. special envoy for Iran Rob Malley. Instead, negotiations have been conducted indirectly -- the U.S. and Iran meeting separately with the remaining parties to the deal: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China and Russia. While talks initially made progress last spring, they were halted in June ahead of Iran's presidential elections, where Ebrahim Raisi, a more hardline cleric closely tied to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, took power. Months of Iran's delays ended in November, but those resumed talks at first brought deep skepticism about reviving the deal. In recent weeks, however, all the sides have made clear they are close -- prompting a flurry of Israeli activity to rally opposition. Last Monday, Bennett traveled to Egypt for a historic summit with Egypt's strongman leader Abdel Fattah el Sisi and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed, UAE's de facto ruler. It was the first time the three countries' leaders met -- with talks focused on a joint defense strategy against Iran, according to Israel. The State Department said the U.S. welcomed the meeting, and Blinken will have his own summit on Monday, with Israel, UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, and Morocco -- as well as a key meeting with Sheikh Mohammed in Morocco. If there's any U.S. concern about the growing anti-Iran coalition, it's not public -- with the Abraham Accords a rare Trump era policy fully embraced by Biden's team. ""When it comes to the most important element, we see eye to eye. We are both committed, both determined that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon,"" Blinken said Sunday alongside Lapid at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. For his part, Bennett is keen to avoid a public spat like the one between former President Barack Obama and his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, who addressed a Republican-controlled Congress in 2015 to lobby against the deal, infuriating the White House. Instead, Bennett and Lapid, who is supposed to succeed Bennett as prime minister in a power-sharing deal, have taken to emphasizing their points of agreement with the Biden team. When Lapid and Blinken met last month in Munich, both men emphasized their ""shared goal"" -- preventing Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon. But that's what made Bennett and Lapid's recent vocal opposition to some parts of a potential deal so striking. The two released a statement over a week ago, condemning what could be part of an ultimate deal, de-listing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from the State Department's foreign terrorist organization list. ""The attempt to delist the IRGC as a terrorist organization is an insult to the victims and would ignore documented reality supported by unequivocal evidence,"" the two men said. ""We believe that the United States will not abandon its closest allies in exchange for empty promises from terrorists."" During a joint press conference, Lapid affirmed Israel's belief that the IRGC is a terrorist organization, while Blinken declined to say whether he considered it one: ""The IRGC is probably the most designated organization in one way or another in the world,"" he said. But he argued that an Iran without the nuclear deal would be an even greater threat to the region: ""An Iran with a nuclear weapon -- or the capacity to produce one on short notice -- would become even more aggressive and would believe it could act with a false sense of impunity."" Biden administration officials have said those follow-on talks would address issues like Iran's ballistic missile program or its support for proxy forces like Hezbollah, which threatens Israel from Syria and Lebanon, or the Houthis, which threatens Saudi Arabia and UAE from Yemen. Just on Friday, a Houthi attack on Saudi oil giant Aramco's facilities caused two storage tanks to set fire in massive blazes in Jeddah, although there were no casualties. Saudi Arabia retaliated with a strike in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on Saturday. But analysts say those talks are increasingly unlikely, with Iran refusing to engage the U.S. even in nuclear negotiations. Either way, critics like Bennett say a revived deal will mean new funds for Iran to project strength across the region and menace its adversaries, none more so than Israel. ""Trying to reach an agreement that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and addresses their attacks on our key partners is an effort worth pursuing. But we need to consult our partners and realize that Iran has not changed -- and, with the recent attacks in northern Iraq and Saudi Arabia, they do not intend to change. We need an agreement that works for everyone, not just an agreement for the sake of having an agreement,"" said Mick Mulroy, a former top Pentagon official and now an ABC News national security analyst. In recent days, however, Blinken and his team have changed their tune slightly, with the current two-week pause in talks seeming to cause some alarm about a deal's likelihood. ""The deal is not just around the corner, and it's not inevitable,"" Malley said Sunday at the Doha Forum. Still, Blinken pressed the case with Lapid and others that without a deal, Iran would be more dangerous as it's able to race toward a nuclear weapon with little insight to its program. Even as the U.S. says it's preparing for that world, Blinken will press Israel and Arab partners for alternatives to keeping a nuclear weapon out of Iranian hands, should diplomacy fail. ""We've long discussed ... alternatives with our partners in the region,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Tuesday, adding, ""For obvious reasons we haven't detailed publicly what that might look like, but it is not for lack of planning on our part."" But at some point, Israel may take those alternatives into their own hands, with the specter of an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities growing, after years of Israeli sabotage. ""Israel and the United States will continue to work together to prevent a nuclear Iran,"" Lapid said next to Blinken Sunday, but added, ""At the same time, Israel will do anything we believe is needed to stop the Iranian nuclear problem - anything.""",23
2022-03-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-words-spark-war-war-note/story?id=83701816,Biden’s words spark war within war: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein ""The single most important thing is for us to stay unified,"" President Joe Biden said last week during his news conference at NATO headquarters. Biden's own words during a trip designed to further isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin wound up cutting against that stated goal. It also may limit any political advantage the president could derive back home from the relative unity in supporting Ukraine. At that same news conference in Brussels, Biden declared that ""sanctions never deter"" and that he didn't claim they would deter Putin's invasion. Except a range of administration officials had said exactly the opposite, including Vice President Kamala Harris: ""The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence,"" Harris said Feb. 20 in Munich. Then came Biden's broadside about Putin at the end of the last speech of his trip on Saturday in Poland: ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" A line that might have carried moral clarity left a geopolitical mess. The White House and friendly Democrats leapt to explain that the president was not endorsing regime change as a policy matter. Putin allies, meanwhile, reacted with indignation, grateful for the chance to gain even a sliver of high ground. Polls have shown growing frustration with Biden's handling of Ukraine, even while most Americans favor specific steps the president has taken. Now the White House is left emphasizing that it doesn't favor Putin being thrown out of power. The rhetorical turn highlights the steps Biden isn't willing to take on behalf of Ukraine, all to avoid potentially further provoking Putin. ""It reminds us that message discipline has its virtues,"" retired Gen. David Petraeus told Jonathan Karl, ABC's chief Washington correspondent, on ""This Week."" ""It will cause some challenges down the road."" The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Sen. Amy Klobuchar wants Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from certain Supreme Court cases now that his wife's bombshell text messages attempting to overturn the 2020 election have become public. The call came during an exclusive interview with ABC's ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl in the wake of reports that Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas sent text messages to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows ​perpetuating lies about the 2020 election and urging him to try to help overturn the results. ""The facts are clear here. This is unbelievable,"" Klobuchar, D-Minn., told Karl on Sunday. ""You have the wife of a sitting Supreme Court justice ... advocating for overturning a legal election to the sitting president's chief of staff."" Klobuchar said other sitting justices should speak out if Thomas doesn't take himself out of the mix on his own, calling it a ""textbook case"" for recusal. ""They had better speak out on this, because you cannot have a justice hearing cases related to this election,"" she said, noting that ethics rules for federal judges generally say they should recuse themselves if a family member is involved in a case before them or if they may appear partial. In Justice Thomas' case, he was the lone Supreme Court judge who voted in January to block the Jan. 6 committee -- which his wife has opposed -- from obtaining Trump White House records. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema While Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is poised to sign GOP-backed legislation that stirred nationwide debate over discussions of LGBTQ issues in classrooms, the governor on Friday enacted another bill aimed at schools' instruction methods. H.B. 1467 ""requires school districts to be transparent in the selection of instructional materials, including library and reading materials,"" according to the governor's office. The bill allows Floridians -- regardless of whether they are parents with ties to school children -- to file complaints with their county's school board about instructional materials they deem objectionable. The residents filing complaints would have to offer evidence to school boards that shows the instructional material does not meet the criteria of the course being taught as outlined by the Department of Education. They could also be asked to demonstrate that the material is somehow ""pornographic"" or ""is inappropriate for the grade level and age group for which the material is used."" The petition to object to instructional materials must be filed within 30 days of a school's adoption of the materials, and then the school board is required to hold a public hearing to determine whether to keep them in the curriculum. The move by DeSantis is the latest overlap between politics and education on the campaign trail. The Florida governor even invoked the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race earlier this year. ""You had this governor's race in Virginia, where you had the losing candidate say parents should not be involved in what is taught in the school system, and so, there is a debate in this country about what role parents have in the education of their kids,"" DeSantis said. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 85. That's the percentage of Americans who said they were satisfied with their own lives in a January Gallup poll.

2022-03-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-no-apologies-putin-cannot-remain-power/story?id=83722293,Biden makes 'no apologies' for saying Putin 'cannot remain in power',"President Joe Biden appeared to want to both ways when he fielded a barrage of questions Monday asking him to clarify his comment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power."" He stood by his words ""expressing moral outrage"" but also clarified that he wasn't ""articulating a policy change."" Biden -- who made the apparently unscripted comment in Poland on Saturday -- took questions from reporters Monday afternoon at an event unveiling his latest budget proposal, which includes $6.9 billion to help Ukraine fight Russian aggression. The first question to Biden was: ""Do you believe what you said, that Putin can't remain in power, or do you now regret saying that? Because your government has been trying to walk that back, did your words complicate matters?"" ""Number one, I'm not walking anything back. The fact of the matter is I was expressing the moral outrage I felt toward the way Putin is dealing and the acts of this man just -- brutality, half the children in Ukraine. I had just come from being with those families, and so -- but I want to make it clear, I wasn't then nor am I now articulating a policy change. I was expressing the moral outrage that I feel, and I make no apologies for it,"" Biden said. Biden went on to say that he does not think the comment complicates the diplomacy of this moment. ""The fact is that we're in a situation where it complicates the situation at the moment is the escalatory efforts of Putin to continue to engage in carnage. The kind of behavior that makes the whole world say, 'My God, what is this man doing?' That's what complicates things a great deal and -- but I don't think it complicates it all,"" Biden added. ""I was expressing my outrage. He shouldn't remain in power. Just like, you know, bad people shouldn't continue to do bad things. But it doesn't mean we have a fundamental policy to do anything to take Putin down in any way,"" Biden said. Pressed by ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce if he's confident Putin doesn't see his words as escalatory, Biden said, ""I don't care what he thinks."" ""Given his behavior, people should understand that he is going to do what he thinks he should do, period. He's not affected by anybody else including, unfortunately, his own advisers. This is a guy who goes to the beat of his own drummer. And the idea that he is going to do something outrageous because I called him for what he was and what he's doing, I think is just not rational,"" Biden said. He told another reporter that another meeting with Putin, ""depends on what he wants to talk about."" Asked why he made the comment closing out his four-day alliance-building trip that was not in his prepared remarks, Biden said he was ""talking directly to the Russian people."" ""The last part of the speech was talking to the Russian people, telling them what we thought. I was communicating this to not only the Russian people but the whole world. This is -- this is just stating a simple fact that this kind of behavior is totally unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. And the way to deal with it is to strengthen and put -- keep NATO completely united and help Ukraine where we can,"" he said. ""Nobody believes we're going to take down, I was talking gonna go -- about taking down Putin,"" Biden added. ""Nobody believes that."" Pressed further, Biden repeated he was ""expressing the moral outrage I felt toward this man"" and ""wasn't articulating a policy change."" Biden also told reporters Sunday evening he was not calling for Putin's removal from office, after the White House and some Democrats scrambled to explain the president was not endorsing regime change in Russia as a policy goal. ""The president's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or regime change,"" a White House official said after the speech. ""I think the president, the White House made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else,"" said Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday. ""As you've heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else, for that matter. In this case, as in any case, it's up to the people of the country in question. It's up to the Russian people."" Putin's allies, meanwhile, have appeared to take the comment as escalatory rhetoric, and the fallout could undermine diplomatic efforts to end the war. ""That's not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians,"" said Kremlin spokesperson Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Biden also called Putin a ""butcher"" over the weekend, after meeting with refugees in Poland. His language drew a rebuke from France's President Emmanuel Macron, who was asked about Biden calling Putin a ""butcher"" and saying he ""cannot remain in power."" ""I wouldn't use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin,"" Macron said in an interview with France 3. ""Because what do we want to do collectively? We want to stop the war that Russia launched in Ukraine, without waging war and without escalation."" The dustup comes as recent polls have shown growing frustration with Biden's handling of Ukraine, even while most Americans favor specific steps the president has taken. According to recent ABC News/Ipsos data, 70% of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of gas prices, for instance, though even more respondents -- 77% -- support his proposal to ban Russian oil, even if it means paying more at the pump. Biden has stepped up his rhetoric in recent weeks as the fighting in Ukraine has worsened. At least twice in the last month, he has called the Russian president a ""war criminal,"" adding he thinks Putin ""will meet the legal definition."" The State Department announced last week Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine but did not specially name Putin.",7
2022-03-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/belarusian-border-nato-military-exercise-now-powerful-show/story?id=83671252,"On the Belarusian border, a NATO military exercise is now a powerful 'show of force'","The silence of the Polish countryside is shattered by the piercing rattle of heavy artillery fire. A smokescreen obscures the horizon, and suddenly, the soldiers swarm. Moving in on armored vehicles, in helicopters, and atop assault watercraft, more than 2,000 soldiers combine to form a united front on the battlefield against an imagined enemy. This is a NATO exercise--preparation in case these troops are called upon to defend the alliance's territory. While it's a scenario that once seemed unthinkable, here—just 10 miles from the Belarusian border and against a geopolitical backdrop dominated by rapacious Russian aggression, this is more than just a drill. ""It's a show of force,"" Lt. Karol Frankowski of Poland told ABC News, adding that Belarus—Russia's staunchest ally—is likely watching over them via aircraft or drone. Soldiers from Poland, Croatia, Romania, the U.K. and U.S. make up the battle group, one of four that received a surge of manpower to defend the eastern front in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Their American commander, Lt. Col. Trevor Phillips, said today's practice feels ""absolutely"" different, colored by the crisis. ""It's difficult to watch and not be able to do anything about it. We're direct action type people. Our whole motto while we are here is 'stronger together,'"" Frankowski said. ""No nation should stand alone. That's why this is so important to us."" Even the objective of the practice is shaped by the warfare in Ukraine. The scenario--troops facing off against rival forces who attempt to barricade a bridge—recreates the challenges of modern warfare, officials said. ""The idea is to destroy the enemy and make free passage for the troops,"" Col. Piotr Fajkowsli, the leader of the Polish brigade, told ABC News. ABC News' Martha Raddatz asked Fajkowsli if he believed Russia would ever strike inside his homeland's boundaries. ""Anything can happen,"" said Fajkowsli, saying that not long ago, the thought of Russia descending on Ukraine with such brute force would have been considered by most to be ""impossible in the 21st century."" ""Now we can see destroyed towns burning. It is crazy,"" he said. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during Friday's press briefing it's an assessment the president and the White House believe as well. ""We do believe Russian aggression in Ukraine shows a willingness by the Russians to disregard international borders and to disregard the basic rules of the road of the international community that have been built in sustained over the course of seven decades,"" he said. Fajkowsli said they are ready to face anything the opposition throws at them. The people he is sworn to protect are a different story. ""We as soldiers are ready to fight against chemical weapons. We have protective gear. The civilians, they don't,"" he said. ""This is the danger."" After the bridge is won, the troops break. With the day's mission completed, they stand temporarily at ease. They will convene again tomorrow to once again play out these war games that now seem all too real. Phillips hopes the conflict doesn't spill over NATO's borders. ""But if it does, we're ready,"" he said.",7
2022-03-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-attends-historic-israeli-arab-summit-amid-iran/story?id=83701822,"Blinken attends 'historic' Israeli, Arab summit amid Iran deal tensions, Palestinian opposition","SDE BOKER, Israel -- Out here in the Negev desert, the Israeli government says, history is being made. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid hosted for the first time on Israeli soil the foreign ministers of four Arab countries that now have close ties with the Jewish state -- a new reality for a region realigned in recent years, especially by the threat from Iran. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken joined them for what Israel calls the Negev summit, but only after an evening of meetings with Palestinian leadership, including President Mahmoud Abbas, and civil society Sunday. While these new Arab-Israeli ties have been heralded for bringing peace and stability, they have left the Palestinians behind and done little to address the decades-old tensions there. ""These regional peace agreements are not a substitute for progress between Palestinians and Israelis,"" Blinken said standing next to Lapid, reiterating his call for the two sides to achieve ""equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, and dignity and create the conditions for a negotiated two-state solution."" The Biden administration is trying to patch up ties with the Palestinians after frosty Trump years -- especially with the specter of violence hanging over next month. Passover and Ramadan coincide, setting the stage for potential sparks like last spring's deadly fighting. Even so, Biden's team has also embraced Trump's Abraham Accords, the deals that established ties between Israel and several Arab neighbors -- a rare piece of continuity between the two administration's foreign policies. Monday's meeting brought together Israel and the U.S. with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco -- all members of the new accords. Egypt, which established ties with Israel over 40 years ago in a U.S.-brokered deal, also attended. Sudan, which was part of the accords, did not either, after a military coup last fall derailed its transition to a civilian-led democracy. ""What we are doing here is making history,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid declared in the Negev, the southern Israeli desert where he brought together Blinken and four Arab foreign ministers. There was no shortage of flowery statements for what was billed as a ""historic summit"" on Israeli soil, between Israel and the Arab countries it has ties with -- although notably, Jordan, which established ties in 1994, skipped it with King Abdallah instead traveling to the West Bank to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Blinken sang from the same sheet music Sunday, with he and other U.S. officials saying they believe deepening ties will help anchor peace across the region. ""What we're seeing is normalization become the new normal for this region,"" he said during a photo op with Israeli President Isaac Herzog -- a line he deployed repeatedly during his visit. ""The United States is very proud to be a part of that -- to support the efforts to deepen the partnerships with countries that have already normalized with Israel and to help seek new partners."" So far, Biden has had no luck with that effort -- with Saudi Arabia, in particular, remaining the key holdout -- and it's unclear what, if any, announcements will come from Monday's meeting. But still, the symbolism of Israel hosting these Arab countries, with their U.S. backer, is a powerful one - a ""dramatic signal of American alignment with Israel and moderate Arab states in the double shadow of the Ukraine crisis … and the likely return to the JCPOA Iranian nuclear agreement,"" according to Jim Jeffrey, a veteran U.S. diplomat and now the chair of the middle east program at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. Those two security challenges are where ties have frayed between the U.S. and its Mideast allies and partners under Biden. In recent weeks, the U.S. has urged Israel, the UAE, and others to do more to punish Russia and support Ukraine -- although in Jerusalem Sunday, Blinken praised Israeli commitments to enforce sanctions and provide humanitarian support, including a field hospital deployed to western Ukraine. In addition, as the State Department's team nears a renewed nuclear deal with Iran, Israel and Arab neighbors worry it will leave Iran flush with cash from sanctions relief -- ready to boost arms and funds to its proxies and expand its ballistic missile program. Several of these countries face near daily threats from Tehran and those proxies -- Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria for Israel, and the Houthis for UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are particularly adamant that Biden's administration has not done enough to support them. That made Monday's meetings a delicate dance for Blinken -- seeking to embrace the peaceful face of the Abraham Accords, while tempering the growing anti-Iran alliance as his team tries to complete a renewed Iran nuclear deal. In Jerusalem, Blinken papered over any differences, particularly with Israel, saying the two countries ""are united in addressing the challenges posed by Iran, including its nuclear program."" But what the burgeoning Arab-Israeli ties don't address is the decades-old tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. While Blinken fully embraced these Trump-era Abraham Accords, he didn't mention the former administration by name -- instead pledging the U.S. ""has and will continue strongly support a process that is transforming this region and beyond."" During a six-way joint statement, Lapid announced that the group would meet again, making this Negev summit a forum -- with an open ""door before all the peoples of the region, including the Palestinians and offering them to replace the way of terror and destruction with a shared future of progress and success."" That was Lapid's only mention of the Palestinians -- UAE's foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed didn't mention them at all, instead gushing about how Israelis and Emiratis are ""curious"" about each other. The major threat to the region's stability remains Iran. Israel and these Arab countries are especially concerned about a renewed nuclear deal filling Iran's coffers again to fund and arm proxy groups -- Hamas and Hezbollah that threaten Israel and the Houthis that threaten UAE and Saudi Arabia. Blinken pledged Monday to ""work together to confront common security challenges and threats, including those from Iran and its proxies"" -- his only reference to what remains a dividing point with America's closest friends in this region. The Biden administration was seized in one of its first foreign policy challenges by some of the worst violence in years between the Israeli military and Hamas, the U.S.-designated terror group that runs the Gaza Strip. Fighting lasted 11 days last May and killed over 250 people, the vast majority Palestinians. But the risk of violence looms large again next month, with Judaism, Islam and Christianity's holy days virtually overlapping in April -- Passover, Ramadan, and Easter. The violence last spring erupted after Israeli restrictions on the Temple Mount during Ramadan and prospective evictions of Palestinians from their homes in east Jerusalem. Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry warned of the specter of violence in Jerusalem next month, with Ramadan and Passover coinciding. During meetings in Jerusalem and Ramallah, Blinken reiterated a constant U.S. message -- that both sides refrain from steps that could provoke the other. Beyond that low bar, it seems Biden and Blinken have little interest in deep engagement on the issue. This is only Blinken's second trip to Israel and the West Bank in over a year in office, as the administration tries to focus attention on China and is consumed by Russia's war in Ukraine. ""Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve to live with equal measures of freedom, of opportunity, security, of dignity, and we believe that the most effective way, ultimately, to give expression to that basic principle is through two states,"" Blinken said Sunday with President Abbas. But he added, ""Of course, the two sides are very far apart, so we'll continue our work, step by step, to try to bring them closer."" One key question in that work is whether the U.S. will reopen its consulate general in East Jerusalem, which traditionally served as a consular operation for Palestinians. As part of its tense ties with Palestinian leaders, the Trump administration shuttered the facility when it moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Blinken has promised to reopen the consulate, but Israeli officials are fiercely opposed to doing so, saying a U.S. consulate for Palestinians should be in what they consider Palestinian territory, not Jerusalem -- which both sides claim as their capital. During remarks after their meeting, Abbas again welcomed the U.S. reopening the consulate -- which earned a head nod from Blinken. But Blinken made no mention of it throughout his trip in Israel, including when Lapid was asked about it during a joint press conference Sunday. ""It's not even our place to say anything,"" Lapid said. ""We just don't think Jerusalem is the right place for this because Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and Israel alone."" With that, Blinken and Lapid exited the room with a ""thank you"" to the press.",23
2022-03-29,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/politicized-decisions-loom-jan-note/story?id=83724703,Politicized decisions still loom around Jan. 6: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein President Joe Biden almost made it sound easy when he declined to comment on the latest revelations about Ginni Thomas’ efforts to urge officials to try to overturn the election, saying he would leave such matters to the Jan. 6 committee and the Justice Department: ""That’s their judgment, not mine, to make."" But recent events only serve to underscore the stakes around decisions not yet made -- or at least not yet revealed publicly -- by both of those entities. The House Jan. 6 committee is still wrestling with how and whether to seek information from Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in a probe that has already threatened to grow to unwieldy proportions. The committee is still gathering new information -- Jared Kushner is slated to appear this week -- with a tight timeline for public hearings and writing a final report. Thomas is only the latest potential witness to prompt dissent inside the committee over how far to extend aspects of the investigation. And a win for the committee in court on Monday, forcing attorney John Eastman to hand over emails, means more documents, along with a good measure more pressure on the Justice Department. Judge David Carter crossed an important threshold with his finding that it is ""more likely than not that President Trump"" committed a crime on Jan. 6. Such a sentence would matter orders of magnitude more, however, if the Justice Department agrees. Attorney General Merrick Garland has been preparing all along for lengthy investigations, including in his department’s budget request this week for an additional 131 new attorneys to handle Jan. 6-related inquiries. Biden can take himself out of making the critical decisions. That, though, doesn’t take the politics out of some of the most significant choices that will have to come out of both Congress and law-enforcement entities. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The Biden administration is pushing a $5.8 trillion budget proposal with aims to drive down the deficit and tackle inflation. White House officials have described the plan as ""fiscally responsible"" and say it would decrease the deficit by $1.3 trillion over one year. That claim is an important one, considering the timing for the Biden administration. It is considered an appeal to the middle as time ticks toward midterm elections that could have unsavory outcomes for Democrats. To avoid a repeat of the failure of Biden’s Build Back Better spending plan, Biden needs to get Sen. Joe Manchin on board, and playing up a deficit reduction could help him do it. The plan calls for increases in funding for law enforcement to combat crime and for national security spending amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, items that could garner bipartisan support. Other top lines from the plan include funding for mental health care, veterans services and cancer prevention. On inflation, the plan calls for investments to address supply chain issues, including port infrastructure and shoring up railways that carry freight. It also aims to invest in affordable housing. White House officials told reporters Monday that deficit reduction efforts, in addition to investments, would address inflation long-term, but they didn’t guarantee short-term relief for the soaring costs Americans are enduring coast to coast. ""We believe the policies in this budget will further reduce the deficit by another trillion over the next decade,"" Cecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, said. ""A lower deficit will help ease long-term inflationary pressures and make our fiscal trajectory more sustainable."" Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young is slated to testify to the House Budget Committee on Tuesday about the president’s proposed budget. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Although the date of the upcoming special election in Texas' 34th congressional district is yet to be determined, the race is already shaping up as an opportunity for the GOP to spotlight the party's efforts to forge inroads with Latino voters and diversify its field of candidates. The contest to replace outgoing Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela will happen within the district's old borders, rather than its new redistricted parameters, offering Republicans hope that they can claim the district, if even for a short time before November's general election. The older district outlined an area that President Joe Biden won by about four points, but according to FiveThirtyEight's redistricting analysis, the new contours of the district -- which this fall's contest will encompass -- resulted in an area that favors Democrats by 17 points. Earlier this year, the current Republican candidate in the running for the 34th district, Mayra Flores, offered testimony during a redistricting hearing that pushed back on the redistricting changes being imposed under her own party's proposals. At the time, Flores said the changes created by the new map prevented her from significantly challenging a Democratic opponent, while also ignoring the impact Latino conservatives could have on the political landscape. As reported by ABC News' Brittany Shepherd, Rep. Elise Stefanik backed Flores and acknowledged the possible benefits of competing under the older map while speaking at a Monday press conference to announce the latest round of endorsements for her political action committee, which seeks to elevate conservative women candidates. ""In the Texas' 34th [congressional district] seat as its currently configured … Joe Biden only won this district by four points. Given how under water he is today, at historically low polling, given the multiple crises that voters are facing, whether its inflation, energy prices or the border crises that we see first-hand in Texas, we think we have a ripe opportunity to pick up this seat,"" Stefanik said. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 11. People were 11 percentage points less likely to say they would accept a Muslim refugee than a Christian one in a huge study of public opinion in Europe. Recent polls have found support for taking in refugees fleeing Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s invasion is high across Europe -- much higher than the last time Europe faced a sudden influx of refugees in 2015, when more than a million people from several Middle Eastern and African countries sought asylum fleeing the Syrian civil war. Many factors explain the difference, as FiveThirtyEight’s Laura Bronner reports, but studies have found that race and religion are two of the biggest in determining which refugees are accepted versus turned away.

2022-03-29,https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/holocaust-survivors-rescued-ukraine-operation-survivor/story?id=83728056,Holocaust survivors rescued from Ukraine in 'Operation Survivor',"Valeriy Zharkovska began kissing the front door to his apartment. The 80-year-old Holocaust survivor was crying, and soon his daughter Inna burst into tears as well. After a failed attempt to leave days earlier, Zharkovska was finally escaping Kharkiv, Ukraine with what was left of his family. For Zharkovska, who survived the Holocaust as a boy, leaving his home meant leaving behind a part of himself. It’s where he rebuilt his life in the years following World War II, and where he spent the last several years taking care of his wife, who died last summer. But in recent weeks, it’s also where he watched his granddaughter shelter under blankets and pillows as Russian bombs rained down around them. Every family in the city lived in darkness at night, in fear that the Russian army would see a light in their window and ultimately bomb it. “It's unbearable,” Inna told ABC News, recalling how she watched her father tear his hand away from the door and walk away from everything he knew. “I understand how difficult it is for him,” she added. “It’s his motherland, and everything he loves is connected with it.” Valeriy Zharkovska is just one of an estimated 10,000 Holocaust survivors who were living in Ukraine at the start of the war. Now, he is one of hundreds of Holocaust survivors who are fleeing a war that is stirring up memories long since buried. Before the taxi-ride through bombed-out Kharkiv, the interminable hours in a bus to Lviv, the shelters in Warsaw, and an apartment in Kassel, Germany, Valeriy and Inna’s escape began with a phone call from across the Atlantic Ocean. On the other end of the line, 6,500 miles away, was Julia Entin, who until days earlier worked as a paralegal for Bet Tzedek, a non-profit organization based in Los Angeles that helps Holocaust survivors receive reparations. Entin, a grandchild of Holocaust survivors, knew she couldn’t say no. Entin started reaching out to various contacts on social networking platforms and WhatsApp, and within days had connected with multiple groups that were helping to evacuate Holocaust survivors from the war-torn region. She quickly learned the logistics of war-time rescues and the importance of sharing resources with several grassroots organizations already on the ground in Ukraine, like the LGTBQ-oriented Safebow, as well as Israeli-based volunteers from ZAKA and Yad Ezer L’Haver. “If a person cannot move without special transport, then you have to find special transport. It means that you might need to call a friend who happens to have another friend, who happens to have another friend, who happens to be involved in some sort of medical transport on the ground,” Entin said. But it’s more than just logistics; Entin explained that not all of the survivors trusted their would-be rescuers, and it took some convincing to get them out. “You have to create a certain level of trust, because again, you are thousands of miles away. And it is probably equally unreal to them that somebody thousands of miles away is going to help them with something that seems impossible,” said Entin. But the impossible is exactly what Entin did with Inna and her family. More than a week before the initial conversation she had with Entin, Inna Zharkovska realized it was time to leave the besieged city. The three Zarkhovskas hoped to flee via train, but at the city’s central train station, they were met with a sea of refugees also searching for a way to escape the Russian advance. And jammed in that crowd jockeying for space on a train, Valeriy fainted. With help, Inna carried her father to a small medical room inside the train station to recover. That night though, with thousands of people sheltering inside the train station, bombs fell around them. The family was forced to return home the next morning to the sound of more explosions across the city; a sound that would now become the new normal. “[My daughter] spent most of the days and nights being covered with blankets in the corner of the room, which is what we found to be the safest,” said Inna. It was then that a U.S. relative of Valeriy reached out for help and, through a series of connections, finally put Inna in touch with Entin. Entin eventually teamed up with newly founded Safebow, a non-profit that was originally set up to evacuate LGBTQ Ukrainians. The logistics were not easy. “We have to find a driver who's willing to go and risk their lives to climb into the space, run up the stairs and knock on the door and see if they can find them,” Rain Dove, the founder of Safebow, told ABC News. “It's a very, very, very chaotic process. But we are pioneers in an era of innovation that has never occurred,” Dove continued, “So we have people like Julia, who doesn't even have to leave their bedroom, and yet can personally guide a Holocaust survivor across the country and get resources for them every step of the way.” As Safebow started connecting people who needed help with people who could help, the group found out that a lot more people outside the LGBTQ community needed help that they could provide. “And it's a really beautiful thing to see different vulnerable, marginalized people from around the world, rescuing anyone who asks for help, because it's usually the other way around,” added Dove, a model who is an activist in the LGBTQ community. It was ultimately Safebow’s organizers who were able to find Inna and her family and helped transport them from Kharkiv to Kyiv, and eventually across the border into Poland. But the terror war followed the family, even in safety. Just like Valeriy suffered years of trauma in the wake of World War II, his granddaughter was now facing her own post-traumatic stress. The scars from the destruction of Kharkiv resurfaced on the streets of Warsaw. One day while on a walk in the center of Warsaw – they heard a loud bang. Inna’s daughter dived for cover on the street. “She started crying and she started asking us to cover her with pillows, with something, because she was absolutely sure that it was a bombing,” said Inna. Inna’s family is now safe, nearly 1,500 miles away from Ukraine in a small town, aware of the irony of a Holocaust survivor seeking shelter in Germany. But for the granddaughter of that Holocaust survivor, the terror remains close. “When we arrived here, my daughter kept asking ‘Mom, can I switch on the light? Is it really true that I can switch on the light in the evening?’” Inna recalled her daughter asking her continuously. “’And can I come up to the window?’” she added.",22
2022-03-30,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainians-rescue-exotic-animals-abandoned-zoo/story?id=83760290,Ukrainians try to rescue exotic animals from abandoned zoo,"A group of Ukrainian volunteers is attempting to rescue animals from a private zoo near the capital that was abandoned after the Russian army bombed and occupied the area. Vitaly Mukhanov told ABC News that he had volunteered to help bring supplies to Ukrainian soldiers when he came across the Yasnohorodka family ecopark, about 30 miles outside Kyiv. The park appeared to have been damaged by shelling, Mukhanov said. Animals, including camels and ostriches, were left with no food. Some were injured, while others were dead, he said. “You could tell that many of the animals starved to death,"" Mukhanov said. Videos and images Mukhanov took of the scene and posted on Facebook on Monday quickly went viral and he said he was subsequently contacted by the zoo's owner, who asked for his assistance. In one of the videos, Mukhanov comes across a wounded ostrich. The bird appeared to be taking its last breaths as he gently stroked its head. ""You can see from the images that the animals were in a very bad way,"" Mukhanov said. ""The town nearby was liberated from the Russians two days ago, so the owner is now returning to the zoo and they hope to evacuate the animals in the next couple of days,"" he said. As of Wednesday morning, Yasnohorodka family ecopark posted on their Facebook page that the animals were being rescued and evacuated from the area. Mukhanov explained that due to the area being bombed and occupied by Russian forces, the owners and staff were in fear of their lives and had to flee the zoo as quickly as possible, forcing them to leave the animals behind. “As of now this area has been freed and our Ukrainian troops are there, so we have organized and guaranteed the owner safety so he can evacuate the animals,” he said. The owner will be returning back to the area hopefully by tomorrow, he said, but there are currently staff and volunteers on-site feeding the animals and safely beginning to evacuate some of them. ABC News reached out to park operators but have not received a comment.",22
2022-03-30,https://abcnews.go.com/International/pregnant-flee-ukraine-war-imposes-long-term-health/story?id=83724438,"As pregnant flee Ukraine, war imposes long-term health effects: Experts","As the war in Ukraine rolls into its second month, pregnant women fleeing the violence face innumerable challenges given their unique health status. Pregnant refugees and their unborn children are uniquely vulnerable to higher rates of death, disease and mental health challenges that can persist after birth. ""There's obviously the risk of physical harm. ... [The] placenta can separate causing something called placental abruption that can lead to hemorrhage and death for both mom and baby,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Langen, associate clinical professor of maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Michigan. Prenatal stress is also associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia -- dangerous elevations in blood pressure during the second half of pregnancy -- as well as gestational diabetes, according to a peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Caring Sciences. Both of these conditions confer risk to both the mother and fetus. Immediate danger for pregnant women and babies Reports from Ukraine indicate women are giving birth in makeshift shelters in basements and subway stations. Equipment, facilities and qualified providers are scarce. Injured pregnant women were photographed evacuating from the Mariupol Children's Hospital after it was destroyed by airstrikes earlier this month. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported over 75 verified incidents of attacks on health care facilities since the start of the invasion, all of which would constitute war crimes. ""Pregnant women are extra vulnerable because they're going through a period of time where they can't run away as fast and they are going to need medical help and are going to have a major life event that sometimes requires a lot of resources from a hospital,"" said Langen. ""If you've destroyed their hospitals and their infrastructure, you're going to see more women die in childbirth."" Even after relocation, expectant mothers face many barriers to care. Anissa Dickerson, a certified nurse midwife and the co-director of the Refugee Women's Health Clinic at Boston Medical Center, has seen many of these issues working with refugees in the past. ""We have patients show up for their first prenatal visits and they might be in their late second trimester, early third trimester. They may have had one ultrasound but they didn't have anything else or they had some lab work, but we're not really sure what it is,"" said Dickerson. ""There is some data out there saying that displaced people have a higher rate of preterm birth, low birthweight and stillbirth,"" said Dickerson, an observation corroborated by a study in the journal of Social Science and Medicine. Health impacts extend beyond wartime Perinatal complications are often compounded by a lack of essential resources. ""If there is malnutrition because of inadequate access to food, that malnutrition for moms can lead to growth problems for the baby while they're in utero,"" said Langen. ""As those kids grow up, they seem to have the opposite problems. They're more likely to have obesity and diabetes and problems with their metabolism, because they lived in such a deprived state while they were a fetus."" Refugees experience higher rates of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, according to a peer-reviewed study in the journal BMC Medicine. In new mothers, these conditions can have long lasting repercussions for both her and her newborn. ""If mom has postpartum depression or postpartum PTSD, which is certainly more likely if you're delivering in a war zone, that impacts how she's able to bond with the baby, and how she's able to provide the care that she would want to after the baby's born,"" added Langen. In light of the U.S. recently announcing its plan to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, Dickerson hopes for an opportunity to address these challenges and provide holistic care for these women and children. ""They're more than their immigration status,"" she said.

2022-03-30,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-primaries-nasty-turn-trump-note/story?id=83746130,"GOP primaries take nasty turn, even without Trump: The Note","The TAKE with Rick Klein It turns out Republicans don't need former President Donald Trump to make their intraparty fights nasty - and that's not even counting what Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., is saying about his colleagues' after-hour activities. Midway through a busy forum-and-debate season in primaries, it's striking how personal and ugly some of the highest-profile races have gotten in contests for the Republican nomination. The leading Republican Senate candidates in Pennsylvania will all share a stage for the first time Wednesday morning at a candidate forum. Already in that race, David McCormick’s campaign has accused Dr. Mehmet Oz of harboring ""dual loyalties"" because Oz has maintained Turkish citizenship. For his part, Oz is airing a campaign ad asserting that McCormick is ""China's friend"" who made money on Chinese investments after ""China sent us COVID."" Over in Ohio, two GOP Senate candidates bumped chests and almost came to blows over foreign investments and credentials in the private sector at a recent debate. In the governor's race, the main Republican challenger to Gov. Mike DeWine has said the governor of his own party has inflicted ""misery"" on Ohioans and is the ""biggest RINO in America today."" That term – short for ""Republican in name only"" – is also coursing through a House primary in West Virginia where two GOP incumbents are running against each other because of redistricting. One candidate is calling his rival a ""RINO"" who likes to work with President Joe Biden; the target of that attack has labeled his colleague a ""political prostitute,"" citing his previous runs for office in other states. Trump himself has poured fuel on intra-party fights of late. He revoked an endorsement in Alabama just last week, and used a weekend trip to Georgia to refresh attacks on incumbent Republicans who didn't back up his lies about the 2020 election. The political environment may be such that Republicans win big this fall even while scorching each other during the primaries. For now, though, GOP candidates are spending time and money elevating issues that are likely to live through November in attack ads. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., joined the chorus of progressive lawmakers calling for Justice Clarence Thomas to resign. It comes amid continued fallout from the discovery of text messages from Thomas' wife, Ginni Thomas, to former president Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to overturn the election in the lead up to Jan. 6. ""Clarence Thomas should resign. If not, his failure to disclose income from right-wing organizations, recuse himself from matters involving his wife, and his vote to block the Jan 6th commission from key information must be investigated and could serve as grounds for impeachment,"" she wrote in a tweet. Ocasio-Cortez joins lawmakers including Reps. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, and Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who have called for resignation. Some lawmakers, like Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. have called on Thomas to recuse himself, citing a conflict of interest. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries called for the Senate Judiciary Committee to launch an investigation. If Thomas doesn't bow to the pressure and recuse himself from Jan. 6-related cases, the other recourse is impeachment, which is highly unlikely. Impeachment of a Supreme Court Justice, even if there were an appetite for it, is rare. Only one has been impeached, Justice Samuel Chase in 1804. He was ultimately acquitted. Thus far, Republicans have backed Thomas. ""Justice Thomas is a great American and an outstanding Justice,"" Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell said in a statement Friday. ""I have total confidence in his brilliance and impartiality in every aspect of the work of the Court."" The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Redistricting fallout continues to take a front seat in several states' primary calendars by creating legal hurdles and raising the stakes for parties' prospects in November. In Ohio -- where early voting for primary elections begins next week -- the state Supreme Court decided Tuesday it would not rule on a case challenging the state's current congressional district maps that heavily favor Republicans and which voting rights groups say are gerrymandered. The parties involved in the lawsuit now have nearly a month to provide evidence and written arguments, leaving a broader window for the court to give its decision, which could overlap with the May 3 primary election. For now, the state has not altered its election calendar in anticipation of issues stemming from the ongoing redistricting battle. Meanwhile in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis broke with the GOP-led legislature by vetoing congressional maps backed by state lawmakers of his own party. DeSantis also called for a special April legislative session to draw new maps. Although it is unlikely Florida's election calendar could be thrown off over the current state of the redistricting process given its August primary date, the lingering questions about what areas district borders end up covering could still hinder candidates' campaigning abilities. The move was expected, given the governor previously said he would reject the proposal while favoring his own version of the maps, which would give Republicans an even stronger political advantage. However, the map that ultimately is created during the upcoming special session is also likely to face challenges in court. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 41. That’s the percentage of Americans who approve of President Biden’s job performance, near his all-time low according to FiveThirtyEight’s real-time average of public opinion polls. Biden's approval ratings, which had been north of 50 percent during his first 200 days in office, began to steadily decline in the summer of 2021, reaching the low 40s by the end of last year. Then, in late February and into March, his numbers improved a smidge – the share of Americans saying they approved of his performance ticked up from about 41 percent to 43 percent, and the share saying they disapproved fell from just over 53 percent to roughly 51 percent. That's not a big change, of course. But it was significant given how polarized American politics have grown, and it raised at least the possibility that Biden could turn the trends around. Not so much, it turns out. Over the last two weeks, Biden's small gains have disappeared. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-03-30,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/federal-probe-hunter-bidens-taxes-intensifies-sources/story?id=83770321,"Federal probe into Hunter Biden's taxes intensifies, sources say","The federal investigation into President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, over his tax affairs has intensified in recent weeks, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. An increasing number of witnesses have appeared before a grand jury impaneled in Wilmington, Delaware, in recent months, the sources said, and have been asked about payments Hunter Biden received while serving on the board of directors of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, in addition to other questions about how Biden paid off tax obligations in recent years. The U.S. Attorney's Office for Delaware, which has been leading the investigation, is expected to hear from more witnesses in the coming weeks, sources told ABC News. Sources say that prosecutors have not made a decision yet on whether criminal charges against Biden are warranted, and that there is debate about whether Biden's admitted past drug abuse could serve to undermine a criminal case over his financial decision-making. A spokesperson for the DA's office declined to comment to ABC News, as did a spokesperson for the Justice Department. Chris Clark, an attorney for Hunter Biden, did not respond to a request for comment. The developments in the probe were first reported by The New York Times. Hunter Biden confirmed the existence of the investigation in December 2020, shortly after his father won the presidency. Since taking office, President Biden has repeatedly pledged to uphold the independence of the Justice Department and not interfere in its work. The tax probe is being led by U.S. Attorney Dan Weiss, a Trump appointee who remained on the job after Biden was sworn in. In a statement released through the Biden-Harris transition team in December 2020, Hunter Biden said that he and his attorney had learned of the investigation just days earlier, and that he was confident that he had handled his tax affairs ""legally and appropriately."" ABC News has previously reported that the investigation began in 2018 -- more than a year before Biden announced his presidential run. Investigators paused their work ahead of the election and waited until after votes were cast to notify Hunter Biden's legal team of the probe, a source told ABC News at the time. Ahead of the 2020 election, political foes of then-candidate Joe Biden -- including then-President Donald Trump -- focused on Hunter Biden's work as a board member for Burisma as well as a series of ill-fated investment endeavors in China. Trump and his allies sought unsuccessfully to characterize Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings over the past decade as evidence of Biden family corruption. ""In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,"" Hunter Biden told ABC News Anchor Amy Robach in October 2019, regarding the impact of his business dealings on his father's political career. ""Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is ... a swamp in -- in -- in many ways? Yeah."" While government watchdogs have broadly taken issue with the ethical implications of Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, the federal probe marks the first possible legal threat tied to his overseas work. Sources told ABC News that prosecutors in Delaware are investigating the tax implications of Hunter Biden's work in both China and Ukraine, among other business endeavors. ABC News' Mike Levine contributed to this report.",11
2022-03-31,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/year-diplomacy-biden-administration-confronts-difficult-realities-yemens/story?id=83773740,"After year of diplomacy, Biden administration confronts difficult realities of Yemen’s war","ALGIERS, Algeria -- One of President Joe Biden's first foreign policy moves was a pledge to help end one of the world's worst humanitarian crises – the war in Yemen – by ""stepping up our diplomacy"" and ""ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales."" More than a year later, the war has escalated – with a sharp increase in civilian casualties, a growing number of Yemenis facing hunger, with less humanitarian funding, less international oversight of airstrikes and more complex attacks against Yemen's neighbors fighting in the conflict. A possible new cease-fire for Islam's holy month of Ramadan could be within reach, the United Nations special envoy for Yemen indicated Wednesday, as he promotes a new peace plan. The Saudi-led coalition announced a unilateral cease-fire starting Wednesday, days after the Houthi rebels announced their own on cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. ""I don't want to overstate it because we've been here before, but there's a chance that we actually have a path forward with the new special envoy laying out what is a credible plan,"" a senior State Department official told ABC News. Temporary cease-fires and new peace plans have come and gone for seven years now, with the Yemeni people left to suffer the consequences. Nearly 400,000 people are believed to have been killed by fighting, disease and starvation, according to a U.N. report. Over 20 million – two-thirds of the population – are now reliant on humanitarian aid, including two million children facing acute malnutrition. ""The world cannot forget about Yemen,"" said Tamuna Sabadze, the country director for the International Rescue Committee, an aid group on the ground in Yemen – a country the size of California and long the Arab world's poorest. ""The suffering has continued for too long. Those with influence over the warring parties must work to deliver a diplomatic resolution to this crisis."" The Houthis, a northern rebel group increasingly backed by Iran, swept to power in 2014 when they seized the capital, Sanaa, amid Arab Spring strife. In response, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and an Arab coalition launched a military intervention – seven years ago this past Saturday – to prop up the Yemeni government and keep from power what they saw as an Iranian proxy. Biden brought new attention to the war early in his term, including by naming career diplomat Tim Lenderking as special envoy for Yemen. On one side, critics, including Republicans and Saudi and Emirati officials, blame increased fighting on his decision to remove the Houthis from the foreign terrorist organization list. On the other, especially among members of Biden's own party, there have been accusations that the administration is not doing enough to pressure the Saudi-led coalition to end the war. It's unclear if measures prescribed by critics on either side would do just that. The last year of diplomatic efforts hasn't. But amid rockier ties with those Gulf Arab partners, the Biden administration is shifting toward them – redoubling support for their defense and increasing pressure on the Houthis. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met the UAE's de facto ruler, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayan, on Tuesday during a tour of the region. They spent two hours together at a private residence of MBZ, as the powerful prince is known, in Morocco – including a 30-minute one-on-one stroll around the compound. A senior State Department official said Wednesday the two discussed ""different mechanisms"" to elevate U.S. support for the UAE's security, although not an official treaty or security guarantee. But after an increasing number of deadly Houthi attacks on Saudi and Emirati civilian infrastructure, the U.S. is now considering ""everything from sanctions to interdictions to other means of preventing [the Houthis] from being able to wage attacks against not just the Emiratis, but the Saudis, as well as within Yemen,"" they added. Houthi attacks have gotten increasingly sophisticated and deadly – killing civilians, striking airports and oil facilities, and using ballistic missiles and drones that are supplied by Iran. Many have come to view the militant group as a proxy force for Iran, which has taken advantage of the war to destabilize its chief rivals in the region, the Saudis and Emiratis. One form of pressure the Emiratis and Saudis are unlikely to get, however, is re-adding the Houthis to the State Department's foreign terrorist organization list, a designation that carries similar sanctions to those the Houthis are already under, but adds potential criminal prosecutions for anyone supporting them. Emirati officials in particular have been lobbying for a reversal, with Biden announcing in January that one is under consideration and the State Department consistently calling Houthi attacks ""terrorism."" But even as they review re-designating the Houthis, the senior State Department official said, the administration's argument for the last year against the designation remains – that it would restrict aid flowing into Yemen because of that threat of prosecutions. ""It's fair to say that they [the Emiratis] and others in the region see the FTO designation in one way, whereas we see it primarily through the impact on our ability to deliver and support humanitarian assistance,"" the senior State Department official told ABC News. Still, the talk of strong support for UAE, Saudi Arabia, and others is a far cry from where some members of Biden's own party are. ""Saudi Arabia's airstrikes and air-and-sea blockade have cost hundreds of thousands of lives and threatened millions more with famine, triggering the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. On this grim anniversary – spanning seven years and three presidential administrations – we are calling for an immediate end to American involvement in the Saudi-led coalition's brutal military campaign,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders and three progressive House members – Pramila Jayapal, Peter DeFazio, and Ro Khanna – adding they will use a War Powers resolution to force his hand. The U.S. military's involvement in the conflict has been limited since November 2018 when, under similar bipartisan pressure, the Trump administration halted midair refueling for Saudi-led coalition aircraft. That air force has been accused by the U.N. of potential war crimes – indiscriminate bombardments and targeting civilian infrastructure. The Houthis have also been accused of potential war crimes, including indiscriminate attacks and land mines, according to the same U.N. panel. Increasingly, they've also conducted complex, coordinated attacks on Saudi Arabia and UAE – including one last Friday that set two Saudi Aramco facilities ablaze and sent black smoke billowing into the air. While there were no casualties, Saudi officials said it would affect oil production amid the global energy crunch. Fighting in recent months has been worse than in years – with more January the deadliest month since 2018 – just three months after the UN Human Rights Council voted to disband that U.N. panel investigating war crimes. While the majority of civilians have been killed by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, the senior State Department official said the coalition ""has been saying they're prepared to engage"" in negotiations towards a cease-fire and ultimately a political resolution. The coalition on Wednesday launched a unilateral cease-fire. The U.N.'s new special envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, welcomed it as part of his call for a truce for Ramadan, Islam's holy month which starts this weekend. Grundberg has been conducting extensive consultations with not just the warring countries, but also political parties, civil society activists, and women's rights advocates. The Gulf Cooperation Council, a Riyadh-based bloc of regional countries, is also hosting a peace conference this week of Yemeni parties. The Houthis have rejected both the Saudi cease-fire and the GCC summit, but days earlier announced they would halt to cross-border attacks until Wednesday, refusing to extend it unless the coalition met certain demands. Those demands – ending restrictions on Yemeni ports and closure of Sanaa's airport – were not met, but it's unclear if the Houthis had resumed attacks. Still, Grundberg expressed some hope Wednesday that his team was ""making progress"" on reaching a truce – telling the GCC summit, ""Yemen needs a truce. I am engaging with the parties with a sense of urgency to reach this truce by the beginning of Ramadan."" In the meantime, it's the Yemeni people who suffer – a crisis now exacerbated by Russia's war against Ukraine. Yemen imports approximately one-fifth of its wheat from the two countries, and with energy prices also soaring, the already severely underfunded humanitarian response is left reeling. That's left children like ""Isaac"" with dimmer futures. In addition to widespread malnutrition, approximately 10,000 children have been killed by the war. Some two million children are out of school, with over 25,000 schools damaged or destroyed. Isaac, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, told the aid group Save the Children that his school ""is definitely not safe anymore."" The 14-year old boy was shot by a sniper in the leg. ""I assumed the sniper would spare me when he saw I was only picking up the ball. He doesn't usually shoot at us, he rarely does, but he did this time,"" he said, according to the group.",23
2022-03-31,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/parents-trevor-reed-marine-detained-russia-protest-white/story?id=83761758,Biden meets with Trevor Reed's parents after they protest outside White House,"The parents of Trevor Reed, a 30-year-old U.S. citizen and former Marine who has been imprisoned in Russia since 2019, met with President Joe Biden Wednesday after demonstrating outside the White House to urge Biden to do more to bring their son home amid Russia's violent invasion of Ukraine. ""During their meeting, the president reiterated his commitment to continue to work to secure the release of Trevor, Paul Whelan, and other Americans wrongfully held in Russia and elsewhere, and to provide all possible assistance until they and others are free and returned home to their families who are advocating so passionately for their release,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement; Whelan is another former Marine imprisoned in Russia. Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for the family, tweeted that the president had been ""incredibly gracious"" during a Wednesday evening White House meeting with Joey and Paula Reed. Franks shared photos of the Reeds standing outside the White House. Before the meeting, when asked by ABC News what they would say to Biden, Joey and Paula Reed said they wanted to remind him of their son's service to the county and to him personally, highlighting his experience as a presidential guard at Camp David. ""We want to tell him about our son -- a little bit that he hasn't gotten from a report from someone,"" Joey Reed said. ""Remind him that our son added time to his Marine Corps service so he could be a presidential guard."" Psaki said Biden's national security team ""will remain in regular contact with the Reeds, the Whelan family, and other families of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad."" ""We are grateful for their partnership and feedback,"" she said. ""We will continue to work to ensure we are communicating and sharing information in a way useful to these families."" The Reeds' pleas come as the State Department announced a new advisory Wednesday warning Americans not to travel to Russia or Ukraine and making it explicit that U.S. citizens in Russia could be singled out ""including for detention."" Trevor Reed has been imprisoned for 956 days and is on the third day of his second hunger strike in the last six months in a prison in Mordovia, Russia, his parents say. Reed suspects he has tuberculosis and a broken rib but has not received ""meaningful medical care,"" they said, so they staged a protest outside the White House to raise awareness about his case. They said he spends most of his days in solitary confinement, constantly getting punished for mundane things like not making his bed properly. ""During the day, because the room has no real heating and there's cracks in the windows, you see your breath all day long. He coils up on the floor next to a hot water pipe to stay warm and then he's given violations for laying on the floor during the daytime,"" his father told reporters. The Reeds repeatedly told reporters that they wanted a prisoner swap in exchange for their son. ""Our son was willing to give his life for President Biden and his family. And so it's not just that he served his country, he served this president in particular. And not that all of the Americans that are held around the world shouldn't get everything that our government can give -- if that means prisoner trades then so be it, let's get our Americans home,"" he said. Trevor Reed has been detained in Russia since the summer of 2019 and was sentenced in 2020 to nine years in a Russian prison colony, convicted on charges of violently assaulting two police officers in Moscow following a drunken party in Moscow where he was visiting his girlfriend. Reed's family and U.S. officials say those charges and ones brought for Whelan were fabricated in order to seize them as bargaining chips. When Biden was in Reed's home state of Texas earlier this month, his motorcade drove past Reed's parents as they demonstrated a speech he was giving in Fort Worth about helping veterans. Biden called an hour later to apologize for not stopping and promised to meet them in person, according to the White House. ""After his event in Fort Worth, the President called Joey and Paula Reed to reiterate his commitment to doing everything he can to bring their son home, to staying in close touch with them through his national security team, and to finding a time to meet in person,"" a White House official said on March 8. Before Wednesday, the Reed family said they had not received a follow-up from a White House official since the phone call. The White House had not responded to repeated questions from ABC News about why it hadn't yet reached out to Reed's parents until it provided a statement about an hour before the Reeds planned to speak with reporters outside the White House. ""The president cannot imagine the pain the Reed family is going through every day,"" a senior Biden administration official said in the statement. ""The president is committed to bringing Trevor and every American unjustly detained overseas home. It is the State Department's highest priority."" Asked after prepared COVID-related remarks on Wednesday afternoon whether he would see Reed's parents while they were in Washington, Biden said: ""I'm gonna see if I can get to see them. They're good people."" Pressed on whether that meant he would see them that day, Biden said, ""We're trying to work that out."" ""Each day, we worry that our son will become the next Otto Warmbier,"" the Reed parents said in a statement, referring to an American student who died after detainment in North Korea. ""We hope the President will be able to find the time to see us. We need his Administration to stop deliberating and start acting. We believe the President (whom we voted for) is the only person who can save our son's life."" The Reeds have also used the moment to raise awareness about other Americans detained in Russia, including WNBA star Brittney Griner and Whelan, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison in what the U.S. ambassador to Russia called a ""mockery of justice."" ""The time is now to bring home Trevor, Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. As we have said for more than a year, we continue to worry escalating tensions, or rhetoric, could lead to Russian authorities inventing additional false charges against Trevor,"" they said in the statement. Trevor's parents' said they had asked their son, in one of the few times they've been able to speak since his imprisonment, what he would tell the president -- but said he had nothing to say. ""I think that he's forgotten about me,"" Reed allegedly said. ABC News asked Joey Reed if he thought Biden's comment that seemed to imply he wanted a regime change in Russia hurt their chances of getting their son home. ""You'd have to ask Putin,"" he said. ""We believe that -- the comments about Putin -- we don't want to comment on them but obviously they're not helpful. But I guess they speak for themselves,"" he added. They said they planned to stay in Washington through Friday. ABC News' Patrick Reevell and Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.",2
2022-03-31,https://abcnews.go.com/International/reporters-notebook-traveling-ukraines-southern-border/story?id=83768453,Reporter's notebook: Traveling along Ukraine's southern border,"Our team spent five days tracing the southern border of Ukraine. We drove more than 650 long miles through the big open, empty lands and packed small towns of Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova, countries that have welcomed more than 1 million people fleeing the war. On the way, we found countless individual stories of horror, perseverance and kindness -- and a group of unique countries giving back any way they can, while living with their own fears that they could be next. Moldova in some ways felt the most like Ukraine. The only other non-NATO, non-EU country along the border, Moldova and Ukraine are also two of the poorest countries in Europe. Many families live across the border here, and both countries have lost territory to Russian aggression in the past. There’s a kinship you can feel between the countries, with so many people we meet here calling Ukrainians “their neighbors, their brothers.” Despite few resources and crushing numbers, Moldovans are doing whatever they can to help. Since the start of the war, more than 380,000 people have fled through the country, more than 15% of the country’s entire population and the most per capita of any other country. We discovered an old movie theater in the country’s capital of Chisinau that had been left standing empty for four years, now converted into a shelter for up to 200 people. The walls were crumbling, but the place had brand new mattresses on the floor. The makeshift home meant a place to stay for Irina and her four-year-old son, Arcadyi. Irina tells us she didn’t want to leave Odessa. Her other son turned 18 in October and since he is now old enough to fight, he isn’t allowed to leave Ukraine. But she says he told her she had to go, she had to save his little brother. She had to make sure at least one son survived this war. She chose to come here to Moldova, because it was the closest that she could stay to her other son. It’s something we hear from many refugees -- the desire to stay as close to home as they can. But Moldova is complicated. It's close to Ukraine, but also to Russia. There are pro-Russian parties in the government and in some groups in town. While we’re at the shelter, a tractor pulls up to drop off supplies. On it -- a large Z, a symbol that’s now become synonymous with Putin’s forces in Russia and is often seen on the tanks there. A tractor with support for Russia, dropping off items that locals have donated to help Ukrainians feeling the Russian attack? Nothing about the scene makes sense, but it’s perhaps the best explanation of life in Moldova. Close proximity to Russia means some people befriend the country, and many are worried that they could be invaded next. We found a similar fear in Romania. On my way out of the region, we flew out of a small airport close to the border. A security guard there asked us what it was like in Ukraine. I asked if he had family there. He said, “No, I’m just worried that Putin will come after us next.” Romania is also a NATO and European Union member. Attacking it would have worldwide implications. But even with these assurances, people here still live in fear. Romania has the largest border with Ukraine of any EU country. Driving along the winding road as it hugs the dividing line between the two countries, we see mostly vast, empty miles. It makes sense that it’s a well-known route for illegal crossings. That could mean men trying to flee Ukraine. We see at least one man sitting with police on the side of the road. But at official crossings, it is almost exclusively women and children. In Siret, Romania’s busiest border crossing, we meet Elenea and her young daughter Katya just moments after they cross. The mother tells us they’re from Kiev and lived right by the television tower that was bombed recently. They wanted to stay, but when one of Katya’s classmates died, Elenea knew she had to leave. We’re there as she FaceTimes her husband to let him know they made it across safely. He had to stay behind to fight. Working in this job, you’re used to being with people during the worst and often hardest moments of their lives. But witnessing this intimate moment broke me. A simple check in between husband and wife, now torn apart by war. Their daughter now asking when she would be able to see her dad again. A heartbreak so big, you could see it. Sadly, their story isn’t uncommon. We met so many families forced to separate, unsure when, or if, they will ever be together again. And as war rages on, the numbers of those fleeing only keep increasing. We hear rumblings from NGOs and volunteers, even other refugees, about hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Ukrainians waiting just on the other side of the border. People want to stay in Ukraine, but may have to flee as the fighting moves west. We ask for numbers of those at the border, but no one is able to tell us for certain. While everyone says they want to remain open to refugees, resources are already stretched thin. If one million people turns into 2 or 3 million, there are concerns about how these countries can keep up. For now, people are stepping up however they can. In Slovakia, we meet Father Pavel Novack who leads a congregation at a small church less than a mile from the border. He helped turn a school nearby into a shelter, one of 24 in this small region. Everything inside is donated from the community. He’s already helped more than 100 refugees, and on the day we visit there are 34 people living inside. Entire groups of families and friends share one room, but always with a roof, food and plenty of hope to go around. Father Pavel says refugees of all faiths are welcome. He shows us his church and tells us that in Orthodox Christianity the sermons are always sung, and as the sun sets outside he begins to pray. After a day of running around chasing stories and driving hundreds of miles, his song stopped our whole crew and forced us to stand still. His voice filled the tiny house of worship with a calmness we hadn’t felt in days. In that brief moment, the war, the heartache, the violence all felt far away. It’s these moments that will stick with me. Of people sacrificing everything to save their families. Of people giving everything of what little they have to help others. Of people trying to find joy even in the darkest moments of war. On our final day, we visited a small park in Moldova and stumbled into a group of older people dancing. As Moldovan music blasted on speakers and elderly couples held hands and shouted in delight, you could feel their joy from across the park. With war just a few dozen miles from where they stood, and with refugees fleeing unthinkable violence, this group remembered to dance. We watched this moment of joy, of life lived well, and were reminded what’s worth fighting for.",22
2022-03-31,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-putin-problems-linger-note/story?id=83768566,Republicans' Putin problems linger: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It's an awful war with an American ally asking for more than an increasingly unpopular Democratic president is willing to give -- and gas prices are showing voters the costs along the way. A range of ambitious Republicans see this as a moment for a new take on foreign policy that gets the party back to its traditional roots. But there's a contrarian voice that happens to be a loud one, and it isn't going away. Former President Donald Trump's latest call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to release what he knows about Hunter Biden -- ""I think he should release it,"" Trump said in an interview this week, referring to information on financial relationships involving Biden's son -- is particularly ill-timed for the GOP. It comes at a time where Putin is isolated and erratic and while the federal investigation centering on the president's son is intensifying, without any help from Putin. Trump's influence on the party on the Putin question is evident in comments such as those from Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., who earlier this month called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ""thug."" The House vote two weeks ago to strip Russia and Belarus of normal trade status was unanimous except for eight Republicans. Some of their names -- Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert -- are familiar figures in the MAGA orbit. From the White House perspective, the latest comments from Trump are an opportunity to turn questions about the president's son into answers. ""What kind of American, let alone an ex-president, thinks that this is the right time to enter into a scheme with Vladimir Putin and brag about his connections to Vladimir Putin?"" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield asked Tuesday. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, has signed legislation that will prohibit transgender students from participating in girls and women's sports. Stitt signed the bill, called the ""Save Women's Sports Act,"" into law Wednesday -- the eve of Transgender Day of Visibility. ""When it comes to sports and athletics, girls should compete against girls. Boys should compete against boys,"" Stitt, who is running for re-election, said. Oklahoma's controversial legislation is a part of a wave of similar legislation targeting transgender athletes pushed by GOP lawmakers in states across the country. Advocates widely consider this sort of legislation harmful to transgender youth. ""These bills are wrong,"" President Joe Biden said in a proclamation marking Transgender Day of Visibility 2022. ""Efforts to criminalize supportive medical care for transgender kids, to ban transgender children from playing sports and to outlaw discussing LGBTQI+ people in schools undermine their humanity and corrode our Nation's values."" Stitt's signage also came on the same day that a group of 21 House Republicans introduced a resolution that not only misgenders Lia Thomas, an NCAA swimming champion and transgender student athlete at the University of Pennsylvania, but also uses her birth name to claim that Thomas ""stole"" the championship trophy and declares another female swimmer the ""rightful winner."" The push led by Rep. Lauren Boebert is unlikely to gain traction, but it is noteworthy given that it has cosponsors who represent 15 states across the country. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The political implications of ending Title 42 are once again highlighting divisions over the nation's immigration policies both across the aisle and within parties. The Trump-era emergency order remains part of the U.S. public health code and allows for the expulsion of migrants without giving them a chance to apply for asylum within the United States. ""Title 42 is a public health directive. It is not an immigration or migration enforcement measure. So the decision on when to lift Title 42 we defer to the CDC,"" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield told reporters Wednesday. ""We are planning for multiple contingencies, and we have every expectation that when the CDC ultimately decides it's appropriate to lift Title 42, there will be an influx of people to the border, and so we are doing a lot of work to plan for that contingency,"" she added. Those comments come on the heels of the Department of Homeland Security saying the agency is ​​bracing for as many as 18,000 migrants per day at the southern border and also after the Biden administration announced it would welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, all while signaling a push for Americans to bounce back from pandemic times. The overlapping priorities present a complicated scenario for the administration to navigate, especially as several members of the president's own party -- some of whom are tied up in pivotal midterm races -- say they disagree with ending the policy at this time. Democrats representing border areas, including Arizona Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly as well as Texas Reps. Vicente Gonzalez and Henry Cuellar, have called on the White House to leave Title 42 in place. Sen. Joe Manchin was also among those asking for an extension of the policy. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 220-223. That's the number of red-leaning seats that will likely show up on the 2022 congressional map. While congressional redistricting is not quite finished, it's getting darn close. It looks like Republicans' historical advantage in the House will be smaller than it has been in decades -- mostly because Democrats have gained seats through gerrymandering. Based on the new House maps that have already passed and the range of possible outcomes in the remaining states, FiveThirtyEight estimates that the 2022 congressional map will end up with 220-223 districts with Republican-leaning partisan leans and 212-215 districts with Democratic-leaning partisan leans, making it a pretty even split.

2022-03-31,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pence-releases-policy-agenda-republican-party-paving-2024/story?id=83784446,"Pence releases policy agenda for Republican Party, paving way for 2024 candidacy","Former Vice President Mike Pence announced Thursday a multi-pronged policy agenda for the Republican Party, the latest in a series of indicators he's planning to mount a run for the presidency in 2024. Pence sees his ""Freedom Agenda"" as ""focused on the future"" and said it ""offers a clear and compelling choice to the American people,"" according to a statement on his political advocacy group's website. While he didn't say it outright, the timing suggests the choice he's referring to is between far-right conservative grievances over the 2020 election championed by former President Donald Trump and Pence's nod toward the future. In a speech earlier this year, Pence forcibly broke from Trump, saying it was ""wrong"" for the former president to have pushed him to reject Electoral College votes for President Joe Biden. The pair have publicly grown apart since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol at which Trump supporters called for Pence's head, forcing him to hide in a secure location. During a call with a handful of news outlets prior to the plan's release, Pence subtly highlighted the contrast with Trump. ""Elections are about the future, and frankly the opposition would love nothing more for conservatives to talk about the past or to talk of the mess they've made of the president,"" Pence told reporters, according to Politico. ""And I think by relentlessly focusing on the future we can stop the radical left, we can turn this country around, we can win the Congress and statehouses back in 2022, and we can win back America in 2024 and beyond."" Pence's plan is organized into three pillars -- American opportunity, American leadership and American culture -- that strike largely at conservative cultural issues that helped rising stars like Virginia's Glenn Youngkin flip blue states red. Some of those agenda items include promoting ""patriotic"" education, a clear reference to critical-race-theory rhetoric in the classroom, which many Republicans oppose; protecting individuals from being ""censored""; ""protecting female athletic competition"" by barring transgender women from playing in certain sporting events; honoring ""God-given worth"" by ending taxpayer funded abortion and abolishing Planned Parenthood. Pence's plan calls for a version of election reform but doesn't mention the fallacy pushed by Trump and his allies that the 2020 election was ""stolen."" Nevertheless, Pence's agenda pushes for a voting system in which identification is required, in-person voting is preferred and encouraged and mail-in voting is ""rare."" The Pence agenda also includes anti-Russian sentiments as the invasion of Ukraine barrels on, saying Putin ""undermines freedom and democracy at home and abroad"" while calling for the creation of private-sector led energy production centered around the export of American-produced natural gas that would cut Europe's dependency on Russian oil. According to Pence's political group's website, the former vice president collaborated with several dozen prominent conservatives to create his plan, including former administration officials Kellyanne Conway, Betsy DeVos, and David Bernhardt. One notable contributor is outgoing Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a frequent target of Trump's harsh criticism, who drew ire from the former president for distancing himself from the Arizona audit of the 2020 election -- another indicator of the daylight between Trump and Pence. Pence is now one of two high-profile Republicans who have released formalized policy proposals for the GOP as the party attempts to secure the advantage in the upcoming midterm elections. Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, announced his controversial 11-point plan in February. Other rumored GOP 2024 candidates, including Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ariz., have made public their priorities for the midterms and beyond. Pence's advocacy organization, Advancing American Freedom, rolled out his plan with a video narrated by Pence, which closely resembles a campaign tease, Thursday morning. ""Our best days are yet to come,"" said Pence, ""for renewing American culture, American opportunity, and American leadership, for a more perfect union for the people.""",14
2022-04-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/american-doctor-trained-hundreds-ukrainians-combat-medics/story?id=83786406,American doctor trains hundreds of Ukrainians to be combat medics,"This is a MedPage Today story. Tennessee physician Dr. Russ Frazier recently returned home from Ukraine, where he had been providing medical services and training as part of the nonprofit, Global Surgical and Medical Support Group. Frazier was part of a group of 10 that spent two weeks in the war-torn nation, providing combat casualty care training to civilians, members of the military and even other doctors. The experience was both harrowing and inspiring, Frazier told MedPage Today. And he's ready to answer the call again, if needed, he said. ""Typically, I've had a couple of months to prepare for trips,"" said Frazier, who is an anesthesiologist at Methodist Medical Center in Oak Ridge, chief of the Knox County Rescue and SWAT tactical physician for the Knox County Sheriff's Department. ""But, with the invasion of Ukraine, I got about 11 hours' notice."" When Frazier got the call, he ran it by his wife and two teenage sons, who immediately gave him the go-ahead. The next morning, Frazier was on a plane to Ukraine. His team included a surgeon and an operating room nurse, as well as a few retired members of the Special Forces, some of whom were actively studying for their MCAT exams by night. Basically, the group was a bunch of Type A personalities, Frazier said. The group had packed armor, warm clothes and all the medical equipment they could take. Initially, Frazier said he and his team didn't know if they would be performing surgeries, treating casualties or primarily providing medical training. Where they landed in Ukraine, the group was far enough west in Lviv that the area wasn't inundated with casualties at the time. So, training became the focus of their trip. ""Within two weeks, we had trained over 500 participants,"" Frazier noted, including 30 people who had been taught to become trainers themselves, as well as a number of physicians -- dermatologists, anesthesiologists, pediatricians and family doctors -- who required more advanced training. The training took place in an old gymnasium. The rear of the building had balance beams, uneven bars and a large foam pit, but the lobby of the building could fit dozens of people in a single class, Frazier recalled. The gym doubled as a public shelter, letting no one forget the intensity of the crisis at hand. The team taught two classes a day, one at 10 a.m. and one at 5 p.m. The very first class had more than 20 people, and by the afternoon class, there were nearly 90. ""The need was there, the drive was there,"" Frazier said. When air raid sirens went off, the team and their trainees moved to the basement of the building, joined by people who were out walking their dogs. Remarkably, the participants in the classes would carry the training equipment down to the basement during the raids to continue their learning. ""It was so inspirational ... the motivation from the citizens to learn everything they possibly could,"" he said. The tactical combat casualty course they used was developed by the U.S. military, Frazier explained. It focused on the five battlefield injuries that can most quickly kill a person, using the acronym MARCH: First, the trainees learned about using tourniquets to prevent massive hemorrhage, which is the only thing that should be done under fire, he noted. Knowing that everyone cannot purchase the recommended combat application tourniquet, the team focused on how to make improvised tourniquets, using bedsheets, sticks, shirt sleeves, or nylon straps. For evaluating airways, trainees were taught remedies that included head tilts and chin lifts to clear an obstructed airway, or turning a patient on their side to clear their airway of teeth, bone fragments or other objects, Frazier said. Some local physicians received advanced emergency airway training, he added, which included learning procedures such as cricothyrotomies. Many physicians like pediatricians or family doctors aren't typically exposed to these types of things, ""but obviously now in a war zone, they may be,"" Frazier said. ""It's surreal, but it's also inspiring,"" he said of the resolve of the Ukrainian people. ""They were very gracious and very appreciative. It was hugs and thank you's. I really felt out of place because of all the attention we got. They definitely showed their appreciation."" The day after the nearby women's and children's hospital was bombed, the chairman of obstetrics was in one of the team's training classes. ""The reality of what everyone needs to do has hit them, and they have willingly stepped forward,"" Frazier said. As for his team, they tried to keep as safe as possible, knowing nothing was without risk. They were able to book two rooms at a local hostel, with five team members in each room. The only downside was that there was no basement in the building, and the team was staying on the top floor, which had skylights in the ceiling. ""It was a little concerning,"" he noted. ""It definitely felt a lot safer in that old gym."" This past weekend, Frazier and some members of his team returned home after another team arrived to help continue the training. However, the situation is incredibly fluid, he noted. ""Everyone from the original team ... [is] very willing to return,"" he said.",22
2022-04-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/landscape-flux-ahead-primary-voting-note/story?id=83793555,Landscape in flux ahead of primary voting: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It's not just that politics is moving fast. It's that it's moving fast inside a voting structure that itself has not settled down. As April of the midterm election year begins, four states still haven't finished drawing congressional districts that will be filled in mere months. Two states have already had to push back their primaries because of redistricting battles. This week brought news that the Ohio Supreme Court won't review the state's new House map until after the May 3 primary there. On Thursday, a New York state judge threw out the new map there and gave lawmakers less than two weeks to draw a new one -- a rebuke to Democrats who carved up the state to their benefit. The process of redrawing House maps has already run counter to expected narratives. An exhaustive analysis by FiveThirtyEight found that, pending final resolutions in a few states, the new 2022 map will feature 11 more Democratic-leaning seats, six less GOP-heavy ones and the smallest number of competitive House districts in a quarter century. Plus, voting laws that were the center of so much controversy in 2021 could still change in significant ways. Lawmakers in Georgia just this week abandoned efforts to further tighten voting laws beyond last year's changes, and a federal judge in Florida on Thursday struck down key parts of the new voting law there. ""At some point, when the Florida Legislature passes law after law disproportionately burdening Black voters, this Court can no longer accept that the effect is incidental,"" District Court Judge Mark Walker wrote. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, promised an appeal and predicted that the original law would stand. Separately, DeSantis' veto of a redistricting plan his own party helped craft means the issue is headed to a special legislative session later this month. Big questions remain unanswered. One guaranteed result is confusion about the process of voting, in a year where the fundamentals of democracy are being tested. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Parents and advocates in Florida are waging the latest culture war battle in federal court, suing the state over legislation critics call the ""Don't Say Gay"" law. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of LGBTQ students, parents and several advocacy organizations who say the legislation, officially known as the Parental Rights in Education bill, is an ""unlawful attempt to stigmatize, silence and erase LGBTQ people in Florida's public schools."" ""I am frightened that this new law will prevent my daughter's teachers from protecting her from bullying at school,"" said Lindsay McClelland, the mother of a transgender fifth grader who is a plaintiff in the suit. ""All I want is for my daughter to be able to learn in a safe environment like any other student."" The bill prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and includes the caveat that any instruction on those topics cannot occur ""in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards."" Under the legislation, parents are allowed to sue if the topics are taught. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has pushed for a host of controversial legislation pertaining to ""parental rights,"" signed the legislation into law Monday. DeSantis is up for reelection this year and is widely considered a potential GOP presidential contender. ""This calculated, politically motivated, virtue-signaling lawsuit is meritless, and we will defend the legality of parents to protect their young children from sexual content in Florida public schools,"" DeSantis' office said in a statement sent to ABC News. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema North Carolina GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn is closing the week at odds with some members of his own party after claiming lawmakers invited him to orgies and used cocaine in front of him. Days later, those claims landed him in hot water with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. As reported by ABC News' Mariam Khan, McCarthy told the freshman lawmaker he had ""lost his trust"" and that Cawthorn needed to take steps to regain that trust and ""turn his life around"" or else there would be consequences, such as losing his committee assignments. Cawthorn told McCarthy that his allegations about the sex parties and cocaine use were exaggerated and untrue, a source familiar with the conversation told ABC News. In a new ad released following the meeting with McCarthy, Cawthorn said ""the entire left-wing establishment has targeted him"" and said in a tweet that he ""won't bow to the mob."" Meanwhile, Cawthorn's history of exaggerated claims and controversial statements in Washington are also affecting his positioning on the campaign trail. On Thursday, Sen. Thom Tillis, a fellow North Carolina Republican, endorsed Cawthorn's primary challenger, Chuck Edwards. The move signals eroding party support for the Trump-backed freshman -- initially painted as a rising Republican star -- as he faces his first re-election challenge. ""The 11th Congressional District deserves a congressman who is fully dedicated to serving their constituents. Unfortunately, Madison Cawthorn has fallen well short of the most basic standards Western North Carolina expects from their representatives, and voters now have several well-qualified candidates to choose from who would be a significant improvement,"" Tillis said in a statement. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 60. That’s the percentage of self-identified baseball fans who told a SurveyMonkey/Los Angeles Times poll that a contentious labor dispute between MLB players and team owners that lasted much of the winter had caused them to lose interest in the 2022 baseball season. Yesterday was supposed to be Opening Day, but it was delayed a week (to next Thursday, April 7) by the two sides’ failure to reach agreement. So will some fans tune out? We’ll have to wait until the end of the season to know for sure, but the smart bet is probably that the lockout won’t significantly harm MLB’s bottom line.

2022-04-02,https://abcnews.go.com/International/photographer-toys-stories-children-living-war-zones/story?id=83812906,Photographer uses toys to tell stories of children living in war zones,"Processing Russia's war on Ukraine has been a challenge for all children, especially those who were forced to flee their homes, say goodbye to family members and watch their entire lives change overnight. To help these children traumatized by living in war zones and bring attention to their plight, artist Brian McCarty is capturing war through their eyes. His project, War Toys, asks children living within violence to draw the destruction they've witnessed. ""We want to do everything we can while the fighting is going on, recognizing it's not until the fighting stops that real recovery happens,"" McCarty said in an interview with ABC News Live Friday. ""So, for now we're just getting in any way we can, giving support any way we can."" McCarty partners with organizations working in the war zone to recreate the children's drawings in real life, using toys found in the local area, and staging them to represent the artwork drawn by young people. ""It's the idea to find the local toys that are available to them as a layer of cultural commentary and artifact, and really unify the types of toys you can find anywhere and connect children and adults the same,"" said McCarty. To start these efforts in Ukraine, McCarty partnered with First Aid of the Soul, a newly formed, grassroots effort being built by Ukrainian art therapist Nathalie Robelot. Once it's safe, the therapists will gather stories from affected children. War Toys also works with U.N. agencies to amplify the voices of the children under their care, and produce artwork in hopes to inspire change through campaigns and presentations. Founded in 2019, it's helped provide art therapy and services to children living in the Middle East. Rubber ducks, dolls and other kids toys have helped bring drawings from Syria and Iraq come to life. McCarty said it's meaningful for children to see this pain from another point of view, and that the toys help make them feel safe. The photographs of toys in war zones are also helping children from afar. In the United States, children have come across graphic images and videos of the war in Ukraine, forcing parents and teachers to find ways to address the crisis in an age-appropriate way. At Holy Innocents Episcopal School in Atlanta, McCarty has displayed the photographs of war toys, giving American children a way to also find comfort in the chaos that's happening overseas. ""It just worked perfectly to bring him in, to help us really try to teach our children about the difficulties of war,"" said the Rev. Bill Murray, the eighth rector of Holy Innocents' Episcopal Church. ""But especially that it is not just the soldiers that are on the field, that there are families that are hurting, that there are so many that are lost and need help."" The reverend said the artwork has helped better explain the war to his students, making them feel more connected to what people their age are going through in Ukraine. ""Taking these pictures and showing the world these photos brings that into the realness, encouraging others to want to help these kids who are in these countries and suffering so much with all that they have seen and all that they have gone through,"" Gracie Cavallo, a ninth grader at Holy Innocents Episcopal School, told ABC News Live. ""It helps bring us together as a community and a world.""",22
2022-04-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/roy-blunt-ketanji-brown-jackson-confirmed-support/story?id=83831571,"Sen. Roy Blunt says Ketanji Brown Jackson will be confirmed, but he won't support her","Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of Republican leadership, said he will not vote to support President Joe Biden's Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, for her historic confirmation to the nation's highest court, citing disagreements with her judicial philosophy. ""Initially, my sense is that the president certainly had every good intention and every right in the campaign to talk about putting the first Black woman on the court,"" Blunt told ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos exclusively on Sunday. ""I think it's time for that to happen. I was hoping that I could be part of that."" The retiring senator continued, ""I think she's certainly going to be confirmed. I think it'll be a high point for the country to see her go on the court. But I don't think she's the kind of judge that will really do the kind of work that I think needs to be done by the court. And I won't be supporting her, but I'll be joining others and understanding the importance of this moment."" Blunt was considered one of the few Republicans who may cross the aisle to support Jackson's nomination. While only three GOP senators supported Jackson's nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year, Blunt was absent for that vote, and said he had a ""good discussion"" with Jackson when they met on March 16. The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on Jackson's nomination Monday, but the full Senate has yet to schedule the final vote. She is expected to be confirmed with at least one Republican vote, as Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, announced Wednesday that she would vote to confirm Jackson. Stephanopoulos pressed Blunt on his decision to vote against her nomination, asking, ""If it's a high point for the country, why not support her?"" ""Well, I think the lifetime appointments have different criteria than other appointments,"" Blunt responded, later adding that ""she just doesn't meet the criteria"" to secure his vote. Stephanopoulos then turned to another issue facing the Supreme Court -- the controversy currently surrounding Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife's reported involvement in urging former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to attempt to overthrow the 2020 election results. ""How about these calls for Justice Thomas to recuse himself from the Jan. 6 investigation cases given the active involvement of his wife Ginni Thomas and the push for an ethics code for Supreme Court justices?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""The idea that you can't disagree with your wife on a public issue and still be able to function as a judge or as a government figure of any kind, I think is an idea that's long outlived any idea that it might be reasonable,"" Blunt answered. ""You know that he disagrees with her?"" Stephanopoulos pressed. ""Judge Thomas has to decide that,"" Blunt said. ""He's going to look at the law. He's going to look at what the law says and what the Constitution says and rule in that regard."" He added that he is ""totally supportive"" of the Justice Department's investigation and prosecution of participants in ""any illegal activity"" during the Jan. 6 insurrection. Lawmakers on the House Jan. 6 Select Committee are pushing Attorney General Merrick Garland to ramp up the Department of Justice's investigation of the insurrection. The pressure on the DOJ follows debate over whether former President Donald Trump could face criminal charges after a ruling from a federal judge in California last week who said it was ""more likely than not"" that Trump committed several federal crimes in an effort to overturn the 2020 election. When asked whether Trump should be subject to any federal prosecution, Blunt reiterated his support for the department's investigation, saying, ""I think the Justice Department has a job to do. They should do it. And people who were involved in planning or execution of illegal activities on Jan. 6 should be prosecuted."" Earlier on ""This Week,"" Stephanopoulos interviewed White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, who defended the Biden administration's record as inflation and gas prices soar across the country. But, Blunt said, ""the biggest political issue in the country today is clearly inflation."" ""All you have to do is go to the gas station or the grocery store or pay your winter heating bill to know that something unacceptable has happened,"" he added. While Biden has taken steps in an effort to bring down high gas prices, such as ordering the release of 1 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve per day over the next six months, the Missouri Republican argued that oil prices were already at ""unacceptable levels long before [Vladimir] Putin did anything regarding Ukraine."" As Russian forces pull out of the capital city of Kyiv, Stephanopoulos asked Blunt what more the United States can do to support Ukraine. ""Well, I think we should be doing everything we can. We should give them what they need as quickly as they needed,"" Blunt said, adding, ""What the president has done has generally been the right thing, but about two or three weeks slower than it should have been."" As a member who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Blunt emphasized the role of U.S. intelligence in assessing Russian military operations and debunking a possible false flag operation, which he called ""incredibly helpful."" He also echoed the widespread praise for the leadership of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, adding, ""I hope he continues to be safe and brave and his country is rallying behind that willingness to be there and be in the fight.""",7
2022-04-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-invasion-ukraine-white-house-chief-staff/story?id=83831517,"Russian invasion of Ukraine 'far from over,' White House chief of staff says","White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain is warning that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is ""far from over,"" despite the claim by Moscow that they are retreating from Kyiv and surrounding areas. ""I think there's a lot of evidence that Putin is simply taking his troops out of the northern part of the country to redeploy them to the eastern part of the country to relaunch a battle there,"" Klain said during an exclusive interview with ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. Klain said it’s ""for Ukraine to decide"" what a post-war country looks like when asked about the possibility that Russia overtakes eastern regions of Ukraine, while Ukraine maintains control of the rest. ""I will tell you, as President Zelenskyy has said, that's not acceptable to him, and we are going to support him with military aid, with economic aid, with humanitarian aid,"" Klain said. ""The political future of Ukraine is up for Ukraine to decide."" ""Is Russia losing this war?"" Stephanopoulos asked Klain. ""The Ukrainians are winning the war around Kyiv and in the northern part of the country. And that's tremendous credit to the fighting they've done and to the support that the United States that our NATO allies have provided them. We send weapons into Ukraine almost every single day,"" Klain responded, dodging the question. ""And the Ukrainian military, the Ukrainian volunteers that are fighting this war have shown their bravery, their tenacity, again, backed up by the generosity of the U.S. and our allies."" While the administration is focused on the crisis overseas, Klain also discussed domestic issues that were at the forefront this week, including inflation, combating rising gas prices and the CDC decision to lift the Title 42 policy at the southern border. President Joe Biden has blamed Russia for the rise in gas prices at the pump, labeling it the ""Putin price hike,"" though gas prices were skyrocketing before the holidays last year. However, it’s not just gas prices on the rise; food prices are also up because of inflation, and it’s reflected in Biden’s poll numbers. ""Gas prices are a problem, absolutely, George,"" Klain acknowledged. ""That's why the president took the actions he took this week to release a million barrels a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to tell the oil companies they either need to pump oil on the 9,000 permits they have or give them back for others to do that, to increase production here. Those things we think are going to bring down the price of gasoline, relieve some of the pain at the pump. And we also have an agenda to cut taxes for people to bring down the cost of everyday things."" A new Quinnipiac University poll shows that just 36% approve of the president overall, and only one in three Americans approve of how he’s handling the economy. Republicans are criticizing his economic policies with the midterm election just months away and are poised to exploit it as November gets closer. Stephanopoulos pressed Klain on how Democrats should respond. ""The Republicans have an agenda too. Sen. [Rick] Scott says their agenda is to raise taxes on millions of Americans, to get rid of social security and to do other things that are going to devastate middle class people,"" Klain said. ""So I think when people compare our agenda to the Republican agenda, that's gonna be a clear choice for folks."" When Stephanopoulos inquired about how anxious Klain is about the elections this fall, Klain said the administration has done ""a great job,"" but there is ""work to do."" ""We have done a lot of work to bring the economy back from dead in the water when we got here. Virtually no jobs being created, businesses closed, schools closed,"" Klain said, adding that there's been a ""tremendous amount of progress on getting the economy going again in 14 months but a lot of work left to be done."" The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday that 431,000 jobs were added to the economy in March, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%. Austan Goolsbee, Klain’s former colleague in the Obama administration, said the country may be moving toward the idea that the COVID-19 era of the U.S. economy is over with -- a sentiment Klain said he “cautiously” agrees with. ""Right now, as we stand here today, our schools are open, our businesses are open, people are coming back to work, people are coming back into the labor force, we had a big jump in labor force participation in March,"" he said. ""So there’s a lot of encouraging signs, in terms of this economy, coming back to being a robust jobs and business creating economy."" Immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border is also looming as a big issue for the midterms, and on Friday, the CDC announced it will end the controversial Title 42 policy, which allowed the government to expel migrants at the border during the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision is receiving a lot of pushback from Democrats and Republicans. Sen. Joe Manchin called it ""frightening,"" Sen. Kyrsten Sinema said it poses a threat to Arizona, and Sen. Mitt Romney said it's going to elect Republicans in November. ""How worried are you about a possible surge at the border?"" Stephanopoulos asked Klain. ""Is there anything the president can do about it?"" ""Title 42 isn’t an immigration law, it's a public health law,"" Klain said. ""It says you could exclude people who pose a public health risk. The Centers for Disease Control decide how to apply that, and they've decided that sometime in late May, the pandemic will be a place where we can no longer exclude people on a public health rationale."" This week, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that up to 18,000 migrants could be apprehended at the border each day if Title 42 were to be lifted, though the administration will keep the Trump-era Migrant Protection Protocols, colloquially known as the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, which bars asylum seekers from entering the U.S. while immigration courts review their claims. ""Look, we need to do more work at the border. The president sent an immigration plan to Congress on his first day in office. We've asked consistently for more resources. We put in place a new rule that will take effect next month to enable us to process asylum claims more clearly,"" Klain said. ""We also have to be honest about what's happening at the border. We have people showing up with asylum claims from places like Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Brazil, people fleeing regimes where they are feeling persecution."" Biden has also repeatedly been attacked by GOP lawmakers for being ""soft on crime."" After at least six people were killed in a mass shooting in Sacramento, California, overnight, Stephanopoulos pressed Klain on how Democrats got ""on the wrong side of the crime issue."" Klain responded that he didn't think Democrats are ""on the wrong side."" ""The president has sent to Congress plans for robust funding of police. Congress passed one of them just last week -- two weeks ago, in the omnibus bill and raised our funding for police. We want to make sure we have strong law enforcement to respond to crime,"" he said. ""We also want to make sure we have in place police reform and community violence intervention that help reduce crime. ... We're working very hard to be at the forefront of efforts to both control crime and have balanced and sensible policing. We think we can do both."" The New York Times reported that as recently as late last year, Biden ""confided to his inner circle that he believed former President Donald J. Trump was a threat to democracy and should be prosecuted,"" citing two people familiar with the president’s comments. The Times reported that ""while the president has never communicated his frustrations directly to Mr. Garland, he has said privately that he wanted Mr. Garland to act less like a ponderous judge and more like a prosecutor who is willing to take decisive action over the events of Jan. 6."" But Klain told Stephanolopous, ""I've never heard the president say that we advocate the prosecution of any person,"" and he reiterated Biden’s pledge to let the Department of Justice be independent and free of political influence. ""One reason why Joe Biden got elected was he promised that we take the decision over who got prosecuted and what away from the White House and put in the Justice Department,"" he said. ""Only Richard Nixon and Donald Trump in the modern era believe that prosecution decisions should be made in the Oval Office, not at the Justice Department."" A federal investigation into Biden's son, Hunter Biden, over payments he received while serving on the board of directors of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, and other questions over how Hunter Biden paid off tax obligations in recent years has intensified, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News last week. Klain said ""neither the president or any of us at the White House"" have been in contact with the DOJ regarding its investigation and told Stephanopoulos, ""Of course the president is confident his son didn’t break the law."" ""That's a matter that's going to be decided by the Justice Department, by the legal process,"" he said. ""It's something that no one at the White House has involvement in."" The Washington Post also reported this week on deals that Hunter Biden had with a Chinese energy company, which paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunter Biden and the president's brother. ""Is the president confident his family didn't cross any ethical lines?"" Stephanopoulos asked Klain. ""The president is confident that his family did the right thing. But again, I want to just be really clear. These are actions by Hunter and his brother. They're private matters. They don't involve the president, and they certainly are something that no one at the White House is involved in."" In the wake of text messages that revealed Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, asked former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to try and overturn the presidential election results, Democrats are now calling for an ethics code for Supreme Court justices. Klain would not say if Biden would sign such a bill into law if it reached his desk and refrained from weighing in on whether Justice Thomas should recuse himself from 2020 election-related cases. ""I don't think that's for me to say, but, but I know a lot of people have said that. Again, I don't think this is a place for us in the White House to be involved with the rulings at the Supreme Court. I think that's for others to decide."" The Senate is expected to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court this week. Missouri GOP Sen. Roy Blunt announced this morning on ""This Week"" that he would vote against her nomination, leaving Maine Sen. Susan Collins as the only Republican so far to voice her support for Judge Jackson. Klain said she ""deserves more Republican votes."" ""What I know is she will get enough votes to get confirmed. In the end I suppose that's the only thing that matters, but I wish more Republicans would look at the case here, look at the record, and vote to confirm Judge Jackson.""",7

Countries are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the conservative figure established by the Paris Agreement, according to the latest report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that was released Monday. Global emissions will need to peak by 2025 at the latest, and then steeply reduce thereafter, to prevent worsening impacts, according to the report. The report warns that ""considerable fossil fuel infrastructure"" will need to be abandoned to sufficiently reduce emissions, including coal assets by 2030 and oil and gas by around 2050. Countries with plans to invest in new fossil fuel infrastructure are engaging in ""moral and economic madness,"" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. ""Such investments will soon be stranded assets – a blot on the landscape and a blight on investment portfolios,"" Guterres in a press conference Monday. ""But it doesn’t have to be this way. Today’s report is focused on mitigation – cutting emissions. It sets out viable, financially sound options in every sector that can keep the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees alive."" The new report laid out a road map for a wide range of solutions that could reduce global emissions, including a ""substantial reduction"" in fossil fuel use; deploying renewable energy on a much larger scale; electrifying as many systems as possible, including transportation; improving energy efficiency; transitioning to alternative fuels, such as hydrogen; and reducing methane emissions. If the global community does not limit average warming to 1.5 Celsius, the world will see extreme heat, a rise in sea levels, extreme weather and threats to food and water supplies, the scientific community has warned. It is likely the world will exceed that target in the 21st century, even if all countries meet their Paris Agreement pledges, but it is still scientifically possible to prevent the worst-case scenarios, according to the report. ""Reducing GHG emissions across the full energy sector requires major transitions, including a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, the deployment of low-emission energy sources, switching to alternative energy carriers, and energy efficiency and conservation,"" the report states. ""The continued installation of unabated fossil fuel infrastructure will 'lock in' GHG emissions."" Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry described the report as ""a defining moment for our planet."" ""We are currently falling short in our battle to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis and mobilize the urgent global action needed. But importantly, the report also tells us we have the tools we need to reach our goals, cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, reach net-zero by 2050, and secure a healthier, cleaner planet,"" Kerry said in a statement Monday. IPCC reports are approved by all 195 countries that signed the Paris Agreement. The latest report was compiled by 278 authors from 65 countries. The report ""puts policymakers on notice, yet again, that the current global trajectory of heat-trapping emissions is alarmingly off-track,"" Dr. Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists and an official civil society observer to the IPCC Working Group III process, said in a statement. ""Their continued inaction is directly responsible for the climate crisis already here, and it has also placed the goals of the Paris Agreement at grave risk,"" Cleetus said. ""The solutions are obvious and have been for a long time—the world needs to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and accelerate the shift to clean energy. Richer nations, including the United States, bear significant responsibility for action because of their outsize contribution to global warming emissions.""

2022-04-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-challenges-punish-russia-simply-close-doors-analysis/story?id=83884670,Zelenskyy challenges UN to punish Russia or 'simply close' its doors: ANALYSIS,"In an impassioned address to the United Nations Security Council Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy laid down the gauntlet -- urging the U.N.'s most powerful body to either act or ""dissolve yourself altogether."" It was a challenge to the world's diplomats sitting in the historic chamber in New York, where any action to even condemn Russia's invasion has been blocked by Russia's veto power as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. But it was also a searing indictment of the U.N. system itself, created in the ashes of World War II to ensure international peace and security. U.N. aid agencies are on the ground providing assistance, its human rights chief is monitoring reported war crimes, including new, shocking images of murdered civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, and nearly three-fourths of its members have joined to condemn Russia's invasion. But none of that has stopped Russian leader Vladimir Putin's brutal campaign to topple the Ukrainian government and subjugate the country, ""Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?"" Zelenskyy asked. ""It is obvious the key institution of the world ... simply cannot work effectively."" Top U.N. officials attended the session Tuesday, including Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who lamented how the war was now fueling food and fuel crises and threatening to throw more people around the world into hunger. ""For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns. ... The war in Ukraine must stop -- now,"" he told the chamber. But weeks of condemnation by Guterres and other U.N. diplomats have fallen on deaf ears in Moscow, which continues to use its prominent perch on the Security Council to spread disinformation about the war and accuse Ukraine of provocations, lies, and fakes. On Tuesday, its envoy Vasily Nebenzya again spoke repeatedly to say the atrocities reported by eyewitnesses and journalists in Bucha were ""staged."" The failure to reproach Nebenzya for his near daily false claims is yet another way the U.N.'s credibility has taken a hit during the crisis, according to some critics. In his remarks, Zelenskyy himself said the U.N. could be ""simply closed"" if it doesn't act to punish Russia for its invasion of his country -- ""if there is nothing that you can do besides conversation."" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield pushed back on that gently in an interview after the session, telling the BBC Zelensky ""is not exactly right."" ""No one can question his frustration with the council and how the council operates. The Russians do have veto power. But I have said over and over again -- they cannot veto our voices, they can't veto his voice,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. But Zelenskyy made clear that for Ukraine, that is not enough. He demanded that ""the Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately"" -- urging for ""complete truth and full accountability."" As he detailed horrific atrocities in Bucha and elsewhere - he said worse is yet to be discovered in the cities still held by Russian forces. But he also called for wholesale reform of the U.N. system -- saying that the international body has not lived up to the goals set out at its founding in San Francisco after World War II, and that those goals cannot be reached without reforms. He called for Russia to be expelled from the Security Council or for it to be reformed at a global conference, including ending the veto power. ""The veto is not the right to die,"" he added. ""No more exceptions or privileges."" There is no effort underway to expel Russia from the Security Council or the General Assembly, the U.N.'s main chamber -- where all 193 countries have a vote, but whose resolutions are non-binding. An expulsion from the U.N. requires a recommendation from the Security Council itself -- where Russia wields that veto power -- and then a vote by the General Assembly. That veto power -- shared with the four other permanent members China, the U.S., the United Kingdom, and France -- has rendered the Security Council powerless to even pass a resolution condemning the Kremlin's invasion. Either way, Putin seems to care little for paper condemnations like U.N. resolutions. The night he launched his war and the bombs started to fall across Ukraine, U.N. diplomats were meeting at the same time in New York late at night to discuss the threat of war, their words ringing even more hollow. Instead of fully expelling Russia, the U.S. is pushing with its allies and partners, including Ukraine, to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council. The body's 47 members are elected among U.N. member states for three-year terms, but a country can be suspended with a two-thirds majority vote in the U.N. General Assembly. ""Our votes can make a real difference. Russia's participation in the U.N. Human Rights Council hurts the council's credibility, it undermines the entire U.N., and it is just plain wrong. Let us come together to do what is right and do right by the Ukrainian people,"" Thomas-Greenfield told her fellow diplomats in the chamber. U.S. officials have said they believe they have the votes necessary -- pointing to two previous resolutions passed by the General Assembly to condemn Russia's invasion with 141 and 140 votes, respectively. A vote could be held as soon as Thursday, Thomas-Greenfield said. While only one other country has faced that kind of censure -- Libya in 2011 after Muammar Gaddafi's forces opened fire on protesters -- Russia has already dismissed the efforts, with Nebenzya vowing nothing will stop the Kremlin's campaign. ""We need to cut out the malignant Nazi tumor that is consuming Ukraine and would in time begin to consume Russia, and we will achieve that goal, I hope sooner rather than later, because there is no other outcome,"" he said.",6
2022-04-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/lgbtq-refugees-fleeing-ukraine-fear-persecution-death/story?id=83784527,"LGBTQ refugees fleeing Ukraine fear persecution, death","The flashlights of the Ukrainian army followed Zi Faámelu, a transgender woman from Ukraine, as she walked through a swamp and hid from the military while crossing the Romanian border. Tall, sharp bushes scratched the singer's face, and the rough waters from the river pulled her body in the opposite direction. She knew it was the only chance she had to escape. She was carrying only her passport, wrapped in a trash bag to protect it from the water. Her passport identified her as male, making it illegal for her to flee Ukraine after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered all men to join the army. Once she made it to the other side, Faámelu could only think of the fact she made it alive. “I knew this was my last chance of survival and I had to do something like this real quick,” she told ABC News. “I was almost drowning and I drank so much water. And I was very exhausted and I swam. I thought I [wouldn’t] make it. But somehow I reached the other side.” At the first checkpoint, Faámelu said the guards took a photo of her passport and sent it across the border to prevent her from leaving the country. The treatment she received at the border, she said, was similar to the reality she faced for being a trans woman in Ukraine. “My story is not like popular opinion right now because I know the inside of it all. And it's not pretty,” she said. “It's ugly. So I know the world stands with Ukraine, but they don't know what's going on inside the country.” Throughout her life, Faámelu said she faced discrimination and transphobia. The invasion made things worse, she said, and she found herself stuck inside her apartment due to fear of persecution. “At first, I wanted to leave Kyiv because there were bombings, but there was a group of dangerous people moving around this city. Homophobic, transphobic people that were preying on LGBTQ folks,” she said. Faámelu is not the only one who says she fears for her safety. Olha Raiter traveled with her ex-partner, Uliana, and their 7-month-old son to Berlin from Ukraine by car. The trip took about 68 hours, and their car became a temporary home as they saw their country being shelled. “I tried to stay positive because you could just die in one second if you just imagine what's going on,” Raiter said. “We have to be positive. We have to believe,"" she added. Raiter always wanted to have kids, but she said it was difficult to make it a reality because of how it would be viewed by society. “I couldn't get married,” she said. “We are all discriminated against in Ukraine because we cannot get the same rights. We have Damien together, but officially, she's nobody to him, even if she's a mother the same as me … and she was there from the very beginning and she was there when I was delivering him. But she still, according to Ukrainian law, … she's nobody.” Raiter says, ""We were moving in the right direction. We put pressure on our government, and it changes. I didn't have a feeling that this was a country that didn't want me."" Despite the hardships and the rough reality members of the LGBTQ community say they face in Ukraine, Raiter did not leave the country because she felt unwanted, but feared raising a child among war. She hopes to return to her home country one day to raise Damien. “I want [Damien] to … grow up in Ukraine, and I think it's important because it's important for me. I know it's possible,” Raiter said. Svetlana Shaytanova works for Quarteera, a nonprofit organization creating a safe space for members of the Russian-speaking LGBTQ community in Germany. She focuses her work on spreading awareness and sharing the harsh realities faced by queer people, like Faámelu. The reality for trans people in Ukraine and across Europe, Shaytanova said, is that it’s harder than it might appear. “They don't want us to exist,” Shaytanova said. “It’s not the government that persecutes people; they put laws in place that allow the general population to be openly aggressive against queer people.” Faámelu is currently staying with a German family – and she says she feels lucky. “It's a perfect place for me right now. It's just luck, … because I could’ve died [at the border],” she said. When Faámelu crossed the border, she left everything behind – her clothes, belongings and even her art pieces. In the midst of the chaos, she still hopes to keep making music and continue her activism within the trans community. “[My voice] is the only thing I have now … because I have nothing. They took everything away from me,” she said. Faámelu says change must be made so others don’t have to be discriminated against and fight for their lives as she did at the border. The issue, she said, is beyond the Russian invasion. “We're fighting for our lives as trans people,” Faámelu said. “It's a war for recognition, for getting noticed, for getting hurt. But we are humans. We deserve our rights. “This is a war within a war.”",7
2022-04-05,https://abcnews.go.com/US/russian-oligarchs-yacht-seized-dojs-kleptocapture-task-force/story?id=83868205,Russian oligarch's yacht seized by DOJ's 'KleptoCapture' task force,"A yacht that belongs to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg has been seized in Marina Real in the Spanish port of Palma de Mallorca, according to court documents unsealed Monday. The yacht was seized on Monday by Spanish authorities and KleptoCapture, the Justice Department task force charged with finding the assets of oligarchs trying to evade sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""We will now seek to have the vessel forfeited as the proceeds of a crime,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a video message released Monday by the Justice Department. A spokesperson for Vekselberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News. Vekselberg was designated an oligarch by U.S. authorities in 2018, when he was sanctioned by the United Sates following Russia's invasion of Crimea. Court documents say Vekselberg was subject to more sanctions once Russia invaded Ukraine. In addition to the seizure of Vekselberg's yacht, U.S. authorities also obtained seizure warrants unsealed in Washington, D.C., Monday that target roughly $625,000 associated with sanctioned parties that's being held at nine U.S. financial institutions, the Justice Department said. The KleptoCapture task force is trying to find yachts, airplanes and other moveable property before it can be moved into jurisdictions where it might be more difficult for U.S. authorities to investigate. ""The point of going after Putin's cronies and Russian oligarchs who seek to violate our laws and shield their assets is to say that nobody is beyond the reach of our system of justice, beyond the reach of our work and cooperation with our allies,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told ABC News' Byron Pitts last month. ""And that these cronies and oligarchs who seek to support and bolster the Russian regime shouldn't be able to get away with that while people are dying,""",0
2022-04-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-return-white-house-health-care-event-lunch/story?id=83866893,Obama returns to White House to help Biden push Affordable Care Act,"For the first time since leaving office, former President Barack Obama returned to the White House on Tuesday to join his former vice president -- Joe Biden -- in promoting the Affordable Health Care Act he signed into law 12 years ago. Obama joined Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to deliver remarks on the Affordable Care Act, with Harris speaking first to applaud the anniversary and introduce the former president. Obama received a standing ovation and told a packed East Room, ""It's good to be back at the White House."" Before addressing the landmark legislation of his presidency, Obama cracked a few jokes, as he often did as president, opening his remarks by thanking ""Vice President Biden."" ""That was a joke. That was all set-up,"" Obama said to laughter, walking back to give Biden a hug. ""I confess, I heard some changes have been made by the current president since I was last here,"" Obama continued. ""Apparently, Secret Service agents have to wear Aviator glasses now. The Navy mess has been replaced by a Baskin-Robbins. And there's a cat running around, which I guarantee Beau and Sunny would have been very unhappy about,"" he said to laughter, referring to the Obamas' dogs. The former president then pivoted to the purpose of his visit: to celebrate 12 years of the Affordable Care Act, saying it's ""an example of why you run for office in the first place."" ""We're not supposed to do this just to occupy a seat or to hang on to power. We're supposed to do this because it's making a difference in the lives of the people who sent us here,"" Obama said, before introducing Biden. ""My name is Joe Biden, and I'm Barack Obama's vice president,"" Biden said, prompting more laughter in the room. ""It feels like the good old days -- being here with you brings back so many good memories."" ""Let's be honest, the Affordable Care Act has been called a lot of things, but Obamacare is the most fitting,"" Biden added with apparent pride, ""Obamacare."" He went on to announce new steps the Biden administration is taking to build on the Affordable Care Act, including a new executive order directing federal agencies ""to do everything in their power"" to expand coverage and make it easier to enroll, which he signed after his remarks, as well as a proposed rule from the Treasury Department to fix the ACA's so-called ""family glitch."" ""Once today's proposed rule is finalized, starting next year, working families in America will get the help they need to afford full family coverage,"" Biden said. ""With this change, it's estimated that 200,000 presently uninsured Americans are going to gain coverage. Nearly one million Americans will see their coverage become more affordable."" Biden also urged Congress to take action to keep the expansions his administration has put in place under the American Rescue Plan intact and pitched to Americans to keep up the fight to prevent Republicans from trying, again, to repeal the ACA. ""If Republicans have their way, it means 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can once again be denied health care coverage by their insurance companies. That's what the law was before Obamacare. In addition, tens of millions of Americans could lose their coverage, including young people who will no longer be able to stay on their parent's insurance policy until age 26,"" Biden said. ""We need to keep up the fight,"" he added, calling out the GOP for its ""unrelenting"" campaign against the ACA. Biden went back to poking fun at himself before signing the executive order, recalling back to when he was caught on hot mic back in 2010 telling Obama the ACA was ""a big f****** deal."" ""And Barack, let me remind you -- it's a hot mic,” Biden said to laughter. Previewing Tuesday's remarks, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that Obama and Biden would also have lunch at the White House Tuesday -- ""as they used to do on a weekly basis"" -- and added, ""They continue to talk regularly."" ""They are real friends, not just Washington friends, and so I'm sure they will talk about events in the world as well as their families and personal lives,"" Psaki said. The visit from the popular former president comes as Biden struggles in the polls over his handling of 40-year-high inflation and soaring gas prices he's pinned to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Psaki said it's ""exactly the right time to have the former president come here -- given this is one of the proudest accomplishments that they worked on together, they shared together."" ""And it is emblematic of their shared view and belief that government can work for people and it can work for the American people. And this is an example of building on a success from more than 10 years ago and making it better over time,"" she added. Psaki also said to expect Obama to return to the White House again soon for his presidential portrait unveiling ""and perhaps other engagements here in the future,"" she said. Since Biden took office, the administration helped to lower health care premiums for nine million Americans through the American Rescue Plan, Psaki noted Monday, ""the biggest expansion of affordable health care since the ACA."" ""We've made affordable health coverage more accessible during the pandemic through the opening of the special enrollment period, which enabled nearly three million Americans to have access to newly sign up for coverage under the ACA,"" she said. ""And President Biden has overseen the most successful open enrollment in history last year with the historic 14.5 million Americans signing up for ACA coverage and another million people signing up for the basic health care program."" Tuesday marked Biden and Obama's first joint appearance since attending the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks last fall in New York and their first joint event in Washington since Biden's inauguration in January 2021. When the pair celebrated the ACA's passage 12 years ago last month, Biden was caught on hot mic applauding Obama at the White House for what he called ""a big f------ deal."" Paraphrasing the memorable moment, a senior administration official told reporters, on what Biden announced, ""to borrow a phrase, this rule is a -- is a big deal."" ""We think it's the most significant administrative action to improve implementation of the ACA that we've taken since the law was first implemented,"" the official added. The rule would begin to take effect beginning Jan. 1, 2023, and Americans will be able to sign up to get financial assistance during the next open enrollment period. As of last year, about 31 million Americans had health care coverage through the ACA, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

2022-04-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/defense-secretary-gop-congressman-clash-alleged-wokeism-military/story?id=83889274,"Defense secretary, GOP congressman clash over alleged 'wokeism' in military","Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin got into a fiery exchange with Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz during a House Armed Services Committee budget hearing Tuesday, as Gaetz accused the Pentagon of strategic failures due to misplaced focus on alleged ""wokeism."" Gaetz began by asking Austin why taxpayers should fund lectures supporting socialism at the DOD-funded National Defense University, a reference to a recent virtual event hosted by the school titled ""Responding to China: The Case For Global Justice and Democratic Socialism,"" presented by French economist Thomas Piketty. Austin said he was unaware of the lecture. ""So now that you know that they did this, would you agree that embracing socialism is not an effective strategy to combat China?"" Gatez asked. ""I certainly don't agree with embracing socialism,"" Austin replied. Gaetz continued, asking, ""So why would we invite people we don't agree with to evangelize views and values that we don't share at the National Defense University, when we should be learning strategy about how to combat our enemies and make assessments that are accurate?"" Austin responded that learning strategy and other relevant subjects is the focus of military universities. Decorum began to crumble as the two men started talking over one another, Gaetz reiterating the controversial content of the lecture, Austin reiterating that the Pentagon does not embrace socialism. ""I control the time!"" Gaetz protested. The Florida congressman proceeded to accuse the Defense Department of making poor predictions about the invasion of Ukraine and the fall of Afghanistan. ""You guys told us that Russia couldn't lose. You told us that the Taliban couldn't immediately win. And so I guess I'm wondering what in the $773 billion that you're requesting today is going to help you make assessments that are accurate in the face of so many blown calls. Austin paused for nearly six seconds before responding. ""You've seen what's in our budget, you've seen how the budget matches the strategy, and so I'll let that speak for itself,"" he said. The secretary then grew visibly annoyed when Gaetz said the U.S. has fallen behind other countries in terms of hypersonic weapons. ""What do you mean we're behind in hypersonics? How do you make that assessment?"" Austin said. ""Your own people brief us that we are behind and that China is winning. Are you aware of the briefings we get on hypersonics?"" Gaetz asked. Austin responded, ""I am certainly aware of briefings that we provide to Congress."" Gaetz again attacked the Pentagon's priorities. ""While everyone else in the world seems to be developing capabilities and being more strategic, we've got time to embrace critical race theory at West Point, to embrace socialism at the National Defense University, to do mandatory pronoun training,"" he said. Austin fired back: ""This is the most capable, the most combat-credible force in the world. It has been and it will be so going forward. And this budget helps us to do that."" ""Not if we embrace socialism,"" Gaetz said. Austin then implied Gaetz was being unpatriotic. ""The fact that you are embarrassed by your country, by your military, I am sorry for that,"" Austin said. Gaetz retorted as Austin was still speaking: ""Oh no, no, I'm embarrassed by your leadership, I am not embarrassed for my country."" ""It's what you're saying, it's what you're saying,"" Austin said. ""I wish we were not losing to China ... That is so disgraceful that you would sit here and conflate your failures with the failures of the uniformed service members. You guys said that Russia would overrun Ukraine in 36 days. You said that the Taliban would be kept at bay for months. You totally blew those calls. And maybe we would be better at them if the National Defense University actually worked a little more on strategy and a little less on wokeism,"" Gaetz said. ""Has it occurred to you that Russia has not overrun Ukraine because of what we've done and our allies have done? Have you ever even thought about that?"" Austin said. Gaetz used his remaining seconds to reply: ""But that was baked into your flawed assessment. And so I saw that the Obama administration tried to destroy our military by starving it of resources, and it seems the Biden administration is trying to destroy our military by force feeding it wokeism. I yield back.""",7
2022-04-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-negotiators-strike-deal-10-billion-covid-funding/story?id=83871609,Senate negotiators strike deal for $10 billion in COVID funding,"After weeks of pleas from the White House for Congress to approve more money toward COVID-19 programs that were at risk of being cut, senators have put forward a new bill for $10 billion. The package, which sets aside money to support the nation's testing infrastructure and the development of new, variant-specific vaccines, falls far short of the initial $22.5 billion requested by the White House. Sen. Mitt Romney, who has been leading negotiations on the bill for Republicans, announced that the new funding would be paid for entirely by offsets, meeting Republican demands to only use already-approved federal funds instead of spending any more money. But doing so required cutting back on support for certain programs and repurposing funds that were set aside for other things. The new bill takes $500 million back from a fund to support colleges and universities during COVID, for example, and nearly $1 billion from a fund for tribal governments. And it does not include funding for the U.S. global vaccination program, which was supporting vaccine distribution and administration in countries around the world. Romney said he was ""willing to explore a fiscally-responsible solution to support global efforts in the weeks ahead."" Reacting to the latest deal, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the president was ""grateful"" for the progress but would continue to push for more money. ""This is clearly a huge focus for the president because of the dire need we have at this moment to get this funding through and the fact that we are already at a point where we have had to halt, delay a range of programs and purchases that we feel are imperative,"" Psaki said at a White House press briefing. Samantha Power, Biden's USAID chief, urged Congress to do just that on Monday evening, pointing to more than 30 countries that are off-track to hit their vaccination goals this year. Power said that without funding, the U.S. will ""have to turn its back on the countries that need urgent help to boost their vaccination rates."" In particular, the funding would have surged resources to 20 countries with the lowest vaccination rates or greatest need for resources like testing, treatments and PPE, she said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was ""disappointed"" that global COVID aid did not make it into the package but that he intends to bring up the funding again later this year as part of a larger global aid package. ""It is my intention for the Senate to consider a bipartisan International appropriations package that could include additional aid for Ukraine as well as funding to address COVID-19 and food insecurity globally,"" Schumer said in a statement. Democrats in the Senate shared Schumer's disappointment in the omission of global aid from the package, Democratic Whip Duck Durbin said, but he is confident it will still get Democratic support. ""I think there's this feeling we're disappointed but what we have, 10 billion or so, is very important,"" Durbin said. But Republican support is less clear. It's not yet certain that the deal will get the necessary 10 Republican votes to clear the Senate's 60 vote threshold. Republican Whip John Thune said the deal still needs to be explained to rank and file members before their support can be gauged. Even if 60 members do agree to back the bill, it will be a heavy lift to secure the unanimous agreement of senators to speed up passage of the bill before the two-week Easter recess is scheduled to begin Friday. It's also unclear exactly what will be supported if the $10 billion package passes, as the White House asked for more than twice that amount to pay for efforts like test manufacturing, continued orders of anti-viral treatments, global vaccine efforts and future vaccines for different variants. But if it does pass, the bill is sure to avert some of the immediate impacts of the funding stalemate. Last week, for example, the White House warned that without any funding, the nation would only have enough tests to get through the next potential increase of cases from the BA.2 variant but wouldn't be able to keep producing tests at the current pace after June. ""And if we fail to invest, we leave ourselves vulnerable if another wave of the virus hits,"" President Joe Biden said in a speech last Wednesday. And in the time Congress and the White House have spent squabbling over the funding, the uninsured fund ran out of money, leaving Americans who don't have insurance to pay as much as $125 out of pocket if they get PCR testing at labs like Quest Diagnostics, one of the biggest in the country. Funds to cover the costs of vaccination for uninsured Americans are set to run out this week. Monoclonal antibody treatment supplies distributed to states each week have also already been impacted. And Biden warned that the U.S. supply could run out entirely by May if funding isn't secured. ""We've had to cancel planned orders and cut the supply we're sending to the states. Without more funding, we'll start to run out of them by the end of May,"" he said on Wednesday. According to Romney's office, half of the proposed $10 billion in funds will go to development and purchase of therapeutics, like a new variant-specific vaccine, while the other half will be given to the Department of Health and Human Services for use with slightly broader COVID-related discretion -- likely for testing.",26
2022-04-06,https://abcnews.go.com/US/accused-isis-beatle-trial-brutal-kidnappings-faces-mothers/story?id=83893964,"Accused ISIS 'Beatle,' on trial for brutal kidnappings, faces mothers of American victims","A British man accused of being one of the infamous quartet of ISIS terrorists nicknamed the ""Beatles"" by prisoners who they beat and executed was faced down in federal court this week by two of their victims' mothers, and one man who survived their brutality. El Shafee Elsheikh is accused of a direct role in holding hostage four Americans, several Britons, and other captives between 2013 and 2014 at several makeshift prisons in Syria. At his trial this week in U.S. federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, prosecutors called as witnesses the mothers of two Americans who did not survive as hostages of ISIS, journalist James Foley and humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller. Foley, of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, was kidnapped in Syria in 2012 along with British journalist John Cantlie, and was held for nearly two years before he was shown beheaded in a gruesome video by the ISIS Beatle dubbed ""Jihadi John,"" whose real name was Mohammed Emwazi. ""Incredible shock, I didn't believe it -- I didn't want to believe it,"" Foley's mother Diane testified about learning that her son was killed. Foley's brother Michael testified about the horror of seeing the ISIS video that showed the remains of his brother, a 38-year old a freelance journalist for Global Post and Agence France-Presse, after the killing that stunned the world on August 19, 2014. Her head tilted up to look at the ceiling rather than at the defendant, Diane Foley spoke in a clear, strong voice about her son, who had previously survived previous captivity by other militants in Libya. She said when President Barack Obama ""announced Jim had been beheaded, it sunk in."" The Foley family subsequently established the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation to assist hostages, their families, and war journalists. On Tuesday, it was Marsha Mueller's turn. She told of how her 27-year-old daughter Kayla, of Prescott, Arizona, had traveled to the Middle East and to Turkey and Syria, seeking ways to help refugees of the Syrian civil war. Then on August 4, 2013, after visiting a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, to help her friend Omar Alkhani install satellite internet, Kayla and her colleagues were kidnapped by armed men. Dressed in a black sweater, Marsha Mueller's voice became stronger with each passing minute as she told of Kayla's love for owls, music and books, and how Kayla had sought to provide aid to women and children refugees in need. She described exchanging 27 emails with ISIS, in which they demanded the release of convicted terrorist Aafia Siddiqi or 5 million Euros in exchange for Kayla's release. An ABC News investigation in 2015 found that the FBI and Obama White House had blocked the Foleys, Muellers and other families from paying ISIS' ransom demands -- though ransoms paid for European hostages had led to their release. After U.S. special mission unit Delta Force raided a makeshift prison on Independence Day 2014, but missed rescuing the hostages by only two days because critics said the intelligence was not acted upon swiftly enough by the White House, ISIS sent an angry email about Kayla and threatened they would ""put a bullet in her head."" Her mother said they knew nothing about the U.S. raid, and reacted to the message with fear. ""They were going to kill her,"" she recalled in court. Marsha Mueller's voice cracked when she read aloud one of three letters Kayla wrote from ISIS prisons, sending ""hugs and kisses"" to her niece, and signing it, ""All my everything, Kayla."" The letters were addressed to her parents, her mentor the Rev. Kathleen Day, and her friends Halla and Orouba Barakat, mother-daughter journalists in Turkey who themselves were later murdered in Istanbul in 2017 and were the subject of an ABC News-Reveal investigation. When Kayla was reported killed on February 6, 2015, ISIS emailed Carl and Marsha Mueller three photos of their lifeless daughter. ""Her face looks like it is smeared with blood, her eyes are partly open, her mouth is slightly open,"" Kayla's mother told the jury. The Muellers later learned that Kayla had stood up for and cared for other hostages, and that she had been repeatedly raped by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the ISIS top leader and self-proclaimed ""caliph"" of all Muslims. Al-Baghdadi was subsequently killed by Delta Force in 2019 during a raid code-named ""Task Force 814"" in honor of Mueller's August 14 birthday. After providing testimony on Tuesday, Marsha Mueller and Diane Foley held each other in comfort, beyond the eyes and ears of the jurors. Another witness who faced Elsheikh in court was Spanish journalist Marc Marginedas, who was kidnapped in Syria and held with Mueller, Foley, Cantlie and others including American journalist Steven Sotloff, with whom Marginedas became close during their captivity. Marginedas recounted in horrifying detail how the four ""Beatles"" -- so named by Cantlie to keep track of their British-accented captors because their real names were unknown -- inflicted savagery upon them. As Sotloff's parents Arthur and Shirley looked on in the courtroom, Marginedas recalled how the terrorists appeared to take particular joy in beating Sotloff, who was Jewish. Sotloff told Marginedas he believed that the beatings, some of which occurred in front of his fellow captives, had left him with broken ribs. But the Jewish journalist never revealed his faith to his captors, and simply wore extra clothing to soften the blows. ""He was a very courageous man who didn't complain much,"" said Marginedas, who testified in the Virginia courtroom only a week after reporting from the front lines in Ukraine. A decade after he was kidnapped, Cantlie's whereabouts remain unknown, as do the whereabouts of New Zealand nurse Louisa Akavi, who was kidnapped by ISIS in 2013. Other victims' relatives who appeared in the courtroom were Paula and Ed Kassig, the parents of former U.S. Army Ranger Peter Kassig, an American aid worker who was killed by ISIS in 2014. Elsheikh, dressed in a collared shirt and khakis, with black-framed glasses and a beard, sat motionless as each family member took the stand, slouching on his left elbow even as prosecutors played video of interviews he had voluntarily given. In one clip filmed in 2019 in a Syrian prison where Elsheikh and fellow ISIS Beatle Alexanda Kotey were held following their capture, former ABC News contributor Sean Langan asked if Jihadi John, who the CIA later killed in a drone strike, had asked Elsheikh to get the Muellers' contact information from their daughter to negotiate ransom. ""That was the first time I saw Kayla, I took an email from her,"" he replied. Elsheikh, who has admitted in media interviews to being an accomplice of ISIS, faces a life sentence if convicted. Prosecutors took the death penalty off the table in a deal with the British government, which opposes capital punishment. On Tuesday, after the jury was dismissed for lunch and U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III had left the courtroom, Kayla Mueller's friend Omar Alkhani delivered an insult in Arabic to Elsheikh while Elsheikh was being led out by a U.S. Marshal. One day Elsheikh would meet his former ISIS bosses ""in hell,"" Alkhani shouted. Elsheikh only glanced back at the outburst.

2022-04-06,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-seek-gas-price-foils-big-oil-ceos/story?id=83892483,Democrats seek gas-price foils in 'Big Oil' CEOs: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Former President Barack Obama took only one question from reporters during his first time back at the White House in more than five years. His answer cut through the tension in the room and inside a nervous Democratic Party: ""We got a story to tell,"" Obama said when asked about the midterm elections, ""just got to tell it."" That task continues Wednesday morning at a hearing of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. House members will hear from top executives at six major energy companies on a quite unsubtle topic: ""Gouged at the Gas Station: Big Oil and America's Pain at the Pump."" Members of Congress have already seen the stickers on gas pumps back home blaming President Joe Biden -- and, in some cases, themselves -- purporting to take credit for soaring gas prices. The ""Putin's Price Hike"" label applied by the White House only goes so far in telling another side of the story. The measures the president is taking, up to and including releasing supply from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, also have limited impact. Democrats have their internal disagreements to contend with when it comes to energy policy. One big focus of Wednesday's hearings will be to expose shortcomings and misleading rhetoric in oil companies' commitment to renewables and to make the case that oil executives are profiting from the war in Ukraine at consumers' expense. Of all the huge political challenges facing Democrats this year, rising prices on gas and consumer items may be the hardest to fix and most resistant to spin. Their hope is that finding new places to direct drivers' ire might start to tell a different tale. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Amid a slew of other actions aimed at lowering the cost of living for Americans, the Biden administration is expected to announce another extension of the pause on student loans. Borrowers will reportedly not have to make payments until after Aug. 3. Interest would also remain at 0% until then. Payments were supposed to resume in May. The new summer date would have them start up just a couple of months before the high-stakes midterm elections. When asked about that possibility Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki deflected. ""I don't have anything to preview at this point in time,"" said Psaki. ""Obviously, we look at and assess what the needs are for the people who were impacted by the payment of student loans."" It comes as the Biden officials take other steps -- releasing oil from reserves to lower the cost of gas, including measures in their proposed budget to tackle inflation in the long term and announcing a plan to lower the cost of health care coverage for families. The announcement of another extension has ignited renewed calls for the Biden administration to cancel student loan debt altogether. ""With each and every repayment extension, you make a stronger case for canceling it,"" said Wisdom Cole, the National Youth and College Director of the NAACP, in a statement. ""At this point, just cancel it. $50,000 is the bare minimum. $10,000 is not enough."" On the campaign trail, President Joe Biden had called for the cancellation of up to $10,000 per borrower. He has yet to fulfill that campaign promise. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Michigan Rep. Fred Upton became the fourth Republican congressman who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump to choose to opt out of running for reelection this year. After serving in Congress for more than 35 years, Upton announced his decision on the House floor Wednesday. ""Even the best stories have a last chapter. This is it for me. I've done the zillions of airline miles back and forth. I've signed 'Fred' to over a million letters, cast more votes than anyone in this chamber while here and by most accounts have succeeded in making a difference, accomplishing what I've set out to do with more unfinished work still yet to come,"" Upton said. Although Upton joins fellow outgoing GOP Reps. Anthony Gonzalez, John Katko and Adam Kinzinger in leaving Congress amid intraparty tensions, another major factor shaping his decision -- as well as the decisions of some of his colleagues -- is reflected in this year's redistricting process. The new boundaries of his district would have put Upton in a dual incumbent primary against Trump-endorsed Rep. Bill Huizenga. Even so, Upton's decision appears to have been made recently given his successful fundraising hauls and television ads touting his accomplishments in Congress, even saying he's ""not afraid of taking anyone on when they're wrong, and work with anyone when they're right."" Earlier this week, Upton told NBC News that if he won his primary, it would send a message to Trump that he's ""not as strong as he might have thought he was."" On the heels of Upton's announcement, Trump celebrated Upton's retirement in a statement saying, ""UPTON QUITS! 4 down and 6 to go. Others losing badly, who's next?"" NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 31. That's the percentage of Alaskans who have a favorable view of former Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, according to a 2021 poll. There's reason to think that poll is not an outlier either, as that's the same share of Alaskans who had a favorable view of Palin in 2018. As FiveThirtyEight's Geoffrey Skelley writes, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of Palin's bid to replace the late Rep. Don Young, Alaska's lone representative. But at the same time, her name recognition, appeal among Trump voters in the state and the state's new top-four voting system could ultimately work in her favor.

2022-04-06,https://abcnews.go.com/International/trevor-reeds-parents-hope-sons-release-russia-diminishing/story?id=83884889,Trevor Reed’s parents say hope diminishing for son's release from Russia,"It's been three years since Joey and Paula Reed have seen their son Trevor, a former Marine currently held in a Russian prison, and now they're afraid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine means their chances for his return are dwindling. The couple spoke to ABC News' ""Start Here"" Tuesday, April 5, and discussed the latest developments in their fight to bring their son home. Joey Reed said the situation is going ""downhill"" as communications with their son have diminished since the start of the Russian invasion and on Monday, April 4, he was reportedly sent to a prison hospital. He said he fears that Russian officials may take more action against his son and other Americans currently held in their prisons and is urging President Joe Biden to act. ""Our biggest fear right now is him getting home at all. We're concerned that they're going to put additional charges, false charges on him, which that's typical FSB and or he will die,"" Joey Reed told ABC News. Trevor Reed's detention began in 2019 when his family says he was visiting a girlfriend in Moscow. The 30-year-old was arrested after Russian authorities said he allegedly assaulted a police officer while drunk. It is a charge the family denies. When asked by Reed's attorneys, video from inside the car, Russian authorities did not present any evidence that he grabbed the wheel or assaulted the officers. But a year later Reed was sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony. Paula Reed said her family tried to raise awareness for their son's imprisonment, but they struggled to get any headway due to other topics taking up the headlines, including the start of the pandemic. ""It just seemed like Trevor couldn't get a break because every time we thought we were going to get some news out there, something bigger was happening in the world that got the attention. So it took us a long time to get our feet running on getting publicity,"" she told ABC News. The Reeds have also been calling for the release of Paul Whelan, another ex-Marine who has been imprisoned in Russia since 2020 following a conviction of espionage which he has denied . The family has picked up their calls for help, and last week protested outside the White House and asked to meet with the President. ""We just thought that they would see us and it would remind someone that they need to be together for a meeting,"" Joey Reed said. Biden met with the family after their protest. The Reeds said during their meeting, which lasted over half an hour, they reiterated their calls to Biden for a prisoner exchange. ""We think that that's the only way Trevor is going to get back with any time soon,"" Paula Reed said. She added that her son is losing hope of ever returning home and pickup up his life where it left off. ""The longer he's in prison, the harder that's going to be for him to do,"" she said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement that, ""during their meeting, the president reiterated his commitment to continue to work to secure the release of Trevor, Paul Whelan, and other Americans wrongfully held in Russia and elsewhere, and to provide all possible assistance until they and others are free and returned home to their families who are advocating so passionately for their release."" The White House declined to comment about specific details discussed between Biden and Reed's parents. The Reeds said they felt the president was mindful of their requests. ""He's a good man. He had a son in the military. He's lost children and he's compassionate,"" Joey Reed said. ""We believe that after hearing us out that I can't imagine that he's not doing something to speed up the process for bringing our son home."" In the meantime, the Reeds said that the government needs to do more to defend and bring back Americans wrongfully imprisoned abroad. ""We just want to get him out of there alive and the sooner, the better,"" Joey Reed said.",2
2022-04-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/general-assembly-vote-russias-suspension-human-rights-council/story?id=83932377,UN General Assembly suspends Russia from Human Rights Council,"The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday voted to pass a resolution to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council, in response to Russian forces' alleged killings of civilians in Ukraine. The vote passed with 93 countries voting in favor, 24 voting against and 58 abstaining from voting. Belarus, China, Iran, Russia and Syria were among the countries who voted against the resolution. The vote came amid global outrage over the alleged killings of civilians in Bucha, Ukraine, after Russian forces withdrew from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. The UNGA needed a two-thirds majority to suspend Russia, now the second country ever suspended after the UNGA voted to remove Libya from the Human Rights Council in 2011 in response to Moammar Gadhafi's violent crackdown on anti-government protesters. In a speech before the vote, a Ukrainian representative urged the assembly to remove Russia from the council. ""Suspension of Russia from the human rights council is not an option, but a duty,"" Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's permanent representative to the United Nations, said. Speaking after the vote, Russia's deputy permanent member Gennady Kuzmin called the UNGA's decision ""an illegitimate and politically motivated step with the aim of demonstratively punishing a sovereign member state of the U.N.,"" even going as far as calling it ""open blackmail of sovereign states."" He also claimed the council is ""monopolized by one group of states who use it for their short-term aims,"" and that ""such actions violate the mandate entrusted by the international community on the Human Rights Council and overall undermine trust in this body."" After the vote was completed, Kuzmin said Russia made the decision to end its membership with the Human Rights Council on Thursday. James Roscoe, a UK diplomat, then asked Russia to clarify, and said, ""That sounds like someone who has just been fired, then tendering their resignation."" Kuzmin responded, ""I think we made a very clear statement."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reacted to the vote as he took the stage for a NATO press conference in Brussels. ""A country that's perpetuating gross and systematic violations of human rights should not sit on a body whose job it is to protect those rights. Today a wrong was righted,"" Blinken said during his opening statement. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told CNN on Wednesday that they ""absolutely"" have the votes to suspend Russia. ""We have been working very, very hard since this war started to build a coalition of countries who are prepared to condemn Russia. We got 141 votes, the first time we went into the General Assembly. The second time we got 140. And I have no doubt that we can defeat Russia here on the Human Rights Council,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. She added: ""They don't deserve to be on the Human Rights Council."" For more coverage: ABC News' Aaron Katersky reports: -ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report",6
2022-04-08,https://abcnews.go.com/International/kentucky-mother-refuses-leave-ukraine-adopted-child-shes/story?id=83932552,Kentucky mother refuses to leave Ukraine without adopted child she’s waiting to bring home,"The war in Ukraine has forced millions to flee, but a Kentucky mother had a different idea: she packed her bags and headed toward a war zone. The mission: Bring home the newest addition to her family. “I decided to come here because we were awaiting court for the finalization of our daughter, who was evacuated from Donetsk to Lviv,” Colleen Thompson told ABC News Live in an interview April 7. Thompson’s daughter, Maure, who turned 18 just a few days before the attacks began, is one of more than 300 orphans who were in the process of being adopted by Americans before Russia invaded Ukraine, according to the United Nations. Thompson added that she also made the tough decision to say goodbye to the rest of her children at home in the U.S. so she could help other Ukrainian orphans. The war has made it impossible for Thompson and other adoptive families to finalize the necessary documentation to bring their children to America. Orphanages are being evacuated as Russia continues its assault, so it's also difficult to keep track of where children may be living, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund. “We were working with several government agencies helping to evacuate children from orphanages and aged-out children who had graduated from the orphanage. We were helping to evacuate them in the early stages of the war,” she said. With pizza, games, tutoring, and companionship, Thompson has helped to make the children feel at home until they’re able to meet their new families. “I’m able to do FaceTime calls with the kiddos in this group who are being adopted by Americans so that they can say ‘Hi’ to their children, and see them,” said Thompson. When Thompson arrived in Ukraine on March 3, she hoped to move her daughter, Maure, and the other children waiting to be adopted, to the United States. But now, more than a month later, they’re still stuck in Lviv. Thompson said she’s glad to be with her daughter, but says they’re in an unsafe position, along with the 43 other children who traveled from Donetsk to Lviv with Maure. “We have air raid sirens here multiple times a day and the children have to go underneath the orphanage every time. It happens, all kinds of things. And it's distressing, scary,” Thompson told ABC News. Although the children can travel to neighboring countries, Thompson said they have been repeatedly told by the State Department that they can’t go to their new homes in America until the adoption is finalized. “Twenty-two E.U. countries, many of whom don't do adoptions and don't have the strong ties that America does, are housing these children,” said Thompson. According to the State Department’s website, a child without a final adoption or guardianship order is not eligible for a visa. The U.S. immigration law determines eligibility for visas, and according to the department’s website, officials don’t have the authority to make exceptions. On March 22, a bipartisan group of legislators sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, calling on the State Department to unite American parents with the Ukrainian children they were already in the process of adopting. Thompson said they had a call with the State Department and parents of the Ukrainian children on Wednesday night, and that they were again told the adoption process needed to first be finalized. “It seems like a simple ask,” said Thompson. “These American families have been vetted, background checked, trained and they're bonded with these children. They're in the process of adopting. We are the best suited and most safe option for these children to have a place to stay while it's unsafe to be in Ukraine.” As the organizations on the ground in Ukraine, and legislators here, continue to work to find a way to bring these children to the United States, Thompson said she will do what she can to make a difference in their lives. She plans on staying with Maure until they’re able to return to Kentucky together.",22
2022-04-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/americans-blame-vladimir-putin-oil-companies-high-gas/story?id=83967683,"Most Americans blame Vladimir Putin, oil companies for high gas prices: POLL","As politicians spar over who's to blame for recent increases in gas prices, a large majority of Americans say oil companies and Russian President Vladimir Putin are major culprits, a new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds. Along party lines, Americans are more likely to blame Democrats for the increase in gas prices than Republicans, according to the poll, which also found much greater enthusiasm about voting in this November's elections among Republicans than among Democrats. In the ABC News/Ipsos poll, which was conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel, more than two-thirds of Americans blamed Putin (71%) and oil companies (68%) a ""great deal"" or a ""good amount"" for the increases in gas prices. This comes the same week oil company executives were grilled by lawmakers about the skyrocketing gas prices, which have been declining in recent days. Oil executives took turns defending their companies during Wednesday's hearing with the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, pushing back on accusations of price gouging and citing the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason for cost increases. Democrats have pointed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as the source of the rise in gas prices, with President Joe Biden coining it ""Putin's price hike,"" while Republicans have argued that Biden's energy policies are to blame. Although the public appears open to Democratic arguments, they are more likely to place a ""great deal"" or a ""good amount"" of blame for the price increases on Democratic party policies (52%) and Biden (51%) than on Republican party policies (33%) and former President Donald Trump (24%). A strong majority of Americans (68%) also disapproves of the way Biden is handling gas prices. Not surprisingly, these assessments divide along party lines, with almost all Republicans (93%) disapproving compared to 41% of Democrats. The public is split, with about half (49%) saying the price increases have caused financial hardship for themselves or others in their household, while 50% say it has not. Only 21% of Americans say it is causing them serious financial hardship. Republicans (60%) are more likely to say they're facing financial hardship over rising gas prices than Democrats (32%). Pain at the pump is considered to be one of several big political challenges facing Democrats this year. With the elections seven months away, just under 2 in 3 Americans (63%) are very (39%) or somewhat (24%) enthusiastic about voting. The poll found greater enthusiasm among Republicans, with 55% saying they are ""very enthusiastic"" about voting compared to only 35% of Democrats -- setting the stage for a challenging election year for Democrats, who will need to increase the intensity on their side of the aisle. On the opposite end, more Democrats (13%) say they are ""not enthusiastic at all"" about voting in the November elections compared to Republicans (5%). The ABC News/Ipsos poll did find broad support for Biden's policies regarding Ukraine, including placing tighter economic sanctions on Russia (79%), accepting refugees from Ukraine into the U.S. (63%), sending additional U.S. weapons and equipment to Ukraine (70%) and sending additional U.S. troops to nearby European countries but not Ukraine (53%). Americans were less supportive of more aggressive options that Biden has said the U.S. won't pursue, including sending troops to Ukraine (17%) and imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine (27%), which could mean direct military conflict with Russia. Despite being in lockstep with White House policies, slightly more than half (53%) of Americans disapprove of the way Biden is handling the situation with Russia and Ukraine, with a great disparity in disapproval between Republicans (85%) and Democrats (28%). Responses on a range of other issues, including the economic recovery, crime, climate change, inflation and immigration, have remained largely unchanged since the beginning of the year, with a majority of Americans disapproving of Biden's handling of them. One bright spot continues to be the president's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with 58% of Americans approving -- up from 50% in late January. COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have plateaued, while hospitalizations and deaths have largely trended downward. Cases have started to tick up across the Northeast and the West Coast, with the Washington elite facing a COVID-19 outbreak in recent days. This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted using Ipsos Public Affairs' KnowledgePanel® April 8-9, 2022, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 530 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 4.9 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 27-26-40%, Democrats-Republicans-independents.

2022-04-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-planned-attacks-ukrainian-civilians-national-security-adviser/story?id=83983530,Russia 'planned' attacks on Ukrainian civilians: National security adviser Sullivan,"National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the latest reports of Ukrainian civilians being tortured and killed by Russian troops have been ""horrifying...downright shocking, but they have not been surprising."" Sullivan told ABC News ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Jonathan Karl on Sunday that before the war began, declassified intelligence ""indicated that there was a plan from the highest levels of the Russian government to target civilians who oppose the invasion."" ""So this is something that was planned,"" he told Karl, adding that some units may have acted without direction from their leaders, frustrated by the level of opposition they've encountered from Ukrainians. ""I do think some of these units engaged in these acts of brutality, these atrocities, these war crimes, even without direction from above. But make no mistake, the larger issue of broad-scale war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine lies at the feet of the Kremlin and lies at the feet of the Russian president,"" he said. When asked if the acts amounted to genocide as suggested by United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who visited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv this week, Sullivan noted that the State Department usually makes that legal determination after an investigation and legal analysis. ""But let's set legalities aside for a minute...I think we can all say that these are mass atrocities. These are war crimes,"" he said. In one of the latest incidents, at least 52 people, including five children, were killed during a missile strike at a train station in eastern Ukraine. Images of bodies strewn across luggage showed the magnitude of the attack, which injured at least 100. Since the war began, the Biden administration has been steadily implementing sanctions meant to cripple the Russian economy and Putin's funding of the invasion. In the latest package, the U.S., in conjunction with its European Union and G-7 allies, imposed a ban on all new investments in Russia, increased sanctions on two major banks and sanctioned Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters. But while the U.S. has banned Russian oil imports, European governments have not. Asked if it was time for Europe to ban Russian oil and gas and imports, which come to an estimated $850 million per day, Sullivan said the president had been clear that the U.S. was able to do so ""without imposing massive costs on the American people"" but would continue to work with European allies to limit dependency. ""He is now working on a daily basis with his European colleagues on steps Europe can take to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas,"" he told Karl. ""In fact, the United States is surging gas exports to Europe in order for them to reduce their dependence on Russia."" Karl followed up: ""But you hear the frustration from President Zelenskyy. We heard it from the mayor of Kyiv that the money continues to flow, that the ruble is not in rubble as the president said...The money is still flowing and flowing in pretty dramatic levels."" ""If you look at independent projections of the Russian economy, it is likely to fall by something like 10 to 15% this year,"" Sullivan said. ""It is likely to cease to be one of the world's major economies because of the economic pressure we have put on them."" Sullivan also said the economy is being ""artificially propped up"" by Russian banks. ""Banks…are not allowed by the Russian government to sell dollars to customers. That's how they're protecting the ruble. But that has huge economic costs on the -- on the Russian economy,"" he added. ""We will continue to squeeze the Russian economy so that Russia and the Kremlin feel the pain from what they have done in Ukraine."" Sullivan conceded that although Putin has suffered several setbacks in his mission to topple the Ukrainian government, his tight grip on media has prevented Russians from hearing the truth. ""They are not getting the truth, for example, Jon, about the fact that the Russians lost and the Ukrainians won the battle for Kyiv,"" he said. ""Kyiv stands despite Russia's effort to conquer the capital city of their neighbor and they were unable to do that, and they suffered a significant military defeat there.""",7
2022-04-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-enthusiasm-problems-worsen-ahead-midterms-note/story?id=83997492,Democrats' enthusiasm problems worsen ahead of midterms: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The COVID outbreak coursing through official Washington isn't keeping President Joe Biden off the case or off the road, with the president set to outline new gun regulations Monday and visit Iowa and North Carolina later in the week. Democrats need to generate all the momentum they can muster. The latest ABC News/Ipsos poll shows a yawning enthusiasm gap for the party ahead of the midterms, with numbers that look even worse upon closer inspection. Looking at those most and least eager to vote this year tells an important aspect of the story. Among Republicans, 55% say they are very enthusiastic about voting in the midterms, compared to just 35% of Democrats -- a number nearly identical to strong enthusiasm among independents (34%). Meanwhile, 13% of Democrats say they are not at all enthusiastic about voting -- a segment of voters, of course, that will be hardest to draw off the sidelines. Only 5% of Republicans say the same, an encouraging sign for GOP strategists worried whether their voters will show up without former President Donald Trump on the ballot. Breaking things down by age offers some insight into what's behind this: Only 23% of 18- to 29-year-olds and 28% of 30- to 49-year-olds say they are very enthusiastic about voting, compared to 47% of 50- to 64-year-olds and 60% of those who are 65 and older. Voters in their 20s and 30s powered Biden's victory in 2020 and are traditionally less likely to vote than those who are older. ABC/Ipsos polling over the last few months shows almost no movement in Biden's approval across a range of issues including the economy, Ukraine, crime, immigration and inflation. That will have to change in relatively short order for Democrats to hope that the voting environment will be anything but dismal this year. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Without a clear end to the pandemic in sight, Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Sunday that decisions about whether to venture out to big gatherings will have to be based on personal risk assessment. Fauci told ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Jonathan Karl that people should consider things like their age, vaccination status and potential to infect vulnerable family members. ""This is not going to be eradicated and it's not going to be eliminated,"" Fauci said. ""And what's going to happen is that we're going to see that each individual is going to have to make their calculation of the amount of risk that they want to take in going to indoor dinners and in going to functions."" His advice comes amid an uptick in cases following a rollback in measures aimed to slow the spread earlier in the pandemic. Members of Biden's Cabinet, White House aides and members of Congress including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have all recently tested positive. Fauci said there is concern about the rise in cases, but that it is ""not unexpected"" given the change in CDC guidance that relaxes mitigation methods. Despite the lingering uncertainty, views on Biden's response to the COVID-19 pandemic have improved, with 58% of Americans approving compared to 50% in late January, according to the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The landscape of Pennsylvania's Republican Senate primary shifted on Saturday when celebrity television doctor Mehmet Oz received former President Donald Trump's endorsement. The backing came four months after Trump's original pick in the contest dropped out over abuse allegations that surfaced amid a child custody battle. Support from one of the party's top leaders could quell concerns from some Republican critics that Oz is not conservative enough while highlighting a direct similarity to Trump given that Oz frequently touts himself as a political outsider. The race's other top contender, former hedge fund CEO David McCormick, had also been lobbying for Trump's endorsement after Sen. Ted Cruz and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo got behind him. In a statement addressing Trump's endorsement, Oz echoed the high stakes of the primary by singling out McCormick. ""President Trump carefully reviewed all of the candidates for U.S. Senate. Everyone, especially David McCormick – a pro-China, Wall Street insider, wanted this endorsement. But President Trump wisely endorsed me because I'm a Conservative who will stand up to Joe Biden and the woke Left,"" Oz said. Trump's decision to support Oz, however, comes at a pivotal time for the former president as he aims to solidify his influence within the party through successful endorsements. The May 17 primary now will be as much of a political test for Trump as it is for the candidate he's endorsing. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 17.

2022-04-11,https://abcnews.go.com/International/macron-le-pen-advance-round-french-elections/story?id=83880584,"Macron, Le Pen advance to second round of French elections","PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, a far-right presidential candidate, took the top two spots in the first round of the presidential elections on Sunday, according to preliminary results. The two, who led a crowded field of twelve candidates, will advance to a second and final round of voting on April 24. Macron, who is seeking reelection, placed first with about 28% of votes cast on Sunday, according to preliminary results. Le Pen carried about 23%. Experts say the latest trends showed a strong and rapid rise in the number of voters in favor of Le Pen, while those of Macron were falling. ""We've seen a positive dynamic in favor of Marine Le Pen,"" Henri Wallard, deputy CEO at Ipsos polling, told ABC News. ""She has progressed clearly in the last two or three weeks before this first phase."" The far-right candidate's message has reached French people concerned about the cost of living. ""The most important concern expressed by the French voters is the purchasing power and and the social issues in general,"" Wallard said. ""And the fact is Marine Le Pen was early on in the campaign well-positioned on this topic ... and the fact is that we have seen as a consequence of the current international crisis a surge in the price of oil and gas and the impact on inflation."" The war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted this atypical presidential campaign and added uncertainty for voters. France risks breaking the 2002 record of non-voters, which reached 28% in the whole of France, according to Jean Chiche, emeritus researcher at the SciencesPo Center for Political Research. Abstention hovers over the elections, as the majority of French people don't feel represented by political office-holders, he said. ""There is a rejection of the political class,"" Chiche told ABC News. ""It is the young people of the working classes who live in isolated cities, or in peri-urban areas; they are the most abstaining."" Macron achieved high scores in the first 15 days of the war in Ukraine, according to Chiche, a major boost for the president seeking reelection. ""Faced with the war in Ukraine, he fully assumed his responsibilities as head of state, everyone in France understands that,"" Maud Bregeon, spokesperson for Macron's La République En Marche party told ABC News. Critics have pointed to Macron's absence on the campaign trail since the beginning of the war as one cause for his dropping popularity. Macron is also facing possible trouble at the polls since his government came under fire in February for hiring and paying large amounts to a U.S. consulting firm, as first revealed by two journalists from French newspaper L'Obs. The French government paid up 1.5 billion euros in 2020 to several private consulting firms for services such as counting health masks at the beginning of the pandemic or drafting a military strategy, the newspaper reported. A senatorial commission of inquiry into the government's frequent and expensive payments to those firms later unveiled that one of them, McKinsey & Company, did not pay taxes in France between 2011 and 2020, despite the large sums received. The National Financial Prosecutor's Office opened a preliminary investigation on April 6 for aggravated money laundering of tax evasion. McKinsey responded the same day, saying in a statement that ""the tax approach applied by McKinsey is similar in the countries where it is present and has been consistent for years."" ""As it stands, if Macron doesn't campaign more, if Marine Le Pen makes it to the second round and at the same time she doesn't collapse like she had done in 2017, then the probability of her being elected is non-zero; it is between 15 to 30%,"" Chiche said before Sunday's vote. The rise of Le Pen's party also led to the emergence of new candidates on the far-right, such as polemist Eric Zemmour. Zemmour, who was found guilty in January of hate speech by a Paris court, has stood out with a campaign focused on what he calls the fight against Islamism, calling on French Muslims to ""renounce the practice of Islam, which imposes a legal and political code."" Proposals from conservative and far-right camps targeting Muslim populations -- such as requiring French nationals to have certain first names -- have come under strong criticism. ""It's a reaction of disgust,"" Abdallah Zekri, president of the National Observatory for the Fight against Islamophobia, told ABC News. ""When he says we have to change our first names? Why change our first names? Zemmour is completely out of bounds."" Other proposals targeting migrants, such as the conservative candidate Valérie Pécresse's bid to systematically remove illegal immigrants accompanied by a ""zero visa"" policy for countries that refuse to take them back have also hit a nerve with migrant communities. Zekri says speeches like that of Zemmour, conservative party candidate Valérie Pécresse and Le Pen tend to lead to an increase in Islamophobic acts. ""I have been following anti-Muslim acts for over 11 years,"" Zekri said. ""Whenever an election approaches, Islamophobic acts automatically increase; and it's getting worse.""",6
2022-04-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/american-firefighter-learns-chiles-stolen-children/story?id=84012146,American firefighter learns he's one of Chile's stolen children,"In 1983, Hilda Quezada Godoy gave birth to a baby three months premature in her native Chile. She was told her newborn son died in the maternity ward. Decades later, Godoy discovered that her baby boy hadn’t died, but had been taken and put up for adoption in a plot sanctioned by the government of Chile. “I wanted to scream,” Godoy said in Spanish. “I questioned a lot of things. The thought [about] if he was loved, if he ate well, if he spent time cold. Why did this happen to me?” Under the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet in the 1970s, coercive adoptions became widespread in what experts say was an effort to reduce poverty and control the population. Thousands of children were taken and trafficked around the world through a complex network that included hospitals, Catholic churches and the Chilean government. “They were selling kids,” said Constanza del Rio, from the Chilean nonprofit Nos Buscamos. “The moms or the families were lied to by them. They didn't know that the kids were alive. So they're not looking for them.” Those targeted were often among the most vulnerable, like single mothers, the poor and indigenous women from the Mapuche community. After confirming the match through DNA testing, Graf began communicating with his birth mother. They finally had a face-to-face reunion last year organized by a team including Osvaldo Corral from Univision, who has become a close friend of the family. In late January 2022, ABC News followed Graf as he traveled to Chile for the first time to see his birthplace and meet additional relatives. “I have so many emotions. It's living a life out of my comfort zone right now, going to a foreign country I've never been to before. I don't speak the language fluently,” said Graf. “I have that fear of sitting right in front of my birth mom and not being able to communicate or express my feelings. It's scary.” Graf has spent the past 38 years living in the United States. He has a wife, Brittany, a child, Wyatt, and works for the City of Houston Fire Department. According to his adoption paperwork, which he says was falsified, he was born in Temuco, Chile, and his mother gave him up because she had several other children and couldn’t support him. “To tell a mother that their child died…Yeah, I would call it kidnapping or stealing,” said Graf. “To catch someone at their weakest moments and prey on that is just, it's disgusting. I don't know what kind of person was even capable of this, but for lack of a better word, inhumane.” Graf was adopted by Carol Graf Carnish and her family. He spent most of his childhood in Minnesota. “To think for 38 years that your son has been dead… It would be just devastating,” said Tyler's adoptive mom Carol Graf Carnish. “I might be a victim, but I don't look at myself as that.” Graf’s adoptive mother said she had no idea that her baby was stolen. “I really wanted children of my own. I had been pregnant and lost a child. And so we looked into adoption,” said Graf Carnish. She said she and her husband traveled to Chile to pick up the baby at the orphanage and recalled feeling hurried out. “We're bonding with the baby and then all of a sudden it was like, ‘Ok, [you] have to go.’” ABC News reached out to Tatiana Roman, the judge who had signed Graf’s adoption papers, but she declined to comment. ABC News did reach a woman, who wished to remain anonymous, who said she was an assistant at one of the Chilean hospitals that was a part of the coercive adoption network. While few involved have spoken publicly about coercive adoptions, ABC News interviewed a woman, who asked not to use her face or name, who said she was an assistant in the maternity ward of a Chilean hospital. She says she witnessed firsthand as midwives lied to mothers. “The mother would ask to see their baby even if they were dead, but they would tell them no because they already had brought it to the oven to cremate them,” said the woman, in Spanish. While she acknowledged knowing at the time that what she witnessed was wrong, she said the fear to protect her own family prevented her from speaking out until now. ""If I returned to that time again I would not have done things differently because I had my children and I had to protect them,"" she said. ""It was a dictatorship and those who challenged authority ... they would eliminate them."" In 2018, Boris Barrera, a member of the Chilean congress, launched an inquiry into the coercive adoptions. His investigation called for a Truth and Reparations Committee and a DNA database -- but no one has been charged with a crime. “What we are anticipating is that there will be punishment. The truth is that it’s hard,” said Barrera in Spanish. “Although the investigative police are working, there is a group of five people for more than 20,000 cases.” Graf and his family also decided to take action. They created a nonprofit called Connecting Roots that uses DNA kits from “MyHeritage DNA” to help other adoptees find their biological family members. “We're past the punishment stage. I think we're just looking for them to admit what they've done and to help reunite people,” said Graf. Graf has teamed up with Constanza del Río from “Nos Buscamos” to help create a DNA database between the United States and Chile to help more quickly identify potential matches and help other families reunite. “We're running out of time, not because of [punishing] the child traffickers; I don't care about that.

So far, they’ve had four DNA matches helping families reunite. “Within the very little time we’ve been an organization and we’ve been able to make a difference,” said Graf. “I have high hopes.”",7
2022-04-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-heads-iowa-confront-democrats-rural-woes-note/story?id=84018437,Biden heads to Iowa to confront Democrats' rural woes: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein President Joe Biden makes his first trip to Iowa as president on Tuesday. But Iowa politics found a way of finding him and the Democratic Party before he touches down. Sunday brought a judge's ruling -- subject to appeal -- that the front-running Democrat for Senate in Iowa, former Rep. Abby Finkenauer, failed to qualify for the primary ballot. It's an inauspicious development during a week the White House hopes to use to showcase its ""rural playbook"" by fanning out across the country. In Washington, meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee is expected to move ahead this week with a plan that could effectively kill Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses in time for 2024. In case you need another Hawkeye State headline, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, the state's former governor, won't be with Biden in Menlo, Iowa, on Tuesday when the president visits an ethanol plant, after Vilsack tested positive for COVID-19 last week. Biden famously finished fourth in what he called a ""gut punch"" amid the debacle that was the Iowa caucuses in 2020 and lost the state to former President Donald Trump by eight points that fall. But the Obama-Biden ticket won the state in the general election twice, by north of nine points in 2008 and more than five points in 2012. Such victories are distant memories for Democrats who are now struggling to figure out how their brand soured in huge swaths of rural America. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the president sees the trip as an example of how he governs on behalf of ""all people, whether you voted for him or not,"" and that he doesn't see Tuesday's visit through a ""political prism."" In Iowa, on this day in particular, that's not entirely his framing to dictate. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper President Biden, in Rose Garden remarks Monday, continued his denunciation of reallocating funds away from law enforcement agencies, or ""defunding the police."" ""The answer is not to defund the police, it's to fund the police and give them the tools and training to support the need to be better partners and protectors of our communities in need,"" Biden said to applause. The comment came during a speech highlighting steps the administration is taking to tackle the proliferation of ""ghost guns,"" easy to acquire kits that allow someone to put together an often untraceable firearm. Biden called for law enforcement agencies to hire more police and invest in community policing and violence interrupters -- community leaders who can help prevent crimes from happening in the first place. Approval of Biden's handling of crime remains at a dismal 38%, according to the latest ABC News/Ipsos Poll. Police reform efforts that died in the Senate haven't been revived and efforts from the White House to address the issue haven't yielded the transformative results Biden promised on the campaign trail. During the White House press briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about the status of an executive order on police reform. She pointed the finger at Congress for inaction on both gun and police reform. ""In order to make reforms impactful over the long term and more expansive, we need legislation,"" said Psaki. The fact remains that Biden made lofty promises to address both, but the likelihood of this 50-50 Senate passing what would be landmark legislation on either issue is slim. Chances could get even slimmer after a midterm election cycle not expected to bode well for the president's party, with Democrats bracing for what could be a loss of control of one or both chambers of Congress. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema As the stakes of former President Donald Trump's political endorsements come under sharper scrutiny, the prospects of at least one of his favored candidates -- North Carolina Senate contender Ted Budd -- appear to be on the rise despite being tied up in one of the nation's messiest primaries. In addition to Trump's backing, Budd is also seeing an outpouring of support from the Club for Growth, a conservative super PAC, which launched multimillion-dollar ad buys that tout Budd as an ally of the former president and his policies. The ads also cast Budd's main primary opponent, former governor Pat McCrory, as a ""lying liberal"" who exercises ""dirty tricks."" McCrory is also playing in the ad wars -- in a new ad released on Monday, the former governor is posing next to a wheelbarrow full of manure with Budd's image hovering above the pile, surrounded by flies. ""There's a lot of crap in politics, just like Congressman Budd's false campaign,"" McCrory said in defense of his branding as a conservative, before referencing his gubernatorial enactment of a law that banned so-called ""sanctuary city"" policies in North Carolina. McCrory is also associated with another controversial policy nicknamed the ""bathroom bill,""which restricted which public restrooms transgender people could use. The policy drew mass protests and rebukes from high-profile businesses and organizations, and the backlash contributed to McCrory's gubernatorial reelection loss. More recently, his role in the issue was resurfaced by Trump, who mocked McCrory as ""the bathroom governor"" at a recent North Carolina rally. ONE MORE THING Former Trump lawyer John Eastman -- a right-wing attorney who is emerging as a top target of the House committee investigating the Capitol attack -- was part of a small group of Trump allies who went to Wisconsin last month in an attempt to convince the Republican leader of the Wisconsin state Assembly to decertify President Joe Biden's win, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told ABC News. The private meeting was just one instance of an ongoing effort by Eastman, My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell and other Trump allies who have continually pushed to overturn the election despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Trump has been paying close attention to the effort and has been in contact with individuals in Wisconsin who are pushing to decertify the election, sources told ABC. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 23.

2022-04-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-fined-covid-19/story?id=84030999,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson fined over COVID-19 lockdown breaches,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was fined in connection with the police investigation into illegal parties and gatherings held at his residence and other government premises during coronavirus-induced lockdowns, Downing Street confirmed Tuesday. Johnson is the first sitting prime minister in U.K.'s history to have broken the law while in office. Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak have all been handed fines in connection with a host of lockdown breaches reported last year. Details as to how much the fines were worth, or which gatherings they were issued in connection with, were scant. ""The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have today received notification that the Metropolitan Police intend to issue them with fixed penalty notices,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. ""We have no further details, but we will update you again when we do."" The investigation into a number of events held at Downing Street by the prime minister's staff while the country was under lockdown conditions dominated headlines earlier this year. U.K.'s Metropolitan Police Service announced it was investigating at least eight gatherings, and they were currently examining over 500 documents and 300 images provided to them by a separate, internal investigation led by top civil servant, Sue Gray. A number of gatherings during lockdown took place at government residences, including a Christmas event, two leaving parties for departing staff and a summer gathering in the Downing Street garden, where up to 100 staffers were invited to bring their own alcoholic drinks. The Prime Minister has previously denied any wrongdoing, though recieved backlash for saying he believed that one of the gatherings, where pictures were leaked to the press of staff drinking alcohol, was a ""work event."" The announcement that Johnson and Sunak are to be issued with fixed penalty notices -- fines which must be paid to avert criminal proceedings -- came a day after the Metropolitan Police announced an update to their investigation, saying at least 50 people have been fined so far. Though media attention soon turned to the prime minister's handling of the crisis in Ukraine, where he has taken a strong line against Russia and was recently pictured with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the announcement of the fines has led to fresh calls for his resignation. While Parliament is in recess, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer, has already called for both Johnson and Sunak to resign. ""Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public,"" he posted on Twitter. ""They must both resign. The Conservatives are totally unfit to govern. Britain deserves better.""",3
2022-04-13,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/big-lie-big-deal-inside-gop-grassroots-note/story?id=84039310,'Big lie' still a big deal inside GOP grassroots: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Republicans in Washington want to be talking about gas prices or inflation, or the border and immigration, or crime, Ukraine, or just about anything President Joe Biden is focused on day to day. But their friends and erstwhile supporters in the party's grassroots have something else top of mind. So does the most popular and prominent figure in the GOP of 2022. Twice this week alone, state and local Republican Party gatherings showcased the resonance of the ""big lie"" about the 2020 election in ways that could wind up dictating the types of candidates and messaging the GOP puts forward. In Colorado over the weekend, a Republican state gathering advanced the Senate candidacy of a Jan. 6 rally attendee and a slate of other candidates who have pursued conspiracy theories surrounding 2020. In Michigan on Monday, several county GOP conventions turned messy after a Trump-endorsed candidate called for Republicans to ""storm"" them. This all comes as allies of former President Donald Trump met just last month with Wisconsin lawmakers in a push to decertify the 2020 -- yes, 2020 -- election, as ABC News' Will Steakin, Katherine Faulders and Laura Romero reported. Trump himself has made clear that a range of his endorsements in Michigan and elsewhere have been predicated on fealty to his false claims about the election. Then there's the message of an unusual anti-endorsement: On Tuesday he announced he wouldn't support Bill McSwain, a candidate for governor of Pennsylvania who served as one of his U.S. attorneys in the state, calling him a ""coward"" for not being more aggressive in pursuing baseless accusations of voter fraud. A wide swath of Republicans maintains that voters care far more about Biden's leadership and things like crime and gas prices than about still more investigations of 2020. But a similar message isn't consistently being delivered from either the top down or the grassroots up. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper More than two dozen victims are recovering after a subway shooting in Brooklyn, calling further attention to the increase in violent crime across the country. The incident, which occurred during the morning commute, comes as New York City Mayor Eric Adams pushes to address public safety concerns and urges workers to return to offices throughout the city. Adams, who remains in isolation due to a COVID-19 diagnosis, told WABC that he would direct the NYPD to double the number of officers patrolling the subway system. He also spoke about the importance of public safety as the city tries to return to normalcy. ""When I talk to my mayors in other cities, the proliferation of guns, those are the many rivers that feed the sea of violence,"" said Adams. He later added, ""We know we have to make sure New Yorkers are safe and feel safe in our system because it would clearly stymie our recovery that we are attempting to do for the city."" The shooting took place just a day after Biden's White House remarks calling for actions to combat gun violence and announcing a nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Biden addressed the shooting Tuesday during a trip to Iowa. ""We're grateful for all the first responders who jumped into action, including civilians -- civilians who didn't hesitate to help their fellow passengers and try to shield them,"" Biden said. Past mass shootings which have forever changed the lives of survivors and victims' families have not spurred the passage of federal gun reform legislation. Despite the horrific images of passengers bloodied by gunfire aboard one of the nation's most important public transit systems, it remains unlikely gun reform legislation could pass in this bitterly divided 50-50 Senate with many Republicans staunchly opposed to further restrictions on guns. The TIP with Brittany Shepherd After a monthslong push and pull with his own legislature, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has finally gotten his way -- for now. Republican legislative leaders are now deferring to DeSantis and his advisers to put forth his preferred map that redraws his state's 28 congressional districts -- deference rarely seen in the redistricting process. This is a flip in thinking for Florida's GOP-led statehouse, which originally opposed maps submitted by DeSantis' office back in January. At the time, DeSantis put forth an aggressive redistricting plan that halved the number of predominantly Black districts from four to two, which in turn eliminated Florida's 5th District which stretches from Tallahassee to Jacksonville and is currently helmed by Rep. Al Lawson, a Black Democrat. Since January, state Republicans put forward their own maps that heavily favored the GOP, but those proposals seemed insufficient for DeSantis, who vetoed a two-map plan passed by the legislature in March. Now, the state legislature will hold a special session starting next week, and DeSantis' team is expected to propose a ""race-neutral"" map, DeSantis said Tuesday. ""We are not going to have a 200-mile gerrymander that divvies up people based on the color of their skin. That is wrong,"" DeSantis said. While DeSantis' final proposed redistricting boundaries are unknown, they are likely to be aggressive and will no doubt face litigation brought by those who believe it suppresses minority votes. According to FiveThirtyEight, Florida is just one of three states that have yet to finalize their maps. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 2012. That's the year when support for LGBTQ protections in local ballot measures decreased, according to Marie-Amélie George, a law professor at Wake Forest University who specializes in LGBTQ rights.

It's something that's once again at the forefront of our politics nationally, as GOP-dominated legislatures move to pass legislation that restricts how gender can be talked about in the classroom and with some Republican politicians and pundits going as far as to claim that public schools have become ""grooming centers,"" or havens for child sexual abusers.

2022-04-13,https://abcnews.go.com/International/inside-ukrainian-village-farmers-stay-harvest-fear-russian/story?id=84016336,Inside a Ukrainian village where farmers stay for the harvest but fear Russian attack,"The wheat has been sown for the coming season, but nobody in Yakovlivka, a small farming village outside Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine, knows if it will be harvested. A week after Russian forces launched their invasion on Feb. 24, the village was bombed. The head of the village administration said four people were killed and 11, including children, were wounded in the attack. ""We were sitting in our cellar for four hours and read the Lord's Prayer. We wrapped the kids into blankets and just couldn't fall asleep until 3 or 4 in the morning,"" said Nina Bonderenko, who works on her cousin's farm. Villagers said the attack may have been aimed at a unit of Ukrainian soldiers camping temporarily in the village school, though apart from some broken windows, the building was undamaged by the blasts. Reuters was not able to independently verify the villagers' account of the bombing. Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" its neighbor. Ukraine and its allies dismiss that as a baseless pretext for war. Since the village was bombed, residents say all certainty has been lost. ""We have planted all the wheat. But will we be able to grow anything and harvest it under the current circumstances?"" said Vadim Aleksandrovich, the director of Granary of Sloboda, a farming company that emerged from a former Soviet-era collective farm. ""Only God knows. We are doing our best."" With the country at war, the uncertainty facing Yakovlivka is shared across the country by farmers who produce the grain that has historically made Ukraine, the world's fifth biggest wheat exporter, one of the great breadbaskets of the world. Last season, Granary of Sloboda's harvest amounted to 3,000 tons of wheat, 3,000 tons of sunflower and 1,000 tons of corn. But at the moment, 80% of the firm's 17,300 acres are not accessible because of mines or combat operations, Aleksandrovich said. Only the fields immediately around Yakovlivka village can be reached relatively safely, and there is heavy fighting around the firm's seed storage facility at its base in Izyum, some 87 miles away, he said. Before farm workers can go out to the fields, they call emergency services to find out if the area is safe. When rockets land in the fields, explosives disposal services remove any projectiles. ""The situation is very tense, and it is unclear what will happen to us,"" Aleksandrovich said. ""We don't even know what will happen in one hour."" Despite the uncertainty, most of the villagers have remained, refusing to join a national exodus that has seen around a quarter of the country's population of 44 million flee their homes. Of 533 permanent residents before the war, 380 have stayed, with refugees from outside boosting the population to 436, according to local authorities. Although the village shop has closed, people have started to patch up the damaged houses that can still be repaired. ""I thought I could live my last days in peace and then this,"" said 66 year-old Vera Babenko, picking a bowl out from under a pile of rubble by her now door-less refrigerator. She said a bomb landed just beside her house, about 650 feet from the school the attack was apparently supposed to hit, but she said she had no plans to leave. ""I want to rebuild my kitchen.""",17
2022-04-13,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-praise-criticism-calling-russias-actions-ukraine-genocide/story?id=84057232,"Biden gets praise, criticism for calling Russia's actions in Ukraine 'genocide'","President Joe Biden is getting both praise and criticism after doubling down on describing Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"" -- the first time he's used the term since the invasion began nearly 50 days ago -- even as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for weeks has claimed that is what's happening on the ground. White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended his use of the term, as she did when Biden called Putin a ""war criminal"" and when he said ""cannot remain in power,"" saying Wednesday the president was simply expressing ""what he feels."" ""The president was speaking to what we all see, and what he feels as clear as day in terms of the atrocities happening on the ground, as he also noted yesterday,"" Psaki said, before tempering his use of the term. ""Of course, there will be a legal process that plays out in the courtroom but he was speaking to what he has seen on the ground, what we have all seen in terms of the atrocities on the ground."" Pressed directly on whether Biden's comments might conflict with the U.S. policy, Psaki dismissed concerns and repeated the requirement of a ""legal process"" which can sometimes take years. ""He was not getting ahead of that. He was speaking on what he feels he sees on the ground,"" she said. ""I do not think anybody is confused about the atrocities we are seeing on the ground -- and different leaders around the world describe it in different ways,"" Psaki added later on. ""It is unquestionable that what we are seeing is horrific, the targeting of civilians, hospitals, children. The president was calling it like he sees it, and that is what he does."" State Department spokesperson Ned Price gave a similar line at his briefing Wednesday, saying Biden used the term based on ""impressions that he has seen and that we all have seen,"" but noted the U.S. is working with international lawyers to determine if Russia's crimes meet the legal threshold. During prepared remarks in Iowa Tuesday blaming inflation and gas prices on ""Putin's price hike,"" Biden said, for the first time, ""Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should on hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away."" His use of the word raised questions among Washington reporters about whether it was an ad-libbed moment or a policy shift from the White House -- until Biden later insisted he meant exactly what said. ""Yes, I called it genocide,"" Biden told reporters after his remarks. ""Because it has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian. And the evidence is mounting. It's different than it was last week, the more evidence is coming out of the -- literally, the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine and we're going to only learn more and more about the devastation."" Genocide is defined as an act ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" according to the United Nations' Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Biden went on to acknowledge the U.S. government has an internal, legal process for designating whether genocide has occurred but still stood by what he indicated was his opinion. ""We'll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me,"" Biden added. Zelenskyy has argued -- and pleaded -- for weeks that Russia has met this definition and called on Western leaders to use the same term, so was quick to applaud Biden's comments as ""true words of a true leader."" The Kremlin, meanwhile, blasted the comment as Putin indicated this week indicated his invasion won't stop until his goals are met and said peace talks with Kyiv had reached a ""dead end."" ""We consider this kind of effort to distort the situation unacceptable,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday. ""This is hardly acceptable from a president of the United States, a country that has committed well-known crimes in recent times."" It's not clear how many Western leaders will go as far as Biden and Zelenskyy -- or what will take for them to reach the same conclusion. No other Western nations have made the determination, aside from Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas tying Russia's crimes to the term in a tweet. French President Emmanuel Macron suggested Wednesday he's more ""careful"" with his words than the American president, saying only that ""war crimes"" have been confirmed. ""So far, it has been established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and bring them to justice,"" Macron told France 2 in an interview. ""I am very careful with some terms [genocide] these days,"" he added. ""I'm not sure the escalation of words is helping the cause right now."" Asked directly by ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce about Macron's criticism Wednesday, Psaki declined to comment. Macron also rebuked Biden's language last month, when asked about Biden calling Putin a ""butcher"" and saying he ""cannot remain in power"" during remarks in Warsaw. ""I wouldn't use those terms, because I continue to speak to President Putin,"" Macron said in another interview with France 3. ""Because what do we want to do collectively? We want to stop the war that Russia launched in Ukraine, without waging war and without escalation."" Biden stood by his words then, saying he was ""expressing moral outrage"" but also clarified that he wasn't ""articulating a policy change"" amid some fallout. It's unclear now what pushed Biden to change his stance on using the term ""genocide"" -- because asked directly last week if he thought the atrocities documented in Bucha were genocide, he said no. ""I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal. Well, the truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden said on April 4. ""He is a war criminal -- but we have to gather the information, we have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight, and we have to gather all the detail so this could be an actual -- have a war crime trial. This guy is brutal. What's happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone sees it."" Asked directly, ""You agree this is genocide?"" “No, it is a war crime,"" Biden replied. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan followed Biden's comment the same day by saying the administration had not yet seen the ""systematic deprivation of life"" necessary to meet the definition of genocide. ""This is something we, of course, continue to monitor every day. Based on what we have seen so far, we have seen atrocities, we have seen war crimes. We have not yet seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide,"" Sullivan said.

2022-04-13,https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/war-ukraine-brings-dual-crisis-global-food-supply/story?id=83960705,War in Ukraine brings dual crisis to global food supply,"LONDON and LVIV -- In southern Ukraine, far from the frontlines of the war, the planting season is set to begin. There, farmers are preparing for a crucial upcoming season, which will prove pivotal for not just Ukraine, but the global food supply in the months and years ahead, in what one farmer described as the “second frontline.” The war has already ushered in a “staggering” humanitarian and economic crisis, according to Anna Bjerde, World Bank Vice President for the Europe and Central Asia region, with the Ukrainian economy expected to shrink by 45% this year. Yet the crisis could extend far beyond the country's borders, with Ukraine’s claim to be one of the world's ""breadbaskets"" now at risk. The country is a top ten global exporter of a number of key agricultural products, including wheat, barley, corn, sunflower oil, soybeans and poultry, and officials and farmers warn the disruption caused by the invasion will have global consequences. At a NATO summit last month, President Biden said leaders discussed food shortages, saying “it’s going to be real.” Facing the realities of a land war in the country, farmers have been forced to improvise, but time is running out, Alex Lissitsa, a leading businessman and president of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club, told ABC News. “Farmers are very, very flexible and especially the Ukrainians are also very, very flexible and adaptive,” he said. “But right now, even the Ukrainian farmers did not expect the brutality of the Russians. We did not expect actually the whole infrastructure bill will be broken here… the main question is actually about the future because I did talk to two farmers; I did talk to companies and everybody has money left for the next four or five months. But if we cannot sell our products, if we don't have access to the export markets and the world market, it's done.” “The majority of Ukrainian farmers will become bankrupt somewhere [around] the summer,” he added. Food prices globally are already rising at the fastest rate in history, with the USDA now estimating that Americans are likely to pay between 4.5%-5.5% more for food this year. An estimated 70% of Ukraine -- an area larger than Italy -- is used as farmland, according to USAID. Russia has been accused by Ukrainian officials of destroying grain silos and key infrastructure during their invasion, as well as laying mines on significant areas of arable land. Around 70% of Ukraine’s exports are moved by Black Sea ports, in places like Odessa and Mariupol, which have now been blocked from carrying out this function due to incessant Russian shelling. “It’s quite clear that their goal is to create harm in Ukraine,” Taras Vysotskyi, Ukraine’s First Deputy Minister of Agriculture, told ABC News. “The main directions of destroying actual machinery, silos, fuel storages, animal farms and blocking the possibilities to export, which means less of cash, less of money for the agricultural producers to keep working and keep planting for the next season.” Products, from maize to cattle, can be held in storage for varying amounts of time, but the longer the war drags on the more likely it will be that these cannot be exported and are at risk of being wasted, he said. “If the ports keep blocked, it's really a disaster for Ukraine agriculture because it has been export oriented, usually in the last decade, like 70%, 75% of all agricultural commodities have been exported, so we can't consume them inside.” Around 300 million people are fed on Ukrainian products around the world on a yearly basis, Vysotskyi said, but current capacity -- the export infrastructure is only working at 10% of the usual amount of goods -- are leaving the country through alternative means, he said. Russia, too, is a major player on the global agricultural stage, and senior official Dmitry Medvedev has warned that Russia “will supply food and crops only to our friends” this month, and the country’s increasing isolation on the global stage could have similar consequences to the disaster in Ukrainian agriculture. Countries in Africa and the Middle East are particularly vulnerable to the crisis. Somalia and Benin have a total dependence on imports of mostly Russian and Ukrainian wheat, and many other countries rely on them for more than half their wheat imports, according to a rapid assessment by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. “The combination of very high prices of food and fuel and macroeconomic tightening will place severe pressure on households in developing countries: real incomes will be squeezed, and economic growth will be constrained,” the UNCTAD stated in its March assessment. “Even in the absence of disorderly moves in financial markets, developing economies will face severe constraints on growth and development.” “Overall, the war is really going to damage international consumers and theirs, as well as countries where people are less rich,” Vysotskyi said. “Then of course, they will feel it more… So it wouldn't be as a matter of price, it's just that they can't find it physically and what to eat.” Both Lissitsa and Vysotskyi said a package of international financial support is vital to alleviate the crisis. “Otherwise, we will have in one year even the war zone situation, because right now we'll be discussing about global hunger,” Lissitsa said. “But if Ukrainian farmers will go bankrupt actually in that year, then next year will be even worse situation. I think the majority of the countries, especially when it comes to Africa but also in Asia, do not understand how serious is that problem.”",25
2022-04-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/preemptive-public-us-strikes-winning-intelligence-war-russia/story?id=84015518,"Preemptive, public US strikes winning intelligence war with Russia: ANALYSIS","For years, the Kremlin's power to weave disinformation into a believable narrative was a seemingly ever-present boogeyman, threatening to disrupt elections and sew discord thousands of miles away from Moscow. Then, as Russia prepared to invade Ukraine, the tide started to turn. From the time the Kremlin claimed the troop buildup on its neighbor's border was simply a training exercise, the U.S. has been able to turn one of its powerful assets -- classified intelligence -- into an effective tool by making it public, undercutting Russian forces before they could carry out their next moves. CIA Director Bill Burns explained the administration's approach in a speech at Georgia Tech on Thursday, saying that at President Joe Biden's direction, the U.S. government had taken ""unprecedented steps to declassify intelligence and use it publicly to preempt the false narratives"" spun by Russian leader Vladimir Putin, making it harder to ""obscure the truth of his unprovoked and vicious aggression."" ""Those decisions can never be taken lightly given the importance of protecting sources and methods,"" he said. ""But in this case, they have made a crucial contribution to a successful whole of government strategy."" While these disclosures have so far proven effective in uniting the West and indeed, much of the world, against Russia, whether the U.S. can maintain the upper hand in a realm traditionally dominated by Russia is still an open question. ABC News spoke with several experts on Russia disinformation and the U.S. strategy of selectively releasing intelligence to counter it. Waving the 'false flag' Over a month before the attack on Ukraine began, U.S. officials sounded the alarm, warning they had credible evidence that Russia might attempt a ""false flag operation""-- manufacturing a pretext to justify an invasion. While this revelation did not deter Moscow from moving in, experts say it still made a profound difference. ""If they could have done a decent false flag operation, then it would have given some audiences reason to believe that them,"" said Todd Helmus, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation specializing in disinformation and countering Russian disinformation and a former deployed adviser to U.S. military commanders, told ABC News. ""That could have sown some disunity in the western response or possibly made support for Ukraine a partisan issue. The release of intelligence took that away from Russia."" Helmus says the U.S. striking first was critical. ""That's the key thing in propaganda wars -- the first person to get their message out really owns that space,"" he said. ""So for the U.S. to do the pre-bunking, they immediately own the space and put Russia on flat foot."" After their strategy was disrupted at the jump, Russia has been unable to effectively recast the reasoning for its invasion, or portray its campaign as successful to a broad audience, according to Helmus. ""It's hard to put lipstick on a pig as they say,"" he said. ""So much is going poorly for Russia that it makes it hard for them to properly message it."" Emily Harding is deputy director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and previously served as deputy staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. She says that while parts of the U.S.'s strategy may seem like common sense, it's nonetheless surprising to see the country take such a proactive approach. ""It's so shocking. The U.S. government in general is poorly placed to mix it up in the information space,"" Harding said, citing the inherent limits imposed by a democratic government with strict rules regarding influencing the public and a bureaucracy that typically ensures the declassification process is slow-moving. In recent weeks, the U.S. has gone so far as to share intelligence on the inner workings of the Kremlin, asserting that Russian president Vladimir Putin is being misinformed by his advisors because ""they are too afraid to tell the truth"" about their military's failures in Ukraine—a move Harding says could be aimed at shaking the confidence of the country's elite. ""If you're loyal to Putin, what you're assuming is that this guy knows what he's doing,"" she said. ""A release like that might undermine that judgment."" ""I think what's been good about these releases is that the public has seen just how good the intelligence community is at anticipating some events, at reading our adversaries, and then at providing policymakers the actionable intelligence they need to make a good decision,"" she said. ""Of many things in this conflict, people are going to look back at the early stages as an information warfare success."" Meanwhile, Sarah Oates, an expert on Russian media and propaganda at the Wilson Center, says that while the Kremlin was extremely disciplined and adept in its anti-democratic propaganda and portrayal of NATO as an enemy force out to destroy Russia, Putin veered off course in the final days before the invasion. ""In many ways, we can see the invasion of Ukraine as kind of a natural outcome of this propaganda warfare that's been going on for years and even decades,"" she said. ""On the other hand, in February, Putin goes completely off script. He just delves into the world of fantasy. He's all the sudden talking about things that are completely implausible and very deniable."" Oates says following the invasion, Russia -- grasping at straws -- has reverted to its traditional disinformation tactics. But now, they're falling flat. ""I can still see echoes of that in the current information warfare strategy that Russia has carried out, particularly in the so called biological labs myth. But in general, it's bad. It's just bad. This is not effective propaganda,"" she said. Truth and consequences While declassifying information has proven successful thus far, there are limits to the strategy -- and risks that come along with it. ""As a former intelligence professional, every time you see information declassified, it first of all makes you swell with pride, but then also strikes terror into your heart. You're very proud because you know what the intelligence community is capable of,"" Harding said. ""You also know what sacrifices were made in order to obtain that information and you worry about what the consequences might be. There are always consequences."" She says she is confident the administration is running a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis before any information is released, and a senior intelligence official tells ABC News that ""standard declassification procedures, which are in place to protect sources and methods were followed. Still, Harding notes that repercussions can be dire—including destroying invaluable working relationships with other countries and ""the potential for a human being put in tremendous danger."" Oates says there are more abstract limitations working against U.S. transparency as well, such as inadvertently providing fodder to the opposition. ""It is difficult because when we release information, it can be manipulated and used against us and woven into their narrative, like Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland trying to say at a congressional hearing 'well, yes, Ukraine does have biological laboratories for research,"" she said, pointing out how that innocuous revelation has been twisted by various sources to claim the country is secretly developing biological weapons. ""It's like -- no, she didn't say that."" ""It's just two completely different systems. And, in general, the Russian propaganda system has been able to run rings around the open media system of the United States,"" Oates continued. ""Relying on people to have news literacy or to check their sources is a little weak."" A Russian resurgence? Even if Russia has lost the information battle, it doesn't mean it's lost the information war. ""I don't know what they got in their pocket,"" said Helmus. ""They're pretty good at adapting. Their campaign targeting the U.S. in 2016 was full of adaption. They may play that game of 'this isn't working, let's try this."" Harding fears Russian failures could push the Kremlin to new extremes. ""I am very concerned that the Russian government is going to be a bit of a wounded animal right now and that they're going to look for ways to strike out,"" she said. And Harding says the impact of that strike could be felt much closer to home. ""They're a big government. They can walk and chew gum at the same time,"" she said. ""I think that it's still entirely possible that they will be trying to play in our 2022 elections, that they'll still be trying to sow divisions within American society, especially as this war rolls on.""

2022-04-14,https://abcnews.go.com/US/giuliani-helps-unlock-electronic-devices-feds-decision-looms/story?id=84081611,Giuliani helps feds unlock devices as charging decision looms,"Rudy Giuliani assisted federal investigators in unlocking several electronic devices that had been seized from him by the FBI -- a move that could speed a decision from Southern District of New York prosecutors whether to charge the former New York City mayor and presidential candidate over his lobbying efforts in Ukraine, his attorney and sources familiar with the case told ABC News. The FBI seized more than a dozen devices from Giuliani's home and office during a search last April. A court-appointed special master has been reviewing the contents but had been slowed by the inability to access all of the devices, the sources said. Giuliani either unlocked several devices himself or gave investigators a list of possible passwords, the sources said, confirming information first reported by CNN. There has been no comment as of yet from the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. ABC News previously reported prosecutors began reviewing thousands of communications from Giuliani after the special master filtered out material she deemed to be subject to the attorney-client privilege. According to her latest report in January, the special master, retired Judge Barbara Jones, agreed about half of what Giuliani designated as privileged should be withheld from federal prosecutors who are investigating his business practices. Jones said Giuliani previously asserted privilege over 96 chats and messages on a cellphone that contained about 25,000 chats and messages. ""Mr. Giuliani designated 96 items as privileged and/or highly personal. Of those 96 designated items, I agreed that 40 were privileged, Mr. Giuliani's counsel withdrew the privilege designation over 19, and I found that 37 were not privileged,"" Jones said in her report. The remaining 56 items were turned over to federal prosecutors.",11
2022-04-15,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-mother-relives-horror-sons-execution-bucha-basement/story?id=84080531,Ukrainian mother relives horror of son's execution in Bucha basement,"The images of five bodies found fatally shot in a basement in Bucha, Ukraine, with their hands tied behind their backs, apparently tortured and executed, alerted the world to possible war crimes. The images, revealed just over a week ago, included the son of Galyna Matyoshko, who spoke to ABC News from a monastery where she had taken refuge. The Ukrainian mother said her son Serhiy was helping evacuees when the Russians arrived. “They came like a hurricane, causing so much pain. For what?” said Matyoshko. “You can’t even imagine this pain. My soul is crying. God forbid this happens to anyone.” Matyoshko said she has the images of her son’s body on her phone. Despite her pain, she is keeping them so that the world can see what happened to her son. “I didn’t want to delete them; I wanted the whole world to see it and know that it’s a fact,” she said. “I'm not holding on to them to hurt myself, I want everyone to know that this isn’t fake. That this is my son, that this happened to me and my son.” According to Matyoshko, her son was helping evacuate women and children from the houses near the Bucha summer camp when he disappeared along with a friend who was doing the same on March 12. Both men's bodies were found in the basement. “I don't know how long he was there, he lost half of his weight. I don't know if they fed him or not. How? For what? I fed this child for myself, for joy,” said Matyoshko. Matyoshko said that the official report from the police crime investigators said that her son was killed by two gunshots. Unofficially, she says she was told by police that they had found eight gunshots and multiple knife wounds on the body. Russian officials have denied all allegations surrounding what was found in the Bucha basement. Matyoshko said she wanted to share a message with Vladimir Putin. “Look at what you did to us,” she said. “What is our fault? What have I done wrong? Why am I crying at a stranger’s place, with no home to live in? You have children; what if the same happened to them? And when our people come to tell you ‘it’s all fake,’ would you believe them?”",22

2022-04-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-send-mixed-signals-oil-border-politics-note/story?id=84135078,Democrats send mixed signals on oil and border politics: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein There's a broken pledge to contend with, as well as promises being kept that some wish weren't. There are Trump policies being affirmed and others about to be revoked. President Joe Biden's administration starts Earth Week offering new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands for the first time in the Biden presidency. It's the latest move to address soaring gas prices but also the latest to enrage environmental advocates -- armed this time with a Biden campaign pledge to the contrary. The Biden administration is also just weeks away from lifting the Title 42 order that allowed federal authorities to quickly expel most migrants coming to the U.S. since the early days of the pandemic. That's in line with the president's longstanding vow to follow the science when it comes to emergency COVID-19 measures, and with Democrats' aversion to almost everything former President Donald Trump did during the pandemic. But an array of Democrats facing tough races this fall fear it's nowhere near in line with the politics of the moment. Incumbent Democrats in states including Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire are raising concerns that Title 42 is being lifted too quickly. One refrain in particular might sting if the expected surge at the border materializes. ""I have yet to hear a plan from the Biden administration,"" said Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Texas. ""This administration does not have a plan,"" Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., warned last week. ""It's going to be a crisis on top of a crisis."" Plan or no plan, there continues to be broad agreement inside the Democratic Party about its dire political outlook. Where they lack agreement is on what can or should be done to respond. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Mass shootings in Columbia, South Carolina, and Pittsburgh over the holiday weekend put a continued spotlight on gun violence and, more broadly, violent crime across the country. The South Carolina shooting, at a crowded mall, injured 14 people, and the Pennsylvania shooting, at a house party, killed two minors and injured nine others. Both came on the heels of the Brooklyn subway shooting, which injured more than two dozen people and led to a subsequent manhunt for alleged gunman Frank James. ""This is a national issue,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams told ABC ""This Week"" Anchor George Stephanopoulos when asked about the uptick in crime in the nation's largest city. ""It's not a red state, blue state. In fact, red states are experiencing a higher murder rate than blue states."" There have been 138 mass shootings in the U.S. since the start of this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that identifies mass shootings as cases in which four or more people are shot and tracks them through public data, news reports and other sources. The Biden administration announced last week it was moving forward with actions to curb ghost guns -- guns sold in parts that can be put together at home and are often untraceable. The administration has called on Congress to pass legislation that could offer more substantial reforms, but advocates say communities from coast to coast can't afford to wait on Congress, where it remains improbable that gun reform could pass since many Republican lawmakers strongly oppose such legislation. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema In less than a week, Michigan Republicans will vote to nominate candidates to challenge incumbent Democrats for statewide offices in November. The event is sure to heighten existing intraparty tensions between Trump loyalists -- some of whom continue to question the outcome of the 2020 election -- and Republicans who want to create a path forward without the former president's election denials dominating their campaigns. Having lost the 2020 battleground by just over 150,000 votes, Trump is now visibly mapping out paths to remain a commanding figure in Michigan's political landscape, which includes getting involved in state legislative contests. The former president has already endorsed nearly a dozen state Senate candidates and is also backing a top contender for speaker of the Michigan state House. Meanwhile, his endorsements for attorney general and secretary of state have been vocal in challenging the results of the 2020 election, and if elected, would be involved with validating future election results. The divides within state parties and their implications are microcosms of concerns that extend to Capitol Hill, where, according to retiring Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, Republicans are poised to have a majority in the House following this year's midterm elections. Even with those prospects, Upton told NBC News that achieving party unity could be tough. ""I don't think it's going to be this wild swing knowing that we picked up a lot of seats in the last election despite Biden winning. So, you know, what's the over/under? So that's going to make a big determination,"" Upton said. ""It will be very hard to govern for Republicans if we're under 230, knowing that we've got the [Marjorie Taylor Greene] element that's really not a part of a governing majority,"" he added, in reference to a party needing 218 members to have a majority in the House. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 737. That's the number of calls placed to abortion clinics across the country that FiveThirtyEight analyzed, finding that wait times of a week or more for an abortion are already fairly common, even in deep blue states like California and New York. And as FiveThirtyEight's Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux writes, it's even worse in states surrounding Texas, where a law that effectively bans abortions after six weeks went into effect last September. In those states, waits of two or three weeks for an abortion appointment are very common, giving us a snapshot of what's potentially in store for the rest of the country if the Supreme Court upholds Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks.

2022-04-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-define-foe-tax-debate-note/story?id=84153660,Democrats define new foe in tax debate: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein As the wealthiest current senator and the man controlling the Senate GOP's campaign arm while growing his own political war chest, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., generally doesn't need help getting the word out about his proposals. Democrats, though, want to make him and his plans famous. Midterm messaging from the White House on down this tax season has an uncommon focus on a select few planks of Scott's ""Plan to Rescue America"" that many Republicans wish he'd stop talking about. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee now has billboards up in Florida and Wisconsin with Scott's face on them to supplement radio ads, mailings and a dedicated website. The White House used the tax filing deadline to blast out a statement saying President Joe Biden wants tax cuts for the middle class ""while Congressional Republicans, led by Senator Scott, are proposing big tax increases on middle-class families."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has already gone out of his way to say the Republican agenda would not include what he called ""a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years."" Over on another wing of the GOP, former President Donald Trump's recently endorsed candidate for Senate in Ohio is among those who aren't fans either. J.D. Vance said at a recent primary debate that ""advocating for middle-class increases"" represents ""a joke for the Republican Party."" Scott has responded by saying he wouldn't raise taxes on anyone who currently pays them. Still, he is standing by his proposals to ensure that all American workers pay at least some taxes, as well as his proposal to have all federal programs expire unless they're renewed by Congress. ""My whole life has been people telling me that, you know, you're doing it the wrong way. You can't, you shouldn't be doing this,"" Scott told The Washington Post in a story published this week. Scott predicted the bipartisan backlash and has held it up as an example of ""Beltway cowardice."" But to Republicans who see plenty to run on this fall, Scott's plan so far stands out as something they're more likely to be running against. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper In an instant, a Florida federal judge upended the CDC's federal mask mandate for public transportation. U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Mizelle ruled Monday that the mask mandate ""exceeds the CDC's statutory authority."" The CDC had recently extended the mandate to May 3, but because of the ruling, the Transportation Security Administration will not enforce it. The aftermath of the decision prompted so much confusion that White House press secretary Jen Psaki couldn't immediately tell reporters if passengers boarding flights would need to wear a mask. ""The CDC recommended continuing the order for additional time -- two weeks -- to be able to assess the latest science in keeping with its responsibility to protect the American people,"" Psaki said. ""So this is obviously a disappointing decision."" A later statement from a White House official clarified that the mandate wouldn't be enforced, allowing travelers to go maskless. The Association of Flight Attendants called out the confusion that the decision and its immediate implications could cause. ""In aviation operations, it is impossible to simply flip a switch from one minute to the next,"" said union President Sara Nelson. The vacated mandate comes as the rate of new COVID-19 infections has increased by 21%. While the ruling is likely to be appealed, in the meantime it will complicate the White House's messaging on pandemic mitigation efforts. The TIP with Brittany Shepherd Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is barreling toward a huge political win, as his state's legislature meets Tuesday in a special session to discuss (and likely pass) a redistricting map proposed by DeSantis and his advisers. Last week, DeSantis put forward a map heavily skewed toward Republicans, creating 18 Republican-leaning and eight Democratic-leaning seats, which, if passed, would effectively eliminate Democrats' national redistricting advantage and threaten the slim majority hold the party has on the House of Representatives come November. DeSantis' proposal also eliminates a Black majority district in northern Florida that the governor viewed as ""racially gerrymandered"" and splits up Black voters around the Orlando area. While Republican leaders say they plan to pass whatever DeSantis presents, hundreds of protestors, including Black members of the state legislature, plan to protest outside the Florida State Capitol in Jacksonville on Tuesday as part of a Congressional Redistricting Day of Action. Speakers will claim DeSantis and his legislature are ""actively working to strip Floridians' freedoms away through deliberate and uncalled for attacks on Black voters' representation in government,"" according to a release from event organizers Equal Ground, a voting rights group. Even if DeSantis can get his map through, it's unclear if it will withstand a challenge in the courts. Only three states -- Missouri, New Hampshire and Florida -- have completed their redistricting processes. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 109. That's the number of candidates former President Trump has endorsed for governor, federal office, attorney general or secretary of state as of April 17. And as FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich and Jean Yi write, at least 78 -- more than 70% --believe the 2020 election was fraudulent, according to our research.

2022-04-20,https://abcnews.go.com/International/experts-lasting-environmental-damage-russias-invasion-ukraine/story?id=83347671,Experts predict lasting environmental damage from Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"As Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, environmental experts and activists are warning of a ripple effect of problems, including long-lasting damage to the war-ravaged country's urban, agricultural and industrial areas. Nearly two months into its invasion, Russia has begun its long-feared offensive in eastern Ukraine along the 300-mile front near Donbas, a region with a 200-year history of coal mining and heavy industry. The past seven weeks have been mired by death, displacement and the demolition of a country's landscape that will take years to repair, experts told ABC News. In addition to the direct impact on Ukrainians, consequences of the war will be felt socially, economically and environmentally. Once the conflict is over, the environment in Ukraine won't be the local government's ""No. 1 priority,"" Doug Weir, research and policy director of The Conflict and Environment Observatory, told ABC News. But, it will still be of grave concern. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine raises a host of unique and potentially profound environmental concerns for not only the people of Ukraine, but the wider region, including much of Europe,"" Carroll Muffett, president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law, told ABC News. ""Those human impacts of the war take on a lot of forms and a lot of dimensions, and many of them last long after long after the hostilities have ceased."" While there were catastrophic environmental consequences during World War I and II, conflicts during recent history provide a more detailed blueprint for the sheer amount of greenhouse gases emitted during modern wars. As a result of the global War on Terror that began in 2001, 1.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases were released, the equivalent to the annual emissions of 257 million passenger cars -- more than twice the current number of cars on the road in the U.S., according to a 2019 report released by Brown University's Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and sulfur dioxide emitted from military vehicles, and other heavy machinery, heavy deforestation occurred in Afghanistan as a result of illegal logging, especially by warlords, which then destroyed wildlife habitat, according to the report. ""We now understand the environmental dimensions of war in ways that we didn't decades ago,"" Muffett said. ""This is a particularly egregious situation, because the entire world is calling for Russia to end its its invasion right now."" These are the areas of most environmental concern, according to experts: Ukraine is a heavily industrialized country, especially in its eastern regions. It contains a large number of mines and refineries of chemical plants that produce substances such as ammonia and urea, Muffett said. Assessing the damage from attacks on industrial sites and new nuclear facilities will be among the Ukrainian government's priorities, Weir said. In addition, there are ""serious concerns"" about the forced closure of several coal mines, which are now flooding with acid mine drainage without the proper methods to pump out the water, Weir said. Those toxins are then seeping into the groundwater aquifers ""We've already seen hints at how those could play out,"" Muffett said, adding that multiple refineries in Ukraine have already been hit. ""One of the things that the lessons of the the invasion of Kuwait and the Iraq war is teach us is that strikes against facilities of these kinds pose profound risks for massive releases and really long-term damage."" Researchers are estimating that millions of people could suffer from malnutrition in the years following the invasion as a result of lack of arable land. Initial assessments show large swaths of agriculture areas affected by heavy shelling an unexploded ordinances, Weir said. Olha Boiko, a Ukrainian climate activist and coordinator for the Climate Action Network for Eastern Europe and East Asia, said she and her fellow activists still in Ukraine are worried about the state of the agricultural fields and their suitability to grow wheat after the war, which is one of the country's largest exports, she said. The plethora of military vehicles trampling over the Ukrainian border are creating an unforgiving landscape, experts said. In an effort to defend their country, Ukrainian military laid landmines over at least one beach near Odesa, according to the Conflict and Environment Observatory. Boiko also alleged that Russian forces have blown up oil exporting equipment, polluted the Black Sea and filled fields with landmines, which were found as Russian forces retreated the regions surrounding Kyiv. Fighting close to Kherson, near the southern coast of Ukraine, resulted in fires in the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve that were so large they were detectable from space and likely destroyed trees and unique habitats for birds, according to the observatory. ""There have been risks to wildlife and biodiversity we've seen that play out in Ukraine, with active battles in in insignificant wetlands,"" Muffett said. One of Russia's military strategies has been to besieging cities by firing weapons indiscriminately into them, Weir said. When Russian troops retreated the areas on the outskirts Kyiv after failing to take the capital, the devastation left in cities such as Bucha, Borodyanka and Irpin was immediately apparent. Buildings were burned or completely destroyed. Burned-out cars littered the roadways. Entire neighborhoods were reduced to rubble. The rebuilding phase is going to be a ""huge task,"" Weir said. ""From an environmental point of view, there's going to be a huge amount of work needed to properly assess these sites, locate potentially hazardous sites,"" Weir said, adding that environmental remediation process for the potentially hazardous sites can be complex and expensive. Soon after the conflict began, Russian troops took hold of the exclusion zone surrounding the Chernobyl power plant, raising concerns that an errant explosive could create another radioactive event at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986. The destroyed reactor was sealed in 2019 under a $2 billion stadium-sized metal structure, but the other three untouched reactors remain fully exposed. Within them sits a pool of 5 million pounds of spent nuclear fuel, as well as dangerous isotopes, such as uranium and plutonium. If hit, the storage facility has the potential to cause an even larger disaster than in 1986 and could prompt widespread evacuations all over Europe, Muffett said. ""The conduct of active military operations in a country with four nuclear facilities and 15 active nuclear reactors poses extraordinary risks,"" Muffett said, admonishing Russia for immediately targeting Chernobyl despite ""no legitimate military objectives associated with that site."" Russian troops have cut off power to Chernobyl in ways the site was not ""sustained for,"" and untrained Russian servicemen disturbed radioactive soil and raised dust as they moved through the area, Muffett said. ""We've seen missile strikes actually put a nuclear facility on fire,"" she said. ""And, in the immediate hours after the fire began, firefighters were unable to reach the blaze, because they were in a live fire situation. These are these are really extraordinary risks."" The conflict in Ukraine is the latest demonstration of the ""deep linkages between fossil fuels and conflict,"" Muffett said. Boiko, who left Kyiv on Feb. 24, said the connection that fossil fuels play in the current war are “obvious,” because Russia is using the funds from its oil industry to fund the conflict. ""We've seen Putin's regime look to weaponize its own natural gas and oil resources as a way to intimidate countries in Europe and beyond from coming to Ukraine to aid,"" Muffett said. ""And so, this is a fossil fueled conflict in every conceivable way."" The environmental activists who remain in Ukraine, those who aren’t helping with the immediate humanitarian relief, are bringing attention to the fact that the E.U. and U.S. have been “very dependent” on Russia’s fossil fuels for years, Boiko said. While the U.S. has imposed sanctions on all Russian oil and other energy sources, the European Union's embargo only extends to coal, and not to oil and gas. About 40% of the EU's gas comes from Russia, according to the observatory. ""This is exactly the leverage that has been used by Russia that is pressuring, basically, other countries to not impose sanctions to not do anything about this war to not help Ukraine,"" Boiko said. But Boiko said the conflict and the aftermath could eventually lead to positive steps in the fight against climate change, because the sanctions imposed on Russia lead to less less fossil fuel consumption. She said the phasing out of fossil fuels could happen more quickly, now that a major world player in oil exports has essentially been eliminated. ""The fact that this conflict is accelerating conversations within Europe about how they free themselves from reliance on fossil oil and fossil gas is also a big step forward,"" Muffett said.",10
2022-04-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russias-lone-climate-protester-continuing-mission-amid-war/story?id=84020192,Russia's 'lone climate protester' is continuing his mission amid the war in Ukraine,"Arshak Makichyan began fighting a one-man war in Russia years before troops from his country invaded Ukraine. Makichyan, 27, known as Russia's ""lone climate activist,"" took it upon himself to educate a country of about 145 million people about the dangers of global warming. Now that he has fled the country, he is continuing his mission to bring lasting environmental change to Russia. Photos from 2019 show Makichyan standing alone in Moscow's Pushkin Square, a sign propped on a wooden stick as his only companion. As a teenager, his climate journey began with a concern for the environment and what individual actions he could take to lessen his carbon blueprint on the planet, such as reducing his use of plastic, he told ABC News. Once Makichyan realized the dire situation the planet was facing, he could not believe how environmental education in Russia is virtually non-existent. ""It was so strange for me that nobody was talking about climate crisis in Russia,"" he said. ""I was getting angry at people, that they don't want to change their habits. I realized, I need to do something more."" Makichyan took it upon himself to research what was happening. When he read about Greta Thunberg and the impact her weekly climate strikes were making, he immediately felt a kindred spirit, he said. Then, beginning in March 2019, he started to conduct his own climate protests every week, the majority of which, at first, were attended only by him. What happened next was a 180-degree shift in focus. Makichyan, a prolific violinist who was studying at the Moscow Conservatory, turned down his chance to continue his music studies in Germany to stay in Moscow and intensify the climate fight. He felt he was in the right moment at the right time to make the biggest difference, he said. Makichyan's friends and family questioned his motives, he said. They didn't understand why he was taking up the cause. ""For most of my friends, I was some kind of insane person who is protesting against bad weather or something like that,"" he said. Eventually, Makichyan's fellow Russians began to notice his efforts. They would contact him on social media to ask questions about the movement. They would suggest different campaigns that they, as a group, could highlight on a weekly basis. His lone protests also got the attention of Thunberg herself, who began reaching out to Makichyan over social media in support. It was ""very difficult"" for them to organize the movement, he said, especially given Russia's strict laws prohibiting demonstrations. Makichyan would often get heckled in the streets by police officers, but the harassment intensified after April 2019, when the Moscow Times featured him in a profile. In December 2019, he was arrested during one of his Friday protests after returning from a joint speech he made with Thunberg in Madrid. Makichyan has been detained several more times since that incident, he said, and the situation only grew more precarious as officials in Moscow took notice of his demonstrations. ""Because they knew that it's a big movement internationally ... they were trying to somehow to take control over us,"" he said. Tensions grew as a result of the pandemic, Makichyan said. He was arrested twice more in the summer of 2020. By the end of 2020, his role as a climate protester was putting he and his wife Polina, a political activist, in danger, Makichyan said. Earlier this year, after Polina was detained twice while leaving her home for speaking out against the burgeoning invasion of Ukraine, the couple knew they had to leave Russia. ""You are afraid, like every hour, that you can be arrested even when you're leaving your house,"" he said. ""You have with you, all this stuff. You're like prepared to be arrested."" They married on Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine, and fled for Berlin a few weeks later, where they are now staying with friends, Makichyan said. The war has now stifled what was a growing environmental movement in Russia, Makichyan said. While Makichyan doesn't know if and when they will ever be able to return to Russia, he plans to keep fighting for awareness in his home country, no matter where he is residing, he said. Right now, he is focusing on campaigns to encourage the European Union to enact a full embargo on Russian oil and gas. ""We don't know what we will do next,"" he said. ""It's very unpredictable.""

Addressing the latest Russian sanctions at Thursday's press briefing, State Department spokesperson Ned Price -- who was also targeted -- said it was ""nothing less than an accolade to have earned the ire of a government that lies to its own people, brutalizes its neighbors, and seeks to create a world where freedom and liberty are put on the run -- and if they had their way, extinguished."" ""Similarly, it is a great honor to share that enmity with other truth-tellers,"" Price added, naming his counterparts, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby and White House press secretary Jen Psaki, ""as well as a number of journalists who have done incredible work, sharing the jarring, bloody truth of Russia's actions in Ukraine."" In a release, the Russian Foreign Ministry cited the 29 individuals sanctioned Thursday as people who ""form the Russophobic agenda."" Second gentlemen Doug Emhoff, White House chief of staff Ron Klain, ABC News Anchor George Stephanopoulos, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan were also included on the so-called ""stop list."" Last month, Russia also sanctioned President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and all 398 members of Congress from entering the country.",15
2022-04-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/french-president-macron-le-pen-face-off-televized/story?id=84185637,"French President Macron and Le Pen clash on Russia, immigration in televised debate","French President Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, his far-right rival in the presidential elections, faced off in a highly anticipated televised debate Wednesday, clashing on topics from the cost of living to Le Pen's softer stance on Russia. Macron and Le Pen took the top two spots in the preliminary round of voting earlier this month, just as they did in 2017. The debate of that year proved disastrous for Le Pen, who struggled under questioning. That year Macron ultimately won a sweeping victory in 2017, winning 66% of the vote. During the two-and-a-half hour long debate on Wednesday, Le Pen's performance under pressure was much improved. Even so, Le Pen faced a string of attacks from Macron regarding her stance on Russia. Macron criticized Le Pen's stance on the Russian annexation of Crimea, which she previously spoke out in favor of and which led her to being banned from entering Ukraine in 2017. ""Why did you do it?"" he said. ""And I say this with great gravity tonight. Because for our country, this is bad news, because you depend on the Russian power and you depend on Mr. Putin."" Macron described Russia as Le Pen's ""banker"" because of a loan her party received in 2014 from a Czech-Russian bank. Le Pen said Macron's allegations were false. Le Pen has sought to soften her National Rally party's image and ease voters' concerns about a far-right president. Macron, meanwhile, has been a notably absent figure on the campaign trail. Le Pen described herself as the ""common sense"" candidate during Wednesday night's debate. ""I truly want to make purchasing power the priority of my next five-year term, if the French have confidence in me,"" she said. Macron, known for his strong grasp of policy detail, but also a tendency to patronize, attempted to dismantle Le Pen's claims that if elected she would immediately develop France's nuclear power production and boost wages by 10%. The pair also clashed on France's relationship with the EU and Le Pen's hard-line stance on immigration, with Macron saying she would ban the right of Muslim women to wear headscarfs in public. Overall, however, there appeared to be no losers in Wednesday night's debate, with neither side landing a knockout blow ahead of the final round of voting this weekend. Polling in France has shown an upswing in Le Pen's popularity and decline in Macron's, though the French president -- who has been accused of arrogance by pundits and voters in the past -- retains a narrow lead in most reported opinion polls. The war in Ukraine has dominated the headlines this campaign cycle, and Le Pen has faced criticism in France for a softer approach to Russia and past support for President Vladimir Putin. While she has said she is in favor of the broad package of sanctions announced by the French government, she has publicly opposed restrictions on oil and gas imports from Russia, citing concerns about the rising cost of living in France that has become a critical issue in the campaign. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview with French television channel BFMTV ahead of the debate on Wednesday, went as far as to urge Le Pen to reconsider her position on Russia. ""If the candidate were to understand that she was wrong, our relationship could change,"" Zelenskyy said. While ensuring not ""to have the right to influence"" the French electoral campaign, Zelenskyy recognized that ""obviously, I have relations with Emmanuel Macron and I would not want to lose them."" Ultimately the final outcome of the election may well be decided by matters closer to home, however, with Macron's team touting his experience in power at a time of stability, while Le Pen's campaign has targeted the incumbent for, they say, being out of touch with ordinary people. The far-right candidate focused her campaign on purchasing power, a topic expected to be one of the main factors in deciding the outcome of the election. Le Pen's project, however, still centers on the fight against immigration. The National Rally candidate has presented several flagship proposals, including a bill to drastically limit immigration, the abolition of the right of soil, and restricting the routes for people to claim asylum in France. ""Fear is the only argument that the current president has to try and stay in power at all cost,"" Le Pen said in a clip posted by her campaign Tuesday. Much will depend on which candidate the supporters of far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon turn to in the final round. Mélenchon secured 22% of the first round of voting in third place, and while he publicly told his supporters not to vote for Le Pen, her populist vision may prove more enticing to a base dissatisfied with Macron, a centrist with a background in the financial sector. The debate was the first and only time voters will have a chance to see the candidates face off ahead of the final round of voting on April 24.

2022-04-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-war-plunge-millions-malnutrition-global-powers-intervene/story?id=84191131,"Ukraine war could plunge millions into malnutrition if global powers don't intervene, experts say","Russia's invasion of Ukraine will have rippling effects in populations far outside the two countries in conflict -- especially in the global food supply, experts are warning. The war in Ukraine could plunge millions into malnutrition if governments, donors and funders do not act now to prevent a shortage of the nutritional staples typically exported out of the region, according to an op-ed published Thursday in Nature. Women and children in low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable, according to the op-ed, which was authored by 10 nutrition and food supply experts from all over the world. The nutritional needs of children are high, relative to their body size, and women's nutritional needs are especially high when pregnant and breastfeeding. ""Impacts of malnutrition might be less immediately visible than those of hunger. But left untreated, they can be multi-generational and irreversible,"" the authors wrote. The biggest concern is the long-term implications malnutrition will have on children, Saskia Osendarp, executive director of the Micronutrient Forum and co-coordinator of Standing Together for Nutrition, a consortium of nutrition, economics, food and health system experts, told ABC News. This could include cognitive development, school performance, and, later in life, social capital and the increased risk of chronic diseases, she said. Nutrient deficiencies, particularly in the first 1,000 days in a child's life -- beginning from conception and lasting until the child's second birthday -- can have ""irreversible, lifelong consequences,"" Osendarp said. Existing gender inequality and power imbalances -- which are often exacerbated during crises -- result in women having less agency to direct resources toward feeding themselves and their children, the experts said. Increased prices, the reduced availability of food or difficulties accessing it will directly affect the quality of people's diets, and increased prices and trade problems will reduce the reach of humanitarian services that prevent and treat acute malnutrition, the experts said. When food prices increase, households switch to cheaper staple foods and processed foods instead of buying more nutritious -- and generally more expensive-- foods, such as fruits, vegetables, dairy meat, decreasing the quality of their diets, Osendarp, one of the authors of the op-ed, said. ""So they may be able to cope and to to keep their caloric intakes at a level to some point, but then they will suffer from nutrient deficiencies,"" she said. In addition, budgets currently devoted to improving people's nutritional status could be redirected to other, more urgent needs as a result of the war, according to the op-ed. The World Food Programme estimated that in 2022, 323 million people would be in urgent need of assistance when it comes to obtaining sufficient food and nutrients. Ukraine is considered on one of the breadbaskets of the world and is a top 10 global exporter of a number of key agricultural products, including wheat, barley, corn, sunflower oil, soybeans and poultry. An estimated 70% of the country is used for farmland -- land that is currently being devastated by assaults by Russian forces. Countries in Africa and the Middle East are particularly vulnerable, while Somalia and Benin have a total dependence on imports of mostly Russian and Ukrainian wheat, according to a rapid assessment by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Several countries rely on Russia and Ukraine for more than half their wheat imports. The number of malnourished people, especially women and children, is expected to increase as a result of record-high price hikes and disruptions in the trade of food, fertilizer and fuel, according to the paper. Cities such as Odessa and Mariupol, where about 70% of Ukraine's exports are moved from, have now been blocked due to incessant Russian shelling, according to USAID. This is not an isolated crisis, Osendarp said. Two years into the pandemic, governments are still recovering from the global economic stressors of the virus as well as climate change-related events, such as severe droughts in the Horn of Africa, as well as increased conflict in other war-torn regions, such as Ethiopia and in Yemen, she said. The authors called for the cessation of trade restrictions that affect access to nutrition and for the use of social protection measures, such as food or cash transfers, specifically tailored to address malnutrition. Protection of financial commitments already made for nutrition, both within nations and globally, and increased investment in humanitarian resources beyond the promises already made will also be necessary, they said. Without an immediate humanitarian response, it is almost guaranteed that the numbers of malnourished children and mothers will increase and will affect generations to come, Osendarp said. ""It will affect millions and millions of mothers and children, and we can just simply not afford to lose that generation,"" she said.

2022-04-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-flips-script-fighting-corporate-wokeness-note/story?id=84196728,GOP flips own script in fighting corporate 'wokeness': The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Debate this week in the Florida legislature might be confusing to anyone familiar with traditional relationships and battle lines in modern politics. Led by a governor with national ambitions, Republican after Republican has lambasted a business behemoth with more than half a century of history in the state. It's been left to Democrats to defend a giant corporation that's long been central to the Sunshine State's tourism industry. The move is expected to culminate Thursday with a vote in the Florida House to strip the Walt Disney Co. of the special governance structure it has operated under since 1967. Disney is the parent company of ABC News. Gov. Ron DeSantis' move was framed as payback for Disney's decision to oppose the new law banning gender identity and sexual orientation from being taught in lower elementary grades. But it doesn't stand alone inside a GOP whose relationship with big businesses has been rapidly evolving at least since the Trump era. Lawmakers in Texas, Georgia and elsewhere have threatened action against entities including Dell Technologies, Coca-Cola, Delta, American Airlines and Major League Baseball after they took stands against new voting restrictions. In addition to taking on Disney this week, DeSantis pointed out that Florida pension funds hold Twitter stock, threatening to hold that company's board members ""accountable"" over their handling of Elon Musk's takeover proposal. It's a far cry from the days when then-Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, cheerfully bought radio ads in blue states inviting companies to move to his business-friendly state. Some Democrats are trying to take advantage of the flipped GOP script; Gov. Jared Polis, D-Colo., tweeted this week that his state would welcome Disney and Twitter if they feel attacked by ""Florida's authoritarian socialist attacks on the private sector."" Some Republicans argue that their hands have been forced by ""wokeness"" at big companies that leave them weighing in on issues they know little about. Still, even counterpunching has consequences for how parties define themselves through hot-button debates and beyond. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The power of an endorsement from former President Donald Trump wasn't enough to keep a former Trump administration official on the ballot in a Tennessee congressional race. Morgan Ortagus, who served as a State Department spokesperson during the Trump presidency, was kicked off the GOP primary ballot for Tennessee's 5th Congressional District following a vote by the party's executive committee, which said Ortagus hadn't voted in enough previous state primaries. Ortagus had only recently moved to the state. Two other candidates were also disqualified. ""I'm a bonafide Republican by their standards, and frankly, by any metric,"" Ortagus said in a statement blaming establishment Republicans for cutting her congressional bid short. ""I'm further disappointed that the party insiders at the Tennessee Republican Party do not seem to share my commitment to President Trump's America First policies. As I have said all along, I believe that voters in Middle Tennessee should pick their representative - not establishment party insiders."" It comes as another Trump-backed candidate, incumbent Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, has been put on the defensive as she prepares to testify under oath in a Georgia courtroom Friday. A legal challenge aiming to keep her name from appearing on the ballot was filed by a group of voters who cite the disqualification clause of the 14th Amendment that bars anyone who has taken the oath of office and has ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding federal office. Both are signals that a Trump endorsement doesn't guarantee smooth sailing to the general election. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Democratic Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow is in the national spotlight after being baselessly accused of aiming to ""groom and sexualize kindergartners"" in a recent fundraising email sent out by fellow state senator, Republican Lana Theis. The fallout coincides with politically charged debates over schooling emerging in state legislatures across the country. Although the two lawmakers represent different areas of the state and are not opponents on the campaign trail, Theis is facing a primary challenger in her district and appears to be leaning into extreme rhetoric to fend off the opposition. As reported by the Detroit Free Press, her campaign email referring to McMorrow claimed ""children are under assault in our schools"" and that ""progressive mobs"" are ""trying to steal our children's innocence."" In a fiery floor speech delivered earlier this week, McMorrow defended herself. She described initially wondering why Theis decided to invoke her name, before ultimately concluding, ""I am the biggest threat to your hollow, hateful scheme. Because you can't claim that you are targeting marginalized kids in the name of 'parental rights' if another parent is standing up to say 'no.'"" ""So, who am I? I am a straight, white, Christian, married, suburban mom who knows that the very notion that learning about slavery or redlining or systemic racism means that children are being taught to feel bad or hate themselves because they are white is absolute nonsense,"" McMorrow said. ""We are not responsible for the past. We also cannot change the past. We can't pretend that it didn't happen, or deny people their very right to exist,"" she added. The heated situation unfolded against a backdrop of broader political developments in Michigan as the state Republican party looks to nominate candidates for a slate of statewide offices this weekend. The nominating process is already exposing intraparty fractures, and it remains to be seen if the kind of rhetoric espoused by Theis will be supported more widely by candidates in executive positions as the campaign season heats up. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 13. That's the number of important Republican Senate primaries FiveThirtyEight is keeping a close eye on as we gear up for the start of the primary season. With President Joe Biden's approval rating mired in the low 40s and the GOP already ahead in generic ballot polling, Republicans need to pick up just one seat to capture control of the Senate. And as FiveThirtyEight's Geoffrey Skelley writes, the GOP already has its sights set on a number of Senate races, ranging from key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia to even more red-leaning states like Ohio, where the Republican nominee will help determine the direction of the party.

2022-04-22,https://abcnews.go.com/US/youth-led-climate-change-lawsuits-increasing-country/story?id=84172785,Youth-led climate change lawsuits are increasing across the country,"Ava Lazar made her first climate documentary at age 11. ""When I was little, my older sister was very concerned about climate change, and I didn't really know what it was,” said Lazar. “But she was so worried and so afraid and had so much anxiety that transferred over to me and I started worrying about it."" Six years after making that film, Lazar is now part of a group suing the state of Virginia for its alleged part in causing the nation's climate crisis. The case is just one in a series of lawsuits nationwide where youth are going to the courts to fight climate change. ""A lot of us are under 18. I'm only 17 years old. I don't really have a voice except to through the court,"" said Ava. ""Just the realization that, oh, it's possible for me to sue the Commonwealth of Virginia. And not only that, but it's happening in other states too was really reassuring."" While the Virginia case, filed in February, is in its infancy, others are beginning to break through the legal armor. Officials in the Held v. State of Montana lawsuit have a trial set to start on Feb. 6, 2023, the first case of its kind to receive a court date in the United States. This comes after the state of Montana had its motion to dismiss the case rejected by a district court judge. In Montana, youth claim that state lawmakers have consistently prioritized fossil fuel infrastructure and profits to the detriment of their future. They argue that the state's actions have violated their constitutional right to a healthy and safe environment. ""As a parent, you know, having our kids basically fix what we have screwed up, in the true way that it can happen is a real point of pride for us,” said Sarah Busse, the parent of two Montana youth plaintiffs. “But also a point of like, we messed up, so they're fixing it?"" Nationwide, youth activists say they see the dire consequences of climate change and know that waiting for government action isn't good enough. ""Youth often feel obligated to do this because of the pure fact that we are young and we need this protection,"" said Grace Gibson-Snyder, an 18-year-old plaintiff in the Montana case. Growing up in Missoula, Montana, Gibson-Snyder developed a connection to the environment that inspired her to get involved. Lander and Badge Busse, brothers from Kalispell, Montana, say they have already experienced the consequences of climate change. They've had to stay inside at school due to wildfire smoke and seen their favorite hobbies, like skiing, change right before their eyes. ""I was sitting on the chairlift with my coach and we were talking about how when he has his kids, or when I have my kids, they're not going to be able to ski on like actual snow … which kind of broke my heart because I love skiing,"" said 14-year-old Badge Busse. He added, ""I would like to share it with my kids and their kids. I feel like that's not gonna happen."" As plaintiffs in the Montana case, they hope to be a part of a significant push nationwide toward legal remedies, regardless of the outcome of their case. ""We're not expecting to fix all of Montana's pollution issues immediately or anything like that. But we are definitely hoping to start a catalyst for hopefully these things,"" said Lander Busse. With two youth cases already filed this year and two more expected in the summer, the movement is gaining steam. Our Children's Trust, the Oregon-based firm responsible for filing many of these cases, has an additional lawsuit ongoing in Utah as well as a federal case, Juliana v. United States. The Juliana case was dismissed by a federal court, which said the remedy the plaintiffs sought was beyond the scope of the law cited, adding that the plaintiffs’ case ""must be made to the political branches or to the electorate at large."" In the aftermath of that ruling, the firm has filed an amended complaint and hopes to receive a trial in the case later this year or early next. Achieving that could be vital in its battle to start turning symbolic victories into legal ones. ""I think all of these cases are winnable if we can get to trial. And it's one reason why I'm really excited about our Montana state case,"" said Julia Olson, the executive director and chief legal counsel at Our Children's Trust. The Montana state constitution states explicitly that ""the state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations,"" a clause that the plaintiffs believe gives them the key to unlocking a legal victory. Whether or not that will be attained waits to be seen. In its motion to dismiss, the state of Montana argued that the injuries the plaintiffs were claiming were ""not caused by the statutes they seek to invalidate."" ""These lawsuits have been very successful in bringing public attention to the climate crisis, and in obtaining court decisions affirming the nature of the problem. So far they haven't led to binding orders that compel action. Perhaps the Montana case will be the first,"" said Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. Young Americans looking to pursue these lawsuits often get in touch with Our Children’s Trust through a network of youth environmental organizations. At that point, the two sides have a conversation about whether or not the individual would be a good fit to join a case. Our Children's Trust and the youth plaintiffs have teamed up to argue that other state constitutions, and that of the United States, provide the legal backing they need to win cases across the country. Until they get their day in court, it's a matter of showing others who aren't old enough to vote that they shouldn't let that stop them from having their voices heard. Lander Busse doesn't see anything unique about who he is and what he and his brother have become a part of: ""We're just some kids from northwest Montana who wanted to do something and got given an opportunity. That [other kids] should be able to make a difference as well."" The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, one of the defendants in the Montana case, said it would not comment on ongoing litigation when contacted by ABC News. In Virginia, the defendants pleaded ""sovereign Immunity,"" which shields states from liability for alleged wrongdoing. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality declined to comment on the case. All other defendants from the Montana and Virginia cases did not return ABC News' request for comment.",7
2022-04-22,https://abcnews.go.com/US/eco-anxiety-teenagers-growing/story?id=84244829,Eco-anxiety among teenagers is growing,"This story originally appeared in Teen Vogue. It's republished here with permission. There are so many things to consider when choosing a college: class size, cost, the strength of the swim team or theater program, for example. And for a growing number of high schoolers, climate change also ranks high on their list of considerations. “I’m honestly super scared about moving to New Orleans for college,” says Katherine Hudson, an 18-year-old from Knoxville, Tennessee. “While I’m excited because I love Louisiana, I’m also scared of a Katrina-esque situation happening again.” For teens everywhere, this is the reality as they come of age during a time of climate crisis. In a recent 10-country survey of 10,000 young people ages 16 to 25 published in The Lancet, 45% of respondents said their feelings about climate change had “negatively affected their daily life and functioning.” “Climate anxiety is more intense for teenagers, [especially] as they transition from home to college, because they have internalized the urgency of the crisis,” says Heather White, author of One Green Thing: Discover Your Hidden Power to Help Save the Planet. For Earth Week, Teen Vogue wanted to hear from U.S. high school students about how climate change concerns show up in your lives and how you cope with these stressors. Have you lived through extreme weather events? Do you talk to people about how they experience this crisis in their lives? Are you taught about it in school? Grappling with these anxieties can feel overwhelming and frustrating, but many students say talking to loved ones or getting engaged in school or community organizing has helped. Hope is never lost. As climate activist Mitzi Jonelle Tan wrote in Teen Vogue, “Every second counts; every fraction of a degree [of warming] matters.” We’ve shared a selection of remarks from students below, along with videos created by ABC News in which two respondents are interviewed. Editor’s note: These responses have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Hometown: Omaha — College town: Boston My aunt works for the Nebraska chapter of the Nature Conservancy, so we are constantly discussing legislation and local concern regarding climate change. In the past couple of years, my home state has experienced drastic flooding due to climate change, the creek behind my house overflowing into the prairie. Because Nebraska relies largely on agriculture, the severe swings in temperature and drastic droughts followed by floods have harmed our crops and farmers. In Boston, the frequent nor'easters dump feet of snow, which then [often] melt in unusually warm temperatures the following week. This may sound a little naive, but I purposely didn't apply to any colleges on the West Coast. I thought to myself, California is going to fall into the ocean in 50 years or some anyway, and I don't want to get attached to a place I might lose. My concern for the environment's future definitely impacted my passion for journalism. I wholeheartedly believe that investigating and elevating diverse voices are forms of advocacy that make a difference. Sonoma, California Many teens agree that it is difficult to imagine having kids when we are older, because it seems cruel to have children when we know they will experience even more brutal impacts of climate change than our generation will. At my school, we are lucky to have a full-time sustainability curriculum coordinator who is provided [with] resources to incorporate climate education into science and social studies courses. Students are also given the opportunity to become climate advocates and [get] time during our school week to participate in activism. Tappan, New York I have asthma, so pollution affects my lungs greatly. [Climate change] causes me to look into the future more than living in the present. El Paso Climate change is very intersectional, from food to women's rights. It disproportionally affects poorer communities, especially on the border. Growing up on the Frontera — the U.S-Mexico border — we experience water constraints, weather influxes, and air pollution, which make El Paso the fourth worst in air quality among [midsize] cities. A big concern of mine is fast fashion and waste. Stores like Shein and H&M are very popular among my peers and some of us can't get enough. The problem is that we only wear these pieces once or twice and then we throw them away, where they occupy landfills. I encourage my friends and classmates to buy less and avoid brands that make clothes unethically. Knoxville, Tennessee Most of my family lives in southwestern Louisiana, which is almost routinely [devastated] by hurricanes that are made worse by climate change. Every day, the Louisiana coastline loses football fields worth of land due to the ever-encroaching Gulf [of Mexico]. Though [we have] lived in what is now Louisiana for over 300 years, my family may have to leave our ancestral homeland in favor of places that are safer. I’ve been lucky to take a class about current issues where we discussed climate change, with specific focus on how it impacts marginalized communities in places like Louisiana and Mississippi. Plus, I have a close friend at Tulane who has recommended books about why so many people directly impacted by climate change don’t believe in it. However, my family won’t talk about it. They don’t say it, but I think they’re afraid of losing Louisiana, or just want to be completely detached from it. I occasionally talk with my therapist about my climate anxiety.… I think just having someone to combat the scared voice in my head can help. Queens, New York I have anxiety and I have spoken to my therapist about how I feel, that I am running out of time for my future because the world is rapidly decaying. I found my therapist through my school, [thanks to] a program implemented by the NYC Department of Education. My therapist has helped me by finding things that can distract me when I start thinking about this topic, such as journaling or watching a show I really like. Tracy, California My family and I moved away from the Bay Area about a year ago, and… [moving to] an area untouched by skyscrapers and car traffic has helped our mental and physical health.… For me, the biggest changes have been my appreciation of nature. For the first time in my life, I am able to see the stars every night, and see more wildlife — jackrabbits, sheep, cows. When I talk about climate with my family, it's usually how is this issue going to affect our beloved forests and natural habitats in California. It makes me feel really worried that it looks like no one is doing anything to stop this from happening — there is no immediate action being taken by world leaders [to] ensure significant progress will be made. There are international deals like the Paris Agreement that promise change by 2050, but anything could happen in 28 years. I know that now more than ever. Countries could fall under a new administration (like Russia's invasion of Ukraine); another pandemic could occur. No part of the world is exempt from climate change — not even my own home, which is the most terrifying realization I've had. All of my personal belongings, family photo albums, heirlooms, the first home my parents purchased [after] we immigrated to the U.S. could also vanish. People don't realize how closely our existence intertwines with the natural world until something precious to them is at stake. Montclair, New Jersey Sometimes it comes up as a joke. I’ll be walking home and note that it’s 50 degrees colder than it was the day before, and blame it on climate change. We don’t learn a lot about climate change in school. The only class I talk about the environment in is biology, and it’s more in general than in reference to current events. The only events to address climate change are student-run events. Healdsburg, California As I’ve learned more about the climate crisis, I’ve moved toward the idea of environmental law. That being said, I’ve also come to understand the amount of pollution and destruction coming from big companies.… One of my greatest fears is that I will become an environmental lawyer and be so weighed down by student loan debt that I default to [taking] the only well-paying job I can find, working with an oil company or some other position that would work against stopping climate change. Evanston, Illinois I have the privilege not to live in a neighborhood polluted by toxic fumes, nor do I worry about my parents' ability to stock our fridge. For this I am very grateful. Yet many in my community are plagued by food apartheid, instances of environmental racism, and an increased sense of vulnerability in line with each new U.N. climate report. At my high school of 4,000 students… teachers don't have the resources to facilitate meaningful discussions about climate change, and our administration doesn't hold the space necessary for students to voice how they feel about the crisis they are set to inherit. In conversations with family and in other adult-dominated spaces, older folx tend to become extremely defensive when addressing what is at the root of the climate crisis. When we begin to unpack how colonialism, white supremacy, capitalism, and greed are at the core of where we are today, adults tend to write off young people as naive and move on. Many of the fears I face regarding the climate crisis I share with fellow organizers, so I have been lucky enough to have that as my main space for coping. New York City I often worry that the next decade is the point of no return for our planet, and I'd like to live out my dream of becoming a proud parent without worrying about the world being habitable for my child.… The fact is, major corporations are causing the most carbon emissions, and the richest people on the planet aren't doing everything they can to reverse this damage. One of my main factors [for]/concerns about what college I commit to is how much money they're divesting from fossil fuels. Abington, Massachusetts Honestly, sometimes it's difficult to not feel burned out or overwhelmed talking about climate change. Especially when the news is near always bad, I get stressed and despondent thinking about how bad the world will look when I am an adult, [and] how it will look for the generations that come after. I want to make a change, but it is hard to feel as though a person can make a difference when some of the main sources of pollution are from industrial factories or [due to] lax regulations, not personal choices. Metairie, Louisiana Hurricane Ida shut my school down for a month. COVID-related school closings that forced us to become virtual learners for a year had already affected my social relationships, but having a hurricane wreck my hopes for a more “normal” school year had a large impact on me. I’ve noticed that many people's social anxiety has worsened. Additionally, many school districts were caught off guard and there was so much confusion after the storm, with us [left] wondering how and when our schools would open again…. It is hard for me not to feel dread on June 1, as hurricane season approaches. At my school, our holiday breaks and summer have been drastically cut short to meet educational time standards, and we have less time to cover material for our second-semester classes.… Sometimes we talk about how it's almost as if you’ve dodged the bullet with one storm, but you are completely unsure how nature will react next. Since I was a little girl, I [have been] told that climate change is a major issue, but seeing the scattered shingles, damaged roofs, and fallen trees with my own eyes has added depth to my perception of the issue. Since then, I have been making more efforts to support climate change action... I created an app to help teens deal with the combined stressors of COVID and the storm, which went on to win my district's Congressional App Challenge. I also [published] a letter to the editor in The New Orleans Advocate about school districts developing a long-term plan for [coping with] hurricanes to lessen families' confusion and academic anxiety. Lake Bluff, Illinois I've had the unfortunate experience of actually receiving physical scarring, although minor, from a climate change-induced forest fire near Palm Springs, California, in 2018, which was one of the main reasons I got into climate activism in the first place. Around the beginning of my senior year, 2021, I went to the O'koon Psychology Group, which did a comprehensive assessment of my mental health and determined that I had anxiety stemming primarily from the fear of the future, along with other general anxiety disorders. This went down the path [leading] me to being medically diagnosed with anxiety by my pediatrician. I found consolation in my freshman biology teacher, who allowed me to express my frustration, worry, and fear about the future. Sammamish, Washington I am lucky to live in an affluent area with good infrastructure, where I can take basic resources, and some luxuries, for granted. However, I’m more than aware that others do not have this privilege, and news headlines of natural disasters, unexpected weather patterns, and other climate crises displacing people of lower socioeconomic status affirm the dire situation. Additionally, last summer I was staying in Pullman, Washington, for a research internship, and the temperatures hit record highs, in the 110s. With air-conditioning units and fans sold out, and the very poor air quality making open windows impossible, it was difficult to get comfortable. It became quite scary when I started receiving amber alerts for fires and evacuation alerts in the nearby counties, and when the apartment complex a street down from mine actually burned down. As elected student government president, I am initiating discussions with our administrators on topics [such as] cafeteria waste, green building features, and high morning traffic with too many idle cars to count. With my team at Sustainability Ambassadors, a local nonprofit, I have developed a video curriculum that is being implemented into the Lake Washington School District biology program. I have also rallied my local government to create an environmental board, where I am now serving a two-year term to advise the Issaquah City Council on relevant policies from the angle of sustainability. I believe that even those who do not see addressing climate change as a personal duty will encounter a necessity to join the fight in the next few decades. Lexington, Massachusetts It's a pretty scary time to be a young person, as we already see what's to come. Even today, where the science is undeniable, government officials are still voting down legislation that will literally save lives. Talking to people openly and honestly is the best way to help them understand the gravity of the situation — we can only change hearts and minds when we have open discussions. While it's important to be realistic, it's so important to emphasize the hope and opportunity that lies in our reach. I've been an organizer with the Sunrise Movement for about a year and a half now, first with my local hub, and later, with the national phone-banking team to help with the 2020 Georgia runoffs. My friends and I started a program at my local library [to] educate elementary school [students] on sustainability and the environment, and seeing young kids so enthusiastic about it gives me even more reason to fight for our future. Now I'm a co-lead of the Victory Squad Support Team and 2022 National Phone-banking Team of Sunrise. I put a lot of myself into this work because I know that it is me — and so many other people just like me — who are going to pay for [climate damage] in the future. Santa Rosa, California I lost my home in the Tubbs Firestorm in 2017. I was 12 years old. I lost all of my belongings, the home I was raised in, and the trees, flowers, and wildlife that surrounded me through all of those years. I have spoken to therapists about my experience and done a lot of my own research about the mental health effects of the climate crisis. It has been helpful, but the harsh reality is that anxiety surrounding our future isn't irrational; it's a very real response to a present threat to our future. Even in my experience, after losing my home, I've had to evacuate multiple times [due to] wildfire threats. This makes it incredibly important to address mental health and climate change hand in hand, so that we can increase the resources for people to process their fears as we increase the awareness of climate urgency. I'm lucky enough to be part of a community that directly acknowledges this crisis. The thing that stands out to me the most in these conversations is the importance of climate education.… [It] is so important for young people to be able to collaborate with and be held and supported by adults as they step into the huge responsibility of being a climate advocate. I co-lead a nonpartisan, grassroots, nonprofit organization called Schools for Climate Action, which has a mission of empowering school boards to work directly with Congress to act on climate and declare this crisis a generational justice issue.… My most recent project has been coauthoring a bill that was recently introduced to the House of Representatives by Rep. Mike Thompson as H.Res975 - Expressing the Mental Health Impacts of Climate-Related Disasters on Youth. Santa Rosa, California Because of climate change, I'm now looking at going into politics, not because I want to, but because I feel I need to in order to enact the necessary change to ensure a future for myself and the generations ahead. I've never desired to be a politician, but I've learned that if politicians aren't going to listen to the youth, then the youth need to step up and fill their shoes.",25
2022-04-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jan-fallout-plays-split-screens-split-realities-note/story?id=84226637,Jan. 6 fallout plays across split screens and split realities: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Over the next 48 hours, there’s a version of political reality set to play out at a county fairgrounds in Ohio and in a convention center in Michigan. There’s another reality entirely driving events in a courtroom in Georgia and hearing rooms in Washington over the coming days and weeks. And then there’s the private and public conversations House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is going to face with audio released Thursday night revealing that he did tell colleagues he would recommend that former President Donald Trump resign after all. Friday brings a notable scene: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., will testify in person at a hearing scheduled to determine whether she’s eligible to run for Congress. It marks the first time a member of Congress accused of being involved with the riot at the Capitol will speak under oath about the events of Jan. 6, 2021. That comes amid news that the House Jan. 6 committee is set to speak with Donald Trump Jr. in the coming days as that panel moves toward wrapping up its interviews in advance of public hearings later this spring. That work got more interesting when New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns released audio of McCarthy late Thursday that blows up his previous denials. Former President Donald Trump himself, meanwhile, will headline a rally Saturday in advance of the May 3 Ohio primaries. Trump will hype his new choice for the Senate race there -- though, notably, several other major candidates also falsely claim that the election was stolen. That figures to be a theme of the Michigan Republican Convention this weekend. State GOP delegates will choose nominees for attorney general and secretary of state from a field that includes several who supported overturning the last election -- and who might be in a position to actually do what Trump wanted done in 2024 or beyond. Those candidates will be selected at the DeVos Place convention center in Grand Rapids -- a building named for the husband of a Trump Cabinet secretary who resigned because of how Trump handled Jan. 6. It’s also happening in a state where Sen. Mitt Romney’s father was considered an iconic Republican governor. The Republican Party has moved quite a bit since the days of either Romney -- and even from where it looked like it was going last Jan. 6. But other events continue to make it impossible to ignore the multi-layered legacy of the attacks at the Capitol. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema Florida’s lengthy and contentious redistricting process crossed its final hurdle on Thursday with the state legislature’s passage of a Republican-favoring map backed by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis. As ABC News’ Brittany Shepherd and Hannah Demissie report, DeSantis’ map would wipe out any gains by Democrats made during the national redistricting process by adding four Republican-leaning seats and eliminating three highly competitive seats from the previous map. Those changes would leave the state with 18 Republican-leaning and eight Democrat-leaning seats, thereby threatening the already thin majority Democrats hold on the House of Representatives. The map also splits up Black voters by slashing the number of Black-majority districts in half from four to two and overhauls Florida's 5th District, which is represented by Rep. Al Lawson, a Black Democrat. Although DeSantis may be able to claim a political victory for now, the celebration may be short-lived. Already, grassroots and voting rights advocates are making plans to organize against the using the new map, and any upcoming legal challenges could prevent it from being implemented this year. ""Given the extent to which the new congressional map in Florida is likely to diminish the voices in government of communities of color, and the blatant disregard the governor and state legislature have shown for creating equal representation for communities of color, it is vital that we hold them accountable and prevent these maps from taking effect,"" said Jack Genberg, senior staff attorney for voting rights with the Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund. Even so, the Florida governor's political maneuverings are setting him up for a high-profile presence on the national conservative stage. DeSantis -- who is thought to be a possible 2024 presidential contender -- appears to be flexing his partisan muscle by hitting the road to stump for Nevada GOP Senate hopeful Adam Laxalt next week. Laxalt has already been endorsed by another influential Republican -- former President Donald Trump. The TIP with Hannah Demissie Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. will be under a political microscope Friday morning when she testifies in Atlanta, Georgia, about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Greene is one of several elected officials whose reelection is being challenged by voters under the disqualification clause of the 14th Amendment. Other elected officials facing similar challenges include Reps. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. and Andy Biggs R-Ariz. Enacted shortly after the Civil War, the disqualification clause bars any person from holding federal office who has previously taken an oath to protect the Constitution -- including a member of Congress -- and has ""engaged in insurrection"" against the United States or ""given aid or comfort"" to its ""enemies."" The hearing has grabbed the attention of many, including Trump, who released a statement falsely accusing Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of working with Democrats to keep Greene off the ballot. Greene maintains her innocence, telling ABC News affiliate WTVC earlier this week that she is also a “victim” of the Capitol riot. ""I was evacuated along with all the members of Congress who were in the House chamber because we were working. We were doing the electoral count, which is our job; that's nothing illegal."" NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 18. That’s the number of Republican-leaning seats on Florida’s soon-to-be congressional map, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric. It marks a gain of four Republican-leaning seats from the old map and, as FiveThirtyEight’s Nathaniel Rakich writes, it’s one of the most biased maps we’ve seen passed this redistricting cycle.

2022-04-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/daughters-shock-trip-buy-bread-ends-fathers-life/story?id=84219189,A daughter's shock as a trip to buy bread ends her father's life in Ukraine,"Editor's note: This story contains graphic images that may be disturbing. Victor Gubarev stepped out to buy bread when he was killed by a fragment from a shell that landed in front of his apartment block in Kharkiv on Monday, minutes before his daughter arrived to find an ambulance crew standing over his body. Crew members had to hold Yana Bachek back as they carried her father's body away following the blasts that hit the Soviet-era apartment complex where they live. An English teacher, she said she had been preparing an online lesson in the kitchen of her one-bedroom apartment, close by her parents' flat, when the shelling started. ""I remember just the explosion,"" she said. ""I just returned from shopping and crazy explosions, noise."" Immediately her mother, Lyubov, called, voice trembling, and said her father had gone to buy bread and was still outside. Her partner, Yevgeniy, stopped her from rushing out straight away in case there were follow-up strikes, as there were, seconds later. ""I began to call him and there was no answer,"" she said. When she pulled on her coat and went out a few minutes later, her anguished reaction to the sight of her father's body was caught by photographers who had arrived with the ambulances, shortly after the blasts. ""I am sorry. I want to forget it. The picture. The one picture I saw him,"" Bachek said. Along with the mass graves of Bucha near Kyiv or the destruction of the port city of Mariupol, the indiscriminate shelling of cities like Kharkiv has come to symbolize what the Kremlin has called its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. Russia says its incursion is intended to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext for war. Russia denies targeting civilians and rejects what Ukraine says is evidence of atrocities, saying Ukraine has staged them to undermine peace talks. Family photos Gubarev's death was one of at least three on Monday in Kharkiv, which has been subjected to near-daily bombardment since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24. A former driver who started working at the age of 16 and rose to become a vehicle fleet manager for the oil company Gazprom, the 79-year-old had been reluctant to leave because of health problems he and his wife suffered. Sitting in her kitchen, occasionally fighting back tears, Bachek, their only child, shared family photos showing her father with an Elvis-style quiff on holidays by the Black Sea, beaming at Lyubov or swinging his granddaughter playfully in a shopping bag. She described growing up in a middle-class family without a lot of money in late Soviet Ukraine, studying hard at school with her mother, a piano teacher who enjoyed concerts and theatre and her father who liked tinkering with cars and joking around with his daughter. ""In his normal life, even in war, he tried to smile, to joke, to support us. He said to us: 'You are my girls, my heroes,'"" she said. Now she waits until her father can be buried but here too the war has imposed an additional agony as the sheer number of dead has grown and normal funerals have become impossible. ""It's not like we used to do -- cemetery, grave, a special place where I can be separate from other people, to be calm, to speak, to cry, to put out the Easter cake,"" she said, referring to a Ukrainian memorial custom. While the family waits for news, the loaf of bread Gubarev went out to buy remains, still in its plastic wrapper, on a table in the hallway, where she touches it briefly each time she goes to the door. ""The bread was in blood,"" she said. ""Now I can't keep it in my hands, but I want to because it is a piece of my dad. It was the last thing he had in his hands.""",22
2022-04-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/earth-day-2022-save-polar-bears-protecting-mothers/story?id=83864945,"Earth Day 2022: Save polar bears by protecting mothers and cubs, experts say","The ability for polar bears to survive in coming decades is becoming more uncertain as global warming continues to melt the Arctic at unprecedented rates, experts warn. Now, biologists and conservationists determined to save the species have zeroed in on a plan to increase populations: focus on the survival of mothers and cubs, who find themselves increasingly vulnerable to dwindling habitat and food sources, they tell ABC News. The ""fundamental"" key to the survival of polar bears is the availability of sea ice cover, Louise Archer, a researcher at the University of Toronto Scarborough's Department of Biological Sciences, told ABC News. The Arctic is currently warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, according to the Arctic Report Card published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in December, leaving the Arctic in a ""dramatically different state,"" with a substantial decline since 1979. It takes an incredible amount of energy for mothers to raise their cubs, but ironically they are not the most efficient hunters, Archer said. They rely on the sea ice as a platform from which to access marine mammals from. ""So having access to sea ice is extremely important to ensure the survival of adults, but also, so that females can support the survival of their cubs,"" Archer said. One of the ""biggest challenges"" from global warming is bears will have to respond to sea ice conditions, or the lack thereof, that have never been experienced in the Arctic before, she said. Polar bear mothers, especially, need nutrients because they lactate for up to two-and-a-half years, the entire time ""the cubs are taking in energy from their moms,"" Archer said. When the cubs are born in the den, they only weigh about a pound or two, she said. But their mother has to raise them to about 10 to 20 pounds before she can go out onto the sea ice and hunt again. All the months in hibernation are not spent sleeping. The mother is nursing, grooming the cubs and maintaining the den, which involves scratching the ceiling and walls with her claws to allow airflow. Otherwise, the den would get completely iced over, and no oxygen would be able to get in, Geoff York, senior director of conservation group Polar Bears International, told ABC News. The mothers and cubs begin to emerge from their dens after four to eight months of not eating or drinking. The priority is to build up fat stores before the sea ice begins to melt in the summer. But if the sea ice is melting sooner, that's less time for the mothers to hunt -- and to teach her children to do so -- and less time to regain the fat stores they lost while fasting and lactating in the den. ""Anything that sort of interrupts that sequence is potentially fatal to the reproductive attempt of the female,"" Andrew Derocher, a professor of biological science at the University of Alberta, told ABC News. ""It's a chain of events that is incredibly sensitive to things like sea ice break up in the springtime -- and that's one of the key metrics that we monitor, is when is the ice breaking out."" Derocher believes the mother-cub relationship is so integral is because it is an ""incredible part of their life history."" After they leave the den, the mothers have an incredible task of teaching the cubs to swim, hunt and one day survive on their own. It is that relationship that provides a ""powerful emotion and a very forceful narrative"" for Disney's new film ""Polar Bear,"" which follows a mother with her cubs as they embark on that journey, Alastair Fothergill, one of the directors of the film, told ABC News. In the first years of a polar bear's life, they are ""extraordinarily dependent on their mother,"" said Fothergill, who has been filming in the Arctic for more than 25 years. The biggest change Fothergill has witnessed as a result of the ice melting is the new tricks mothers are teaching their cubs, such as climbing cliffs to get bird eggs and chicks, as well as learning to hunt walrus calves -- a dangerous feat, as the mother walruses defend their young with their tusks. Previously, seals served as their primary source of food. Experts have found that the health of a polar bear population can be determined by ""three good winters,"" York said. Last year, he witnessed a mother with triplet cubs in the Western Hudson Bay of Canada -- an increasingly rare sight in a population that has declined 30% in the last 40 years. ""That's kind of what polar bears need,"" he said. ""They need three good years to bring cubs from birth to sub adulthood and get them out of the sub population."" One of the most profound phases of the mother-cub relationship is the moment the mother must leave her cubs, a ""really risky and dangerous time for the polar bear, "" said. ""We say in the narrative that she knew she had taught her cubs everything she could, which is true,"" he said. ""But at the same time, she has to move on. She has to go and have another set of cubs."" Researchers have found that in more solitary populations of polar bears that have had less access to sea ice, the bears are forced to fast for longer periods of time, Archer said. This has led to a decline of body condition, the decline in the survival of colds and the decline in the overall population abundance, she added. The bears who live in the most southern regions are more at risk, and there could very well be a time when the subpopulations in the Arctic are the only ones to persist, Archer said. Places like Wrangel Island off of Russia offer a place for polar bears to retreat during times of significant ice loss, where they have access to walrus, York said. Given the current climate change conditions, the ability for polar bears to feed and survive will become increasingly precarious -- unless they can adapt and learn how to survive on terrestrial land, Archer hypothesized. ""Once the ice is inaccessible to bears, survival of bears is severely compromised,"" she said. When Derocher published a paper in 1993 about the potential effects of warming on polar bears, he did not think he would see those effects within his lifetime, he said. ""We thought this is something for future generations far away,"" he said. ""And what has surprised me is that the changes have been manifest in the populations so much sooner than we anticipated."" It will be human activity and the ability for it to properly mitigate climate change that will ultimately determine the chances for polar bears to survive, York said. They are currently listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species ""That's directly tied to actions we may or may not take to curb our greenhouse gas reductions,"" he said.

2022-04-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/capable-winning-ukrainian-parliament-member/story?id=84265703,"'We are capable of winning,' says Ukrainian parliament member","As the people of Ukraine continue to defend against a Russian onslaught, Yevheniia Kravchuk, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, says the nation is still looking for three main things from the United States: heavy weapons, sanctions on Russia and financial aid. ""We need more weapons... Because right now Russians are putting artillery, tanks, everything they have, and also they bombed civilians to terrorize the whole country,"" Kravchuk told ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz. ""As long as we're getting more than we burn every day, we are capable of winning and we're capable of kicking Russians out because that's the way how to end this -- to end this war."" Last week, President Joe Biden announced another $800 million to aid Ukrainian military efforts in the Donbas region and said he will send a supplemental budget request to Congress to keep supporting the nation. The new aid includes artillery weapons, anti-air missiles and helicopters. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also announced Thursday the department would provide an additional $500 million in financial aid. Kravchuk, a member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's party in the nation's parliament, said it's important that the U.S. provide the offensive weapons ""because it's sort of a green light to other countries in Europe, for example, to give these weapons as well."" Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Russia had taken the eastern city of Mariupol, a claim Ukrainians have pushed back on with 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers holed up in a steel plant as they continue to fight. There have also been reports of 120,000 civilians still trapped in the besieged city. Last week, just four buses and a few private vehicles were able to escape the city -- the first to leave in about two weeks. ""Is there any chance for [a] humanitarian corridor at this point?"" Raddatz asked. ""Yesterday Russians did not let the humanitarian corridor to work,"" Kravchuk said. ""Hundreds of people were gathered at one point to go out of Mariupol and Russian soldiers just came and said no, we're not allowing this to happen."" She said Russian soldiers are making ""forcible deportations"" out of Ukraine to Vladivostok, a Russian city thousands of miles away. ""And we do not know how to bring them back to Ukraine. They have pulled these people from Mariupol -- they are put to filtration camps,"" Kravchuk said. ""It's sort of something that can't be happening in the 21st Century. And we really hope that maybe with help of other Western leaders, other leaders of similar worlds, we will be able to take out the kids and women who are still in the basements of this factory and inside of Mariupol."" Zelenskyy has announced that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will arrive in Kyiv on Sunday to discuss the logistics of providing more military assistance. U.S. officials have yet to confirm the visit. Asked by Raddatz about the significance of that visit, Kravchuk called it ""a really, really symbolical and powerful signal to Russia that Ukraine will not be left alone with this war.""",7
2022-04-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/inside-blinken-austins-risky-secret-visit-ukraine/story?id=84295558,"Inside Blinken and Austin's risky, secret visit to Ukraine","In the quiet weekend morning hours Saturday, two of President Joe Biden's top advisers boarded their flights -- the start of a long journey shrouded in secrecy. It was a secret -- until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spilled just hours after they were wheels up. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin were coming to visit Kyiv, the war-time president announced. While the Biden administration refused to comment all weekend, it was a hiccup that could have derailed the secret visit, amid intense security concerns about sending two Cabinet officials to an active war zone. In the end, Blinken, Austin, and a small delegation arrived in Kyiv Sunday for a three-hour meeting with Zelenskyy, carrying with them a number of major announcements to make -- millions more in U.S. security assistance, increased U.S. training for Ukrainian troops, the return of U.S. diplomats to Ukraine, and after three years of vacancy, a nominee for a new U.S. ambassador. Senior State and Defense Department officials dismissed any concerns that Zelenskyy's announcement imperiled the trip: ""We plan for any number of contingencies. ... It didn't change anything about our commitment to go there today and to share what we have to say,"" a senior State Department official told reporters Sunday. But the administration refused to confirm the trip took place until the early morning hours Monday -- only when the U.S. team returned across the border in Poland. ""We don't know how the rest of this war will unfold, but we do know that a sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene, and our support for Ukraine going forward will continue,"" Blinken told reporters Monday morning in Poland. The visit was the first by senior U.S. officials since Russia's invasion started 60 days ago -- ""part symbolism but also very substantive,"" Blinken said as he sat across the table from Zelenskyy. That substance was in what he and Austin carried with them, including $165 million for Ukraine to purchase ammunition for its Soviet-era weaponry and $322 million for Ukraine to purchase from defense firms -- what's known as foreign military financing. In total, the Biden administration intends to obligate more than $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 other European countries, virtually all of whom have supported Ukraine's military from their own stockpiles. Blinken also announced Biden would formally nominate Bridget Brink, a career diplomat currently serving as U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, to serve as envoy in Kyiv. U.S. diplomats will eventually return to the capital too, Blinken said, as they start this week by making the journey across the border from Poland to Lviv on a daily basis. It's a journey Blinken and Austin now know personally. They arrived in southeastern Poland Saturday evening near the border with Ukraine -- riding the train to Kyiv in the opposite direction from the nearly three million Ukrainian refugees who've arrived in Poland. As passengers, they saw little of the war-torn country, according to a senior State Department official, who said shades on the windows blacked out much of the view. Once in the capital, no longer under Russian siege, Blinken said there were signs that normal life was returning. ""We certainly saw people on the streets in Kyiv -- evidence of that fact that the battle for Kyiv was won, and there is what looks from the surface at least to be normal life,"" he told reporters afterwards. ""But that's in stark contrast to what's going on in other parts of Ukraine -- in the south and the east -- where the Russian brutality is doing horrific things to people every single day."" From the train, they traveled straight to the presidential palace for three hours of meetings with Zelenskyy and his team, according to a senior State Department official, including Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, and Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President. ""We had a really good, detailed, substantive, focused conversation for the better part of three hours that really went into every aspect of this campaign and next steps,"" the senior State Department official said. It was the first time senior U.S. officials had seen Zelenskyy since Russia invaded -- a chance to check in on the TV star, who won a surprising presidential election, and who's become a wartime leader and world figure. When a U.S. delegation visited Zelenskyy last May -- the first meeting between Biden officials and a Ukrainian president already bruised by American politics -- Zelenskyy was ""constantly energized, moving from one thing to another,"" the senior State Department official said. ""Now, there's a deliberateness and a kind of gravitas,"" they said, describing him as ""very focused, very detail-oriented on different aspects of this, whether the security, the economic, the humanitarian, the sanctions. He went into real detail on each, but in a very deliberate way."" Even physically, he ""looked remarkably well,"" the official added. When the U.S. delegation asked about his family, Zelenskyy said they were doing ok, but ""'the hard part is we just don't see each other. We miss each other,'"" the official recounted him saying. ""It was just a kind of human moment. Everyone in this thing is an individual with their own individual lives and family lives,"" they added. ""He's going from being a TV celebrity to maybe the most recognized leader -- other than the president of the United States and Vladimir Putin -- in the world. He's borne that remarkably well."" An in-person conversation makes working through any differences easier, officials said -- including Zelenskyy's push for the U.S. to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. The designation, made by the State Department, carries the strictest U.S. sanctions, although Russia is already under many of them. Zelenskyy personally asked Biden to designate Russia during a phone call earlier this month, a U.S. official confirmed to ABC News. The designation is for governments that support terrorist groups, not ones that terrorize, per the senior State Department official, who said during their talks, they explained State Department lawyers are reviewing the possibility, ""but it's a statute. It's a legal determination."" ""Look, the Russians are terrorizing the Ukrainians. But that's different than saying they meet the criteria of the SST [state sponsor of terrorism designation]."" But if face-to-face interactions are that important, it begs the question why didn't Biden himself go. Another senior State Department official pointed to security concerns. ""The president of the United States is somewhat singular in terms of what travel would require, so it goes well beyond what a cabinet secretary would - or what virtually any other world leader - would require.""",7
2022-04-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-reopens-intraparty-wounds-1st-primary-play-note/story?id=84281608,Biden reopens intraparty wounds with 1st primary play: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein President Joe Biden’s first endorsement of the 2022 congressional primaries was a strange one in terms of both timing and strategy -- and the signals it sends about the president’s thinking will resonate through the voting season that’s about to commence. Late Saturday, the announcement came from the campaign of Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., that Biden endorsed Schrader, with a statement citing his role in helping “pass much of my agenda into law” and his ability to represent Oregon and “all of America.” White House officials had previously said the president would most likely not endorse in Democratic primaries. Oregon’s May 17 primary hasn’t been top of mind for most strategists, and Schrader is a little-known figure in national politics. To the extent that Democratic activists know Schrader’s name, it’s mainly been for his opposition to progressive priorities that Biden actually supports. He opposed a $15 minimum wage and a proposal to contain prescription drug prices, and he initially voted against last year’s $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill. He also enraged colleagues shortly after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol when he likened the swift impeachment push to an attempted “lynching” of then-President Donald Trump, as ABC News’ Ben Siegel reported at the time. All of that earned Schrader a primary challenger in Jamie McLeod-Skinner, who has been endorsed by four county Democratic parties, a range of progressive groups and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. In an interview last week with The Washington Post’s David Weigel, McLeod-Skinner called Schrader “the Joe Manchin or Oregon” and warned that he would lose the general election because the Democratic base has soured on him. A Biden aide told ABC News that the president is being “strategic” in where he’s offering support and will be endorsing other “incumbents who have been with him on votes and supporting his agenda.” The fact that Schrader was his first endorsement was primarily a function of the voting calendar, the aide indicated. Biden’s statement said Schrader has been with him “when it mattered most.” In this race, though, the argument some Democrats are using to try to oust the incumbent is exactly the opposite. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As the Biden administration moves forward with an appeal to a judge’s ruling that struck down the federal mask mandate on public transit, health experts are sounding the alarm about the risk of undermining the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""This is not going to be the last of the need for public health measures we've taken for any crisis,"" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. ""And what could be the crisis of tomorrow?"" The Biden administration hasn’t called for a stay that would have allowed the mask mandate to remain in place while the issue works its way through the courts, indicating that the appeal may not be as much about preserving the soon-to-expire mandate as it is about ensuring that the CDC can put public health-related measures in place in the event of another pandemic. Before U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Mizelle ruled that the mask mandate exceeded “the CDC’s statutory authority,” the mandate had only been extended until May 3. Despite COVID-19 infection rates increasing 10% or more in 38 states and territories due to omicron subvariants, the case numbers are still significantly lower than at previous points in the pandemic. “The U.S. public is done with the pandemic, even though the virus is not done with us,"" Osterholm said Sunday. ""And we have to recognize that in public health."" The TIP with Alisa Wiersema While former President Donald Trump rallied in Ohio this weekend, his political influence was unfolding in Michigan, a 2020 battleground state he lost by over 154,000 votes. On Saturday, Michigan Republicans nominated Trump-endorsed ""Big Lie"" candidates Kristina Karamo and Matt DePerno to run against incumbent Democrats in respective contests for secretary of state and attorney general. If Karamo and DePerno are successful in November, they will hold positions directly involved with validating future election results as Michigan’s top elections and law enforcement officials. As reported by ABC News’ Lalee Ibssa, DePerno, a lawyer, filed suit seeking to audit the 2020 election results in Antrim County; however, those efforts were dismissed by a Michigan court Thursday. Karamo was part of the Supreme Court lawsuit that was eventually rejected seeking to overturn the 2020 results after claiming she personally witnessed election fraud in Detroit. Although their endorsements still need to be officially confirmed by a party vote in August, the pair will now road test how well Trump’s most ardent supporters can fare in statewide executive races amid ongoing fractures within Michigan's Republican party. The party's move to nominate the nation's first 2020 conspiracy theorists to run in major battleground contests creates a complicated political landscape that has some Democrats pouncing. ""My opponent is more focused on peddling divisive fake conspiracies & lies than providing competent, customer-service driven leadership,” said incumbent Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in a tweet, adding that Karamo will ""undermine our democracy.""

2022-04-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/frances-macron-wins-reelection-le-pen-rises-analysts/story?id=84291348,"France's Macron wins reelection, but Le Pen rises, analysts say","PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term in office on Sunday, defeating far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in a closely watched runoff election. Final results released by the French Ministry of the Interior on Monday show the centrist incumbent secured a decisive 58.54% of the vote, while Le Pen garnered 41.46%. Macron, 44, is the first sitting French president to be reelected in 20 years. He and Le Pen, 53, emerged as the top candidates in the 2022 French presidential election after a first-round vote on April 10. Sunday's runoff was a rematch of the 2017 presidential election, in which Macron beat Le Pen by a landslide. This year, however, Macron's victory was marred by low voter turnout and Le Pen's ever-rising popularity. According to official figures, approximately 28% of registered voters in France did not vote in Sunday's presidential election, the highest amount in the past two decades. French voters can also show their dissatisfaction with both candidates by voting ""blanc."" Blank ballots represented 6.35% of the votes on Sunday. While Le Pen conceded defeat on Sunday night, she told her supporters that the ""result represents in itself a dazzling victory"" because the amount of votes she won was the highest by a far-right candidate in France's modern history. Henri Wallard, the chairman of French polling institute Ipsos in Paris and its global deputy CEO, said the outcome of the 2022 presidential election showed that Le Pen's ""'de-demonization' has partially worked."" ""A Le Pen vote is increasingly seen as a credible alternative and not just a protest vote,"" Wallard told ABC News on Monday. Douglas Yates, a professor of international relations and diplomacy at the American Graduate School in Paris, said Macron was triumphant ""less because the French support his programs and more because they did not support Le Pen's."" ""He must keep this in mind,"" Yates told ABC News on Monday. ""She promised domestic programs that would be popular, things that help them fight the cost of living. He should take out his checkbook and write them some checks if he wants to keep his majority in the upcoming legislative elections."" Nacira Guenif, an anthropology and sociology professor at Paris VIII University who focuses on race and gender, agreed that the French president ""was not reelected by people who believe in him or his program."" ""He was granted one vote after another that could not be offered to Le Pen or spoiled in abstention,"" Guenif told ABC News on Monday. ""These people who voted out of a sense of duty to avoid the worst will probably remind him what he owed them and how he should live up to their gesture."" Macron was all but absent from the campaign trail as he moderated talks between Putin and Western countries, which ultimately failed to prevent the war in Ukraine. Many French citizens were feeling disenfranchised by Macron's stringent COVID-19 policies and unpopular plans to raise the legal retirement age amid widespread inflation and soaring gas prices. Nevertheless, the election outcome proved that ""there still was an anti-Le Pen front in large urban constituencies,"" according to Wallard. During his victory speech in front of Paris' Eiffel Tower on Sunday night, Macron vowed to unite his divided country. ""An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right,"" Macron told his supporters. ""It will be my responsibility and that of those around me."" Although Le Pen's far-right French political party National Rally has performed poorly in previous legislative elections, Yates said the party's strongholds in the south, east and north of France ""might give them seats"" when voters return to the polls in June. Guenif said the historic 13 million votes that Le Pen received should be seen ""as an alarm bell that will ring as soon as the next parliamentary campaign."" ""Racist, illiberal, anti-immigration and authoritarian policies have become mainstream and are cast as the respectable means for a national preference,"" Guenif added. ""This is deeply concerning since center-right and right-wing parties increasingly follow this path. Macron's government has embraced such line with illiberal laws during his first term."" Le Pen -- a former lawyer known for her vociferous rhetoric -- has sought to soften her image as the leader of the National Rally, which was founded in 1972 by her firebrand far-right father, Jean-Marie Louis Le Pen. During her latest bid for the presidency, she was no longer directly calling for France to leave the European Union and abandon the euro currency. However, she was likened to former U.S. President Donald Trump with her hard-line policies on Islam and immigration. If elected, she vowed to ban Muslim headscarves in public and give French citizens priority over foreigners for housing and job benefits. Le Pen was also criticized for her history of support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. She called Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine ""unacceptable"" and said she's in favor of sanctions, but she publicly opposed restrictions on Russian energy imports, citing concerns about the rising cost of living in France. She also pledged to withdraw France from NATO's integrated military command, which could undermine support for Ukraine's fight. Le Pen previously spoke out in favor of Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. ""We are far from finished with the Le Pen family."" Guenif said. ""The daughter [Marine] is still in position to run and if things get worse, win in 2027. And the granddaughter has prepared for years to enter the arena in turn."" Ahead of the first- and second-round votes, French street artist Jaeraymie created distorted versions of Le Pen's campaign posters in an effort to call out extremism. In one of his posters seen in Paris, Le Pen is depicted wearing a hijab, a Muslim headscarf, with the words: ""Don't submit to a thinly veiled extreme right."" ""She wants to ban the hijab in public spaces in France,"" Jaeraymie told ABC News earlier this month. ""So I found it interesting to tell her: 'Why not imagine what it's like to be a hijabi woman in France?'"" A passerby at the time was amused by the large poster, telling ABC News: ""It's quite funny to put into question their ideas.""

2022-04-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/french-election-2022-macron-faces-rival-le-pen/story?id=84243569,French election 2022: Macron projected to beat far-right rival Le Pen,"PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron is projected to win a second term in office after facing his far-right rival Marine Le Pen in a runoff election on Sunday. Early estimates reported by French media and confirmed to ABC News by French polling institute Ipsos show that the centrist incumbent won a comfortable 58% of the votes, which was higher than opinion polls had predicted. Votes will continue to be counted overnight, with final results being released Monday afternoon by the French government. Macron would be the first sitting French president to be reelected in 20 years. As polling stations closed across the country and French media announced the preliminary results on Sunday evening, supporters at Macron’s rally in front of the shimmering Eiffel Tower in Paris cheered: ""We won, she lost!"" One Macron supporter told ABC News that he was ""relieved."" ""Because I was afraid Marine Le Pen would win,"" he said. Le Pen, however, was the first to take the stage that night at her rally on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, following the news of her projected loss. While admitting defeat, she told her supporters that ""tonight’s result represents in itself a dazzling victory."" She won an estimated 42% of the votes -- the highest amount by a far-right party candidate in France’s modern history. ""We can see that we have nevertheless been victorious,"" Le Pen said, before promising to ""pursue her engagement for France and for the French"" and to ""lead the battle of the legislative elections."" Macron, 44, and Le Pen, 53, emerged as the top candidates in the 2022 French presidential election after a first-round vote on April 10. Sunday's runoff was a rematch of the 2017 presidential election, in which Macron beat Le Pen by a landslide. Earlier this week, opinion polls reported by French media showed a close race ahead of the second-round vote, with Macron leading Le Pen by about 13 percentage points. ""The gap between the two candidates as measured in the polls is much more narrow than five years ago,"" Henri Wallard, the chairman of Ipsos in France and its global deputy CEO, told ABC News on Saturday. This time, Le Pen sought to soften her rhetoric and image as the leader of the far-right French political party National Rally. The former lawyer was no longer directly calling for France to leave the European Union and abandon the euro currency. However, she was likened to former U.S. President Donald Trump with her hard-line policies on Islam and immigration. If elected, she vowed to ban Muslim headscarves in public and give French citizens priority over foreigners for housing and job benefits. ""Her image has considerably softened,"" Wallard said. ""She comes across as less extremist than before."" Le Pen was also criticized for her history of support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. She called Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine ""unacceptable"" and said she's in favor of sanctions, but publicly opposed restrictions on Russian energy imports, citing concerns about the rising cost of living in France. She also pledged to withdraw France from NATO's integrated military command, which could undermine support for Ukraine's fight. Le Pen previously spoke out in favor of Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. ""Her victory would be a political earthquake,"" Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., told ABC News on Friday. ""She would probably not wreck that coalition, but raise difficult questions."" Meanwhile, Macron was all but absent from the campaign trail as he moderated talks between Putin and Western countries, which ultimately failed to prevent the war in Ukraine. Many French citizens were feeling disenfranchised by Macron's stringent COVID-19 policies and unpopular plans to raise the legal retirement age amid widespread inflation and soaring gas prices. One Paris resident told ABC News on Saturday that deciding which candidate to vote for was like choosing between ""cholera and the plague."" Another voter at a polling station on the outskirts of Paris told ABC News that he considered Macron ""the lesser evil."" Fears that voter turnout could be low materialized in polling stations across France. The final rate of abstention is set to reach 28% for Sunday, up 2.5% from 2017, according to convergent estimates from four French polling institutes, including Ipsos and Sopra Steria. In a brief victory speech on Sunday night, Macron addressed those who didn't vote. ""Their silence signified a refusal to choose, which we must also respond to,"" Macron told the crowd. The former banker-turned-president then reached out to Le Pen's supporters. ""My thoughts go to those who voted for Mrs. Le Pen,"" he said, ""because from now on, I am no longer a candidate for a party, but I am everyone's president.""

2022-04-26,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/big-lie-animates-gop-primaries-ahead-voting-season/story?id=84301867,'Big lie' animates GOP primaries ahead of voting season: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Former President Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 election are a huge issue in a small number of Republican primaries playing out this spring and summer. Perhaps just as telling are the races where they aren’t much of an issue at all -- because the GOP candidates don't actually disagree with Trump. In the Georgia gubernatorial race, Gov. Brian Kemp and former Sen. David Perdue sparred over the ""big lie"" for more than 20 minutes at the top of the first debate Sunday. Perdue falsely said Kemp ""caved in and gave the elections"" to Democrats in the 2020 cycle, while Kemp said Perdue should blame himself for losing his Senate race. But perhaps more typical of GOP primary season is the Ohio Senate race, where the first major voting of the year takes place next Tuesday. Trump's newly endorsed candidate, J.D. Vance, appeared alongside Trump on Saturday while the former president repeated discredited claims about the last election -- claims Vance is also trumpeting. That's not particularly controversial in the race. At a recent debate, when the moderator asked all the major GOP candidates whether they thought it would be better for the Republican Party if Trump moved on from talking about 2020, only one of the five raised his hand. One of those who didn't, Josh Mandel, got huge applause at a campaign event Thursday when he said ""this election was stolen,"" ABC News' Rachel Scott and Allison Pecorin report. In Michigan over the weekend, the state GOP nominated election conspiracy candidates for both secretary of state and attorney general. Depending on how primary season plays out, there may be more than a dozen states where Republicans are running for offices that would leave them in positions to actually do what Trump wanted after he lost the 2020 race. Trump's influence is certainly on the line in many of the races in which he's chosen to endorse. But even as new Jan. 6 information comes to light, implicating members of Congress and Trump's inner circle in plots to overturn the election, that same influence has already had an incalculable impact. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Hundreds of text messages between former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and various allies of Trump capture both the chaotic aftermath of the attack at the Capitol and efforts by Trump's inner circle to find a way for him to stay in power. Some of the more than 2,300 text messages first released by CNN are from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has downplayed the events of the Jan. 6 attack and fomented conspiracy theories about it but expressed deep concern that day. ""Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn't the way to solve anything,"" Greene wrote. A few days before President Joe Biden's inauguration, Greene suggested invoking martial law to Meadows in hopes he would share it with then-President Trump. ""In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall [sic] law,"" wrote Greene. ""I don't know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!"" Greene currently faces a legal challenge to her reelection effort based on her actions related to the attack on the Capitol. A group of voters wants to remove her from the state's ballot citing a provision of the Constitution's 14th Amendment known as the ""disqualification clause,"" which could bar her from running if she ""engaged in insurrection"" against the United States or ""given aid or comfort"" to its ""enemies."" During Greene's testimony under oath Friday, she repeatedly said she didn't recall when asked if she advocated for martial law. It remains to be seen whether this trove of text messages will have any bearing on the outcome of her case. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Just hours after Trump announced he would be heading to western Pennsylvania for a rally next week, the field of Republican Senate candidates took to the debate stage for the first time since Dr. Mehmet Oz received Trump's endorsement. The endorsement loomed over the debate as candidates echoed support for Trump-era policies while throwing jabs at the top-spending contenders, Oz and David McCormick. Oz was blasted by his fellow Republicans for what they saw as switching his opinions on conservative positions like being against abortions, while McCormick fended off attacks about alleged ties to business dealings in China. Other candidates leaned into highlighting their conservative experience. Carla Sands repeatedly noted her experience working in the Trump administration as ambassador to Denmark, while businessman Jeff Bartos addressed his focus on ""Main Street Pennsylvania."" Meanwhile, conservative political commentator and veteran Kathy Barnette claimed Trump's endorsement of Oz put a sharper spotlight on the television doctor for his past comments, thereby granting her ""the benefit out of that particular endorsement"" as a true conservative. ""MAGA does not belong to President Trump, MAGA -- although he coined the word -- MAGA is actually, it belongs to the people. Our values never, never shifted to President Trump's values. It was President Trump who shifted and aligned with our values,"" Barnette said. In an allusion to the former president's continued false claims of 2020 election fraud, each candidate was asked whether they believed it was time for Republicans to move past questioning the last election's results -- none of the candidates directly agreed about moving on. ""I had discussed it with President Trump, and we cannot move on,"" Oz said. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 90.

2022-04-26,https://abcnews.go.com/International/security-councils-inaction-ukraine-prompts-questions-reform/story?id=84222703,UN Security Council's inaction on Ukraine prompts questions on reform,"The United Nations Security Council's lack of action to intervene in the war in Ukraine, with more than one resolution being vetoed by Russia, has resurfaced criticism of the body. The Ukrainian government has heavily criticized the body for not taking action to stop the war, with strong criticism coming from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who, in an address to its Security Council, challenged the body to act or ""dissolve"" itself. The U.N. General Assembly passed resolutions condemning the war in Ukraine, including a resolution to remove Russia from the Human Rights Council, exposing what little support Russia has for its war and international condemnation for its alleged war crimes. Historically, when the Council has been unable to take action, the U.N. General Assembly has intervened, experts told ABC News. The Security Council, a body consisting of 15 members, five of which are permanent with veto power dubbed the P-5, is responsible for peace and security. The remaining 10 non-permanent seats rotate by election of other U.N. members for two year periods. The permanent members are China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. Amid this criticism, the U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted a new rule on Tuesday that triggers a debate in the General Assembly within 10 days of a permanent member using their veto power. The rule, sponsored by Liechtenstein, a small country in Europe, and more than 50 other countries, including the U.S., was created in an effort to create accountability for vetoes made in the Security Council. This story explores the shortcomings of the Security Council and ways it can be reformed. Can Russia be removed or its veto power taken away? Removing a member from the Security Council or the General Assembly requires a recommendation from the Security Council. Because Russia is one of the P-5 and has veto power, it can block any resolution from being passed, keeping its seat safe. It would be impossible to remove Russia from the council unless it agrees to its own expulsion or suspension. While there has been wide international condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it could still use its position in the U.N. to serve its domestic interests. Whenever Russia is represented in the U.N. Security Council, it uses the opportunity to sell the war at home, even if the international community does not believe what they are saying, Paul Poast, an associate professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told ABC News in an interview. ""A lot of times, there's value in being there, even if you're not getting anything done, just because it's useful for this domestic political purpose,"" Poast said. Experts agree that is unlikely Russia will be removed, but one expert said it is not impossible. The U.N. Charter lists the Republic of China as one of the P-5. Experts said this is actually Taiwan, as the charter itself was drafted before the communist revolution in China, Kim Lane Scheppele, an international affairs professor at Princeton who focuses on international law, told ABC News. The civil war, sparked by the Chinese Revolution in 1948, led to ""what had been the government of China [fleeing] to Taiwan. And Security Council membership fled with the government,"" Scheppele said. Taiwan remained a permanent member until 1971 when a General Assembly resolution, pushed for by China, transferred the seat. ""The language of the Republic of China, in the in the U.N. Charter, was reinterpreted to mean that the membership moved from Taiwan to the mainland,"" Scheppele said. This could be applied to Russia as well, given that the U.N. charter lists the ""Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"" as a permanent member of the Council, not Russia. This could leave room for any of the other former Soviet states to replace Russia, possibly even Ukraine, Scheppele said. ""This is kind of the only option that I can see, legally speaking, for how you could do it,"" Scheppele said. Another expert disagrees, and said that there is no way the seat could be taken away from Russia. ""There's no direct challenger to take that seat and under the current structure of the U.N., and even the current politics of the U.N. General Assembly, there's no way that I can envision a scenario where there would be a change of the Security Council to either remove Russia completely or even remove the veto power,"" Poast said. Poast later said, ""Removing them from the Human Rights Council, in many ways, is probably about as significant of a change as you can make."" Limitations of the UN While experts said the U.N. facilitates diplomacy and keeps the lines of communication open between major powers, the Security Council's actions are tied to major powers' interests. The inequity of the Security Council is that nothing can be done if it opposes what the major powers want, Poast said. While the Security Council has not been able to pass any resolutions regarding the war in Ukraine or act to stop or prevent it, Poast said taking action is not part of its role. That is why NATO was created; to have a separate union, without China and Russia, allowing Western states to take action. ""One of the big things that drove the process of creating NATO was the recognition sitting around late 1947 [to] 1948, that, from the British and the American perspective, they weren't going to be able to work with the Soviet Union,"" Poast said, adding that the powers needed a separate entity that would enable them to take action. Even in the early days of the U.N., Poast said there were concerns over whether the British, French and Americans would be able to work with the Soviets and Chinese. This was proven in 1999 when NATO took action in Kosovo, after the Security Council did not act, and again in 2011 when NATO intervened in Libya. ""It's also a key reason why we're seeing NATO be very active in this war, because of exactly the fact that the U.N. Security Council has been ineffective in doing anything about this. But in contrast, NATO has been highly effective in trying to do something to support Ukraine,"" Poast said. But, Poast said the U.N. is keeping lines of diplomacy open between the U.S. and Russia, even though their respective Secretary of State and Foreign minister have not been communicating. ""That is still important to be able to have the major powers talking to each other, especially if you go back to the ultimate purpose of the UN, which … is to prevent the major powers from fighting one another, not to keep them from fighting any war,"" Poast said. Another expert said the U.N. has been remarkably effective in preventing wars. ""Before 1945, there were a lot of wars between states and since 1945, there have been very, very few. And the Security Council was designed to regulate war between states and in that sense, it's been, historically, tremendously effective,"" said Lise Morjé Howard, a professor at Georgetown University and president of the Academic Council on the United Nations System. She added, ""there have been a lot of militarized disputes between states that came close to war, or where the war maybe even started. And then the controversy went to the U.N. Security Council, they see a resolution, or decision or some kind of mediation process. Sometimes it's peacekeeping. And then the war didn't escalate."" Howard also said the Council has been able to prevent a great power war from breaking out since its inception after World War II. Proposed reforms to the Security Council While Poast thinks a separate entity would be needed to take action, there are several proposals to reform both the UN and the Security Council, including limiting veto power and increasing the number of non-permanent members, both of which would need the consent of the P-5. As for expanding the number of members, one proposal, known as the G-4, is to give India, Germany, Brazil and Japan permanent seats in the Council, while another proposal is for African countries to be given two permanent seats in the body, according to Howard. Howard said the G-4 proposal has been popular for the last 10 years, but it could hurt the legitimacy of the Council, which stems from its ability to make decisions. But, ""I, and many other scholars, have argued that if you expand the number of decision makers, you will have fewer decisions on the Security Council,"" Howard said. She added, ""That means that they that the council will be less effective at decision making."" Another proposal, dubbed Uniting for Consensus, is to expand the number of non-permanent members in the Council from 10 to 20, to have more representation in the body. This proposal also suggests that states should be allowed to reapply to be on the Council after their two-year election ends. Howard said more representation and diversity in the Council could increase its legitimacy. Scheppele said another way to reform the Council is to subject its decision to approval by the International Court of Justice. The ICJ could rule on whether its decisions are in line with international law, as a way to put some checks on the body. ""If the Security Council does something that the General Assembly believes is contrary to international law, for example, the General Assembly can already, under the charter, refer that question decided by the Security Council to the ICJ,"" Scheppele said. But, enforcement of ICJ decisions would still be a problem and this would not resolve the Council's inaction, Scheppele said. While a lot of focus has been placed on the Security Council, Scheppele said the U.N. is a large organization with several bodies heavily involved in Ukraine. ""There's everything from UNICEF, which is in there, into Ukraine, trying to save kids to UNESCO, which has actually been working with all the museum directors across Ukraine to try to preserve Ukraine's cultural heritage,"" Scheppele said. She added, ""the U.N. is more than the general assembly and the Security Council. And there are probably other pieces of the U.N. that are very actively involved in trying to mitigate the damage from this...the U.N. is a big beast has lots of different wings, and arms and legs, and a bunch of them are involved in the war. It's just not the Security Council.""",6
2022-04-26,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nature-battle-changing-us-helping-ukraine-adapt-blinken/story?id=84314354,"Nature of battle changing, US helping Ukraine adapt: Blinken","Speaking publicly about his visit to Ukraine for the first time since returning home, Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday asserted ""the Ukrainians have won the battle for Kyiv,"" while calling for additional aid to help the country weather the war as the fighting shifts eastward and to the south. ""As we took the train across the border and rode westward into Ukraine, we saw mile after mile of Ukrainian countryside, territory that just a couple of months ago, the Russian government thought that it could seize in a matter of weeks. Today -- firmly Ukraine's,"" he recounted, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about his secretive visit to heart of the war-torn country with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Blinken said that on the trip, the highest-level visit to Ukraine's capital by U.S. officials since the invasion, evidence of its military success abounded. ""In Kyiv we saw the signs of a vibrant city coming back to life. People eating outside sitting on benches, strolling. It was right in front of us,"" he said. ""For all the suffering that they've endured, for all the carnage that Russia's brutal invasion continues to inflict, Ukraine was and will continue to be a free and independent country."" During the hearing, convened to review the State Department's budget for the coming fiscal year, Blinken argued that fulfilling the funding requests would prove critical to Ukraine's defense and curbing Russian aggression. ""I felt some pride in what the United States has done to support the Ukrainian government and its people and an even firmer conviction that we must not let up. Moscow's war of aggression against Ukraine has underscored the power and purpose of American diplomacy,"" he said. ""We have to continue to drive that diplomacy forward to seize what I believe are strategic opportunities, as well as address risks presented by Russia's overreach."" Blinken argued support from the U.S. and its allies had already played a decisive role. ""[The Ukrainian people's] success is primarily because of their incredible courage and determination, but it's also because we were able to equip them with what they needed,"" Blinken said. ""For every tank that the Russians have had in Ukraine, we've managed with 30 allies and partners, in one way or another, to provide about 10 anti-armor systems. For every plane that the Russians have flown in the skies, there have been about 10 anti-aircraft munitions of one kind or another."" But Blinken acknowledged that as the battleground shifted to other regions of the country, the Ukrainians' strategy needed to evolve well. ""The nature of this battle is changing, to eastern and southern Ukraine. They're adapting to that. We're adapting to that."" The secretary said while in Kyiv, he discussed what assistance Ukraine required for the next phase of the fighting with its President Zelensky and top military leader. ""I think we're largely aligned in what they say they need and what we think we're able to provide,"" he said. While the committee largely projected bipartisan support for Ukraine, the most contentious round of the hearing came during Sen. Rand Paul's line of questioning on what he called the ""reasons"" behind Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Paul, a Republican more aligned with former President Donald Trump's ""America First"" stance than the other members of his party on the committee, blamed the attack in part on President Joe Biden's and other officials' public support for Ukraine's eventual NATO membership. ""Russia said it was a red line,"" Paul stated. ""Had they been, or are they to become part of NATO, that means U.S. troops will be fighting in Ukraine and that's something I very much oppose."" ""My judgment is different,"" Blinken countered, pointing out the countries Russia had targeted -- like Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine -- were not part of NATO. ""You could also argue the countries they've attacked were part of Russia … well, we're part of the Soviet Union,"" Paul replied. ""That does not give Russia the right to attack them,"" Blinken responded. ""It is the fundamental right of these countries to decide their own future and their own destiny."" Blinken also said that in the eyes of the department, the alliance was not Russian President Vladimir Putin's chief concern ahead of the attack. ""This was never about Ukraine being potentially part of NATO,"" he said. ""It was always about his belief that Ukraine does not deserve to be a sovereign independent country that it must be re reassumed into Russia in one form or another."" Blinken was also pressed on the State Department's relatively slow-moving approach to repopulating the U.S. embassy in Kyiv after it was temporarily relocated in February, a step many of its allies have already taken. ""We are sending diplomats back to Ukraine this week, and they will begin to assess how we can most effectively and securely reopen the embassy in Kyiv. I anticipate that we will be in Lviv and then and then head to head to Kyiv, subject to the President's final decision on that,"" he said. ""We want to have our embassy reopened and we're working to do that.""",7
2022-04-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-trevor-reeds-detention-russia-release/story?id=84343467,Timeline of Trevor Reed's detention in Russia and release,"The U.S. is celebrating the release of Trevor Reed, a Marine veteran from Texas detained in Russia for 985 days, and who was headed back to the United States Wednesday after a prisoner exchange, according to the White House, following years of his family pleading his case. Reed was sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison colony in 2020, convicted on charges of violently assaulting two police officers in Moscow following a drunken party when he was visiting his girlfriend. Reed's family and U.S. officials say those charges and ones brought against Paul Whelan, another former Marine still held in Russia, were fabricated in order to seize them as bargaining chips. Here's a timeline of key events in Reed's case: Aug. 15, 2019 - Russian police detain Reed While visiting his Russian girlfriend, Reed was out at a party and became intoxicated. He says he was traveling home from the party in the early morning hours of Aug. 16 when their car was pulled over and Reed says he got out because he got sick and started running around. Police were called to the scene and took Reed to a police station where Russian Federation agents later arrived and detained him. March 11, 2020 - Reed's trial begins Reed appears in a Russian court on the first day on his trial. He faced charges of endangering the lives of the officers and was accused of attacking them and grabbing the police car's steering wheel and causing it to swerve -- despite video evidence later showing that never happened. U.S. officials would later call the trial ""theatre of the absurd."" July 30, 2020 - Russia sentences Reed to nine years A Russian court handed down Reed a maximum sentence of nine years in a Russian prison colony after his trial faced a long delay from March until July. July 16, 2021 - Reed transferred to remote prison colony After several appeals, Reed was moved from a prison in Moscow to a remote prison colony. Despite hopes for a prisoner exchange at President Joe Biden's summit with Russia's president Vladimir Putin in Geneva one month earlier, Reed was sent some 350 miles from the Russian capital to a camp in Mordovia. Nov. 4, 2021 - Reed goes on hunger strike Isolated in the remote prison colony, Reed goes on a hunger strike, according to his girlfriend, protesting his detention and ""numerous and flagrant violations"" of his rights by Russian authorities. He had been in solitary confinement for nearly three months at this point because he refused to do labor in the prison camp, his family said at the time. Feb. 24, 2022 - Russia invades Ukraine Russian launches its invasion of neighboring Ukraine, prompting more calls from Reed's family for Biden to bring their son home. March 8, 2022 - Reed's parents protest at Biden event After protesting outside Biden's event at a Veterans Affairs facility in Fort Worth, Texas, Joey and Paula Reed said Biden called them after his speech. March 30, 2022 - Reed's parents meet Biden Reed's parents meet with Biden for 40 minutes after demonstrating outside the White House amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Around the same time, Trevor Reed went back on another hunger strike in prison to protest. April 1, 2022 - Reed transferred to hospital Reed was transferred to a prison hospital after reported exposure to tuberculosis in December, his family said. April 12, 2022 - Reed appears in appeals court via video link Reed is seen publicly for the first time in months in a court appearance via video link from his prison colony for an appeals hearing. The court remanded his case to a lower court, but Reed was able to speak about his health, saying it had been two weeks since he coughed up blood, and called the charges against him fabricated. April 27, 2022 - US, Russia announce prisoner swap Statements from the White House and Russian Foreign Ministry report Reed's release as part of an international prisoner exchange. Reed is exchanged for Russian Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot serving a 20-year federal prison sentence in Connecticut for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. after he was arrested in Liberia in 2010 and extradited to the U.S. According to Joey Reed, his son was first flown from Russia to Turkey where he was exchanged on the tarmac for Yaroshenko. ""He said it was like a movie,"" Joey Reed said. ""They walked past each other like in a spy swap.""",2

""Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement. ""Trevor, a former U.S. Marine, is free from Russian detention. I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence. And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom."" Reed was exchanged for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, a convicted drug trafficker, Russian officials said. Entering into negotiations with Russian officials for Reed’s release “required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly,” Biden said. He has been held in Russia since 2019. “His safe return is a testament to the priority my Administration places on bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad,"" he said. ""We won’t stop until Paul Whelan and others join Trevor in the loving arms of family and friends."" Russian state media aired video of Reed at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow on Wednesday. Speaking to ABC News by phone, Reed's father, Joey Reed, said his son was a bit ""overwhelmed"" by the news. Doctors on the flight are assessing Trevor, Joey Reed said. Trevor went on hunger strike in November to protest against conditions while in solitary confinement in the remote labor camp where he was being held, with the former Marine suffering from deteriorating health in recent months, according to his lawyers. According to his father, Trevor was first flown from Russia to Turkey where he was exchanged on the tarmac for Yaroshenko. ""He said it was like a movie -- they walked past each other like in a spy swap,"" Joey Reed said. ""Our understanding is the next time Trevor steps off the plane he will be in America."" In a statement, Reed's family said their ""prayers had been answered and Trevor is safely on his way back to the United States."" ""First and foremost, we’d like to thank President Biden for his kindness, his consideration, and for making the decision to bring Trevor home,"" the family said. ""The president’s action may have saved Trevor’s life."" They went on, ""While we understand the interest in Trevor’s story – and as soon as he’s ready, he’ll tell his own story, we’d respectfully ask for some privacy while we address the myriad of health issues brought on by the squalid conditions he was subjected to in his Russian gulag."" The family also said they ""stand proudly"" with the family of Paul Whelan, another former Marine serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges in a maximum-security prison colony, and the other families of ""wrongfully detained Americans"" who are awaiting their release. It had long been speculated that Russian national Yaroshenko would be part of any prisoner swap involving American citizens jailed in Russia, though the timing has come as a surprise, with U.S.-Russia relations strained by the war in Ukraine. In 2010, Yaroshenkowas arrested as part of a DEA operation in Liberia and taken to the U.S., which the Russian Foreign Ministry described as an ""effective kidnapping.""

Albright, who had cancer, died in March at the age of 84. She served as secretary of state from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton and as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. from 1993 to 1997. President Joe Biden eulogized Albright, sharing a story about a speech he gave last month in Poland, where he said a crowd of hundreds cheered when he mentioned Albright's name. ""Her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world. Madeleine never minced words or wasted time when she saw something needed fixing, or someone who needed helping. She just got to work,"" Biden said. ""She could go toe-to-toe with the toughest dictators, then turn around and literally teach a fellow ambassador how to do the macarena on the floor of the U.N. Security Council,"" he continued. With the NATO alliance critical in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden highlighted her work to keep NATO ""strong and galvanized"" when she was the nation's top diplomat. ""When I got word that Madeleine passed, I was in midair on my way to Europe to meet with our NATO allies in Brussels to help try to continue to keep the strong, strong alliances together, our organization and international response to Russia's brutal and unjustifiable war against Ukraine. It was not lost on me that Madeleine was a big part of the reason NATO was still strong and galvanized as it is today."" During her tenure as secretary of state, she focused on promoting the eastward expansion of NATO and pushed for NATO intervention in the 1999 war in Kosovo, according to the historical office of the Department of State. Her approach to diplomacy and statecraft was colored by her own experiences as a refugee who fled what was then Czechoslovakia with her family in the aftermath of World War II. She remained engaged with both American and international affairs until the end of her life, writing a book in 2018 warning about a resurgence of fascism and sounding an alarm about Russian President Vladimir Putin in a New York Times op-ed published just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""In early 2000, I became the first senior U.S. official to meet with Vladimir Putin in his new capacity as acting president of Russia... Flying home, I recorded my impressions. 'Putin is small and pale,' I wrote, 'so cold as to be almost reptilian,'"" Albright wrote in the Times. She added that ""should he invade [Ukraine], it will be a historic error."" Biden said Wednesday ""her story was America's story"" and praised Albright as a pioneer who made sure women ""knew they belonged at every single table having to do with national security, without exception."" Both former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also spoke at the funeral, as did Albright's daughters, Anne, Alice and Katie. ""Few leaders have been so perfectly suited for the times in which they served... Because she knew firsthand that America's policy decisions had the power to make a difference in people's lives around the world, she saw her jobs as both an obligation and an opportunity,"" the former president wrote in a statement the day Albright died.

2022-04-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mccarthys-free-speech-problem-inside-gop-note/story?id=84322921,McCarthy’s free speech problem inside GOP: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein There's probably never a good time for audio to emerge of a party leader musing about whether some of his colleagues should be banned from social media platforms. Even so, this is a particularly awkward time for House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's colleagues to learn what he had to say about some of the firebrands in his conference in the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. ""Can't they take their Twitter accounts away, too?"" McCarthy asked members of his leadership team in audio obtained by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns for their forthcoming book, ""This Will Not Pass."" It was McCarthy reflecting a widespread view at a tenuous time, when the likes of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., were tossing off potentially inflammatory observations in the hours and days after the insurrection. That is decidedly not the view of McCarthy's conference now. Just hours before Martin and Burns released the audio, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., was weighing on his podcast whether it was ""disqualifying"" for a party leader to call for a Twitter ban on a colleague; Boebert, his guest, labeled it ""a complete violation of our freedom of speech."" The new book is coming out at the very moment that Twitter is being acquired by Elon Musk, who views his mission as bringing more ""free speech"" to the platform. Musk was critical of Twitter acting as the ""de facto arbiter of free speech"" by banning Trump after the events of Jan. 6. As McCarthy himself knows better than most, every vote for leader matters, and he has no shortage of ambitious colleagues who are ready to block his path to the speakership. McCarthy's problem now is that issues of ""de-platforming"" and perceived anti-conservative bias in social media are broader than the Greene-Gohmert-Boebert wing of the GOP. What he said and thought last January could matter greatly after this November. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper A meeting between President Joe Biden and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has reignited the possibility of executive actions to address student loans. Sources tell ABC News' Mariam Khan that Biden was ""very receptive"" to such suggestions and said multiple times that he was prepared to extend the loan repayment moratorium and potentially issue executive actions to cancel a portion of borrowers' student loan debt. Earlier this month, the Biden administration extended the pause on payments through Aug. 31 with interest remaining at 0% until then. Payments that were supposed to resume in May will now start up just a couple of months before the high-stakes midterm elections. Progressives have urged Biden to cancel varying amounts of student loan debt and others have called for the administration to cancel student loan debt altogether. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that Biden is thinking about how to move forward on the issue and would decide before the pause on payments ends. Psaki said the president ""is looking at other executive authority options he has to bring relief to people who have student loans."" On the campaign trail, Biden had called for canceling up to $10,000 per borrower. He has yet to fulfill that promise. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema One of the nation's most closely watched congressional primaries is increasingly serving as a microcosm of intraparty Democratic divisions. Incumbent moderate Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas is just weeks away from a second faceoff this year with progressive immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros in the May 24 runoff election. On Tuesday, Cuellar's campaign announced House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn would be campaigning for the vulnerable congressman next week. In 2021, Clyburn similarly rallied behind Shontel Brown in Ohio's 11th Congressional District, which Brown won during an equally divisive primary season for Democrats. Meanwhile, Cisneros boasts endorsements from progressive heavyweights like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, as well as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Beyond symbolic backings, Cuellar and Cisneros are in national political crosshairs over Title 42 -- a major wedge issue between Democratic lawmakers. Cuellar -- who has a history of backing some conservative policies -- was one of two Latino lawmakers from Texas border districts to call on the Biden administration to keep the Trump-era policy in place. In a recent interview on Fox News, Cuellar said the administration is giving too much attention to ""immigration activists"" while sending ""mixed messages"" to the public regarding pandemic health. Cuellar's early public opposition to the Biden administration's move on a major immigration policy is likely to add to progressive characterizations of him being ""the most conservative Democrat"" in Congress, but it remains to be seen whether voters echo that sentiment.

2022-04-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-outbreaks-amid-perfect-storm-conditions-unicef-warn/story?id=84349818,"Measles outbreaks possible amid 'perfect storm' of conditions, WHO and UNICEF warn","The World Health Organization and UNICEF are warning of a ""perfect storm"" of circumstances fueling the potential for large-scale measles outbreaks, underscoring worrying signs of increased risk as infections around the globe this year are far above what they were this time last year. In the first two months of 2022, reported measles cases worldwide increased by nearly 80%, compared to the same timeframe in 2021, the organizations said in a joint news release, adding that conditions are ""ripe"" for serious outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable illness. ""Pandemic-related disruptions, increasing inequalities in access to vaccines and the diversion of resources from routine immunization are leaving too many children without protection against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases,"" the organizations said, adding that the risk for large outbreaks ""has increased as communities relax social distancing practices and other preventive measures for COVID-19 implemented during the height of the pandemic."" Almost 17,338 cases of the highly contagious disease were reported worldwide in January and February 2022, compared to 9,665 during the first two months of 2021. Brewing humanitarian crises have inflamed the issue. ""With millions of people being displaced due to conflicts and crises, including in Ukraine, Ethiopia, Somalia and Afghanistan, disruptions in routine immunization and COVID-19 vaccination services, lack of clean water and sanitation, and overcrowding increase the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks,"" the organizations said. ""The agencies are concerned that outbreaks of measles could also forewarn outbreaks of other diseases that do not spread as rapidly,"" WHO and UNICEF said, noting that besides its direct effect on the body, which can be lethal, the measles virus also weakens the immune system and makes a child more vulnerable to other infectious diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhea for months after the measles infection -- among those who survive. This is not the first time global health agencies have warned of lagging pediatric immunizations being an issue of urgent address. In an April meeting, the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts noted that disruptions to routine immunization programs puts ""millions of children at risk of disease outbreaks,"" and ""large and disruptive outbreaks of measles have occurred in at least 19 countries during the past 12 months."" And in the U.S., as ABC has reported, vaccination coverage for kindergarteners fell below the nationwide target during the 2020-2021 school year, according to CDC data, raising concerns about vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, mumps and whooping cough. Experts worry pandemic disruptions could inadvertently lead to a growing number of vaccine-preventable illnesses among children. In 2020, 23 million children missed out on basic childhood vaccines through routine health services, the highest number since 2009 and 3.7 million more than in 2019, the WHO and UNICEF said Wednesday. As of April 1, 57 vaccine-preventable disease campaigns in 43 countries that were scheduled to take place since the start of the pandemic are still postponed, impacting 203 million people, most of whom are children, the agencies said. Nineteen of those postponed are measles campaigns, putting 73 million children at risk of measles due to missed vaccinations. In Ukraine, the measles catch-up campaign of 2019 ""was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter due to the war,"" the WHO and UNICEF said. ""Routine and catch-up campaigns are needed wherever access is possible to help make sure there are not repeated outbreaks as in 2017-2019, when there were over 115,000 cases of measles and 41 deaths in the country -- this was the highest incidence in Europe."" As of this April, the agencies said there have been 21 large and disruptive measles outbreaks around the world in the last 12 months. Most of the measles cases were reported in Africa and the East Mediterranean region. Countries with the largest measles outbreaks since the past year include Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Ethiopia. The figures are likely higher, as the pandemic has disrupted surveillance systems globally, with potential underreporting, the agencies said. The agencies cited insufficient measles vaccine coverage as the primary reason for the outbreaks ""wherever they occur."" ""Measles is more than a dangerous and potentially deadly disease. It is also an early indication that there are gaps in our global immunization coverage, gaps vulnerable children cannot afford,"" UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement. ""It is encouraging that people in many communities are beginning to feel protected enough from COVID-19 to return to more social activities. But doing so in places where children are not receiving routine vaccination creates the perfect storm for the spread of a disease like measles.""

2022-04-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-war-discussed-reed-prisoner-swap-russia-us/story?id=84343257,"Ukraine war not discussed in Reed prisoner swap with Russia, US officials say","U.S. and Russian officials have been negotiating the prisoner swap for Trevor Reed for months, according to senior administration officials Wednesday, with talks intensifying in recent weeks amid concern about his health. As the Marine veteran, held since August 2019, was released, he met with U.S. special presidential envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens -- and was described by an administration official as being in ""good spirits"" -- before traveling to the U.S., the officials said. This diplomatic exchange continued even amid Russia's war in Ukraine -- but the senior administration officials made clear, the talks never touched on the war or U.S. sanctions. There was not even senior-level U.S. official travel to Russia to negotiate the exchange, according to the officials. ""This is a discrete issue on which we were able to make an arrangement with the Russians. It represents no change -- zero -- to our approach to the appalling violence in Ukraine,"" a senior administration official told reporters. ""Let me just emphasize this again because it's so important -- the discussion with the Russians that led to this exchange were strictly limited to these topics, not a broader diplomatic conversation or even the starting point,"" they added. Topics around the war ""weren't broached. They were never intended to be broached"" during the high-stakes secret talks, a second senior administration official said. As he was leaving a White House event Wednesday afternoon, President Joe Biden was asked how Reed's release happened amid the invasion of Ukraine. ""I did it,"" Biden said. ""How?"" a reporter followed up. ""I raised it. I raised it three months ago,"" Biden said, before leaving the room. Earlier Wednesday, Biden said in a statement he made ""a very hard decision"" to commute the sentence of Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian drug smuggler convicted of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. But the senior administration officials emphasized Yaroshenko was not pardoned, and argued he ""has already paid a steep price in the U.S. justice system for his crime. In fact, he's already served the majority of his sentence."" Serving a nine-year sentence in a remote prison camp, Reed went on a second hunger strike in late March to protest his treatment, according to his family. After a reported exposure to tuberculosis in December, his family was increasingly concerned about reports he was coughing up blood or experiencing fevers, especially when he was transferred to a prison hospital on April 1. Appearing publicly for the first time in months, Reed told a Russian court via video teleconference on April 12 that it had been two weeks since he'd coughed up blood or had a fever, but he said he wasn't receiving medical care for a broken rib. While American Paul Whelan, another Marine veteran, has been held longer than Reed, it was Reed's failing health and his family and the U.S. government's concern that led to his case being raised in the exchange. The officials declined to say more about Reed's condition now or when and where he is expected to arrive in the U.S., out of privacy concerns for him and his family. Yaroshenko is in Russian custody now, they confirmed. But they repeatedly emphasized the Biden administration's commitment to securing the freedom of U.S. citizens unjustly detained around the world. ""We will continue to work on and attempt to find ways to address other cases as best we can,"" the senior administration official said when asked about Whelan and American WNBA star Brittney Griner, detained in Russia since February. Whelan was also a tourist in Russia when he was arrested on espionage charges that he, his family, and the U.S. government have said are spurious. Whelan has been detained since December 2018 and was sentenced to 16 years in prison in June 2020 -- transferred to a prison colony eight hours southeast of Moscow. Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner, has been held since being accused of having hashish oil in her suitcase while returning to Russia to play basketball. She remains in pre-trial detention, with a court extending her detention until May 19. ABC News' Molly Nagle contributed to this report.",2
2022-04-27,https://abcnews.go.com/US/trevor-reeds-parents-david-muir-looked-horriblewe-started/story?id=84346715,Trevor Reed's parents to David Muir: 'He looked horrible ... we started crying',"Trevor Reed's time inside a Russian prison may be over, but his parents said they are still concerned about his well-being and his long road to recovery. Hours after Reed was released from a Russian prison as part of an international prisoner exchange, the former Marine's parents spoke with ABC News anchor David Muir and said they are relieved that his nearly three-year captivity has come to an end. However, Joey and Paula Reed said they are very concerned about their son's physical and mental recovery. ""Trevor left here, young, virile, in good shape, good condition. And he's not, he's not coming home that way. So that's our concern about his health."" Joey Reed told Muir during an interview on ""World News Tonight"" Wednesday. The parents lobbied for years for the U.S. to negotiate for their son's release, going as far as to personally plead with President Joe Biden to act. On Wednesday, their requests were fulfilled. Reed was exchanged for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, a convicted drug trafficker, Russian officials said. ""Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly,"" Biden said in a statement. ""Trevor, a former U.S. Marine, is free from Russian detention. I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence. And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom."" Reed's ordeal started in 2019 when he was visiting his girlfriend in Moscow. The 30-year-old was arrested after Russian authorities alleged Reed grabbed the wheel of a police car and assaulted a police officer while drunk. Reed denied the allegations and maintained his innocence. The U.S. government also denied the allegations. One year later, Reed was sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony. After several appeals, Reed was moved from a prison in Moscow to a remote prison colony. In November 2021, Reed went on a hunger strike, according to his girlfriend. He was reportedly kept in solitary confinement for three months before the hunger strike, according to his family. On March 30, the Reeds protested outside the White House asking for an audience with President Biden. Biden did meet with the family after their demonstration and the couple told ABC News they felt the president was mindful of their requests. On Wednesday video and photos of Reed being escorted out of prison and into a plane were released. The Reeds said they cried when viewing that footage of their son, who they said looked weak and had trouble walking. ""He looked like he could hardly walk, he looked like he'd been walking shackled,"" Joey Reed said. The family said their priority is to ensure their son regains his health. ""He just looked terrible to us,"" Paula Reed said.",2
2022-04-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-seek-reframe-border-debate-note/story?id=84351350,Democrats seek to reframe border debate: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It has the trappings of an intraparty rebellion: Warnings of a migrant surge that will overwhelm authorities, battleground-state Democrats saying the Biden administration doesn't have a plan -- and even an in-cycle senator from New Hampshire traveling to the Mexican border to call for an expansion of the Trump border wall. But a range of immigration advocates and their allies in Congress are arguing that it doesn't have to be this way for Democrats. Heading into the midterms, they see a chance for their party to go on offense in selling what the administration has done and what they still plan to do to help immigrants, while also supporting border security. ""Democrats should speak to the Democratic coalition -- not to Republican voters,"" Frank Sharry, executive director of the immigration reform group America's Voice, told ABC News. ""If Democrats panic, they lose. If they lean in with strength, they win."" Sharry's group has been working with advocates from the Immigration Hub and other progressive activists in recent weeks to brief operatives and lawmakers on polling and campaign research pointing to ways to neutralize GOP attacks on immigration. Central to their argument is that Title 42 was a Trump-era anti-immigrant measure rather than a border security tool. President Joe Biden is right to wind it down next month, they argue, and to sell efforts to legalize DREAMers, protect refugees and promote legal immigration. Sharry said activists have been frustrated that the White House hasn't provided messaging cover to vulnerable Democrats -- and with some Democrats whom he said have chosen to ""cede the field"" to right-wing framing around border issues. This week brought signs that may be changing with the unveiling of a broader Biden administration plan for a world where Title 42 is rescinded. The GOP barbs are inevitable, as the House Republican border trip Monday and the grilling of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday make clear. But the hope of some immigration activists is that Democrats start to respond in ways that don't validate the attacks. Late Wednesday, a federal judge stepped in as expected to block Biden from lifting Title 42 restrictions -- keeping the issue alive as a potent issue for the foreseeable future. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema After months of seeing palatable redistricting changes unfold across the country, Democrats are now facing uncertainty regarding new maps in New York -- a state where they hold an overwhelming political majority. As reported by ABC News' Aaron Katersky, on Wednesday the New York Court of Appeals -- the state's highest court -- voided congressional and state Senate maps drawn by Democrats. The case now goes back to the trial court and the new maps will be drawn by a politically neutral master, according to the decision. The court scolded Democrats for failing to adhere ""to the will of the People of this State,"" given that voters previously sought to stop political influence from impacting New York's redistricting process through state constitutional amendments in 2014. The court also characterized the maps as being ""drawn with impermissible partisan purpose,"" thereby violating the state's ""constitutional provision prohibiting partisan gerrymandering."" ""We are confident that, in consultation with the Board of Elections, [the] Supreme Court can swiftly develop a schedule to facilitate an August primary election, allowing time for the adoption of new constitutional maps,"" the 4-3 decision said, indicating that New York's election schedule will likely be delayed. The news comes on the heels of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' signing his favored congressional map into law. The new map wipes out political gains made by Democrats by adding four Republican-leaning seats and eliminating three highly competitive preexisting seats. DeSantis' map also split up Black voters by slashing the number of Black-majority districts from four to two. Taken together, the looming questions about how the new maps will ultimately translate into voter turnout put sharper focus on a tough campaign cycle for Democrats in the months ahead. The TIP with Brittany Shepherd Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is taking his victory lap on the road. On Wednesday, the governor of the self-proclaimed freest state in the nation decamped to Nevada to campaign for Trump-endorsed GOP Senate candidate Adam Laxalt. Laxalt, the former Nevada-based Trump campaign co-chair, has pushed the need to ""tighten up"" elections, a watered-down embrace of the former president's baseless assertion of widespread election fraud in the 2020 election. DeSantis has championed the issue in Florida, too, just signing into law a bill that would create a sort of election fraud police force by establishing the Office of Election Crimes and Security to root out bad actors. The Las Vegas ""Rise Up"" event is a sign of DeSantis' growing influence, as his appearance is one of his first more high-profile political stumps on behalf of another candidate outside his home state. ""In times like these, there is no substitute for courage,"" DeSantis said of Laxalt at the hotly anticipated campaign event. And there's a hope that what happens in Vegas breaks the old adage and makes waves in the GOP primary in mid-June, as Laxalt hopes to unseat Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto come November. ""By standing shoulder to shoulder with DeSantis, Laxalt is making clear he's an extreme MAGA Republican who shares the same dangerous agenda, which Nevadans simply cannot afford,"" the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 22. That's the number of U.S. House seats we expected Democrats to win in New York under their new congressional map, which is quite bullish for Democrats considering there are only 26 seats at stake in New York, Democrats currently control 19 of them and the overall midterm environment doesn't look great for Democrats. But on Wednesday, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the map was a partisan gerrymander. New York's map, as FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich writes, was a big reason Democrats had done so well nationally in the 2021-22 redistricting cycle. But now, as we enter the lawsuit portion, it's possible that Democrats' big redistricting advantage will be erased. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-04-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-congress-33-billion-aid-package-ukraine/story?id=84368246,Biden asks Congress for $33 billion in new aid package to Ukraine,"President Joe Biden formally asked Congress on Thursday for $33 billion in supplemental aid for Ukraine over the next five months to help counter Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion over the long term. ""The cost of this fight is not cheap. But caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen,"" Biden said. ""It's critical this funding gets approved and approved as quickly as possible."" ""We're not attacking Russia. We're helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,"" he added. ""And just as Putin chose to launch this brutal invasion, he could make the choice to end it, this brutal invasion. Russia is the aggressor, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Russia is the aggressor, and the world must and will hold Russia accountable."" Biden said the supplemental budget request will allow weapons and ammunition to flow ""without interruption to the brave Ukrainian fighters"" and the U.S. to continue delivering economic and humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people, whom he said are paying the real price of this fight with their lives. Over $20 billion of the $33 billion would be for military and other security systems, the White House said. Biden is also asking for an additional $8.5 billion in economic assistance to help provide basic services to the Ukrainian people and $3 billion in humanitarian assistance and food security funding. Part of the package also includes targeted funding to address economic disruptions in the U.S. as a result of the war in Ukraine, like helping increase U.S. production of wheat and soybeans, ""and funding to allow the use of the Defense Production Act to expand domestic production of critical reserves -- of reserves of critical minerals and materials that have been disrupted by Putin's war and are necessary to make everything from defense systems to cars,"" a senior administration official said ahead of Biden's remarks. Biden said he was also sending lawmakers another comprehensive package to enhance our effort to sanction Russian oligarchs and ""take their ill-begotten gains."" As billions in additional COVID funding remains stalled in Congress, asked if that funding should be tied to the Ukraine aid, Biden said, ""I don't care how they do it -- I'm sending them both up.""",26
2022-04-29,https://abcnews.go.com/International/swan-lake-symbol-protest-russia/story?id=84401801,How 'Swan Lake' became a symbol of protest in Russia,"As Russians seek to subtly protest the invasion of Ukraine amid a crackdown on anti-war sentiment, ""Swan Lake"" has been a go-to symbol. The famous Russian ballet may seem like an unlikely choice to foreigners, but it is a powerful historical reference for Russians that is being used as one of several coded forms of protest during the war, according to Russian State University anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova. ""It's quite dangerous now to protest in Russia,"" Arkhipova, who was abroad when the invasion started and has decided not to return to Moscow, told ABC News' podcast ""Start Here"" from Berlin. Anti-war demonstrations in Russia have been shut down by authorities and led to mass arrests. A law passed by the Russian parliament in early March criminalizes public opposition to the war -- and makes it illegal to call the ""military operation"" a war. ""It's almost impossible now in Russia to protest in direct forms, like to go in street and say, 'Putin, go away,'"" Arkhipova said. ""But people are trying to invent as many other ways to protest as possible."" One of those ways is through the image of ballerinas from ""Swan Lake."" Graffiti depicting the line of four ballerinas in the ""Dance of the Cygnets"" has been popping up on walls in Russian cities. Earlier last month, when independent Russian news outlet TV Rain signed off indefinitely due to pressure over its coverage of the conflict, it did so with a clip from ""Swan Lake."" The moment was a nod to when Soviet state TV interrupted programming by airing the ballet on a loop after the death of Premier Leonid Brezhnev in 1982 while Soviet leaders selected a successor. The same thing happened again after the deaths of Yuri Andropov in 1984 and Konstantin Chernenko in 1985, as well as during a failed coup against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 -- becoming a sign of political instability and upheaval. ""In the late Soviet times, this ballet was a symbol of all of the deaths of the Soviet leaders,"" Arkhipova said. ""And so that's why it became a sign that we are waiting for Putin to die."" ""Swan Lake"" graffiti has popped up before the war as well, including when Russian President Vladimir Putin was inaugurated to his fourth presidential term. Another type of coded message that's been popping up ""everywhere,"" including on the walls of buildings, is a slogan with eight asterisks that stands for ""no war,"" or ""net voyny"" in Russian, Arkhipova said. ""Very often, people are changing their avatars in social media to these eight asterisks,"" she said. ""It's the way to say no war instead of saying no war."" Despite the risk of fines or possibly jail, protesters persist in an attempt to cut through the misinformation and ""informational blockades"" about the circumstances of the war, Arkhipova said. ""Many Russian people, they even don't know what is going on because the blockage is quite severe,"" she said. ""The more people can hear about massacre in Bucha, about violence, about soldiers killed from both sides, about bombing and so on, the harder for them to accept the fact that we are not saviors anymore, we are aggressors.""

2022-04-29,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-spokesman-shows-anger-putin-alleged-russian-atrocities/story?id=84402987,Pentagon spokesman shows anger over Putin and alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine,"In a rare show of emotion at the Pentagon, press secretary John Kirby choked up discussing Russian President Vladimir Putin and alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine during a briefing with reporters Friday. It began when Kirby was asked whether he believes Putin is a ""rational actor."" ""It's hard to look at what he's doing in Ukraine, what his forces are doing in Ukraine, and think that any ethical, moral individual could justify that. It's difficult to look at the –"" Kirby said, cutting off his sentence as he looked away to collect himself. After eight seconds of silence behind the podium, he continued. ""Sorry,"" he said. ""It's difficult to look at some of the images and imagine that any well-thinking, serious, mature leader would do that. So, I can't talk to his psychology, but I think we can all speak to his depravity."" Later in the briefing, he apologized for the charged moment. ""I didn't mean to get emotional, I apologize for that. I don't want to make this about me. But I've been around the military a long, long time and I've known friends who didn't make it back. It's just hard,"" Kirby said. Kirby then redoubled his attack on Putin and the brutality he said has been carried out by his military -- accusations the Russians deny -- his demeanor visibly shifting from sorrowful to indignant. ""It's hard to square his, let's just call it what it is, his BS – that this is about Nazism in Ukraine, and it's about protecting Russians in Ukraine, and it's about defending Russian national interests, when none of them, none of them were threatened by Ukraine,"" he said, slamming his right hand to the podium to emphasize the final words. ""It's hard to square that rhetoric by what he's actually doing inside Ukraine to innocent people. Shot in the back of the head, hands tied behind their backs. Women, pregnant women being killed. Hospitals being bombed. I mean, it's just unconscionable. And I don't know ... I don't have the mental capacity to understand how you connect those two things. It's just beyond me,"" he said. He closed with a final apology. ""I'm just a spokesman,"" he said. ""I'm not qualified to make an assessment one way or the other, and I do apologize for injecting my personal perspective here.""",7

""Ultimately it was President Biden,"" Joey Reed, Trevor Reed's father, said in an interview Friday on ""Good Morning America."" ""We've said all along if we could just speak to the man, we think he would make this happen and that's exactly what happened. He did everything that we had said he would do and it's amazing and we can't thank him enough."" He added, ""We believe he may have saved Trevor's life."" Reed, a former Marine from Texas, was released from Russian prison on Wednesday as part of an international prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia. He had been held in Russia since 2019. Trevor Reed's family said they met with him on Thursday for a few hours. His mother, Paula Reed, said it was the first time they got to hug him, saying ""it was heaven."" The Reeds said they received a phone call early Thursday morning from Roger Carsten, the presidential envoy on hostage affairs, who handed the phone to Trevor Reed, who was on a plane headed to the U.S. Reed was arrested in Russia, while on a trip visiting his girlfriend, after Russian authorities alleged he grabbed the wheel of a police car and assaulted a police officer while drunk. Reed denied the allegations and maintained his innocence. A year later he was sentenced to nine years in prison. After several appeals he was moved from a Moscow prison to a remote prison colony. Reed was exchanged for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, a convicted drug trafficker. Reed's parents said their son has a long road to recovery, in an interview with ABC News' David Muir on Wednesday. He is currently in a medical facility receiving care, but his family did not have a complete update on his health on Friday. ""We don't really have a whole lot of answers yet. He's getting testing done. He is at a top-notch medical facility and getting great care so we're excited about that but we won't really know more for a few days,"" Paula Reed said. The Reeds lobbied for years for the U.S. to negotiate for their son's release, even personally pleading with Biden. Other Americans, including Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, are still being held in Russia. ""Our hearts go out to them and we can only imagine how disappointed they are that their loved ones didn't get to come home,"" Paula Reed said. She added that Whelan's release was the first thing her son brought up when the family spoke. ""He said he didn't feel well and we said, 'Do you mean physically?' He said, 'No, mom. I feel terrible that Paul still there and I'm here.' And he said when I get better, I'm going to start advocating for them to bring Paul home right away,'"" Paula Reed said.",2
2022-04-29,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/covid-politics-sour-biden-note/story?id=84372694,COVID politics sour for Biden: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Following the science is leading the Biden administration in some confusing directions just as the pandemic edges closer to the Oval Office. Start with the awkward timing: As President Joe Biden wants to signal a return to relative normal, he plans to attend Saturday night’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, while Vice President Kamala Harris remains in self-quarantine after having tested positive for COVID-19. Stay for the awkward politics: The White House’s contention that the economy is doing much better than people think looks much different in light of economic reports suggesting a recession could be near. Cue the awkward legal maneuverings: The administration is in court to try to lift a Trump-era border restrictions because the threat of the pandemic is receding and also to be allowed to reinstate the mask mandate covering public transportation -- all based on guidance from the CDC. There’s little to no consistency to Republican critics who want Biden and Democrats to stay away from public gatherings and jettison all mandates, while also insisting that COVID is enough of a threat to warrant immediate deportation of migrants arriving at the border. Still, the critiques from Democrats sting more -- particularly those in tough reelection races who say the Biden administration still has no plan for dealing with a border surge if Title 42 restrictions are lifted. And while economic jitters are seen as a strong reason for more COVID-19 relief funding and a whole lot more by some in the party, a familiar group of moderates doesn’t agree. It’s easy to see this weekend, with the president expected to engage in some self-deprecating fun in a dressed-up Washington, as some kind of pivot point in Washington’s relationship with COVID-19. But what direction things are turning in isn’t clear just yet. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper An answer on student loan debt forgiveness could be announced in the coming weeks, according to President Joe Biden. Details, however, are scant. When asked about if he was considering $50,000 in student debt cancellation -- an amount that progressives like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer have urged the president to forgive per borrower -- he said no, but he left open the possibility of other debt reduction measures. ""I am considering dealing with some debt reduction,"" Biden said. ""I am not considering $50,000 debt reduction, but I'm in the process of taking a hard look at whether or not there will be additional debt forgiveness."" It follows a meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus during which Biden said multiple times that he was prepared to extend the loan repayment moratorium and potentially issue executive actions to cancel a portion of borrowers' student loan debt, sources told ABC News. Earlier this month, the Biden administration extended the pause on federal student loan payments. Borrowers do not have to make payments until after Aug. 31, and interest will remain at 0% through that time. Payments were supposed to resume in May. The new summer date would have payments start up just a couple of months before the high-stakes midterm elections. White House press secretary Jen Psaki didn’t offer any further clarity later in the day when asked during a press briefing. ""Stay tuned and we'll see,"" she said. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The race for Indiana's first congressional district may not be the most high-profile political contest of the season, but that doesn't make it any less significant. The outcome of Tuesday's Republican primary could serve as a weathervane for potential Republican inroads in longtime blue strongholds. Over the last three presidential elections, Democratic candidates have won the district -- but have done so with gradually weakening margins. Following former President Barack Obama's 60-point win in 2012, Hillary Clinton's and Joe Biden's victories dropped to narrower margins that hovered around 54%. Incumbent Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan won his 2020 race with 57% of the vote and is expected to win again on May 3, but while Democrats have held the Gary, Indiana, area district since 1931, the crowded Republican primary field indicates a potential shift that could be in line with national political aftershocks. Out of the seven Republicans running in Tuesday's primary, the two leading candidates -- Jennifer-Ruth Green and Blair Milo -- are both veteran women who are making economic progress the central pillar of their campaigns. Milo touts her experience as the youngest mayor of LaPorte, Indiana, having flipped the Democratic office in 2011 at age 28. Meanwhile, Green has the support of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which featured her as an ""On The Radar"" candidate ahead of the primary and gave her the designation of a ""quality candidate"" by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Sen. Tom Cotton's endorsement of Green is yet another sign of Republicans making a serious play at flipping the district come November. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 41.

2022-05-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/infectious-disease-doctor-pulled-off-400-person-wedding/story?id=84427784,Infectious disease doctor pulled off 400-person wedding during omicron surge,"This is a MedPage Today story. For Manoj Jain, MD, MPH, an infectious disease specialist in Memphis, Tennessee, Memorial Day 2019 was a particularly meaningful day: His daughter, a lawyer based in Boston, became engaged to be married. The family looked forward to a large Indian wedding that was set for Memorial Day 2020. Then COVID-19 hit. The wedding was postponed and rescheduled. Then rescheduled again, and multiple times after that. In December 2021, Jain said he mentioned to his daughter and her fiancé that he didn't feel there was a way they could safely hold the event in late January 2022. Their response was devastating to hear. ""'Dad, if we don't do it now, we're not going to do it again,'"" Jain said his daughter told him. ""That whole statement made me think 'Oh, my gosh, I've got to plan something different.'"" Jain, an adjunct assistant professor at Emory University Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta, shared how he successfully pulled off a large-scale wedding at the height of the Omicron surge during a Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security webinar this week. ""This pandemic has had a professional toll on so many of us,"" Jain said, but added that personal events have prompted difficult questions as well, as people weigh whether to hold weddings, anniversary celebrations, and bar mitzvahs. ""That's been a huge challenge,"" he said. ""And [the wedding] has certainly been a big challenge for me."" Jain explained that he rallied his family together to devise a game plan to have the celebration -- and avoid having it become a superspreader event. Some of the parameters that were set for the event included: Jain explained that the family held a series of Zoom calls with potential attendees, breaking down those requirements, and that the personalized calls and messaging were crucial in making sure everyone agreed to the protocol. Out-of-town guests were required to complete a rapid test within 24 hours before leaving for Memphis, and then complete another rapid test and a PCR test with a 6- to 12-hour turnaround time. Local guests had to complete a PCR test 24-48 hours beforehand, or be tested at the wedding venue (a hotel) the day before the event (Jain said he worked with several of his laboratory assistants and a local lab to get the testing done). He reported that, out of some 400 guests, there were 10 positive cases identified through pre-festivities testing -- six prior to arrival, and four on arrival (one via rapid test; three via PCR). These people were told individually that they could not attend the wedding and all complied, Jain stated, adding ""Imagine if those 10 came to the wedding, what a superspreader that could have been."" Additionally, there were two invitees who had previously decided to not get vaccinated so the bride told them they could not attend, he said. Not surprisingly, Jain said that his biggest fear was that the bride or groom would test positive before the wedding. To limit the chances of that, the bride was in quarantine in the family home in the days before the wedding. She ate separately from other family members and wore a mask when she was with them. Jain said that he even asked the salon employees who were going to do the bride's make-up to undergo testing before she arrived for her appointment. A family member told Jain that he was overdoing some of the cautionary measures and that, as a result, no one would come to his daughter's wedding. ""The virus has no boundaries,"" Jain said he replied. He also noted that the hotel's ventilation system was out his hands, so the family opted to focus on the protective measures they could control. Jain said that the wedding went off without a hitch, and that none of the guests tested positive afterwards. While he acknowledged that he wasn't conducting a scientific study, anecdotal evidence matters. ""We can do a large event safely,"" he stressed. MedPage Today asked Jain if the recent lifting of mask mandates on public transportation, such as airplanes, would have changed his plans for the wedding. Jain reiterated the importance of masking. ""I think we need to continue the mask mandates on planes ... it's a terrible idea to give that up,"" he said. He added that his current concerns include uncertainty about the BA.2 subvariant, so, ""Masks are very simple ... they are very protective."" Jain said that he is hopeful that more families and friends will be able to gather safely in the months to come. ""We are resilient,"" he said. ""We will find ways to do things.""",17

""But we're also active, of course, in more than 80 countries around the world. ... We're working with farmers to also increase their production so that you actually have more supply brought on market."" ""But we really do need this financial support from the Congress to be able to meet emergency food needs,"" she later added, ""so we don't see the cascading deadly effects of Russia's war extend into Africa and beyond."" Russia and Ukraine are mass producers of wheat and grain. Power said Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East may rely on upwards of 80% to 90% of wheat and grain imports from the countries at war. Not only are there food shortages globally, but there is also a growing demand for fertilizer from farmers looking to protect their crops. ""Fertilizer shortages are real now because Russia is a big exporter of fertilizer. And even though fertilizer is not sanctioned, less fertilizer is coming out of Russia,"" Power said. ""As a result, we're working with countries to think about natural solutions like manure and compost. And this may hasten transitions that would have been in the interest of farmers to make eventually anyway."" Stephanopoulos pressed: ""Listening to you lay out these consequences, it's hard not to conclude that in some respects this has already become something of a world war."" ""Certainly in terms of effects, not confined to the horrors that the Ukrainian people are suffering,"" Power responded. Power pushed back on the idea that high food prices are due to the Biden administration's sanctions on Russia, saying instead it's the result of Russia's ""unwillingness now to come to the negotiating table."" ""That is what is causing these cascading effects,"" she said, ""so we want to meet those effects, but continue to ensure that that pressure is put on the Russian Federation through economic sanctions and through the security assistance so that they finally negotiate a peace."" Power, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Ukraine's European neighbors are handling the influx of Ukrainian refugees ""remarkably well,"" and the dire situation within Ukraine's borders is where the greatest hardship is. ""I think the bigger challenges lie within Ukraine,"" Power said. ""It goes without saying that in places like Mariupol that haven't been reached by meaningful humanitarian assistance in two months, where you have people dying of starvation, of dehydration,"" she said. ""You've seen images this week of babies who are wearing diapers that are plastic bags taped together as diapers and women so cold that they're in that steel plant wearing the uniforms of steel plant workers, shaking, having been injured, no access to trauma care,"" she added. ""I mean, those are the true horrors that are being perpetrated right now.""",7
2022-05-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-strong-crime-boosted-trust-inflation-poll/story?id=84403842,"GOP strong on crime, boosted by trust in inflation: POLL","Broad Republican advantages in trust to tame inflation and handle crime are keeping the party in a strong position for the 2022 midterm elections in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, albeit off the historic peak in vote preference the GOP attained last fall. Americans trust the Republican Party over the Democrats to handle inflation, by 19% points; the economy more generally, by 14 points; and crime, by a dozen points. Trust in the Republicans to handle crime is its highest (by a single point) in ABC/Post results back 32 years; trust on the economy, just slightly off its high two months ago. See PDF for full results, charts and tables. On the Democratic side, Joe Biden’s job approval as president remains underwater, but with a 5-point gain since February, aided by better ratings for handling the coronavirus pandemic (+7 points) and the war in Ukraine (+9). Still, 52% of Americans disapprove of Biden’s performance overall, versus 42% who approve. Those who “strongly” disapprove outnumber strong approvers by a 2-1 margin, potentially indicating motivation to vote in the fall. Moreover, with inflation its highest in 40 years, Biden’s rating for handling inflation is dramatically bad in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates: 68% of Americans disapprove. Fewer but still 57% disapprove of his work on the economy more broadly. Looking to November, registered voters divide essentially evenly between Democratic and Republican candidates for Congress, 46-45%. That’s a comedown for the GOP from its lead of 7 points in February and 10 points last November -- the latter, the largest Republican midterm advantage in ABC/Post polls back 40 years. The change is led by a close contest among political independents, swing voters in most national elections, from a 50-32% Republican lead in November to an even 42-42% now. That said, a close overall division in congressional vote preferences among registered voters in pre-election polls historically has been sufficient to signal strong Republican outcomes. That was the case in 2010, when the GOP gained 63 seats in the House; and 1994, when it gained 54 seats. (Less so in 2014, but still a 13-seat GOP win.) Inflation is a major irritant. Half of Americans are concerned about it; an additional 44%, not only concerned but upset about it. Just 6% are unconcerned. Views on inflation are associated with partisanship and vote preferences. Among registered voters who are upset about inflation (disproportionately Republicans), GOP House candidates lead their Democratic opponents by 63-26%. Among those who are concerned but not upset (plus the few who are unconcerned), this reverses to 62-30% for the Democrats. In another economic indicator, with unemployment nearly back to its pre-pandemic level, Americans by 50-43% think good-paying jobs are easy to find in their community. That doesn’t help the Democrats, though, because registered voters who say good jobs are available in their area favor Republican candidates by a 10-point margin. And comparatively few people are looking for jobs, while everyone’s paying higher prices. While the GOP leads on the economy and crime, the parties are essentially tied on the issue of immigration and close in trust to handle education. The Democrats have a lead on abortion (+10 points), worth watching as the Supreme Court readies a ruling on a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Democratic Party vaults to extensive leads on two other issues, both related to social equity: Equal treatment of racial and ethnic groups, on which it’s trusted over the Republican Party by 52-31%; and equal treatment of groups regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, a 55-26% Democratic advantage. Among groups, women generally are more apt than men to trust Democrats on the issues tested; in one example, the Republican Party has a 56-29% lead on the economy among men, compared with a split, 44-43%, among women. Similar to men, whites trust the GOP on the economy by 30 points; people in racial and ethnic minority groups favor the Democrats, but by a slimmer 11-point margin. Independents tilt Republican by 16 points; 15% of independents volunteer that they don’t trust either party on the economy. Biden’s approval rating does not place him in enviable company. Only one previous president at about this point in office had higher disapproval -- Donald Trump, at 56% -- in polls dating to the Truman administration. (Four of his 13 predecessors have had about Biden’s level of approval.) Looking at it another way doesn’t offer Democrats any more encouragement. While Biden’s standing just ahead of the November election remains to be seen, it’s currently similar to Trump’s going into his first midterm (40%; his party lost 40 seats). It’s worse than Barack Obama’s approval in October 2010 (50%, loss of 63 seats); Bill Clinton’s in 1994 (48%, loss of 54 seats) and Ronald Reagan’s in 1982 (49%, loss of 26 seats). The exception is Jimmy Carter, who lost fewer seats, but still 15, in his first midterm, with 49% approval. There’s time, of course, for Biden’s approval rating to change. Specifically on the economy, Biden’s poor rating is essentially unchanged from February; it includes a 25-point deficit among independents. In terms of his even worse rating on inflation, 38% within his own party disapprove, as do 42% of liberals, a stalwart Democratic group. Disapproval on inflation rises to 65% among moderates, 74% among independents and nine in 10 Republicans and conservatives alike. Again, given low unemployment, Biden does less poorly -- but not well -- on creating jobs; 41% approve, 46% disapprove. His rating is similar on handling the war in Ukraine, 42-47%, approve-disapprove. In this case, while still underwater, approval is up 9 points since February, with a corresponding drop in those with no opinion. Disapproval is unchanged. Biden peeks above 50% on handling one remaining issue tested in this survey, the pandemic: Here he has a 51-43% approval rating, a turnaround from 44-50% as the Omicron variant raged two months ago. Overall, as mentioned, Biden’s general job approval rating is up 5 points, to 42%, from his low as president in February. That includes his best rating among Hispanic people (62% approve) since just after he took office and +9 points since February among urban residents. This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone April 24-28, 2022, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,004 adults, including 907 registered voters.

2022-05-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/majorities-favor-support-ukraine-broad-concerns-impacts-poll/story?id=84405185,Majorities favor support for Ukraine despite broad concerns about impacts: POLL,"Concerns about escalation and economic consequences of the war in Ukraine loom large in U.S. public opinion, even as majorities of Americans favor increased support for Ukraine, particularly in terms of humanitarian aid and further economic sanctions on Russia. Fifty-five percent in this ABC News/Washington Post poll also favor increased military support, even as 8 in 10 express worries about a wider war or the possible use of nuclear weapons by Russia. As many also worry about direct U.S. military involvement, a step most by far rule out. See PDF for full results, charts and tables. Economically, two-thirds are very or somewhat concerned that sanctions against Russia will contribute to higher food and energy prices in the United States. Yet, two-thirds also support increasing such sanctions, a sign of commitment to Ukraine’s cause. Indeed, among those who are concerned about price impacts, 64% support sanctions anyway. Despite public concerns, majorities think the United States should take further action to support Ukraine on several measures in this poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates. Leading the list, three-quarters back increased humanitarian support, with, as noted, two-thirds for increased economic sanctions and 55% for greater military support. (As with humanitarian support, the nature of potential military support wasn’t specified.) Notably, support for the United States providing each of these items reaches majorities across partisan lines, with single-digit differences between Democrats and Republicans on sanctions and military support. Democrats are 12% points more supportive of increased humanitarian aid. Given another option, just 21% of Americans overall think the United States should take direct military action against Russian forces in Ukraine. This declines to 14% if it meant risking a nuclear war. More generally, the public divides on whether the United States is doing too little (37%) or the right amount (36%) to support Ukraine. Fourteen percent say it’s doing too much. There’s a partisan split on this question, with 47% of Republicans saying the United States is doing too little, compared with 29% of Democrats. Independents fall in between. Among other groups, women are 16 to 22 points more apt than men to express concern about each of the items tested -- the war expanding into other countries, U.S. forces getting involved, Russia using nuclear weapons and sanctions raising food and fuel prices. Concerns about price impacts of higher sanctions peak among more economically vulnerable Americans -- those with no more than a high school diploma (77%) or with annual household incomes less than $50,000 (76%) -- as well as among women (77%). Support for increased sanctions, in turn, is lower among less well-off adults, 60%, versus 77% in top-income households.

2022-05-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-poll-uptick-meets-eye-note/story?id=84429865,Biden poll uptick likely less than meets the eye: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll contains a rare dose of bright news for Democrats – a president with an approval rate nosing up, and the party back to parity with Republicans on the generic congressional ballot. But the reality, barely six months out from the midterms, remains grim for the party in power. That’s evident both inside the same polling numbers and in the pending legislative agenda that continues to pit different segments of the Democratic base against themselves. President Joe Biden gained 5 percentage points in his overall approval rating since February in the ABC/Post polling, but remains underwater by 10 points, 42-52% approve-disapprove. Democrats clawed back 10 points in congressional preference since last November, to a 46-45% virtual tie among all voters and a 42-42% deadlock among independents, yet that’s a good measure beneath levels that historically have led to Democrats controlling the House. On what might be the single biggest issue, a whopping 94% say they’re either “upset” or “concerned” by inflation. Biden’s approval rating on that issue is upside-down by 40 points, 28-68% approve-disapprove, while Republicans hold a 19-point edge on trust to handle inflation and 14 points on handling the economy. The new poll shows relative strength for the president on handling the war in Ukraine and COVID. But while Biden is framing his latest massive spending asks on both fronts as urgent, both could snag on intra-party divisions on immigration and Title 42 in Congress, as Democrats fear the same forces at play in this poll and more. The president poked fun at his polling at Saturday’s White House Correspondents Association dinner: “I’m really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have.” Democrats have been looking for positive signs to shape their messaging. With midterm voting starting in earnest this week, it’s not yet clear that they’re getting closer to finding them. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As primary day approaches in Ohio, early voting numbers in the state could be a sign of things to come during the general election. According to data released by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, Republicans outnumber Democrats in early in-person voting, the number of absentee ballots requested, and the number of ballots submitted. In comparison to 2018, Republican participation in the early vote is slightly up, while Democratic participation is down by a larger margin. Republican voters requested 91,365 ahead of the May 3 primary, in comparison 91,050 in 2018. Democrats have only requested 87,693 ballots, in contrast to 115,005 in 2018. While this could be a byproduct of the slew of competitive (not to mention expensive) GOP primaries in the state, like the senate race, it could also be indicative of the levels of enthusiasm of voters for each party. According to the latest ABC/Washington Post Poll, 52% of Americans disapprove of Biden’s performance overall, versus 42% who approve. Those who “strongly” disapprove outnumber strong approvers by a 2-1 margin, potentially indicating motivation to vote in the fall. The jury is still out if Ohio lives up to its history as a swing state. As Democrats approach these high-stakes midterm elections, which historically don’t favor the party in power, the enthusiasm gap should be a major concern. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Speaker Nancy Pelosi reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to Ukraine with a surprise weekend visit to the war-torn country alongside a group of House Democrats. The visit marked the first trip by a congressional delegation since the start of the war in late February. ""We believe that we are visiting you to say thank you for your fight for freedom. That we are on a frontier of freedom and that your fight is a fight for everyone and so our commitment is to be there for you until your fight is done,” said Pelosi during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The trip by Pelosi — who is third in line to the presidency and is the highest-ranking American official to visit Kyiv yet— came just days after Biden called on Congress to approve $33 billion of additional funding in aid for Ukraine. Despite bipartisan support, the request from the White House could end up getting tangled in other legislative debates. A similar dovetail appears to be evident in the American public's perception of the ongoing conflict abroad. According to the latest polling by ABC News/Washington Post, 55% of Americans favor increased military support for Ukraine and 76% support an increase in humanitarian aid. However, Americans express paralleling concerns about the war —81% are concerned about the war expanding to other countries, and 66% are worried about sanctions contributing to higher economic costs.

2022-05-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-meets-parents-american-journalist-austin-tice-abducted/story?id=84448315,Biden meets with parents of American journalist Austin Tice who was abducted in Syria,"The parents of Austin Tice, an American journalist and Marine Corps veteran abducted in Syria, have already been waiting almost a decade for their son to return home. After a public plea for support over the weekend, President Joe Biden wasted no time, saying on Monday he would meet with them ""today."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki provided more details on the meeting after it took place, saying in a statement that ""the president reiterated his commitment to continue to work through all available avenues to secure Austin's long overdue return to his family."" Psaki added that Biden's national security team ""will remain in regular contact"" with the Tice family, as well as the families of other hostages. The heightened attention to Tice's case comes after the head of the White House Correspondents' Association paid tribute to him during the group's annual dinner on Saturday, asking his mother to stand and be acknowledged as the president looked on. Later in the evening, during his own remarks, Biden said that he would like to meet with her and Tice's father. ""After the President made those comments, obviously we went into action to work to set up the meeting on Sunday and see if Debra and Mark Tice -- Austin's parents -- would be available,"" Psaki said during a briefing. That high-profile moment at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner took place just days after Trevor Reed, an American and former Marine held captive in Russia for nearly two years, was freed as part of an international prisoner exchange --a deal that fell into place weeks after Reed's parents had a White House meeting with the president of their own. The Tices have previously met with National Security adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but Psaki called the audience with Biden ""an additional and more significant step."" State Department Spokesperson Ned Price added that the meeting was a testament to the administration's commitment to bring Tice back home, adding ""he has been away from his family for far too long, and we're doing everything we can to see that comes to a successful conclusion."" But Tice's imprisonment poses unique challenges. Reed's release was the result of months of intense negotiations within Moscow. But the U.S. has not had a formal diplomatic relationship with Syria since the onset of the country's civil war in 2012 -- something Tice's mother has voiced frustration over in prior interviews. Despite that complication, Price said the U.S. could still secure Tice's freedom. ""You didn't hear us share the details of those consultations before [Trevor Reed] was released. We do believe that we can best and most effectively achieve potentially successful outcomes if we do have space to conduct private conversations,"" Price said. ""We of course don't have, I would say, fully normal relations with Moscow at this time and yet we were able to have a discrete, focused set of discussions regarding the effort to free Trevor Reed that ultimately were successful."" Tice disappeared in 2012 while covering the Free Syrian Army, a group of Syrian military officials who had joined the opposition against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A month later, a video was released showing him blindfolded, removed from a car and led by armed men up a hill, saying ""Oh, Jesus."" He has not been publicly heard from since. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading directly to the safe location, recovery and return of Tice.",15
2022-05-03,https://abcnews.go.com/US/paul-whelan-wondering-left-russia-brother/story?id=84442718,"Paul Whelan still wondering why he was left behind in Russia, brother says","Even though the U.S. successfully negotiated the release of Trevor Reed from a Russian prison, after nearly three years of captivity, the brother of another detained American isn't sure that his family member will follow suit. David Whelan, the brother of Paul Whelan, who's been held by Russian officials since 2019, gave an update on his sibling's condition to ABC News on Monday. Paul Whelan spoke with his parents after Reed's release and said the news was hard for him, according to David Whelan. ""He asked, 'Why was I left behind?' And we still don't really have a good answer for that,"" David Whelan told ABC News. Paul Whelan was discharged from the Marines for bad conduct in 2008 after being convicted of larceny. He later worked as a global security executive for the auto parts supplier BorgWarner. He was arrested in December 2018 while visiting Moscow for a friend's wedding and charged with espionage by Russian intelligence officials. Paul Whelan and American officials have denied the charges. Paul Whelan, an avid traveler who has Irish, British and Canadian citizenship, visited Russia numerous times in the 2010s, and previously told ABC News he was intrigued by the country's the language and culture. In June 2020, Paul Whelan was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian prison camp. His family has repeatedly called for his release. Reed was also arrested in Moscow in 2019 after Russian authorities said he struck an officer. Reed and American officials refuted the charges. Reed's parents pushed President Joe Biden to bring him back home with a prisoner transfer. Last week, that request was fulfilled. Reed was exchanged for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, a convicted drug trafficker. Joey and Paula Reed, Trevor Reed's parents, also advocated for Whelan during their discussions with the president and other officials. David Whelan said now that Yaroshenko has been released to the Russians, he is concerned there are fewer concessions the U.S. can make. ""I think those sorts of negotiations, they take time, and they're also very sensitive. It's not just a matter of who's involved,"" David Whelan said. ""It's not really clear what their next steps are going to be."" Biden has repeatedly called for Paul Whelan to be released and reiterated his commitment to bringing him back last week after Reed was released. David Whelan said he hasn't spoken with Biden recently but did talk with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken over the weekend. ""Hearing President Biden last summer in Geneva say that he wouldn't walk away from Paul's case, [and] hearing him this week on Wednesday say that he was still going to be working to bring Paul home to his loved ones, that's really important for us,"" David Whelan said. ""That sort of outreach, both in private and in public is huge for us."" The U.S. has also called on Russia to release WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was arrested in Russia in February, right before the invasion of Ukraine, on drug charges. David Whelan said he hopes the U.S. can bring back American citizens who are in similar situations. ""Paul is one of dozens and dozens who are arbitrarily detained by sovereign nations around the world. And they're all very tricky, each one."" he said.",2
2022-05-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/scotus-bombshell-lands-ohio-tests-trump-biden-note/story?id=84448801,SCOTUS bombshell lands as Ohio tests Trump and Biden: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Political movements and party practicalities tend to collide in unpredictable ways -- all the more so with a bombshell about the Supreme Court landing on the midterm landscape just as voting heats up. So it is that the first major primary voting of 2022 will test the style of both the current and most recent presidents inside their respective parties, at a time of less predictability than ever about how the biggest issues will play. With polls open in Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday, voters will start to sort through the complicated paths both men present, only now with new urgency around the issue of abortion, given Politico’s reporting of what appears to be a draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade. On the louder and far more expensive GOP side in Ohio, former President Donald Trump could win both the battle and the war in the Senate race -- yet take neither in the race for governor. Whatever he may call him at a rally, Trump’s support for J.D. Vance vaulted him into front-running status for the seat now held by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio. Even if Vance doesn’t win, the nominee could well be a Trump-aligned Republican who endorses falsehoods about the last election. Yet Gov. Mike DeWine -- a throwback to a pre-Trump GOP era -- seems likely to survive a Trump-inspired (though not endorsed) challenge to his COVID governance and establishment leanings. As for President Joe Biden, he chose to hand out only his second primary endorsement of the cycle to Rep. Shontel Brown in her rematch against progressive powerhouse Nina Turner, a close ally of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden hasn’t endorsed in the Senate primary, but he probably didn’t need to. Rep. Tim Ryan has embraced the president’s wing of the party while cruising against two Black women who support canceling student loan debt and Medicare-for-all – and also expanding the number of Supreme Court justices. New ABC News/Washington Post polling out Tuesday shows that 60% of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents want the GOP to follow Trump’s leadership – about where that’s been since he left office. By contrast, only about 53% of Democrats and independents who lean that way want to follow Biden’s leadership, with younger Democrats most solidly favoring a new direction. Primary season begins with memories of 2020 still close to the surface -- and fresh reminders that the realities of 2022 are still being shaped. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As primary voters in Ohio cast their ballots, candidates from both parties have their eyes on the general election and are looking to take advantage of newly drawn districts. Ohio's 13th Congressional District, which has been represented by Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan for nearly a decade, has now taken a very different shape. New boundaries give Republicans a better shot at picking up the seat. ""It's not the Democratic district that it was before,"" said Paul Beck, an Ohio State University political science professor. Madison Gesiotto Gilbert, a Republican candidate and former Miss Ohio with former President Trump's endorsement, is looking to capitalize on that red shift in the crowded GOP primary and, she hopes, in the general election. ""When it comes to what's going on the past couple years people are very frustrated,"" she said. ""And honestly, that's part of why I got into the race."" State Rep. Emilia Sykes, the lone Democrat in the race, is angling to make the most of the collective voting power in Summit County, which includes her hometown, Akron, and is one of the state's largest counties by population. Rather than being split into several different districts, the reliably blue county is now covered by just one. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Although Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose once told the Cleveland Plain Dealer it is ""irresponsible when Republicans say an election was stolen and don't have evidence"" in the fallout from the 2020 election, the Republican incumbent still received Trump's endorsement for his reelection campaign. ""I think President Trump is incredibly influential here in Ohio. He won by an overwhelming margin, in a secure election -- he got over 8%, that's a record-setting 3 million votes in the state of Ohio,"" LaRose said in an interview on ABC News Live on Monday touting the endorsement. As Trump increasingly wades into state-level political contests, the shift in rhetoric by LaRose demonstrates an attempt to bridge the divide between sentiments of election denial expressed by many of Trump's supporters with the wishes of broad swaths of Republicans who want to see the party move on from focusing on 2020. In doing so, LaRose appears to be superimposing Trump's comments into existing voting parameters that he backs as the state's top elections official. ""In some states they have, I would say foolishly, decided to send absentee ballots to everybody whether they asked for one or not. We don't do that in Ohio. If you want to vote from the comfort of home, that's available to you. You have to prove your identity when you do that. And we also maintain accurate voter rolls in Ohio, so Ohio does this right. That's not just me talking, that's what President Trump said when he was interviewed a year ago,"" LaRose said. The race is yet another example of formerly quiet state contests reaching national prominence. Last month, a Trump-backed, election-denying Michigan candidate for secretary of state, Kristina Karamo, was nominated by her state's Republican Party to face off with incumbent Democrat Jocelyn Benson. Meanwhile, in Georgia, incumbent GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is facing Trump-backed primary challenger Rep. Jody Hice after Raffensperger refused to help overturn Biden's 2020 victory. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 26. That's the number of full-blown election deniers running in Indiana and Ohio's Republican primaries for seats in the Senate, House and for governor Tuesaday, according to research from FiveThirtyEight and ABC News.

2022-05-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-touts-economic-growth-debt-deficit-reduction-ahead/story?id=84492487,"Biden touts economic growth, debt and deficit reduction ahead of Fed rate hike","President Joe Biden on Wednesday said that the federal government will pay down the national debt this quarter for the first time in six years. His remarks on economic growth came ahead of the Federal Reserve announcing a hike in interest rates Wednesday afternoon in an attempt to manage soaring inflation. ""Bringing down the deficit is one way to ease inflationary pressures in an economy, where a consequence of a war and gas prices and oil, food, and it all – it's just a different world right this moment because of Ukraine and Russia,"" Biden said. Inflation is a big political problem for him and fellow Democrats ahead of the midterm elections as Republicans try to capitalize on soaring energy prices. ""For all the talk the Republicans make about deficits, it didn't happen a single quarter under my predecessor, not once,"" Biden said. ""The bottom line is the deficit went up every year under my predecessor, before the pandemic and during the pandemic, snd it's gone down both years since I have been here. Period. There are the facts."" Biden's remarks from the White House come after the Treasury Department updated estimates this week to project that the U.S. deficit will fall by over $1.5 trillion this year, a revision from the $1.3 trillion projected in Biden's budget. He credited the American Rescue Plan for growing the economy, though that relief bill has also been criticized for contributing to current inflation problems. ""Looking ahead, I plan to reduce the deficit even more which will help reduce inflationary measures and lower the cost for everyone's families,"" Biden said, as he tries to revive a stalled legislative agenda in Congress. A White House official said, ""This deficit reduction is occurring because the robust economic recovery means earnings and incomes are higher, which is increasing revenue, and because the Administration is winding down emergency spending."" ""There is no reason why a billionaire should be paid a lower tax rate than a teacher or firefighter,"" Biden said Wednesday. ""That is a sharp contrast to what's today's Republican Party is offering."" Raising a plan released by Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott, Biden blasted what he called ""this ultra-MAGA agenda,"" which he said would raise costs for Americans families The budget deficit fell by more than $350 billion in Biden's first year, according to the White House, but with inflation at a 40-year high, Republicans are hitting Biden on the economy as the 2022 midterm election cycle kicks off and Americans are still paying more at the pump. In an effort to manage inflation, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise the short-term interest rate by a half-percentage point Wednesday -- double the usual amount and the sharpest rate hike since 2000, meaning it will soon cost Americans more to buy big-ticket items like cars and homes. The annual deficit has expanded to around $3 trillion due to the pandemic's blow on the economy, with the gross national debt surpassing $30 trillion for the first time earlier this year. Former President Donald Trump's massive tax cut in 2017 has added more than $1 trillion to the debt by some estimates -- a point Biden hit head on.

2022-05-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trevor-reeds-father-advocates-white-house-detained-americans/story?id=84502919,Trevor Reed's father advocates outside White House for other detained Americans,"The father of Trevor Reed, the American freed from Russia in a prisoner exchange last week, on Wednesday demonstrated outside the White House, calling for the Biden administration to help other Americans held hostage overseas, including two U.S. citizens still detained in Russia, Paul Whelan and WNBA star Brittney Griner. Trevor Reed, a 30-year-old former Marine, was released last week after nearly three years in detention in Russia, where he was imprisoned on charges that his family and the U.S. government said were trumped up. He arrived home in Texas last Thursday after being traded for a Russian pilot who had been serving a lengthy sentence in the U.S. for a drug-smuggling conviction. Reed is currently at a military base in San Antonio, receiving counseling and support as part of a reintegration program. Despite reuniting with his son less than a week ago, Reed's father Joey Reed and his daughter, Taylor Reed, travelled to Washington, D.C., Wednesday to join the demonstration with families of Americans detained in several countries, including Venezuela, Iran, China, Rwanda. Joey Reed said he had come to urge the Biden administration to repeat what it had done for his son and to put a spotlight on the cases of the families of other detainees. ""We think there's at least 16 cases of detainees and hostages where an exchange would bring them home tomorrow,"" Reed told ABC News. He also called on President Joe Biden to meet with the families of other hostages as he did with the Reeds, saying he felt that had been pivotal in persuading the administration to go ahead with the exchange that freed his son. ""We believe that was the complete tipping point was when we met with him,"" he told ABC News. ""He's a personable guy. You know, he's compassionate, kind. Meet with these families like they met with us."" Joey Reed said he had come at the insistence of his son, who is passionate about freeing Whelan, the other former U.S. Marine still held in Russia and who was not part of last week's prisoner exchange. Reed's release has renewed focus on the cases of Whelan and Griner, who the U.S. government believes were seized by Russia as bargaining chips. Whelan has been detained in Russia since 2018 and is currently in a prison camp, sentenced to 16 years on espionage charges that the U.S. government and his family say were fabricated. Griner was arrested at a Moscow airport in February when Russian police alleged they found vape cartridges in her luggage containing hashish oil, a substance illegal in Russia. This week, the State Department reclassified Griner as ""wrongfully detained,"" a designation that allows it to begin negotiating for her release and disregards the Russian criminal case against her. Reed was freed in an exchange for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian cargo plane pilot who was jailed in the U.S. in 2011, after he was seized in a DEA sting operation and convicted of plotting to smuggle large quantities of cocaine. Since 2018, Russia had repeatedly floated Yaroshenko as a possible candidate for a prisoner trade for Reed and Whelan. But Russia has also pressed for Viktor Bout, the Russian arms dealer dubbed ""the Merchant of Death,"" who is currently serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. on drugs and terrorism charges. Most experts believe Bout -- one of the world's most notorious arms dealers -- is a more difficult trade for the U.S. to accept. The U.S. is generally reluctant to make prisoner exchanges in hostage case out of a fear of encouraging hostile governments to seize more Americans. But Joey Reed said his son's case showed the U.S. could be more open to making exchanges if it can get Americans home. ""We just want a trade so they can bring Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner home tomorrow. And we hope that they're working, towards that and that Trevor was just the beginning of a lot of Americans being repatriated with their country and their families,"" Joey Reed said. Whelan's sister, Elizabeth Whelan, was also at Wednesday's demonstration and said it was ""wonderful"" Reed had been released and gave her hope for her brother. ""I do think Trevor Reed's release showed that sort of trade was possible. But I think mostly to us it signaled that tools are available,"" she said. ""So, we're just asking the White House, the administration to do whatever is [possible], use whatever tools are at their disposal to bring Paul home. And the same goes for everyone. She said she had met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan at the White House before the demonstration and that the meeting had been encouraging. Asked about the efforts to free detained Americans, State Department spokesman Ned Price on Wednesday said, ""What I can say is that we are doing everything we can -- almost all of it unseen, almost all of it unsaid in public -- to do everything we can to advance the commitment that President Biden has to see these Americans who were wrongfully or unjustly detained around the world -- or in some cases held hostage around the world -- brought home."" Among the families represented the event were several whose relatives are held in Venezuela, including Alirio and Jose Luis Zambrano, Jorge Toledo, Tomeu Vadell, Matthew Heath, Jose Angel Pereira, Airan Berry and Luke Denman. Relatives of Siamak and Baquer Namazi, and Morad Tahbaz, also called for help in freeing them from Iran. One by one the families stood at a microphone and described the pain of struggling to free their loved ones and pleaded with the Biden administration to act urgently. Several said, Reed's release had given them hope. Neda Shargi, whose brother, Emad, is serving a 10-year sentence in Iran, addressed Reed directly, saying: ""If Trevor is watching this we are so grateful to you for being strong enough to come back. And for having your parents here. Trevor, it's because of you that we have hope."" ABC News' Shannon Crawford contributed to this report.",2
2022-05-04,https://abcnews.go.com/US/dr-ozs-vote-2018-turkish-election-renews-criticism/story?id=84326742,Dr. Oz's vote in 2018 Turkish election renews criticism,"As Dr. Mehmet Oz embarks on a bid for the U.S. Senate, the television star has largely shied away from discussing his ties to Turkey, where he maintains citizenship, and dismissed criticism from political opponents that he harbors any so-called ""dual loyalties."" But a photograph of Oz casting a ballot in Turkey's 2018 presidential election is rankling some national security experts -- particularly after recently saying he has ""never been politically involved in Turkey in any capacity."" ""The decision to vote in a foreign country's election is problematic from a security clearance perspective,"" according to John V. Berry, a former government lawyer with expertise in federal security clearances. After a rocky start to his campaign, Oz recently earned a coveted endorsement from former President Donald Trump, bolstering his chances of capturing the Republican nod. But political opponents have continued to target his connections to Turkey -- a strategy the Oz campaign and others have called xenophobic smears. If elected, Oz has said he would renounce his Turkish citizenship. When asked about the photograph, which appeared in June 2018 on the Facebook page of Turkey's consulate in Manhattan, Brittany Yanick, an Oz campaign spokesperson, confirmed its authenticity to ABC News and confirmed that Oz did vote in the 2018 election. According to Yanick, Oz voted for opposition candidate Muharrem Ince in his unsuccessful campaign against Turkish President Recep Tayyep Erdogan. She denied that Oz's vote amounted to ""political involvement."" ""Voting in an election is far different from being actively engaged in the political work of the Turkish government, which Dr. Oz has never been involved with,"" Yanick told ABC News. ""There is no security issue whatsoever."" Elected officials are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny as civilians who seek security clearances for sensitive government work; once sworn-in, lawmakers are granted access to classified information, unless the executive branch denies them certain information. But the background check process for civilians can also ""provide a framework for analyzing whether someone is trustworthy or not,"" according to Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, a nonprofit public interest law firm. And for McClanahan, voting in another country's election would set off a ""giant, flashing red light."" Born and raised in Ohio, Oz has said that he maintains dual U.S.-Turkey citizenship to care for his mother in Turkey, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. He also served in the Turkish army for 60 days in the early 1980s -- reportedly to retain his Turkish citizenship -- and maintains real estate holdings in Turkey, plus has an endorsement deal the country's national airline, Turkish Airlines. ""Any single one of those would be enough to torpedo a [security] clearance,"" McClanahan said. ""Taken together, I would not put good odds on that person getting a clearance anywhere."" Turkish voting records indicate that the 2018 presidential election was the first in which Oz participated. Prior to the 2014 election, Turks living abroad could only vote by returning home or by visiting polling stations set up on Turkey's borders. Yanick, the campaign spokesperson, said Oz did not plan to vote in the 2018 election, but decided to cast a ballot while at the consulate discussing his ""humanitarian work on behalf of Syrian refugees in Turkey."" ""It was during an election season, so he voted,"" Yanick said. Other security experts ABC News spoke with expressed less concern with Oz's 2018 vote. Steve Aftergood, a senior analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, said that because Oz has been transparent about his ties to Turkey, his dual citizenship alone is more of a political concern for him than a risk to national security. ""The fact that [Oz] has made no effort to conceal his dual citizenship counts in his favor,"" Aftergood said. ""Voters will have an opportunity to decide whether or not it is of concern to them."" Security experts that ABC News consulted emphasized that the country in question matters when considering potential foreign influence risks. A person's ties to Turkey, a NATO member and strategic ally to the U.S., present far less of a threat than China or Russia. But in recent years, Turkish President Erdogan has demonstrated increasingly authoritarian behavior, jailing journalists and summarily silencing opposition voices. Erdogan has also strained ties with the U.S. by purchasing Russian weapons systems. Richard Grenell, the former Director of National Intelligence under President Trump, characterized Oz's understanding of Turkey an asset in the fight against authoritarianism. ""It is frankly un-American to suggest that first- and second-generation Americans are unworthy or suspect to work as a U.S. official,"" Grenell said. ""They've seen fascism and totalitarianism and are actually more clear-eyed about what is at stake."" Background check investigators consider ""the totality of circumstances"" when investigating those seeking security clearances, said Sean Bigley, a national security lawyer and former Trump-appointee to the National Security Education Board. Bigley said Oz's portfolio of risk would likely include his existing financial ties to Turkey. According to financial disclosures submitted in April, Oz owns several hundreds of thousands of dollars in real estate property in Turkey, including a building he has leased out to the Turkish Ministry of Education for free. The building is being used as a student dormitory, according to his disclosure form, and ""is subject to pending trust and estate litigation."" The disclosure form also shows Oz scored a lucrative endorsement contract with Turkish Airlines, Turkey's national flag-carrying airline. Experts say the air carrier has grown increasingly close to Erdogan since 2018, when he named himself chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a 49% stake. In 2018, Oz appeared in a Super Bowl advertisement for Turkish Airlines, and in 2021, he appeared in a four-minute informational discussing the airline's COVID-19 safety protocols as a brand ambassador. Any wealth Oz has accumulated from his interests in Turkey, including the airline deal, would reflect only a small amount of his full financial picture. In all, Oz's disclosure shows that he and his spouse together own between $104 and $422 million in various assets and holdings. Even so, Bigley said, ""if I were advising [Oz], I would suggest divesting from any assets or ... financial ties with any entity of the Turkish government."" Oz has faced criticism for not using his celebrity prominence as a platform for denouncing Erdogan's clampdowns on opposition and other democratic backsliding. Some suggest that Oz's continuing financial interests in Turkey create a disincentive for him to criticize its leadership, as doing so could put Oz at risk of having his Turkish assets seized. ""It is the nature of the Turkish system and authoritarian systems more generally that folks who do not want to be targeted by the state kowtow to leaders or keep their mouth shut,"" said Steven Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""There are many examples of people who have dared to criticize Erdogan who have been forcibly divested."" Nicholas Danforth, a non-resident fellow at the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, an Athens-based think tank, agreed. ""If you wanted to have a lucrative career as a spokesman for Turkish Airlines, you certainly couldn't say anything negative about Erdogan,"" Danforth said. According to several news reports published since launching his campaign, Oz has met with Erdogan on at least two occasions, in 2014 and 2018, and attended events with officials in Erdogan's party. Oz has said that attending these functions was normal for a Turkish-American of his stature. Asked whether Oz had taken a public stance against Erdogan, Yanick provided ABC News with comments Oz made at a January 2022 campaign event in which he said he ""would be the harshest critic of Erdogan"" in the Senate. ""The country that I respected when I was growing up -- Turkey, the country my father left -- was a secular country where there was no significant Islamic rule elements, period,"" he said. ""And it was not a dictatorship."" Hailed in the West as a charismatic leader with the potential to return Turkey to its secular roots, Muharrem Ince fell to Erdogan in the 2018 election by a substantial margin -- 52 percent to 30. Ince attracted support from a broad coalition of anti-Erdogan parties, but also expressed some controversial opinions -- including an interest in rebuilding ties with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""Ince was hardly a paragon of democracy, human rights, and tolerance,"" said Cook. As one of Turkey's most recognizable figures in the West, Oz is not the first high-profile candidate to face accusations of a so-called ""dual loyalty,"" a claim reminiscent of attacks against Catholics, Jews and members of other religious and ethnic groups in previous generations. During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump accused Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, of maintaining dual loyalties to Canada, his country of birth, even though Cruz had renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014. Trump has not expressed any similar concern for Oz's arrangement.",12
2022-05-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/richardson-helping-free-wnba-star-brittney-griner-detention/story?id=84518602,Richardson helping to free WNBA star Brittney Griner from detention in Russia,"In her struggle for freedom from detention in Russia, WNBA star Brittney Griner now has another big name in her corner: former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson. A spokesperson for the Richardson Center confirmed to ABC News that the international hostage negotiator was working on Griner's case, adding that her family asked for his assistance. Richardson, who has also previously served as congressman, energy secretary, and governor of New Mexico, has carried out diplomatic missions to bring back Americans from Cuba, Iraq and North Korea. Recently, he was credited with playing a critical part in securing the release of Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine who was held in a Russian prison for over two years. While Richardson's direct role in Griner's case was first reported this week, he suggested at his involvement in an interview with ABC's Linsey Davis following Reed's release last week. ""The U.S. government is trying. On private efforts, we're trying. I think this Trevor Reed initiative helps,"" Richardson said on April 27. ""Now the Russians are going to want something in return, and it's very murky what has happened. But she deserves to come home."" On Tuesday, Griner's 75th day in Russian custody, the State Department said it would reclassify her case as a ""wrongful detention,"" signaling the U.S. would now play a more active role in negotiating for her release. ""We appreciate all of those who are very invested in this case, and Brittney Griner is fortunate to have a network who has supported her from Day One. We have worked very closely with that network,"" said department spokesman Ned Price. ""We do often partner with various individuals and organizations on these cases,"" Price added. ""We welcome all of those efforts that are coordinated closely with us that might help to seek the safe release of any American who's unjustly detained around the world."" Griner’s agent Lindsay Kagawa Colas said in a statement on Tuesday “our expectation is that the White House do whatever is necessary to bring her home.” Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was visiting Russia to play basketball off-season and was arrested in February at a Moscow area airport for allegedly having vape cartridges in her luggage that contained hashish oil -- an illegal substance in Russia. She is facing drug charges with up to 10 years in prison, according to Russian media reports, and her pre-trial detention was extended in March to May 19.

2022-05-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-seek-claim-working-class-senate-battles-note/story?id=84498980,Democrats seek new claim on working class in Senate battles: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Shortly after securing his party's nomination late Tuesday, one candidate for Senate released a video accusing his rival of liking San Francisco more than Ohio, favoring ""globalization and free trade"" and reveling in appearances on CNN and at ""Washington cocktail parties."" His party affiliation might surprise a few folks. Those were the words of Democratic nominee Tim Ryan, squaring up against Trump-backed Republican J.D. Vance in what figures to be a populist showdown in Ohio where the Democrat will not surrender working-class votes. It's emerging as a trend in key Senate races -- in part because of the types of candidates the GOP, under the influence of former President Donald Trump, is putting forward. Vance rose to prominence on the ""Hillbilly Elegy"" tale of him leaving rural Ohio for Yale Law School and working for Peter Theil's venture capital firm. In Pennsylvania, Trump's choice is Dr. Mehmet Oz, a celebrity doctor and longtime resident of New Jersey who -- as ABC News reported Wednesday -- voted in the Turkish presidential election as recently as 2018. Another frontrunner is David McCormick, a former consultant and hedge-fund manager who worked in the Bush administration and whose wife worked for Trump. The leading Democrat in the primary later this month is Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a 6-foot-nine-inch heavily tattooed former small-town mayor. In Georgia, the odds-on favorite for the Republican Senate nomination is Herschel Walker, a football legend who played for the University of Georgia but who lived outside Dallas, Texas, for much of the last decade. Walker is seeking to run against Sen. Raphael Warnock, senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church -- the storied spiritual home of Martin Luther King, Jr. -- since 2005. The Democrats emerging this primary season will find themselves drafting behind some of the messaging of President Joe Biden, whose working-class roots have long been vital to his political identity. On Wednesday, as the dust settled from voting in Ohio and Indiana, Biden railed against what he called an ""ultra-MAGA agenda"" that he said would raise taxes on ""working families"" and ""working-class folks."" It was some of the sharpest political rhetoric the president has used to engage with his predecessor and the party Trump continues to dominate. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As news of the leaked SCOTUS draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade continues to send shockwaves across the country, fears of other legal implications are growing. Opponents of the draft decision say overturning Roe could jeopardize other court decisions related to privacy rights. ""This will be the roadmap for the erosion of LGBTQ rights, same-sex marriage, contraception and, by the way, voting rights, human rights and civil rights,"" CK Hoffler, a trial attorney and former president of the National Bar Association, said in an interview with ABC News Live. President Biden also sounded the alarm Wednesday. He wondered aloud whether ""children who are LGBTQ"" won't be allowed ""in classrooms with other children."" ""Is that legit under the way the decision is written?"" he asked. ""What are the next things that are going to be attacked?” He placed the blame on the movement borne out of former President Trump’s 2016 campaign, saying ""this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history -- in recent American history.” Some Democrats believe that the impending Supreme Court decision will serve as a wake-up call, creating the motivation they need to get voters to the polls to back candidates who support the right to an abortion, but there's no guarantee. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The runoff primary election in Texas' 28th Congressional District could be one of the first significant tests of political fallout among Democrats related to the draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade. Progressive Jessica Cisneros' second campaign challenging incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar had long centered on characterizing Cuellar's moderate policy positions as detrimental to the Democratic agenda. If you ask Cisneros, Cuellar's anti-abortion policy stance is the latest example of that claim. ""As the Supreme Court prepares to overturn Roe v. Wade, I am calling on Democratic Party leadership to withdraw their support of Henry Cuellar who is the last anti-choice Democrat in the House,"" Cisneros said in a statement, adding that ""with the House majority on the line, he could very much be the deciding vote on the future of our reproductive rights and we cannot afford to take that risk."" But the call for action against Cuellar did not appear to resonate. Just hours after Cisneros released that statement, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn rallied with the incumbent congressman at a get out the vote event in San Antonio. As reported by the Texas Tribune, Clyburn acknowledged that he does not agree with Cuellar on every issue, but the congressman is still someone with whom Clyburn finds ""more agreement than disagreement."" In the meantime, the stakes of the May 24 contest are also likely to sharpen the focus on Texas' broader midterm political landscape given that the state has some of the strictest and most controversial limits on abortion access in the country.

2022-05-06,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/legislative-odds-favor-gop-abortion-battles-note/story?id=84526988,Legislative odds still favor GOP in abortion battles: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The political earthquake didn't quite shake everything up. The fallout of this week's jaw-dropping Supreme Court leak has Democrats enraged and newly motivated. It also has them confronting the same stubborn legislative and mathematical realities that have defined their last year-plus in control of Washington. Abortion opponents have largely taken the expected good news from the high court as a call for further action. Louisiana is advancing a bill that would allow prosecutors to treat abortions as homicides. Gov. Kristi Noem, R-S.D., said she would immediately call for a special legislative session to explore new protections for ""every unborn child"" if Roe v. Wade is overturned -- even though South Dakota already has a ""trigger law"" that would outlaw abortion as soon as the Supreme Court allows it. Democratic-led states including Connecticut, New York and California are taking steps to protect abortion rights and prepare for an influx of out-of-state abortion seekers. Democrats have polling on their side in Americans supporting the concept of abortion being available to women, as this week's ABC News/Washington Post survey confirmed. But some states with Democratic governors are essentially paralyzed by GOP-controlled legislatures. Democrats in Wisconsin, up to and including Gov. Tony Evers, will have to contend with an 1849 state law criminalizing abortions in almost all circumstances; the law has been unenforceable since Roe but has not been repealed. At the federal level, the Biden White House is coming up against the limits of what it can do if the legal landscape is upended, as now seems exceedingly likely. The main congressional vehicle to codify Roe in federal law will come up for an initial vote in the Senate next Wednesday, but while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is calling it one of the most important votes ""of this century,"" it stands no realistic chance of getting 60 votes. The situation leaves some Democrats -- particularly progressives who have long agitated for sweeping Supreme Court reform -- with a familiar feeling. The debate is roughly tracking the path taken on voting rights since last January -- action in Republican-led states met with virtually no action in the Democratic-controlled Congress. Democrats may yet see a boost in voter engagement because of the forthcoming court news, though there were few signs of the issue impacting voting in the two red-tinged states that had primary voting this week, Ohio and Indiana. But before they get there, Democrats appear likely to face still more losses on an issue vital to so many of their voters. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The Biden administration, which has furnished a host of historic firsts, is adding another with Karine Jean-Pierre set to take the helm as White House press secretary. Jean-Pierre will be both the first Black woman and the first openly LGBTQ person to serve in the press secretary role when she replaces outgoing Jen Psaki. Jean-Pierre, who now serves as deputy, is an alum of former President Obama's 2008 campaign and his administration, and the Thursday announcement came almost 10 years to the day of then-Vice President Biden's May 6 NBC interview when he revealed his support for same-sex marriage. Psaki called the historic nature of the announcement ""amazing"" during Thursday's press briefing. ""Representation matters, and she will give a voice to so many and allow and show so many what is truly possible when you work hard and dream big, and that matters,"" said Psaki. ""And we should celebrate that."" Jean-Pierre's job will be no cakewalk. She will take to the podium as the administration confronts numerous challenges: soaring inflation, an impending SCOTUS decision on abortion, a seemingly endless war in Ukraine, an ongoing pandemic and coming elections that could hamper the fate of the rest of the administration's agenda. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Ohio's primary season is over, but the ongoing political fallout of former President Donald Trump's influence across the state is already brewing ahead of November in the 9th Congressional District. Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur went from representing a district that had a +16 partisan lean in favor of Democrats to a district that is now +6 for Republicans after redistricting took effect, according to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight. The new partisan framing of the district was highlighted earlier this week when Republican J.R. Majewski won his party's primary. Majewski -- who gained notoriety for painting a mural of Trump's face on his front yard -- attended the Jan. 6 rally preceding the insurrection and has been adjacent to QAnon conspiracies. His run against Kaptur, the longest-serving woman in the House, will once again spotlight the former president's false claims of 2020 election fraud that have emerged as a focus for some 2022 Republican candidates. In a 2021 interview with the Toledo Blade, Majewski cast unfounded doubt on 2020 election administration, despite acknowledging that he could not ""say that I have factual evidence that Joe Biden didn't beat President Trump in a fair election."" Kaptur now faces the prospect of making her pitch to voters in the northwestern part of the state where she has never held office, while the campaign arm of the House Democrats pounces on the prospect of Majewski being too extreme for his own party. In an email, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claimed their counterparts are ""avoiding comment on Majewski"" despite having congratulated other winning Ohio Republicans. ""The NRCC is now stuck with a toxic and extreme nominee who is out of touch with what's important to voters in Northwest Ohio,"" said DCCC spokesperson Abel Iraola.

2022-05-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kamala-harris-warns-women-lose-make-decisions-bodies/story?id=84564915,Kamala Harris warns women may lose right to 'make decisions about their own bodies' in commencement speech,"Vice President Kamala Harris gave a sobering look at the ""unsettled"" world students are heading into as she delivered the commencement speech at Tennessee State University on Saturday. The vice president discussed the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as the looming possibility Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the Supreme Court after a draft opinion leaked earlier this week. ""The world that you graduate into is unsettled,"" Harris said. ""It is a world where long-established principles now rest on shaky ground. We see this in Ukraine, where Russia's invasion threatens international rules and norms that have provided unprecedented peace and security in Europe since World War II."" ""We believed that the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity had for the most part prevailed, that democracy had prevailed,"" she continued. ""But now the certainty of fundamental principles is being called into question, including the principles of equality and fairness."" The crowd erupted in cheers when Harris remarked that the students were facing an unsettled world where Roe v. Wade may be overturned. ""In the United States, we are once again forced to defend fundamental principles that we hoped were long settled -- principles like the freedom to vote, the rights of women to make decisions about their own bodies, even what constitutes the truth, especially in an era, when anyone can post anything online and claim it is a fact,"" Harris said. Harris congratulated the students on succeeding in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Class of 2022, you made it through and it cannot be denied also that your class has traveled a stony road -- a pandemic that took away so much of the college experience that you once imagined,"" she said. Shifting to a more optimistic tone, the vice president said that each student is well-equipped to tackle the ""biggest challenges of today"" by drawing from their lived experiences and personal attributes. ""Most importantly, you have the ability to see what can be unburdened by what has been,"" she said, drawing from her stump speech on the campaign trail. As a fellow graduate of a historically Black college and university, she expressed ""there is no limit to your capacity for greatness."" ""I want you all -- each and every one of you -- to always remember that you are not alone, that you come from people, that you come with people,"" she said. ""Because I promise you, there will be a time when you will walk into a boardroom or a courtroom or maybe even the Situation Room, and you will walk into the room and find you are the only person in that room who looks like you or has had your life experience. ""At that moment, you must remember you are not in that room alone. Always know that you carry the voices of everyone here and those upon whose shoulders you stand."" Harris is also scheduled to give the commencement speech at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on May 18.",7
2022-05-08,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-suffered-loss-extraordinary-number-generals/story?id=84545931,Why Russia has suffered the loss of an 'extraordinary' number of generals,"During its war in Ukraine, Russia's top military leadership has proven to be particularly vulnerable, experts say. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense has claimed that 12 Russian generals have been killed since the invasion began in late February. Russian officials have not confirmed that number. U.S. officials -- who last week pushed back on a New York Times report that said the U.S. provided Ukraine intelligence that helped it target and kill Russian generals and other senior officers -- also have not confirmed the number of Russian generals killed. Though, as reported by Ukraine, that kind of loss is ""quite extraordinary,"" ABC News contributor and retired Col. Steve Ganyard said. ""Maybe you'd have to go back to World War II to have that sort of proportion of senior officers being killed on the front lines,"" Ganyard said. Such a high number of casualties at that level suggests several things -- one being a lack of confidence among Russian military leaders in their troops, according to Ganyard. ""It suggests that the generals need to be at the front lines to ensure that their troops are conducting the battle plan in the way that they want,"" he said. ""But that also suggests a lack of confidence in their troops if they need to be that far forward with that many senior folks."" That demonstrates Russia's seriousness about its campaign but is also ""an indication of how weak the Russian military has turned out to be in that they need that much senior leadership that far forward,"" Ganyard said. Russian generals also may be especially vulnerable due to the structure of Russia's military, experts say. Unlike the U.S. military, Russia does not empower its non-commissioned and junior officers with the authority to make decisions on their own, said Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and an ABC News contributor. ""They do not delegate authority. So, they are out giving orders directly to their forces,"" Mulroy said. ""The lack of delegation is another reason the Russian military is performing so poorly."" Poor morale among Russian troops may also be giving Ukraine an advantage in the war, despite Ukrainians being outnumbered by enemy troops and military equipment, Ganyard said. ""As soon as communication breaks down … the young folks in the Russian military don't know what to do and they know that they're just being told to do something, particularly when it's a fight where their heart isn't in it,"" he said. ""That is an advantage that Ukraine has proven to be decisive on the battlefield thus far."" Russian troops have also been shown to be vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping while on the ground in Ukraine, Ganyard said. ""One of the many failures of the Russian military in this war is that it has shown how little they have invested in command and control capabilities,"" he said. ""The Russians aren't even using encryption, so it means that anybody -- if they find the frequency -- are able to listen in."" There are ""very credible reports"" of Russian troops even confiscating phones from Ukrainian citizens and using those for command and control operations, Ganyard said. ""So obviously, the Ukrainians can tap into their own phone lines if they can figure out who's doing it,"" he said. Russian soldiers have also been tracked in real-time through geolocation of social media posts, Ganyard said. ""The modern age has introduced lots of benefits, but in the case of the military, it actually becomes dangerous because most of the apps that people are running are not encrypted and they're passing real-time data of where people are,"" he said. Tracking Russian troops could lead Ukrainian forces to command posts -- and likely top military leadership. ""If you shell and you take out a command post, you're probably going to take out quite a bit of senior leadership,"" Ganyard said. Amid the claims of Russia's military leadership losses, it is unclear what the Ukrainian military has similarly suffered. ""The Ukrainians have been very good at controlling the narrative on social media and on media in general,"" Ganyard said. ""We're getting anecdotal reporting back-channel that the Ukrainians are paying a price, too."" And with a smaller military, the Ukrainians ""can pay a price less than the Russians can,"" he added. ""The Ukrainians are hurting,"" Ganyard said. ""This is not something where the Ukrainians are not taking any losses, while the Russians are."" ABC News' Matt Seyler contributed to this report.",7
2022-05-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fall-swift-roe-wade-overturned-sen-amy-klobuchar/story?id=84564280,Abortion bans 'will be swift' if Roe v. Wade is overturned: Sen. Amy Klobuchar,"The move to add new abortion bans ""will be swift"" if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Sunday, adding that the Senate will do everything it can to codify a woman's right to choose. ""With this leaked opinion, the court is looking at reversing 50 years of women's rights and the fall will be swift. Over 20 states have laws in place already,"" Klobuchar, D-Minn., told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. ""I think the question that voters are going to be asking when 75% of people are with us on this, is who should make this decision,"" Klobuchar said. ""Should it be a woman and her doctor or a politician? Should it be Ted Cruz making this decision or a woman and her family? Where are women’s equal rights?"" On Tuesday, Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed a leaked draft opinion of a Supreme Court ruling indicating that five conservative justices, three of whom were appointed by former President Trump, are poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. The bombshell that the high court could soon overturn the landmark 1973 ruling sparked outrage across the country among people, including elected leaders, who support abortion rights. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that the Senate would hold a vote Wednesday to codify federal abortion protections by way of the Women's Health Protection Act, but not enough votes are expected for the measure to pass. To overcome a filibuster, the bill -- which passed the House but has stalled in the Senate -- needs support from 60 senators. ""If we are not successful, then we go to the ballot box,"" Klobuchar said of the bill. ""We march straight to the ballot box, and the women of this country and the men who stand with them will vote like they've never voted before."" All House Democrats except for Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, voted for the Women's Health Protection Act. Raddatz pressed Klobuchar on whether the Democratic Party should only back members and candidates who support abortion rights. ""Do you believe there should be a litmus test?"" Raddatz asked. ""The Democrats have several candidates who do not support abortion rights."" ""You have people who are personally, personally pro-life, but yet believe that that decision should be a woman's personal choice, even if they may not agree with them,"" Klobuchar responded. ""So I think it's important to note that we have people in our party that vote to uphold Roe v. Wade that may have personal opinions that are different."" The Minnesota senator added that the Democratic Party is ""clearly pro-choice."" ""That is the position of our party and I think you see in primary after primary, that matters to our voters -- certainly now more than ever,"" she said. While she said abortion will not be the ""only issue"" for Democrats in the midterm elections, noting voters are also focused on the economy and Ukraine, she said ""a new generation of women"" are seeing their rights pulled back and saying, ""Wait a minute, my mom and my grandma are going to have more rights than I'm going to have going forward?"" Raddatz pressed Klobuchar on public polls showing that while a majority of Americans support the right to an abortion in most cases, within the states that would almost immediately ban abortion if Roe is overturned, a majority of adults believe abortion should be illegal in most or all cases, a New York Times analysis found. ""Why should a woman in Texas have different rights and a different future and a different ability to make decisions about her body and her reproductive choices than a woman in Minnesota?"" Klobuchar responded. ""How can that be in this country, that we'd have a patchwork of laws?"" Klobuchar added that a reversal of Roe v. Wade would disproportionately affect poor women and women of color. ""This is just wrong, and that is part of why Justice [Harry] Blackmun, who is a Republican-appointed justice, no less, made that thoughtful decision, looked at the Constitution and said, the right to privacy includes the right for women to make a choice like this.""",28
2022-05-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/secret-service-jill-biden-ukraine-analysis/story?id=84598285,How the Secret Service got Jill Biden to Ukraine: ANALYSIS,"First lady Jill Biden made news when she conducted an unannounced visit to western Ukraine on Sunday. The first lady traveled by vehicle to the town of Uzhhorod, which was about a 10-minute drive from the Slovakian border, and spent about two hours in Ukraine. Considering that the entire nation is gripped in a war with Russia, and the United States had pulled out its diplomatic staff, closed its Embassy and has no real resources in the country, this type of a visit is difficult and dangerous. Since it began protecting presidents, the United States Secret Service has escorted the president and other high-ranking government officials into war zones, disaster areas and places in extreme distress. Whether during World War II with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt visiting troops on the front lines of battle, bringing President Lyndon B. Johnson to Vietnam during the war, or both President George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, despite the overwhelming security risks, the Secret Service has always managed to make these trips happen and keep the protectees safe. This all starts with planning and the Secret Service advance process. Any trip a Secret Service protectee embarks on, domestic or overseas, begins with the advance. In the case of the first lady, this likely included close coordination between the Secret Service and White House staff to determine the destination, scope and duration of any visit. Once those decisions are made, the security planning begins and often includes counterparts from different federal and state agencies. In the case of a foreign advance, where neither the Secret Service nor the U.S. government has any real authority, a liaison is established with the host country's security forces via the Secret Service offices located in that geographic area, and the U.S. State Department and its Diplomatic Security Services (DSS) Regional Security Offices. Depending on the nature of the visit, the host country is typically notified via diplomatic notice of the impending visit of a United States dignitary. In cases where the nature of the visit has real security concerns, such as in a war zone, that notification is typically made at the highest levels, specifically the ambassador. The visit information is typically closely held so that the dissemination of any information that may be advantageous to an adversary is minimized. This includes the use of secure communication methods between the White House, State Department and Secret Service. One of the overriding security and logistics concerns for these types of visits is the ability to tap into or transport in U.S. military and Secret Service assets to support the visit. In places where the U.S. military has a presence or can operate, the support and logistics are made easier. In the case of a location where neither of those resources is available -- as is the case in Ukraine, the Secret Service must work with the local security forces and make decisions about what level of support they can provide and what, if any, Secret Service support they will permit. Often these visits use elements of clandestine operations in order to preserve the protective methodology the Secret Service uses to transport the protectee to the location and specific locations of the visit. These clandestine methods include ""covers for action"" and diversions for, in this case, the first lady’s schedule and movements, as well as for the Agents and military assets assigned to support the visit. These assets may include vehicles, extra personnel, communications gear and robust tactical units such as the Secret Service Counter Assault Team (CAT), DSS Mobile Security Deployment (MSD) and U.S. Military Special Operations. All of this is to ensure that both the Secret Service and host nation can secure a safe visit for the protectee and that any adversaries' ability to compromise the methods used for creating that visit remain classified.

2022-05-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-pushback-builds-trump-primary-picks-note/story?id=84577810,GOP pushback builds against Trump primary picks: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Former President Donald Trump won the first round in the primary season endorsement battle last week, with J.D. Vance's triumph in the GOP Senate primary in Ohio. It only gets harder from here. That fact landed directly in Trump's face Friday night when mentions of Dr. Mehmet Oz's name drew boos at the former president's Pennsylvania rally. Some attendees even turned their backs when Oz himself -- Trump's endorsed pick in the next big Senate race -- spoke to the crowd, as ABC News' Lalee Ibssa reported. Trump used a chunk of time to attack Oz's main GOP rival, David McCormick, as ""not MAGA"" and the candidate of ""the Washington establishment,"" linking a man who was a former top Trump aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. For his part, McCormick hustled up a new ad questioning Oz's stance on abortion rights and suggesting Trump chose the wrong candidate in the race, as Axios' Mike Allen first reported. McCormick is relying on help from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and former Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ahead of the May 17 primary. This coming Tuesday will bring judgments on high-profile Trump endorsements in deep-red West Virginia and Nebraska. Trump's pick for governor of Nebraska, Charles Herbster, is facing groping allegations from two Republican women; Herbster, a high-profile Trump donor, has dismissed the accusations as political smears. That race remains up for grabs in a splintered field. But even if Herbster and Oz pull out wins, Trump's hope of triumphing against incumbent governors appears to be fading in states including Georgia and Idaho. Speaking on Oz's behalf Friday, the former president touted the success of his candidate's television show and stated what, if he wins, could go down as the main reason why: ""Very importantly, he's supported by somebody known as me."" That does remain important. But even as Republican voters overwhelmingly maintain loyalty to Trump, taking his word up and down the ballot is another story entirely. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As Republican Senate leadership raises the idea of a national abortion ban, Democratic lawmakers insist reproductive rights will drive voters to the polls in support of their candidates. In an interview with USA Today on the leaked draft of the Supreme Court decision that would overturn the landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade legalizing abortion nationwide, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called a national abortion ban ""possible."" ""If the leaked opinion became the final opinion, legislative bodies -- not only at the state level but at the federal level -- certainly could legislate in that area,"" McConnell said. Even without a national ban, 26 states are likely to impose abortion bans if Roe is overturned, including 13 with ""trigger laws"" tied to the decision, according to an analysis by reproductive health research group the Guttmacher Institute. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is slated to bring a vote this week on legislation that would codify abortion rights, but it doesn't have the necessary 60 votes and is expected to fail. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., believes the next line of defense is this fall's midterm elections. ""We march straight to the ballot box, and the women of this country and the men who stand with them will vote like they've never voted before,"" Klobuchar told ABC's ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. What remains to be seen is if reproductive rights will get Democratic voters out to the polls in numbers strong enough to counter historical trends that often make midterm elections unfavorable to the party that controls the White House and, in this case, the party that supports abortion access. The TIP with Hannah Demissie The effort to prevent elected officials allegedly involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol received a devastating blow last week. A Georgia administrative law judge issued his ruling allowing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to stay on the ballot after a group of voters challenged her eligibility to run for reelection -- alleging that Greene supported the insurrection and that disqualified her. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger adopted the opinion a few hours later. Greene is one of several politicians across the country who have faced challenges to their under the disqualification clause of the 14th Amendment. Other legislators who have had their candidacies challenged and later dismissed include Arizona Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs. The Georgia voters plan to appeal the decision. But the overwhelming number of candidacy challenges under the disqualification clause that have been thrown out by judges across the country does not bode well for voters hoping to see Greene and others removed from the ballot this election cycle using this post-Civil War provision. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 200. That's roughly the number of anti-critical race theory bills Republican state legislators have introduced since January 2021, according to data compiled by the nonprofit organization PEN America. Few of these bills actually target the teaching of critical race theory, and as FiveThirtyEight contributors Theodore Johnson, Emelia Gold and Ashley Zhao write, one of the most troubling aspects of these bills is the severe punishments they prescribe for those found to be in violation of the legislation. Of the 84 proposed bills FiveThirtyEight looked at, 47 outlined punishments ranging from fines to potential legal action. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-05-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-highlight-efforts-fight-inflation-attack-ultra-maga/story?id=84617325,"Biden highlights efforts to fight inflation, attacks 'ultra-MAGA' GOP","President Joe Biden on Tuesday continued his sharpened attack on what he's now calling the GOP's ""ultra-MAGA"" agenda as he pitched his plan to tackle inflation. His remarks came as the national average price of a gallon of gas hit a record high of $4.37 a gallon, AAA said. ""I want every American to know that I am taking inflation very seriously,"" Biden said from the podium in the South Court Auditorium. ""It is my top domestic priority."" Inflation is one of the Democratic Party's biggest problems heading into the 2022 midterm elections. Republicans have seized on higher costs to criticize Biden's domestic agenda while the White House is pinning the problem on supply chain issues, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Biden used his speech on Tuesday to tout what he said were recent accomplishments aimed at alleviating the increasing financial burdens on Americans, including a historic release form the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to offset soaring gas prices and reducing the national deficit. He also reiterated calls for Congress to pass other portions of his agenda that would lower the price of prescription drugs and other health care costs. Biden also used the occasion to continue his ramped-up rhetoric against the GOP, accusing Republicans of having no concrete plan to address higher costs. ""They have no plan to bring down energy prices today,"" Biden said. ""No plan to get us to a cleaner energy independent future tomorrow."" ""My plan is to lower everyday costs for hardworking Americans and lower the deficit by asking large corporations and the wealthiest Americans to not engage in price gouging and to pay their fair share in taxes,"" Biden added. ""The Republican plan is to increase taxes on middle class families, let billionaires and large companies off the hook as they raise prices and reap profits in record amounts. And it's really that simple."" Biden has used one proposal in particular as a target: A campaign pitch from Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott, head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, that would have all Americans pay some income tax to ""have some skin in the game, even if a small amount."" That would mean a tax increase on Americans whose income is currently too low to owe federal income taxes. On Tuesday, Biden said Scott's plan would hurt frontline workers like firefighters and teachers. Despite Biden's focus on the plan, Scott's proposal hasn't been embraced by Republican leaders. Instead, Sen. Mitch McConnell made a point to distance himself from it shortly after it was announced. ""If we are fortunate enough to have the majority next year, I'll be the majority leader, I'll decide in consultation with my members, what to put on the floor,"" McConnell said. ""Let me tell you what will not be a part of our agenda. We will not have as part of our agenda, a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years. That will not be a part of the Republican Senate majority agenda."" Before Biden spoke, Scott tweeted that Biden was ""unfit for office"" and should resign. Asked about that after he finished his remarks, Biden said, ""I think the man has a problem."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki later Tuesday offered some insight into who they consider an ""ultra-MAGA"" Republican, pointing to those who voiced support for Scott's tax plan or who would sunset Medicare and Social Security programs. ""And it's also the obsession with culture wars and wars against Mickey Mouse and banning books,"" Psaki said, declining to name any specific lawmaker. ""The president thinks that is extreme."" Psaki was also pressed on Biden's focus of Scott's proposal, given McConnell's rejection of it. ""Are there any Republicans that you can think of that the president might be referencing that is currently behind us?"" one reporter asked. Psaki highlighted support from Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel -- who described Scott's pitch as one of the GOP's ""real solutions"" -- as well as Sen Ron. Johnson, who told Breitbart last month he agreed with ""most"" of the plan. Psaki also emphasized Scott's role as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm for Senate Republicans. ""Rick Scott is not a random senator, he is literally in charge of winning back the Senate for Republicans,"" Psaki said. Biden's remarks on inflation come ahead of the release of April's consumer price index. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will announce those numbers on Wednesday morning. In March, the consumer price index spiked 8.5% from the year prior--the largest 12-month increase in 40 years. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found 68% Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of inflation. His approval rating on the issue was underwater by 40 percentage points. Republicans were more trusted by Americans to handle rising prices than Democrats, the survey found. ABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.",21
2022-05-11,https://abcnews.go.com/International/reporters-notebook-returning-kyiv-amid-war/story?id=84622740,Returning to Kyiv amid war: Reporter's Notebook,"The drive back into Kyiv was a mix of emotions. This is a city I once called home. I have a ton of happy memories from that period: The day I became a dad for the first time. A beach vacation in Odessa. And jogging countless times with our labrador, Emi, through Kyiv’s forests and along the beaches of the Dnipro river. Whether a hedonistic wine festival or a cool hipster market, before the war, Kyiv was a city that could always surprise. Today, as I return as a Correspondent for ABC News, the patriotic street art adjacent to our apartment block we lived in is still as impressive as ever. Many of the cool cafes, bars and restaurants in my neighborhood are open and more and more people are returning to their homes. But my journey back, along the main highway to the west of the city, told the story of today. Blackened buildings, wounded by Russian missiles, sit idle. A rusting carcass of a burnt out tank speaks of Russia’s defeat and retreat in this part of the country. Giant concrete-block checkpoints and piles of white sandbags dotted along the roads in almost every region of Ukraine reflect the unease and uncertainty over what will happen in the current phase of this war. I, like so many others, never imagined that Russian President Vladimir Putin would invade. Because when I lived here, I saw the passion Ukrainians’ had for that desire many of us take for granted; life in a truly independent, democratic country without widespread corruption. An attempt to occupy large parts of Ukraine looked like an unrealistic miscalculation. During the eleven weeks since Russia invaded, the people of Ukraine have lived the unimaginable. At the hospital where my daughter was born, babies were delivered in the basement. It was a private hospital run by a company called ISIDA. But in the early stages of the war, the hospital free for anyone. “We understood that people needed help,” said Andrii Vilenskyi, ISIDA’s CEO. As bombs fell nearby, Vilenskyi closed some of his medical facilities, concentrating staff in key buildings to ensure that they could still deliver babies. Back then, in the early stages of the war, I was back at our current family home in France. I would speak to Ukrainian friends on a regular basis. And even as Russia advanced to the outskirts of Kyiv, virtually all of them were convinced that Ukraine would win. “We have no other option,” they would tell me. Today Ukraine is a very different country to the one I left in 2017. The plague of war, with guaranteed side effects of death and destruction, is all around. On my second day back, a drive out to the suburbs of Kyiv, towns like Bucha and Borodyanka, where Russian troops committed countless atrocities was a sobering and somber experience. Entire apartment blocks there have been obliterated by Russian bombs. And even in the far west of the country, near the border of Poland, one of the most peaceful parts of the country, you don’t space the effects of the war. My first night back in the country, in that region, the air raid sirens sounded. Locals barely flinch now when they go off. My former home town Kyiv still has its charm. But the war is pervasive. There is no real morning rush hour down Khreschatyk, the city’s main avenue near our former apartment. And every single person here is living this war. Everyone knows people who are fighting for the Ukrainian military, people who have left their homes to seek safety abroad and people who have been killed by Putin’s invasion. But the determination, ingenuity and passion of Ukrainians, which I knew so well back then, is still alive and kicking today. If anything, those characteristics have become more emboldened since Putin invaded Ukraine.",22
2022-05-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/red-states-deliver-split-decision-trump-backed-candidates/story?id=84627411,Red states deliver split decision on Trump-backed candidates: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Some races are less about which party will be in control than they are about who controls which party. By that measure, Republican primary voters delivered conflicting messaging on Tuesday in a pair of states that former President Donald Trump carried comfortably in 2020. Trump got a big victory in West Virginia -- yet also saw his candidate decisively defeated in the governor’s race in Nebraska. In West Virginia, where a pair of Republican House members were forced to run against each other, one backed the infrastructure law and a Jan. 6 commission. The other got Trump’s endorsement and romped despite a much thinner record in the state, riding MAGA momentum over the candidate backed by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. In Nebraska, Trump backed and stood by a mega-donor Charles Herbster despite groping allegations from multiple women -- only to see him fade in the end. The state’s GOP establishment didn’t rally for another candidate as much as it did come together against Herbster, handing Trump his first primary loss of the still-young voting season. It points to a possibility that Trump-skeptical Republicans have highlighted for months. While Trump may be near-impossible to beat when he gets involved in a congressional race, campaigns for governor might be different -- affording candidates a chance to display independent streaks and giving oxygen to other GOP players. Less noticed amid Trump’s triumph with J.D. Vance in the Ohio Senate race last week was his failure to recruit a challenger he would back against Gov. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, who won renomination the same night as Vance. As important as Tuesday’s races were, they might best be seen as warm-up acts to more consequential elections ahead. After a string of red-state primaries, upcoming races will nominate candidates in battleground Senate races and campaigns for governor in states that will be heavily contested in 2024. That raises the stakes for both Trump and Republicans who are worried about the kind of candidates he is backing this year. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Despite the outrage surrounding the leaked SCOTUS draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, a coming Senate vote to protect abortion rights is widely expected to fail Wednesday. ""There'll be no more hiding. There'll be no more distracting. No more obfuscating where every member in this chamber stands. Senate Republicans will face a choice. Either vote to protect the rights of women to exercise freedom over their own bodies or stand with the Supreme Court as 50 years of women's rights are reduced to rubble before our very eyes,"" Schumer said Tuesday. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., one of the only Democrats with anti-abortion views, announced he would vote with his party in support of the Women's Health Protection Act. It's a significant shift on the issue from Casey. His father, former Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey, opposed abortion and supported restrictions in the landmark SCOTUS case Planned Parenthood v. Casey. However, that shift isn't enough to advance the legislation with a 60-vote requirement to avoid the filibuster. Even Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, the two GOP lawmakers in favor of abortion access, are expected to vote against the legislation citing ""conscience protections,"" that would, for example, allow a Catholic hospital to refuse to provide abortion care. While Wednesday's vote is expected to crash and burn, there could be a compromise in the works. Bipartisan negotiations are ongoing to at least preserve the status quo on Roe, according to ABC News' Trish Turner. The problem is that those efforts could face the same 60-vote obstacle. Still, Murkowski remains optimistic. ""I have stated my concerns with [the Women's Health Protection Act] previously, voted against that legislation previously, and have filed legislation with Senator Collins that we both feel actually codifies Roe and some of the other precedents related to Casey, so that's where we are,"" she said. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Next week's primary elections in Pennsylvania are likely to be the first contests in which we see the draft SCOTUS decision on Roe v. Wade play out on the 2022 campaign trail. The issue could pose an uphill battle for Trump-endorsed Senate GOP candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz, who has been facing backlash from voters and opponents alike about his past pro-abortion comments despite taking an anti-abortion stance throughout his campaign. In a 2019 interview on The Breakfast Club, Oz was asked to comment on anti-abortion laws that were making their way through the Alabama legislature. ""I'm really worried about it"" and ""I don't quite get it as a doctor,"" were some of Oz's reactions to the legislation. Opponents including Dave McCormick and Kathy Barnette have resurfaced the interview during primary debates in hopes of casting doubt on Oz's conservative positions. Most recently, Barnette described her personal reasons for being against abortions with the goal of questioning the doctor's political intentions. ""I am the byproduct of a rape. My mother was 11 years old when I was conceived. My father was 21. I was not just a lump of cells. As you can see, I'm still not just a lump of cells. My life has value,"" Barnette said before questioning whether Oz ""changed his position on that my life is valuable."" Oz replied to Barnette's comments by saying he has the support of his mother-in-law, who is an ordained minister, and that as a heart surgeon who has operated on small children he ""would never think of harming that child or even nine months earlier because life starts at conception.""

2022-05-11,https://abcnews.go.com/International/millions-lives-risk-famine-stalks-horn-africa/story?id=84643535,Millions of lives at risk as famine stalks Horn of Africa,"In northern Kenya's drought-stricken Turkana County, a group of children carried sacks of palm fruit atop their heads as they walked across the parched earth back to their tiny village. They walk more than 20 miles to gather the small, bulbous fruit from the African oil palm several times a week. It will be their breakfast, lunch and dinner. One of the children, Ekiru, said the last time he ate something other than palm fruit was when a goat died of starvation and his village divided up the carcass. ""There is nothing else,"" Ekiru's grandmother, Nakaleso Lobuin Nipayan, told ABC News. ""When the palm fruit go away, we will die."" Famine is just around the corner for many others here. Up to 20 million people across the wider Horn of Africa region could go hungry this year as delayed rains exacerbate extreme drought amid soaring prices of food and fuel as well as a shortfall in humanitarian aid, according to the World Food Programme, the food-assistance branch of the United Nations. ""If they don't receive assistance, we will see them go into something we call severe acute malnutrition,"" Lauren Landis, WFP's country director for Kenya, told ABC News. ""And there's the threat of death."" Click here to help drought-affected families in East Africa via the International Rescue Committee, World Food Programme and Save the Children. According to a report released Wednesday by the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification, the number and duration of droughts have increased 29% globally since 2000. While droughts represent just 15% of the world's natural disasters, they took the largest human tool -- approximately 650,000 deaths from 1970 to 2019. This year, more than 2.3 billion people face water stress, while almost 160 million children are exposed to severe and prolonged droughts, according to the report. The report, entitled ​​""Drought In Numbers, 2022,"" warned that unless action is stepped up, an estimated 700 million people will be at risk of being displaced by drought by 2030; an estimated one in four children will live in areas with extreme water shortages by 2040, and droughts may affect over three-quarters of the world's population by 2050. Following several consecutive poor rainy seasons, the Horn of Africa is facing what's been described as its worst drought since 1981. Aid workers fear the outcome will be deadlier than the severe drought that affected all of East Africa between 2011 and 2012, claiming the lives of an estimated 260,000 people. In Kenya, the drought has been declared a national emergency. Between 80% and 90% of reservoirs and dams are drying up in Turkana, Kenya's largest and northwesternmost county. It is also one of the hottest and driest. The communities here can no longer survive on farming, fishing or livestock. ABC News traveled to Turkana County with the International Rescue Committee in early May. At an IRC-run hospital within a refugee camp in the rural town of Kakuma, cases of malnutrition have increased four-fold in recent months. The refugees had fled their homes in neighboring countries and crossed into Kenya -- considered one of the richest East African economies -- only to find little food or water. ""People [are] coming from all over the region thinking that they can find safety and nourishment in Kenya,"" Dr. Sila Monthe, who works at the Kakuma refugee camp, told ABC News. ""[But] Kenya is in a drought and can't really support all of these people."" The hospital's pediatric wing is reaching capacity, with currently an average of 20 admissions per day, according to Monthe. Many of the children being treated here exhibit the telltale signs of severe malnutrition, with some even too weak to cry. ""People have been dying just trying to get to the hospital,"" Monthe added. Although the success rate of the pediatric wing's stabilization ward is consistently above 85%, Monthe said that means 15% of the patients -- mostly young children -- still die. ""Because they are so malnourished, the whole body shuts down,"" she told ABC News. ""That includes the digestive tract, so they're usually unable to digest food."" The situation in the Horn of Africa has also been compounded by the fallout from a war on another continent, thousands of miles away. Since Russian forces invaded neighboring Ukraine in late February, the cost of grain, fuel and fertilizer has skyrocketed worldwide, worsening hunger crises. Many countries in East Africa rely on Russia and Ukraine for a significant percentage of these agricultural commodities, according to data collected by the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. The Kenyan government also raised the price of petroleum products for March, April and May, citing the conflict in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the cost of WFP's local food basket -- the minimum food needs per family per month -- has increased by 23% in the past year, driven in part by the Ukraine war. Back in Ekiru's village, near the town of Lorugum, he and his grandmother smashed palm fruit against rocks to extract the fibrous, faintly sweet flesh. ""This normally will sustain them until God remembers them,"" the grandmother, Nipayan, told ABC News, noting that she has ""never seen"" a drought as ""bad ""as this. Thunderclouds suddenly rolled in overhead and it began to pour with rain. ""I feel happy,"" said Ekiru, whose name means ""rain"" in the Turkana language. But the sporadic and localized rainfall is not enough, even as it triggers a deluge in Ekiru's village. ""We were hoping that this rain will be good enough to be able to pull out some of the population out of the situation they were in,"" Shashwat Saraf, the International Rescue Committee's regional emergency director for East Africa, told ABC News. ""But this rain also failing and being below average will actually result in catastrophic consequences for the population."" ""We are talking about lives of millions of people in the region,” he added, ""and I think we cannot say in words in terms of what it means for those individuals and families that are impacted by this crisis."" One of the goats belonging to Ekiru's family died during the recent heavy rain, providing them with a rare meal other than palm fruit. They once owned 20 goats, but now only have eight. More than 3 million livestock have died in the Horn of Africa amid the ongoing drought, according to WFP. In Kenya alone, more than 1 million livestock deaths have been reported across several northern counties, including Turkana, ""majorly as a result of starvation and diseases,"" according to the National Drought Management Authority's bulletin for April. ""Animals will die,"" Ekiru's grandmother told ABC News, ""and eventually the entire family will starve."" ABC News' Nick Oloo, Cornel Van Heerden and Bea Wangondu contributed to this report.",25
2022-05-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-us-farmers-inflation-fight-food-prices-continue/story?id=84643494,Biden says US farmers can help in inflation fight as food prices continue to soar,"President Joe Biden hit the road Wednesday to talk about the role American farmers can play in alleviating global food shortages caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At O’Connor Farms, a family-run farm in Kankakee, Illinois, Biden outlined steps his administration is taking to help farmers ramp up domestic production. ""Right now America is fighting on two fronts,"" Biden said. ""At home, it’s inflation and rising prices. Abroad, it’s helping Ukrainians defend their democracy and feeding those who are left hungry around the world because Russian atrocities exist."" Biden continued, ""Our farmers are helping both on both fronts, reducing the food cost of price of food at home and expanding production and feeding the world in need."" To support this cause, the administration will increase the number of counties that can get insurance for double cropping, or planting a second crop on the same land in a single year. It will also double Biden's pledged funding for the production of fertilizer from $250 million to $500 million. Jeff O'Connor, the owner of the Illinois farm, said the changes will allow U.S. farmers to ""step up at a very critical time."" “The farming community stands ready to maximize production, which we do so well, in this time of world need,” O’Connor said as he introduced Biden. Biden's appearance in Illinois came fresh on the heels of the release of April's consumer price index -- a key measure of inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday morning consumer prices rose 8.3% last month from the year prior, a slight dip from March's peak of 8.5% but still close to a four-decade high. The cost of food as well as shelter, airfare and new vehicles were the main contributors to the April statistics, the bureau said. Food prices overall are up 9.4% in the last 12 months, increasing 0.9% from March to April. Grocery prices are even higher, up 10.8% from a year ago. Gas prices hit a record high on Wednesday of $4.40 per gallon, according to AAA. ""While it is heartening to see that annual inflation moderated in April, the fact remains that inflation is unacceptably high,"" Biden said in a statement reacting to the April data. ""As I said yesterday, inflation is a challenge for families across the country and bringing it down is my top economic priority."" Inflation is poised to be one of the biggest issues in the 2022 midterm elections. In bad news for Biden, a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found most Americans disapprove of his handling of the economic issue. In anticipation of the new data on consumer prices, Biden on Tuesday delivered remarks on efforts by his administration to combat inflation. His speech also took aim at what he describes as ""ultra-MAGA"" Republicans, most notably Florida Sen. Rick Scott and his plan to have all Americans pay some federal income tax. ""The Republican plan is to increase taxes on middle class families,"" Biden said, despite the fact that Scott's plan has been dismissed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. After his remarks, Biden was asked by a reporter when the public can expect prices to come down. ""I don't know, but I know what we have to do to make sure that we can bring it down,"" Biden responded.",21
2022-05-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-orders-flags-half-staff-us-records-million/story?id=84667735,Biden orders flags to half-staff as US records 1 million COVID deaths,"President Joe Biden on Thursday addressed the U.S. reaching the milestone of 1 million coronavirus deaths. ""One million empty chairs around the family dinner table,"" Biden said in a pre-taped video message. ""Each irreplaceable, irreplaceable losses. Each leaving behind a family or community forever changed because of this pandemic. Our heart goes out to all those who are struggling."" Biden has ordered flags be flown at half-staff at the White House and all federal public buildings and grounds until sunset on May 16 in remembrance of those who lost their lives to the virus. His remarks kicked off a second virtual summit focused on the global response to the ongoing health crisis and preventing future pandemics. The United States is co-hosting the event alongside Belize, Germany, Indonesia and Senegal. Biden also noted the U.S. is not alone in its grief. ""Around the world many more millions have died,"" he said in the video message. ""Millions of children have been orphaned, with thousands still dying every day. Now is the time for us to act. All of us together. We all must do more, must honor those we have lost by doing everything we can to prevent as many deaths as possible."" Biden on Thursday reiterated his call for Congress to pass more COVID-19 aid. In March, Biden requested an additional $22.5 billion to combat the virus, warning that the country's testing, vaccine and treatment supplies were running low. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are trying to forge ahead with a slimmed down $10 billion coronavirus assistance package. Senate Republicans previously blocked it over the administration's plan to lift Title 42, a pandemic-era rule restricting migration at the U.S. border. Democrats tried to link the COVID-19 package to supplemental aid for Ukraine to ensure its passage but the two measures were decoupled earlier this week. Biden said Thursday that the emergency coronavirus funding is ""vital to protect Americans."" The pre-taped message marking 1 million deaths was more muted than Biden's address on 500,000 virus deaths in February 2021, when he and Vice President Kamala Harris stood in front of the South Portico of the White House and held a moment of silence as well as a candle-lighting ceremony. White House press secretary Psaki defended Thursday's taped message when a reporter asked why the 1 million deaths milestone wasn't marked with a more prominent remembrance. ""I would say first the president publicly addressed this day and marked it,"" Psaki said. ""We also lowered the flags for five -- they will be lowered for five days. And we will continue to mark and commemorate the lives lost. What people care about the country though, most, is our action and what actions the president will continue to take. And obviously since he took office, according to a Yale study, it’s estimated we’ve saved over 2.2 million American lives and $900 billion in health care costs. There’s more work that needs to be done. More work to fight misinformation. More work to get more people vaccinated and action is what people care about.""",15
2022-05-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/helsinkis-underground-city-reflects-tense-position-russias-neighbor/story?id=84668764,Helsinki's 'underground city' reflects tense position as Russia's neighbor,"HELSINKI -- Finland may be world's happiest country -- at least on the surface. But Helsinki's ""underground city"" tells a different story. Beneath the capital, a massive network of bunkers and tunnels spreads out all across the city. There are than 5,000 bomb shelters in Helsinki -- enough to shelter more than the city's entire population -- and more than 50,000 bunkers across the country, according to Helsinki's Civil Defense Department. All buildings above a certain size are required by law to have their own bunkers. ""There's a historic sense that you should always be prepared. It might not be this generation or the next generation, but Russia is likely to attack Finland in some way,"" said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a leading researcher at the Finnish Institute for International Affairs. With so much ground going unutilized, the city of Helsinki has converted some of its shelters into spaces for everyday public use. There's an underground playground, a shelter that doubles as a hockey rink, even an underground swimming pool. This is what it's like being Russia's neighbor. The two countries share an 800-mile border and a long, complicated history. For decades, Finland opted not to join any military alliance in an effort meant to appease Russia's security concerns. As a result, Finland had to ensure it could fend for itself. So it's not just the bunkers; conscription is still mandatory for men, and the country has about 900,000 reservists. ""We have to take care of the citizens, that's the main reason we have this system,"" said Tomi Rask, an instructor with Helsinki's Civil Defense Department. But the very scenarios Finland has spent years preparing for are now playing out in Ukraine, where some have been living underground for weeks. The invasion marked a turning point for Finland-Russia relations. Public support in Finland for joining NATO is skyrocketing from roughly 30% before the war to more than 70% in the weeks after the invasion. ""We have such a horrible neighbor on the east side of Finland. We don't have any other option than to go to NATO,"" said said Finland citizen Kare Vartiainen, who ABC News met making use of the underground pool. After years of neutrality, on Thursday, Finland's leaders announced Finland should apply to join NATO ""without delay."" Sweden is expected to follow suit. The country's accession would more than double Russia's land border with NATO. It would also expand NATO's influence in the Arctic and further unify the West, said Salonius-Pasternak. NATO would also grow stronger. ""NATO would now have two more old democratic countries, both with really capable militaries, so that effectively all of northern Europe would now be one region to defend,"" he said. There are those that are still skeptical, like Veronika Honkasalo, one of the few members of Parliament who doesn't think Finland should join. MPs are expected to take up the issue next week. ""I'm afraid that NATO membership will increase actually the tensions in the Baltic Sea region and also will increase the tensions in Finland, especially regarding the eastern border,"" she said. Russia has already threatened ""serious military and political consequences"" if Finland and Sweden join NATO, saying it will have to bolster its defenses in the region and that it could decide to place nuclear weapons in the Baltics. There are concerns about what could happen in the time period after Finland and Sweden submit their applications but before they formally join the alliance. The two countries now hoping to win over security assurances from allies, including the U.S. On Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to come to Finland and Sweden's aid if either nation is attacked. Finns say now is the time to act while Putin is busy with Ukraine. The war in Ukraine is prompting Finland, even with its 50,000 shelters and capable military, to decide it can no longer go it alone. It's likely giving Putin the very thing he worked so hard to prevent: NATO's expansion. ""We are a small nation, we need help, we need friends. And from my point of view, maybe NATO is the friend that we need,"" said Rask.",7
2022-05-12,https://abcnews.go.com/US/bear-kills-army-soldier-alaska-training/story?id=84636109,Army soldier killed by bear during training in Alaska identified,"Officials have identified a U.S. Army soldier who died after sustaining injuries in a bear attack Tuesday at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska. Staff Sgt. Seth Michael Plant, 30, an infantryman from the 3rd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was part of a small group training in an area west of the Anchorage Regional Landfill when the attack took place, the base said Thursday. Plant was ""transported to the JBER hospital after the mauling where he was declared dead,"" the base said in a statement Thursday. A second soldier who suffered minor injuries in the attack was treated and released, according to the base. Plant's name was initially withheld following the incident pending next-of-kin notification. A native of Saint Augustine, Florida, he joined the active-duty Army in January 2015 after a stint in the reserve component. He had previously served at Fort Benning, Georgia, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, before coming to JBER in July 2021. ""Staff Sgt. Plant was an integral part of our organization. He was a positive and dedicated leader who brought joy and energy to the paratroopers who served with him,"" said Lt. Col. David J. Nelson, 3rd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment commander, said in a statement. ""He always had a smile on his face, he always went above and beyond what was asked of him, and he served as an inspiration to all who had the privilege to know him. His loss is deeply felt within our organization and we offer our sincere condolences to friends and family."" Plant had received numerous awards and decorations during his service, including the Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal and Afghanistan Campaign Medal. The Army Criminal Investigation Division is investigating the attack, along with the 673d Security Forces Squadron, 673d Civil Engineering Squadron Conservation Law Enforcement Officers, Alaska Wildlife Troopers and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Following the attack, a brown bear approached the area, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Responding personnel deployed bear spray, and the animal left. A den with two brown bear cubs was found nearby, and hair collected during the initial investigation was consistent with that of a brown bear, the department said. ""From everything we know so far, based on the scene investigation and information from other responding agencies, this appears to be a defensive attack by a female bear protecting her cubs,"" Cyndi Wardlow, southcentral regional supervisor for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said in a statement Thursday. ""We are trying to learn everything we can about what happened to increase public safety around wildlife in Alaska."" The whereabouts of the bear are currently unknown. A bear involved in a fatal attack may be killed by wildlife officials, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game said. The area of the attack is in a remote section of JBER, where the U.S. Army Alaska Command is headquartered. The area has been closed off to the public for recreation.

2022-05-12,https://abcnews.go.com/US/abcnews-marks-25-years-back-biggest-stories-covered/story?id=84295137,"As ABCNews.com marks 25 years, a look back at the biggest stories we covered","When ABCNews.com launched on May 15, 1997, Bill Clinton was president and the nation was months away from learning of his sex scandal with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The iPhone was still a decade from being introduced by Apple and the space shuttle Atlantis was blasting off on its 19th flight. The mission for the site then, as it is now, was to provide ABC News' legion of viewers and radio listeners a 24/7 news platform on what was then commonly referred to as the World Wide Web. Since then, ABCNews.com has covered politics, terrorist attacks, mass shootings, wars and climate change. The 25-year-old website has become one of the largest around-the-clock online news platforms in the nation with audiences consuming multimedia stories from around the globe, including videos, blogs, podcasts and most recently, ABC News' Live streaming newscasts. Here are some of the top stories from the past quarter century that ABC News Digital has covered: On Aug. 31, 1997, the Princess of Wales, and her companion, Dodi Fayed, were killed in a crash in Paris when their driver lost control of a Mercedes-Benz while trying to outrun a pack of paparazzi. The heartbreaking story, and its intricacies have captivated the world in the years since. On Dec. 19, 1998, the 42nd president of the United States was impeached on grounds of committing perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice stemming from a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones. The case publicly exposed Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton emerged from the impeachment proceedings with a 71% approval rating and the Senate ultimately acquitted him of the charges, allowing him to serve out the rest of his second term. One of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history took place on April 20, 1999, when two teenagers launched an attack at their school -- Columbine High in Littleton, Colorado -- killing 12 students and a teacher and wounding more than 20 people. The two gunmen, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, died by suicide. In December 2000, Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush was declared the winner of a disputed presidential election over incumbent Vice President Al Gore. The election prompted a hotly contested recount of the vote in Florida, numerous legal challenges and was ultimately decided in a narrow 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision. Hijackers belonging to the international terrorist network al-Qaeda hijacked four commercial planes, crashing two into New York City's World Trade Center and one into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. The fourth hijacked plane crashed into a Pennsylvania field after passengers confronted the hijackers, thwarting another attack. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks, making them the deadliest terrorist strikes on U.S. soil. The attacks triggered the war in Afghanistan, an al-Qaeda safe haven, and a hunt for terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden. In January 2002, the Boston Globe published an article that revealed that the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston had moved a priest defrocked in 1998 from one parish to another, even though records indicated church officials knew of his pedophilia for more than 20 years. By the middle of February, the archdiocese disclosed the names of 87 other priests who had also been accused of sexually abusing children. A series of revelations followed about how the Roman Catholic church mishandled cases of sexual abuse of minors by priests, causing public outrage and sparking reform efforts. In March 2003, the United States led an international coalition in an invasion of Iraq, which the U.S. officials claimed was developing weapons of mass destruction. Following an air assault on targets in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, the U.S.-led coalition launched a ground war that led to the seizure of Baghdad and the ouster of the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein. Combat operations ended 18 years later. A massive underwater earthquake near the Indonesian island of Sumatra spawned a tsunami that killed some 230,000 people and displaced an estimated 1.6 million others in more than a dozen countries from Indonesia to Kenya. The tsunami caused unprecedented destruction in many coastal areas of the Indian Ocean. Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst natural disasters ever to strike the U.S. It was originally designated a Category 4 storm—though later analysis said it was likely a Category 3 storm—with winds of 145 mph when it first struck Louisiana on Aug. 29, 2005, leading to the flooding of New Orleans and massive damage along the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama. In August 2006, the National Hurricane Center reported at least 1,833 deaths directly or indirectly caused by Katrina, including 1,577 in Louisiana. The sizzling hot U.S. housing market started to collapse under the weight of subprime mortgages being approved for high-risk borrowers, many with poor credit. The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate, sending adjustable mortgage interest rates soaring. Housing prices dramatically plummeted as a result and borrowers defaulted in record number. A major U.S. and global economic downturn began in 2007 and intensified in September 2008 as the housing market continued to collapse and stock markets suffered the largest losses since the Great Depression. Some financial institutions were left holding trillions of dollars in nearly worthless subprime mortgages, including global investment companies like Bear Stearns, which saw two of its hedge funds go belly up. In the historic Nov. 4 election, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois, and his running mate, Joe Biden, beat Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain and then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin by a wide margin in the Electoral College. The Obama-Biden ticket also won a majority of the popular vote, becoming the first Democratic ticket to do so since 1976. Obama, whose Black father was from Kenya and whose white mother was from Kansas, became the country's first Black president, inheriting a nation in deep financial crisis. The H1N1 swine influenza virus first emerged in spring 2009 in North America and quickly spread worldwide. On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic, raising its alert system to the highest level, Phase 6, for the first time since 1968. Hundreds of thousands of people were estimated to have died worldwide during the virus's initial year of circulation, while millions of infected people were thought to have suffered only mild symptoms before recovering fully. On Jan. 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, killing some 220,000 people, according to the U.N., and leaving at least 1 million more homeless. The decade-long search to bring Osama bin Laden to justice ended when the U.S. Navy's special forces unit SEAL Team 6 raided the terrorist leader's safe house in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2, 2011, killing him. ""Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, and a terrorist who’s responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children,"" President Obama announced in a late-night address to the nation. On Dec. 14, 2012, Adam Lanza, 20, armed with a Remington AR-15 rifle forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and in the course of 264 seconds, fatally shot 20 first graders and six staff members. On April 15, 2013, two backpack bombs were detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others in an incident that law enforcement officials deemed a terrorist attack. An intense investigation identified two brothers, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, as the suspects. The older Tsarnaev died in a shootout with law enforcement officers, and his younger brother was captured after he survived being shot. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted in 2015 on multiple federal charges, including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, and was sentenced to death. On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner, a 43-year-old Black man, died after a New York City police officer placed him in a chokehold, a maneuver that had been banned by the New York Police Department. A few weeks later, on Aug. 9, unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, setting off more than a week of protests and riots throughout Missouri and elsewhere. Both cases galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement launched in 2012 when Black teenager Trayvon Martin was fatally shot in Florida by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. In a historic decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution guaranteed a right to same-sex marriage in all 50 states. The 5-4 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges capped a long and often contentious battle over what many have called the ""defining civil rights challenge of our time."" The case behind the decision began in 2013, after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex spouses must be afforded the same federal benefits as other married couples. That ruling, though, did not tackle the question of whether gay marriage is a constitutional right. On Nov. 8, 2016, real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump won the presidential election as the Republican nominee, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic Party's nominee, and becoming the 45th president of the United States. Trump stunned observers by defying polling and pulling off a comfortable Electoral College victory despite losing the popular vote by millions. Also in 2016, a man who swore allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on June 12, a devastating day for the LGBTQ community. The gunman, 26-year-old Omar Mateen, was killed in a shootout with police. On Oct. 1, 2017, a former accountant opened fire from a window of a 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, killing 53 people and wounding more than 850 others attending the outdoor Route 91 Harvest Festival music concert below. The killer, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, died by suicide in the hotel suite, where investigators seized 24 guns, including AR-15 and AR-10 rifles with armor-piercing bullets. After movie mogul Harvey Weinstein's first accusers came forward in October 2017, activists urged women to publicly share stories of sexual harassment and abuse they may have suffered at the workplace and at the hands of powerful men in the entertainment industry. The campaign was commonly referred to as the #MeToo Movement because the #MeToo hashtag was widely used on social media platforms as a way to connect the many stories being shared in separate posts. On Feb. 14, 2018, a 19-year-old gunman killed 17 people and injured 17 others in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The gunman, Nikolas Cruz, pleaded guilty to 34 charges, including 17 counts of murder, in October 2021. A jury is currently being selected in the death penalty phase of his case. On Dec.18, 2019, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump. The House's Democratic majority won passage of two articles of impeachment, accusing Trump of abuse of power for allegedly trying to strong arm Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to announce an investigation of his political opponent Joe Biden and obstructing Congress by allegedly directing White House staff and employees of other federal agencies not to comply with subpoenas. He was acquitted in his 2020 trial by the Republican-controlled Senate. Two mass shooting occurred Aug. 4, 2019, one at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart store that left 23 people dead and 23 wounded, and the other in Dayton, Ohio, that left nine people dead, including the gunman's sister, and 17 wounded. The alleged gunman in the El Paso shooting, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, who purportedly told investigators he allegedly set out to kill as many Mexicans as he could, was charged with multiple counts of capital murder and hate crimes and is awaiting a federal trial. The Dayton gunman, 24-year-old Connor Betts, was fatally shot by police. In March of 2020, COVID-19 spread to United States causing thousands of deaths weekly and prompting a nationwide shutdown of most businesses. Amid the worst U.S. health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic, George Floyd was killed on May 25 when Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin dug his knee into the back of the handcuffed and prone Black man's neck for more than nine minutes. The incident was captured on video by witnesses and posted to social media, sparking nationwide protests. Chauvin was convicted by a state jury on April 20, 2021, and sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison. He pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights and is awaiting sentencing. As Congress was in session to certify the election of Joe Biden as President of the United States, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol Building in protest of the election, breaching security causing a lockdown of the Capitol. Five people died during or after the attack, including four protesters and one Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick, and approximately 140 officers suffered injuries, according to the Department of Justice. More than 750 people have been arrested for their alleged roles in the melee, including many who have either pleaded guilty or have been convicted. On Jan. 13, Trump became the first U.S. president to be impeached twice when he was charged with inciting the violent Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The then-Republican-controlled Senate voted 57-43 to acquit Trump, although seven Republican senators voted along with Democrats to convict him. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his army invade Ukraine on Feb. 24. Since the war started, thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed and millions more have been displaced from their homes have fled the country to seek refuge.",0
2022-05-12,https://abcnews.go.com/US/dial-live-blogs-abcnews-helped-transform-online-news/story?id=83787987,From dial-up to live blogs: How ABCNews.com helped transform online news over 25 years,"The internet was starting to come into its own in 1997. Most Americans who could surf the web were only able to do so with slow dial-up connections and many major newspapers and networks hadn’t yet established an online presence. It was at this moment that ABC News decided to extend its online reach with a dedicated website to complement its decades of broadcast journalism. For the reporters and producers who helped start the site, that task was a challenge. ""We used to joke it was the Wild West. Everyone was charting their own path. There was no playbook and we did what we thought what was best,"" said Zach Toback, a vice president at the company who worked as an associate producer in the multimedia department when ABCNews.com launched on May 15, 1997. Today, ABCNews.com has grown into one of the top-performing news sites in the world. Lulu Chiang, ABC News' vice president of digital content, said that a lot of the team's early decisions paid off, laying the foundation for what are now common elements of digital storytelling, including live video. ""There's a lot of information out there and we're the place of record,"" she said. ""We were very early to the game and our work paid off."" Into the unknown Toback said the internet speeds and technology at the time meant the news site had to be constructed with limited features that would be easily accessible to visitors. When the site launched, it featured articles based on news scripts from that day's ""World News Tonight"" broadcast, some original pieces and articles from The Associated Press. The website also offered video clips from ""World News Tonight"" segments that were no more than 20 seconds long, according to Toback. ""You had to download to play them, there was no streaming, and even these short clips took a long time to download,"" he said. The site launched with a major investigative piece, ""The Nuclear Threat,"" which looked at the difficulty of dismantling nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. The article included exclusive videos and audio that impressed observers. ""'The Nuclear Threat' illustrates what ABC hopes to do with the medium,"" Forbes wrote in a May 28 article. Growing with technology As time went on, the digital team began to notice some trends with users and quickly adapted their production. They saw higher traffic to the site during the afternoon hours, which Toback said correlated with lunch breaks. People working in offices and businesses had access to high-speed internet and they used it to keep up with the latest news. ""We would do a lot of programming in the middle of the day and morning. We sort of programmed our content around the fact that our audience was going to look at it during their work,"" Toback said. As the years went by and more Americans turned to the internet for their news, ABCNews.com adapted and added more features. Hourly updates of the top news from ABC News Radio, on-demand video clips, slideshows and more were introduced to complement the in-depth news articles and breaking stories on topics such as politics, the environment, technology and crime. Doug Looney, ABC News' director of post-production and distribution, said getting audio on the site years ago was no easy task. To do so, ABC News partnered with RealNetworks to stream the radio updates, creating the files from analog recordings, said Looney, who started out as a video designer for the website. ""We would take it back, capture it and digitize it into a computer ... and create a Real Audio file and that would be a streaming thing,"" Looney said. He said that as soon as the site was able to provide its own all-digital streaming audio, the team jumped on it. And that was only the beginning of ABCNews.com's evolution. Toback said the digital team pushed the multimedia storytelling experience for its audience. Everything from photo slideshows to GIFs were pushed to the site to enrich the content, which now included more original reporting from digital reporters. ""That was the beauty of the internet. [News] went from one-dimensional to two- and three-dimensional,"" Toback said. Looney said that when the website started to use 3D graphics and presentations to accompany stories, readers took notice. For example, the site ran a special interactive piece in 2006 where readers could take a tour of the USS Arizona, a Navy ship that was sunk during the attack on Pearl Harbor. ""I know when we would pitch ideas like that to other groups [at ABC News], that's when they would go, 'Whoa, what's that? You can do that on the site?'"" Looney said. Tapping into Web 2.0 and beyond ABCNews.com's growth jumped throughout the 2000s and 2010s as people increasingly consumed news on the web. Since December 1999, ABCNews.com has published more than 356,000 articles, according to Chiang. Similarly, in 2004, the site was publishing just six videos a day and today it's more than 100. ""At the end of the day, it's not just about having 'Good Morning America' in the morning and 'World News Tonight' and 'Nightline' at night. It's about having a 24/7 operation and ABCNews.com is key to that,"" she said. Looney and other members of the original ABCNews.com team said the network was quick to jump on social media and use that to grow the site's audience. Tweets, Facebook posts and even TikTok videos have helped push ABC News' digital coverage to more people. ""For a long time, it was all about creating that good experience for a computer screen. Now it's a phone screen,"" he said. ""There's a lot of reinventing of the same thing for those platforms."" According to Toback, the most important feature to be added to the site has been real-time coverage of breaking news and major news events through live blogs. The site has given readers these updates on recent stories like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Oscars through live streaming video of ABC News Live. ""The ability to have content in real time is the biggest advantage we have. Everyone wants everything yesterday, they don't want to wait,"" Toback said. And for Looney, there are still avenues of growth for the website and ABC News' online presence. ""We have seen Web 2.0, but no one really knows what Web 3.0 will be,"" he said, referring to the coming decentralized version of the internet. ""There's going to be a bigger leap in the internet and how people consume media and we're going to be on top of that."" Going forward, Chiang said ABCNews.com will be rolling out a redesign and new features that build upon that foundation built decades ago. ""We are excited about the changes [readers] will be seeing in the weeks and months to come,"" she said.",27
2022-05-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/inflation-abortion-vote-showcase-democrats-governing-limits-note/story?id=84651101,"Inflation, abortion vote showcase Democrats’ governing limits: The Note","The TAKE with Rick Klein Democrats' latest midterm messaging is heavy on blame – directed at Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, at Sen. Rick Scott's proposed agenda, at former President Donald Trump's Supreme Court picks and also at what Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says he might do with a Senate majority. But the messaging turn hasn't included policy movement to confront the challenges party leaders view as fundamental. Soaring inflation and an expected Supreme Court case eliminating the constitutional right to abortion have Democrats in a familiar place: taking votes, but then also explaining what their current majorities cannot accomplish. The failed vote to codify a right to abortion in federal law played out exactly as Democratic leaders knew it would, and left them pointing six months down the road for solutions. ""Voters need to elect more pro-choice senators this November,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement after the vote. ""Elect more MAGA Republicans if you want to see a nationwide abortion ban,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The president's focus on what he called his ""top priority"" of inflation featured a sharp turn this week against what he is calling an ""ultra-MAGA"" GOP agenda, citing the plans advanced by Scott, R-Fla. He said he understands that voters are frustrated, yet may have inadvertently summed up the contradictions Democrats are struggling with. ""You justifiably are right, we control all three branches of government. We don't really,"" the president said Tuesday. Pushing their voters to care about the midterms fits with any political strategy of getting voters engaged. That may be more problematic, though, when part of what they're being engaged over proves to be exercises in legislative futility. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Several prominent Republican governors are going all in to support Gov. Brian Kemp, as Georgia's May 24 primary nears. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are all expected to hit the campaign trail with Kemp, who is being challenged from the right by former Sen. David Perdue, who is backed by former President Trump. Each of the governors has leadership ties to the Republican Governors Association. The dynamic reveals fracturing within the Republican Party, with establishment leaders on one side and Trump on the other. Trump, who has publicly lashed out against Kemp since he refused to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, issued a statement in which he referred to Ducey, Ricketts and Christie as ""RINOs,"" which is shorthand for ""Republicans in name only"" and an insult in conservative circles. This isn't the first gubernatorial race in which establishment figures have gone all out against a Trump-endorsed candidate. The latest comes after Tuesday's gubernatorial primary in Rickett's home state. There, Ricketts and other establishment figures supported businessman Jim Pillen who came out on top over Trump's pick Charles Herbster who had been accused of sexual assault by eight women. Kemp is the favorite to win his primary, despite Trump's campaign against him. The TIP with Brittany Shepherd A federal judge has struck down a portion of Florida's previously approved map drawn by Gov. Ron DeSantis and his staff that reconfigures the state's 28 districts. It's a turn of bad luck for DeSantis, who has been sailing recently on the headwinds of many political wins and the hint of a good fortune for voting rights activists who are suing over the GOP-friendly redistricting plan. Leon County Circuit Judge Layne Smith, a DeSantis appointee, said Wednesday that he will issue a preliminary injunction that keeps a segment of the DeSantis-supported map – which majorly reconstructs Florida's 5th district, where Black voters made up the majority – from taking effect in November's general election because it ""diminishes African Americans' ability to elect candidates of their choice."" According to FiveThirtyEight, Smith has reinstated the old configuration of FL-05 that stretches from parts of Jacksonville to Tallahassee. If passed, DeSantis' map could also eliminate Democrats' national redistricting advantage. DeSantis has said this original configuration is unconstitutional because it is ""racially gerrymandered."" The district in question, Fl-05, is currently led by Black Democrat Rep. Al Lawson, who said the governor is ""wrong for enacting this Republican-leaning map that is in clear violation of the U.S. and state constitutions."" DeSantis' office has made it clear they plan on appealing. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 40. That’s the number of bills that have been introduced since January 2021 that seek to restrict how gender and gender identity are taught at schools, according to FiveThirtyEight’s Jean Yi. And as Jean writes, the current push to restrict trans rights goes far beyond athletics. Republican state lawmakers are also increasingly limiting how gender is talked about in the classroom as part of a broader push to limit what teachers can — and can’t say.

2022-05-13,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/homeland-security-announces-16b-local-grants-extremism-security/story?id=84670065,"Homeland Security announces $1.6B in local grants for election security, to combat extremism","Shortly after the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, then-top Department of Homeland Security official Alejandro Mayorkas saw a picture of a Federal Emergency Management Agency analysis as part of the investigation — and realized the equipment used, to illustrate what happened on the day of bombing and lay out a plethora of evidence and leads, had been purchased through a grant program run by his department. Years later, a repeat: After a shooting on the New York City subway last month injured 10 people, Mayorkas told ABC News in an interview this week, authorities relied on equipment purchased with FEMA funds to capture ""critical evidence."" ""We impact people's lives by making those lives safer,"" said Mayorkas, now the secretary of DHS. The DHS on Friday announced nearly $1.6 billion as part of the FEMA preparedness grant program for the 2022 fiscal year, available to cities from coast to coast, with a specific focus on terrorism and preventing disasters. The newly announced awards are the latest in what DHS officials called significant funding funneled to the local level. Since FEMA's preparedness grant program began in 2002, the department has given localities more than $54 billion. State and local governments, which can apply annually, can be funded by eight grant programs that range from an increase in law enforcement equipment to overtime for local officers on the southern border. The grant recipients for the largest amount of money, the Urban Area Security Initiative, have to address six priority areas of cybersecurity, soft target and crowded places, information and intelligence sharing, domestic violent extremism, community preparedness and resilience and election security, according to DHS. The categories of community preparedness and resilience and election security are new for 2022, Mayorkas told ABC News. DHS' continued focus on cybersecurity and domestic extremism comes amid the department's concerns of possible Russian cyberattacks as retaliation to the U.S. response to the war in Ukraine and what Mayorkas himself has called one of the ""greatest"" threats to the country: homegrown extremists. As part of the latest wave of grants, which will be disbursed throughout the 2022 fiscal year, DHS will identify 36 high-threat, high-density cities, states and localities that will receive some of the $615 million funds allocated through the program to focus on the six priority areas. These areas are selected in a nonpartisan way, Mayorkas stressed. ""This is a risk-based program,"" he said. The secretary told ABC News that officials have increased the percentage of funds — from 25% to 30% — which must be dedicated to law enforcement's terrorism prevention. Mayorkas cited their ""role in preventing terrorist acts on the front lines in each of our communities across the country."" In years past, according to public filings, the grants have been used to fund local narcotics task forces, training for intelligence analysts and more. Mayorkas says the program has improved because they've engaged with local stakeholders on the flexibility of how they spend their grant money. Along the southern border — where federal officials have been dealing with historically high levels of migration — the department is allocating $90 million for local communities through their Operation Stonegarden grant. Operation Stonegarden pays for border officer overtime, Mayorkas said, as well as technology enhancements for local communities, such as phones and tablets to allow for better communication, according to previous filings. Regarding the southern border, the secretary told ABC News that the federal government has been planning since September for the end of Title 42, the Trump-era policy continued by the Biden administration which expels migrants before they can seek asylum under the auspices of a public heath emergency. President Joe Biden's White House is seeking to now roll back the use of Title 42 regarding immigrants — which drew intense criticism from advocates under both Trump and Biden — but that plan is being challenged in court, with the latest hearing scheduled in Louisiana on Friday. Conservatives have continually voiced concerns about how the government will handle high levels of immigration at the same time that the government's treatment of these migrants, dating beyond the Biden administration, has also drawn scrutiny.",12
2022-05-13,https://abcnews.go.com/International/afghan-journalists-fled-taliban-limbo-pakistan/story?id=84316382,Afghan journalists who fled the Taliban say they're in limbo in Pakistan,"LONDON -- After eight months of living in hiding and moving between three safe houses in different cities in her native Afghanistan, 32-year-old journalist Fawzia Sayedzada said she fled her Taliban-ruled country in April. Sayedzada told ABC News that she had been arrested in Kabul and threatened by the Taliban for covering the news, especially women's protests, after the Taliban takeover last August. She joined dozens of other Afghan journalists in neighboring Pakistan, where she said they are now stranded. Many of them have managed to leave Afghanistan with the help of human rights aid groups, but are now waiting for their fate to be decided by U.N. member nations, including the United States, Canada and Germany, that have announced special schemes to let them in. ""We were not safe in Afghanistan, and we know we are not safe here,"" Sayedzada told ABC News. Many Afghan refugees who have fled the Taliban to Pakistan face potential danger from local Taliban members, Sayedzada said, adding that some journalists and former members of rights groups are seen as more high-profile targets. That's why Sayedzada is now advocating on behalf of those reporters, she said. ""We have been trying to help people be heard,"" she told ABC News. ""And, now, on behalf of many of my colleagues here, I'd say we also need to be heard, as we feel we are forgotten by the world."" Afghanistan was ranked 122 out of 180 countries in the latest World Press Freedom Index, which Reporters Without Borders (RSF) issued in April 2021. Pakistan was ranked 157 on the index. While some of these journalists have come with their family members, others have had to leave Afghanistan on their own, which puts them in a vulnerable situation, especially in Pakistan, according to Sayedzada. ""Pakistan is a second home to Taliban members. They are everywhere and keep spying on us,"" she said. ""If you live on your own and have no one to rely on, it would be scary and very tough to survive."" Pakistan, in response, said journalists and aid workers were being protected by local and national police. ""If any refugee faces any threat, they can contact the security forces of the interior ministry or the foreign ministry,"" Abdullah Khan, secretary to the spokesman of the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told ABC News. Khan said ""Pakistan protects all of the refugees that enter the country,"" adding that he couldn't comment on specific cases. The acting spokesperson of the Taliban foreign ministry did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. Earlier this year, the Committee to Protect Journalists warned of eroding press freedoms under the Taliban, including last year's order that female journalists must wear hijabs while on screen. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Pakistan currently hosts more than 1.4 million registered Afghans who have been forced to flee their homes over the years of war. UNHCR has announced that processing asylum cases for Afghans in Pakistan may take time due to the excessive number of applicants. During a protest in Pakistan on April 27, a group of about 60 journalists from Afghanistan called for support from the international community and asked that their asylum cases be followed up and accelerated. After the protest, Sayedzada said a young woman who had fled the country on her own asked if she could stay with Sayedzada and her family. ""It broke my heart I could not help her as we are already four people trying to make the ends meet until we are picked by a safe country that lets us in,"" she told ABC News. Sayedzada, who worked in Afghanistan with television channel Setare-ye Sobh and radio program Zemzemeh, is a single mother of a 13-year-old boy. She crossed the Afghanistan-Pakistan border with her son, her elderly mother and one of her brothers. She said her brother, who isn't a journalist, has also been arrested and tortured by the Taliban several times, providing medical records to ABC News for review. ""Both my brother and I received death threats from the Taliban many times and had to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible,"" Sayedzada said. ""We had no choice but to leave my father and other family members back home."" At least 50 journalists and media workers in Afghanistan have been detained briefly or arrested by police or the Istikhbarat, the Taliban intelligence agency, since the Taliban returned to power, RSF said in early February. ""These arrests, which are often accompanied by violence, have lasted from several hours to nearly a week. They usually occur when journalists are covering street demonstrations by women in the capital, Kabul,"" RSF wrote, adding that the Istikhbarat and the Taliban's Ministry for Promoting Virtue and Suppressing Vice are ""directly implicated"" in this harassment. Despite the dangers of speaking up, Sayedzada said her colleagues both in Afghanistan and Pakistan keep reporting on the dire situation of living under the Taliban. ""After our gathering in Pakistan and asking for the acceleration of processing our asylum cases, I received a phone call from a Taliban member who told me if I keep talking to the media, they would hang me from the gates of the town so other journalists take a lesson,"" Sayedzada told ABC News. ""But I am not going to stop speaking up, even if I am sometimes scared."" Being heartbroken by the news coming from Ukraine, Sayedzada said she deeply relates to the Ukrainian people and feels the horror of living in a war situation or being forced to leave home. ""We share the pain and suffrage,"" she said. ""War is a sore on the body of humanity and its pain is not bound to borders."" Sayedzada said she and her colleagues in Pakistan have heard that the process of their asylum cases might take longer due to the surge of Ukrainian refugees. She, however, said she wants everyone to be safe, ""whether from Ukraine, Afghanistan or Iraq."" ""It is true that the process of admitting Afghan refugees and asylum seekers to the western countries might get affected by the urgency of the cases coming from Ukraine,"" she told ABC News. ""It does not affect how I feel for Ukrainian people, though."" ""But I do believe that the world needs to remember us and the threats we are facing so they treat us equally to Ukrainians,"" she added. ""Being forgotten is the worst, especially after my colleagues' attempts to amplify the voice of vulnerable people.""",23
2022-05-17,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/1st-major-court-test-doj-special-counsel-investigating/story?id=84778977,1st major court test for DOJ special counsel investigating origins of Russia probe,"The Justice Department special counsel investigating the origins of the probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election is facing his first major test in federal court this week, with the start of a criminal trial against a Democrat-linked lawyer charged with lying to the FBI. Prosecutors are seeking to convince a jury that lawyer Michael Sussmann lied in bringing forth a tip to a senior FBI official in September 2016 about potential connections between then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's company and a Russian bank, by allegedly telling the official that he was not working on behalf of any client at the time. According to John Durham, who has been investigating the Russia probe for more than three years and was appointed special counsel by former Attorney General William Barr just before Barr’s resignation in 2020, Sussmann was in fact bringing the info to then-FBI general counsel James Baker as part of Sussmann's work for Hillary Clinton's political campaign and a technology company executive who had worked to assemble the data. This ""led the FBI General Counsel to understand that Sussmann was acting as a good citizen merely passing along information, not as a paid advocate or political operative,"" Durham's indictment alleges. ""Many people have strong feelings about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, but we are not here because these involve allegations involved either,"" Durham prosecutor Deborah Shaw said in opening arguments Tuesday. ""We are here because the FBI is our institution. It should not be used as a political tool for anyone."" The alleged lie by Sussmann had an impact on how the FBI ultimately investigated the allegations, Durham has claimed, which involved data showing a potential communications channel between computer servers for the Trump Organization and the Russian-owned Alfa Bank. The FBI eventually determined the data did not show anything nefarious. A key piece of evidence Durham's team has said supports their case was revealed only last month. Prosecutors will point the jury to a text message that Sussmann allegedly sent to Baker the night before they met in which Sussmann wrote, ""I’m coming on my own – not on behalf of a client or company – want to help the Bureau."" While the charge against Sussmann is narrow, through their 27-page indictment and hundreds of pages of court filings in the months since Sussmann was indicted, Durham's prosecutors have sought to allege a broader potential conspiracy regarding efforts by Clinton's campaign and other political operatives to spread unverified allegations about possible ties between Trump, his campaign and the Russian government. ""No one should be so privileged to have the ability to walk into the FBI and lie for political ends,"" Shaw said Tuesday, adding ""whether we hate Donald Trump or like him,"" all have to agree lying to FBI is illegal. Sussmann's attorneys have disputed he told Baker at the meeting that he was not bringing the information forward on behalf of a specific client, and have argued that there's no evidence such a statement had a measurable impact on how FBI agents eventually investigated the allegations. In opening statements Tuesday, Sussmann's attorney Michael Bosworth said while Sussmann was representing Clinton's campaign ""generally"" in the fall of 2016 -- and that representation included work on the Alfa Bank data that was brought to him by tech executive Rodney Joffe -- his meeting with the FBI was not part of his work for the Clinton campaign. On the contrary, according to Bosworth, Sussmann sought the meeting to give the bureau a heads up on a story the New York Times was working on about the Alfa Bank data at the time, so it wouldn't be caught ""flat-footed."" While Durham's team argues Sussmann was hoping the meeting would later result in an ""October surprise"" news story about the FBI opening an investigation on potential ties between Trump and Russia -- Bosworth said that as a result of the meeting, the FBI was actually able to persuade the Times not to run the story. In other words, according to Bosworth, Sussmann's meeting generated the ""opposite"" result of what the Clinton campaign would have wanted at the time. Sussmann's attorneys have previously accused Durham's prosecutors of trying to promote a ""baseless narrative that the Clinton Campaign conspired with others to trick the federal government into investigating ties between President Trump and Russia,"" and have successfully sought to limit some of the evidence that Durham's team had hoped to present in the two-week trial. Last week, the judge overseeing Sussmann's case, Christopher Cooper, issued an order that will prevent Durham's team from bringing forward evidence alleging what they have described as a ""joint venture"" between Sussmann, representatives for Clinton's campaign and the technology executive Rodney Joffe to collect and spread opposition research about Trump. In his ruling, Cooper said he would not oversee ""a time-consuming and largely unnecessary mini-trial to determine the existence and scope of an uncharged conspiracy to develop and disseminate the Alfa Bank data."" The witness lists for both Durham's prosecutors and Sussmann's team are extensive, and include an array of current and former law enforcement and intelligence officials, former Clinton campaign operatives and a former New York Times reporter who was in touch with Sussmann around the time he met with the FBI. In the three years since Durham was initially assigned to look into the origins of the Russia investigation, he has secured only one guilty plea of a former lawyer with the FBI who admitted to doctoring an email that was used to support a surveillance application that targeted a former Trump campaign aide. Durham’s only other indictment outside of Sussmann was against Igor Danchenko, a lead analyst who contributed to the now-infamous Steele Dossier, who was charged last year with five counts of lying to the FBI about who his sources were for claims in the dossier. Danchenko has pleaded not guilty to all counts. While he has conducted his investigation largely out of public view the past three years, Durham has notably opted to attend the first days of Sussmann's trial in person.",11
2022-05-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-pauses-scrutinized-disinformation-group-review-slams-gross/story?id=84808464,DHS pauses much-scrutinized disinformation group for review but slams 'gross mischaracterizations',"The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday it was pausing its short-lived Disinformation Governance Board pending a review of the larger strategy behind it. The person tapped to lead the group, former Wilson Center fellow Nina Jankowicz, said she had resigned as a result. Both Jankowicz and a DHS spokesperson said the group had itself become a target of disinformation since its creation was announced in late April. A DHS official went further on Wednesday, saying Jankowicz was ""the subject of some particularly vicious and unfair attacks."" As the official suggested, Jankowicz became the face of conservative-fueled criticism, some of it in personal terms. Others voiced concerns about her background: Jankowicz, who is routinely outspoken on Twitter, had publicly criticized Republicans and sowed doubt about the accuracy of press reports critical of President Joe Biden's son Hunter. More broadly, the disinformation board found detractors in the GOP and some leading civil liberties groups over the scope of its work. That scrutiny was fueled by an admittedly clumsy rollout -- such as a confusing name -- as well as an initial lack of specifics about the board's operations. In an interview with ABC News last week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the board wasn't rolled out ""effectively,"" but that its work was ""exactly contrary"" to how it was being portrayed. ""It was intended to ensure coordination across the Department's component agencies as they protect Americans from disinformation that threatens the homeland,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. ""The Board has been grossly and intentionally mischaracterized: it was never about censorship or policing speech in any manner. It was designed to ensure we fulfill our mission to protect the homeland, while protecting core Constitutional rights."" ""However,"" the spokesperson continued, ""false attacks have become a significant distraction from the Department's vitally important work to combat disinformation that threatens the safety and security of the American people."" The board is now on hold awaiting a report and a review of strategy for how the department can combat disinformation effectively while still protecting civil liberties. That work will be handled by members of the recently revamped Homeland Security Advisory Council. The DHS said that former Secretary Michael Chertoff and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick were tapped by Mayorkas to produce recommendations on the future of the group within 75 days. ""During the HSAC's review … the Department's critical work across several administrations to address disinformation that threatens the security of our country will continue,"" the DHS spokesperson said. In her own statement on Wednesday, Jankowicz said, ""With the Board's work paused and its future uncertain, and I have decided to leave DHS to return to my work in the public sphere. … It is deeply disappointing that mischaracterizations of the Board became a distraction from the Department's vital work, and indeed, along with recent events globally and nationally, embodies why it is necessary."" ""I maintain my commitment to building awareness of disinformation's threats and trust the Department will do the same,"" Jankowciz said. Administration officials emphasized that the decision to temporarily suspend the board was in part due to the ""extreme"" reaction from those who disagreed with it. ""There have been gross mischaracterizations of what the board what the board's work would be and there have been grotesque personal attacks,"" one official said Wednesday. ""And the reaction has candidly become a distraction to the department's important work in addressing disinformation to security."" Mayorkas himself ultimately made the move to reassess the board before the group ever hosted its first meeting, according to the official. Asked if the decision was politically motivated, the official said the broader point was to ensure the success of the department's mission to counter misinformation campaigns, which the government believes compromise security. The DHS had been on the defensive about the board for weeks, with Mayorkas being pressed by Republicans about it during a Senate hearing earlier this month. The department previously admitted that ""there has been confusion about the working group, its role, and its activities"" and vowed to work on building greater public trust. DHS has said the the panel would not be involved in managing department operations and Mayorkas said the group would ""bring together the experts throughout our department to ensure that our ongoing work in combating disinformation is done in a way that does not infringe on free speech, a fundamental constitutional right embedded in the First Amendment, nor on the right of privacy or other civil rights and civil liberties."" Addressing disinformation is a major homeland security priority and DHS had said the new board would help counter false claims from human smugglers and Russia. A Homeland Security spokesperson stressed that work again on Wednesday, noting ""malicious efforts spread by foreign adversaries, human traffickers, and transnational criminal organizations."" Some Republicans cheered the board's suspension, renewing attacks that it was ""Orwellian"" in nature and would, despite DHS' statements otherwise, be ""policing"" U.S. citizens. ""This board was only successful in reinforcing that the Department of Homeland Security's priorities are severely misplaced,"" Rep. Mike Turner, of Ohio, and New York Rep. John Katko said in a joint statement Wednesday. ""When the border crisis is worsening daily, cyber-attacks from adversaries are threatening to cripple our critical infrastructure, the rise in violent crime is putting Americans across the country in danger, and disrupted supply chains are having devastating impacts on Americans, DHS is focused on policing Americans' free speech."" But the group was warily received by some civil liberties advocates, too. ""The burden is on the government to explain why a Homeland Security Department needs a disinformation board in the first place,"" Ben Wizner, director of ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told ABC News on Wednesday. ""They really have only themselves to blame for the political backlash, given that they announced this without offering any clarity about the mission or scope of the board."" A group of First Amendment-focused organizations wrote to Mayorkas earlier this month asking for the type of re-evaluation that DHS has now announced. ""The Department has demonstrated a readiness to cross the legal bounds of privacy and speech rights. Coupled with the Department's checkered record on civil liberties, the Department's muddled announcement of the Board has squandered the trust that would be required for the Board to fulfill its mission,"" the groups, led by the nonprofit Protect Democracy, said in a statement. Former Acting Head of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS John Cohen, who is also an ABC News contributor, said the responsibilities of the board were widely misunderstood. ""The intention of the board was to facilitate the discussion on policy issues impacting the department, it was meant to ensure that the department protected privacy and civil liberties, as they move to evaluate threat related online content,"" Cohen said. Cohen, who helped stand up the disinformation board and left the department last month, said earlier in May that the board addressed a communication issue within the department. ""It didn't coordinate operational activities, it wasn't governing intelligence operations, it had no input on how organizations collect intelligence or information,"" he said then. ""It was simply intended to be a working group that would gather on an ad hoc basis to address matters of policy.""",12

The first daughter, 40, was scheduled to travel to Latin America this week with first lady Jill Biden. The president and first lady are not considered a close contacts, according to the first lady's spokesperson, Michael LaRosa. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reaffirmed in Wednesday's briefing that the president was not considered a close contact of his daughter, who he hasn't seen in ""about a week."" She did not have guidance on when the president was last tested for COVID-19. ""[T]he president tests regularly throughout the week as part of a cadence as determined by his doctor,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters. ""If his testing were to change because of the close contact, we’d let all of you know, but his cadence has not changed."" Ashley Biden will no longer be joining the first lady on her trip to Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica, LaRosa said. Jill Biden was scheduled to depart Wednesday afternoon for Quito, Ecuador. This is the second foreign trip Ashley Biden has had to drop out of in recent weeks. She was considered a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19 before the first lady's trip to Poland, Romania and Ukraine earlier this month. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, who is currently meeting with health officials from G-7 countries in Germany, also tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, the agency said. The president is not considered a close contact, it said. As the BA.2 subvariant has spread around Washington, several people within the president's inner circle have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks, including Vice President Kamala Harris, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield, former press secretary Jen Psaki and Jean-Pierre herself. The president has never been deemed a close contact. When asked how this was possible, Jean-Pierre reiterated Wednesday that ""extra precautions"" are taken around meetings with the president. Because she had a meeting with the president today, Jean-Pierre said she was tested, masked and the meeting was socially distanced. Masks are now optional at the White House campus, though meetings with the president are often socially distanced, officials said. White House officials have also stressed that the president is up-to-date on COVID boosters. Someone is considered a close contact if the person was within 6 feet of an individual with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period, per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

Vadim Shishimarin pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing an unarmed Ukrainian civilian. The guilty plea carries a life sentence. Shishimarin, 21, is accused of shooting a 62-year-old man on Feb. 28. The man was a resident of Chupakhivka who was riding a bike on the roadside when he was shot, according to Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general. This is the first trial Ukraine has conducted for an act that could be considered a war crime. Asked by the presiding judge whether he accepted his guilt, Shishimarin said: ""Yes. Fully yes."" Shishimarin is charged with murder and two counts of robbery. He surrendered to Ukrainian law enforcement and has been a prisoner of war since, Ukrainian prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the proceedings on Wednesday, telling reporters that accusations leveled against Russian soldiers by Ukraine were ""simply fake or staged.""",0
2022-05-18,https://abcnews.go.com/International/bloody-protests-iran-food-prices/story?id=84789746,Bloody protests in Iran are not just about food prices,"LONDON -- Hundreds of Iranians have taken to the streets in cities across the country, protesting against the crippling political and economic situation. Unofficial reports say security forces have killed at least four people. Coming from all walks of life, protestors shout slogans that target the top officials of the clerical system, including the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Ebrahim Raisi. The internet in the cities with ongoing protests is either cut or partially throttled by the government in an attempt to control the spreading of the news. The unrest started after the government cut subsidies on essential food items such as cooking oil, eggs and milk last Wednesday. For example, the price of cooking increased more than 400% overnight. However, dominant slogans in the protests like ""Down with Khamenei, Down with dictator"" and ""We don't want mullah's ruling"" indicate that protesting the ailing economy follows another primary demand: overthrowing the system. ""The establishment suffers from lack of legitimacy,"" Mohammad Mosaed, a dissident journalist in exile, told ABC News. ""It has failed to fulfill the promises it made 43 years ago like freedom and justice."" Mosaed had to leave Iran after another series of protests in November 2019. With hundreds of people killed and thousands arrested, the nationwide protests in 2019 were the deadliest since the Islamic revolution in 1979. The exact number of killings still remains unknown due to the strict censorship of the media and cutting off the whole country's internet for 10 days. Those protests also started after fuel went up three times its cost and soon spread all around the country, especially in small cities. ""The current protests are similar to those in 2019 as they are not bound to Tehran that has a bigger middle-class population, but are rather spread all over the country, especially in smaller towns which are economically deprived,"" Mosaed said. Iran's state media has repeatedly blamed the West's economic sanctions for the hardship the country faces. They are the sanctions that mainly aim to restrict Iran's nuclear program. In 2015, Iran committed to restricting its nuclear program in return for the West's commitment to easing the sanctions in a deal with the world powers known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). However, in May 2018, then-President Donald Trump pulled out of the pact, leaving it a matter of renegotiation. Four years later, after rounds of talks, the process of reviving JCPOA is still stalled due to disagreements between Iran and other parties -- the U.S., France, Germany, the U.K., Russia and China. However, unlike the Islamic Republic's blame narrative, many believe Western sanctions are not the only reason or even the main reason for the situation. ""The recent crippling situation resulted from having totally incompetent leaders for years, widespread corruption, and then the sanctions,"" Mosaed said. After four decades of giving several chances to different parties to lead the country, Mosaed believes that more and more people are coming to the understanding that the incompetency and corruption of the leaders must be the main subject of the protests. ""Many of these people used to form the main body of the establishment's loyal patrons, and now the former patrons have turned to fierce protesters,"" he added.",10
2022-05-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pennsylvania-gop-reaps-trump-sows-note/story?id=84811395,Pennsylvania GOP reaps what Trump sows: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The advice from former President Donald Trump was as unsolicited as it was unwelcome to Republicans in Pennsylvania looking to bring the party together after a searing primary. But in reality, many of those seeking office this year have been almost literally asking for it. Trump's call for Mehmet Oz to ""declare victory"" to make it ""much harder for them to cheat"" cited no evidence and left unclear who ""them"" might be. Thousands of legally cast votes – including from members of the military serving overseas – have yet to be counted, and a recount is likely to be triggered under state law. Oz hasn't taken Trump's advice, and none of the candidates have raised questions about the validity of votes not yet counted. But during their campaigns, all the major Republican candidates for statewide office in Pennsylvania landed somewhere on the spectrum between emphasizing ""election integrity"" and outright claiming that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, despite any proof of fraud. Another Senate candidate who surged late in the race, Kathy Barnette, was at the Jan. 6 rally before the U.S. Capitol riots and footage unearthed this week showed her marching toward the Capitol that day, though she said she didn't participate in violence. Barnette has yet to concede defeat despite trailing far behind Oz and Dave McCormick; she said on the eve of the primary that she wouldn't endorse Oz or McCormick if either won because, in her words, ""I have no intentions of supporting globalists."" No one is questioning the fact that state Sen. Doug Mastriano sailed to the Republican nomination for governor, powered in part by Trump's endorsement. Mastriano himself was also at the Jan. 6 rally — but also said he didn't join the insurrection. He did lead legal and state legislative efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and would be empowered to choose Pennsylvania's next secretary of state if he wins the race for governor. Next week brings more races, notably in Georgia and Texas, where pro-Trump candidates have endorsed lies and conspiracy theories about the 2020 race. Those issues are clearly relevant in 2022 – and could be even more consequential in 2024. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper A draft of new congressional maps in New York released this week is already shaking up midterm races and now former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is considering a congressional bid. ""Our neighborhoods need help as we recover from Covid. Our nation needs help as democracy is threatened and working people struggle. I am ready to serve to continue the fight against inequality,"" de Blasio wrote in a tweet announcing an exploratory committee for the new 10th congressional district which would now include his Brooklyn neighborhood. That seat, currently occupied by Rep. Jerry Nadler, would have to be vacated by the veteran congressman, as his Upper East Side home would now be a part of the 12th district. Some believe de Blasio would have a good shot at victory in the new NY-10. ""He can run on two issues, which is 'I'll stop the guns and I'll fight for choice,'"" Hank Sheinkopf, a New York political consultant, told ABC News. ""He's got large, large numbers of people who listen to him and voted for him in the past in that district today."" Nadler could face Rep. Carolyn Maloney in a member-on-member matchup caused by the map's new boundaries. The move comes after de Blasio opted not to launch a gubernatorial bid following his two-term tenure as mayor of New York City. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema While the results of one of Pennsylvania's primary contests could take weeks to finalize, the outcome of elections in Texas, the first state to vote in 2022, will be tied up in less than a week. The national reckoning over the draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade looms over the runoff for Texas' 28th Congressional District where moderate incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar is facing off for a second time against progressive, Jessica Cisneros. While the race was already contentious before news of the draft made headlines, the issue of abortion is taking center stage in the last days of the campaign given Cuellar's voting record as the sole anti-abortion Democrat in the House. In the weeks leading up to Tuesday's runoff, Cisneros -- who has the backing of high-profile progressives like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley -- called on Democratic House leaders to revoke their endorsements of Cuellar due to his anti-abortion stance. The stakes are high -- a primary loss for a longtime incumbent in one of the nation's most conservative states would be a stunning upset and would signal that abortion access is a top issue for voters. Across the aisle, Republicans will once again test out whether Trump's endorsement is enough to carry a controversial candidate across the finish line in the runoff for Texas attorney general. During a recent rally in Austin, Texas, Trump reaffirmed his support for incumbent Ken Paxton, calling him ""a fighter like no other,"" despite Paxton being the subject of a series of allegations tied to state and federal investigations. His opponent, Land Commissioner George P. Bush, lost out on Trump's endorsement, which he sought despite his family's opposition to the former president's policies. Despite his family's deep ties to Texas politics, Bush is facing a hurdle as he attempts to distance himself from being seen as too much of a centrist for the current political climate within his party.

2022-05-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-40-billion-aid-ukraine-bill-heads/story?id=84835587,"Senate passes $40 billion in new aid to Ukraine, bill heads to Biden","The Senate voted on Thursday to pass an additional $40 billion in new aid for Ukraine, after President Joe Biden called on Congress last month to deliver the additional funding, to help counter Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion over the long term. In his floor remarks before the 86 -11 vote, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer noted the significance of the package. ""By passing this aid package the Senate can now say to the Ukrainian people help is on the way: real help, significant help, help that could ensure the Ukrainian people are victorious,"" he said. With the House having passed the aid package earlier this month, it will now head next to Biden's desk. The aid package got broad bipartisan support with some Republican holdouts. It had been stalled for several days after Republican Sen. Rand Paul's refusal to expedite to process. In floor remarks before Thursday's vote, Republican Leader Mitch McConnell promised a ""big bipartisan landslide"" and seemed to thumb his nose at concerns from Paul and other deficit hawks about the cost of the Ukraine bill. ""Anyone concerned about the cost of supporting a Ukrainian victory should consider the much larger cost should Ukraine lose,"" McConnell said as he encouraged all members to join the ""big bipartisan supermajority"" voting to advance the aid package. But Schumer went further, calling out the group of Republicans who he expects will vote against the aid package. ""It appears more and more MAGA republicans are on the same soft on Putin playbook that we saw used by former President Trump,"" Schumer said. ""The MAGA influence on the Republican party is becoming all too large and all too dominant. We Americans all of us Democrats and Republicans cannot afford to stick our heads in the sand while Vladimir Putin continues his vicious belligerence against the Ukrainian people while he fires at civilian hospitals and targets and kills children and innocent people,"" he said. ""But when Republicans -- in significant number -- oppose this package that is precisely the signal, we are sending to enemies abroad,"" Schumer said.",26

Bush had a tongue-tied moment at a speech on Wednesday and millions on social media took notice. When condemning Russia's attack on Ukraine, Bush mistakenly referred to the decision to launch an ""unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq"" before quickly correcting himself to say ""Ukraine,"" in what was a bungled criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq,"" said Bush, before catching himself and shaking his head. ""I mean -- of Ukraine."" Realizing his mistake, Bush then appeared to say under his breath, ""Iraq, too."" Bush made the comment in a speech at his presidential center at Southern Methodist University in Dallas on Wednesday during an event examining the future of American elections. After a pause, Bush blamed the mistake on his age and the audience laughed. ""Anyway, [I'm] 75,"" he said. But on Twitter, the reaction to Bush's inadvertent reference to the most polarizing decision of his administration was mixed, as users revived criticism of his decision to invade and sarcastically riffed on his history of such slip-ups. Former Rep. Joe Walsh, who ran for the Republican nomination for president in 2020, tweeted as the clip swirled through social media: ""All gaffes aside, George W Bush was wrong to invade Iraq. And Putin was wrong to invade Ukraine."" Another user cracked that ""Freud really stepped out of his grave to personally slap the ‘Iraq’ out of Bush’s mouth didn’t he."" The mixup was widely seen. Since video of Bush's speech was clipped and tweeted by Dallas Morning News reporter Michael Williams on Wednesday, it has been viewed more than 17 million times. In his Wednesday remarks, Bush also described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a ""cool little guy,"" deeming him ""the [Winston] Churchill of the 21st century."" As president, Bush oversaw the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- as part of the post-9/11 conflicts in the Middle East -- under the pretext that the country was hiding weapons of mass destruction, or WMDs. Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein, was deposed but no weapons were found, and the war officially lasted for nearly a decade. While the Bush administration argued the fighting was necessary for national security even without the WMDs, it became increasingly unpopular at home. Thousands of U.S. service members and tens of thousands of civilians died. Bush wrote in his post-White House memoir that he had a ""sickening feeling"" when he learned there were no WMDs in Iraq after their supposed existence was used as justification for the invasion. He told ABC News' ""World News Tonight"" when leaving office in 2008 that the ""biggest regret"" of his presidency was what he called the ""intelligence failure in Iraq."" When pressed in that interview, Bush declined to ""speculate"" on whether he would still have gone to war if he knew Iraq didn't have WMDs. ""That is a do-over that I can't do,"" he said. Nonetheless, he wrote in his memoir, ""I strongly believe that removing Saddam from power was the right decision."" ABC News' Chris Donovan contributed to this report.",27
2022-05-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-embarks-asia-heavy-focus-china-north-korea/story?id=84811808,Biden embarks for Asia with a heavy focus on China and North Korea,"With much of the Biden administration's attention this year focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden turns his attention to Asia Thursday as he embarks on a visit to South Korea and Japan -- a trip that the White House says ""comes at a pivotal moment"" for his foreign policy agenda. The trip will mark the president's first trip to the region since taking office and will feature a heavy focus on North Korea and China. While the president campaigned heavily on making China a main focus of his foreign policy, the war in Ukraine has occupied Biden's foreign agenda of late. While the White House may hope that the trip shows that the president has not taken his eye off the challenge China poses, Ukraine will still loom large over the trip. ""President Biden has rallied the free world in defense of Ukraine and in opposition to Russian aggression,"" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday. ""He remains focused on ensuring that our efforts in those missions are successful, but he also intends to seize this moment, this pivotal moment, to assert bold and confident American leadership in another vital region of the world -- the Indo-Pacific."" Biden will begin his journey in Seoul and wrap the visit in Tokyo. Sullivan said this will be an ""opportunity to reaffirm and reinforce two vital security alliances"" and to ""deepen two vibrant economic partnerships."" ""The message we're trying to send on this trip is a message of an affirmative vision of what the world can look like if the democracies and open societies of the world stand together to shape the rules of the road, to define the security architecture of the region, to reinforce strong, powerful, historic alliances, and we think putting that on display over four days bilaterally with the ROK and Japan, through the Quad, through the Indo-Pacific economic framework, it will send a powerful message. We think that message will be heard everywhere."" Asked to what extent is the message of this trip is a cautionary tale delivered to China and their aggression towards Taiwan, Sullivan said the message ""will be heard in Beijing, but it is not a negative message, and it's not targeted at any one country."" While in South Korea, President Biden is expected to meet with President Yoon Seok-youl, ""engage with technology and manufacturing leaders"" who are ""mobilizing billions of dollars in investment here in the United States,"" and he will visit American and South Korean troops who are ""standing shoulder-to-shoulder in defense"" of threats posed by North Korea. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden will not be visiting the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) this trip. He visited the area as vice president in 2013 and while serving in the Senate. Sullivan, though, continued to repeat that U.S. intelligence continues to show that North Korean leader Kim Jon Un, who ramped up missile launches in 2002, could launch a long-range missile test, nuclear test, or both in the days leading into, on, or after the president's trip to the region. ""We are preparing for all contingencies, including the possibility that such a provocation would occur while we are in Korea or in Japan,"" Sullivan told reporters. He said that the U.S. is coordinating with allies in South Korea and Japan, as well as counterparts in China. ""We are prepared obviously to make both short and longer-term adjustments to our military posture as necessary to ensure that we are providing both defense and deterrence to our allies in the region and then we're responding to any North Korean provocation."" In Japan, Biden will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to discuss economic relations and global security issues, including North Korea, and they launch a new economic initiative for the region. ""The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, IPEF, as we affectionately call it, is a 21st century economic arrangement, a new model designed to tackle new economic challenges,"" Sullivan said. ""From setting the rules of the digital economy, to ensuring secure and resilient supply chains, to managing the energy transition, to investing in clean modern high standards infrastructure."" And while in Tokyo, Biden will also participate in a second in-person Quad summit with his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan. They last met in September at the White House.

2022-05-20,https://abcnews.go.com/US/russian-opposition-group-pushing-us-sanction-tier-putin/story?id=84845445,Russian opposition group pushing US to sanction 'next tier' of Putin enablers,"Top members of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's team are pressing U.S. officials to pursue sanctions against 6,000 Russians who they say are among the ""next tier"" of those enabling Russian President Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine. Members of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation met Thursday with staff from the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee, as well as officials with the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department, the group's executive director, Vladimir Ashurkov, told ABC News. Navalny has been held in a Russian jail since January of 2021, while his anti-corruption foundation is based outside of Russia. Thursday's meetings were part of a four-day trip to push the U.S. to take action against thousands of Putin supporters who Ashurkov said are outside of the super-rich, multi-billionaire class -- and who still have time to decide what they want the future of Russia to look like. ""It's a lot of officials, not necessarily at the top, but the next tier,"" Ashurkov said. ""The average age for them is 45 years old, so they still have a life after Putin,"" he said. ""And they have to think hard about where they stand on this war and on Putin's regime."" Ashurkov said the 6,000 names have already been made public, which ""creates for them motivation to step away and distance themselves from Putin's regime."" ""And that's what we want to achieve,"" Ashurkov said. Among the Justice Department officials the group met with were members of the department's Kleptocapture Task Force, which was formed in March to target the assets of Russian oligarchs. ""We're helping [the task force] with asset tracking for sanctioned individuals,"" Ashurkov told ABC News. ""We are arguably the most professional investigative outfit in Russia -- so I think they benefit from our experience and from our work."" Ashurkov also said he met with a group of Republican senators that included Lindsay Graham, Marco Rubio and Jim Risch, who Ashurkov said were ""generally receptive."" In addition, Ashurkov said his group was scheduled to meet with the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control, which handles sanctions programs. But he said there were no meetings scheduled with the White House. Saying that sanctions alone are not ""silver bullets"" powerful enough to stop the war in Ukraine, Ashurkov said they're one of the options available to Western allies to make an impact. ""They all have been really receptive to this,"" Ashurkov said of the U.S. officials he had met. ""I think, really, people support the idea,"" he said of the proposed sanctions. ""I think during this trip we at least got the important lawmakers to be aware of our proposals and to support them.""",7

The personnel were assigned to help prepare for the presidential visit when they went out for dinner and then stopped at several bars, the sources told ABC News. As the evening progressed, the two Secret Service staffers became apparently intoxicated and the agent wound up in a heated argument with a cab driver, according to the sources. Police were called and a report detailing the ""altercation"" was filed, one source said. ""The Secret Service is aware of an off-duty incident involving two employees which may constitute potential policy violations,"" agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to ABC News. ""The individuals will be immediately returned back to their post of duty and placed on administrative leave. There was no impact to the upcoming trip. We have very strict protocols and policies for all employees and we hold ourselves to the highest professional standards. Given this is an active administrative personnel matter, we are not in a position to comment further."" The agent who allegedly got into the argument with the cab driver is scheduled to be interviewed by local police before boarding a flight back to the U.S. The decision to send them home was made while the president was still en route to Asia. The latest episode in the Far East carries echoes of the 2012 scandal in which Secret Service employees were investigated for drinking heavily and hiring prostitutes while preparing for a trip by then-President Barack Obama to Cartagena, Colombia. Of the 13 agents first suspected of soliciting prostitutes in Cartagena, three were cleared of wrongdoing and returned to duty, six resigned or retired, and four had their security clearances revoked or were removed, according to a report by the Homeland Security Department inspector general issued in December 2013. According to the report, the agents in Colombia consumed as many as 13 alcoholic drinks ""before engaging in questionable behavior."" ""The Secret Service conducts thousands of advances for protectees each year, including for the president overseas,"" said retired senior Secret Service agent Don Mihalek, an ABC News contributor. ""Through it all, the president has been kept safe and few incidents have arisen. Despite that, the Secret Service is made up of people, some who make mistakes. When they do though, the response has been thorough to ensure that the integrity of the mission is always maintained.""",27
2022-05-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/access-baby-formula-act-explained-nationwide-shortage-leaves/story?id=84878456,"Plane carrying more than 75,000 pounds of imported baby formula lands in US","The first batch of imported baby formula under ""Operation Fly Formula"" arrived in the United States on Sunday as the Biden administration tries to alleviate the nationwide baby formula shortage. Military aircraft transported the shipment of three formula brands, the equivalent of up to half a million 8-ounce bottles, from Ramstein Air Base in Germany to Indiana. The shipment included Nestlé Health Science Alfamino Infant and Alfamino Junior as well as Gerber Good Start Extensive HA, all of which are hypoallergenic formulas for children with cow's milk protein allergies. The Department of Agriculture said Saturday that ""additional flights will be announced in the coming days."" ""Typically, the process to transport this product from Europe to U.S. would take two weeks. Thanks to Operation Fly Formula, we cut that down to approximately three days,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. This shipment is the first of multiple planes of imported formula expected to arrive in the U.S. in the coming weeks. Another shipment of formula will be flying into Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia on a FedEx plane this coming week, the White House announced Sunday afternoon. FedEx has secured a government contract to carry that critical cargo, bringing it from Ramstein Air Base in Germany. From there, the formula will be transported to a Nestlé facility in Pennsylvania via FedEx's integrated air and ground network. The White House said the flight and trucking ""will take place in the coming days."" ""Folks, I'm excited to tell you that the first flight from Operation Fly Formula is loaded up with more than 70,000 pounds of infant formula and about to land in Indiana. Our team is working around the clock to get safe formula to everyone who needs it,"" President Joe Biden tweeted Sunday ahead of the first plane's arrival. Biden also signed legislation aimed at improving access to baby formula for low-income families last week. The Access to Baby Formula Act of 2022 ensures families can use benefits from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children -- also known as WIC -- to buy formula products outside what is normally designated for the program during times of crisis. The program purchases about half of all the infant formula supply in the U.S., with some 1.2 million infants receiving formula through WIC. Typically, each state relies on a contract with a single manufacturer to supply products for WIC participants. But a recall from Abbott, one of the nation's largest manufacturers, highlighted flaws within the federal nutrition program. ""When we became aware of all of this we came together very quickly to do what we could,"" Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said in remarks from the floor after the legislation passed, though she said she wished it would've never gotten to this point for families. ""The reality is that half of the baby formula in this country goes to moms and babies that are on a very important program that is called the Women, Infants, and Children's program,"" Stabenow continued. ""We know that we've got to do anything humanly possible to take away any barrier available for them to get this important food for children."" Now, the United States Department of Agriculture will have authority to amend WIC program rules during a shortage, recall or other emergencies and allow families to buy whatever products are available in the store. The law also requires formula manufacturers that provide products for WIC participants to have a contingency plan for responding to shortages or recalls in the future. Biden signed the baby formula bill into law during his five-day trip to Asia, according to the White House. He also signed a $40 billion aid package to Ukraine as Russia's invasion stretches into its fourth month. The Access to Baby Formula Act of 2022 had overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in a 414-to-9 vote and the Senate via unanimous consent. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., celebrated the bipartisan moment in the chamber. ""It's rare that we have unanimity in the Senate on important measures, and I wish we had more, but this is one of these important issues and I'm glad we're acting with one voice,"" said Schumer, calling the shortage ""stuff of nightmares"" for parents. For the week ending May 15, nearly 45% of products in the U.S. were unavailable, according to the data tracking firm Datasembly, up slightly from the 43% out-of-stock rate reported the week ending May 8. The House also tried to give $28 million in emergency assistance to the Food and Drug Administration to enhance safety inspections and prevent fraudulent products from getting into stores. But the bill failed to move forward in the Senate, as Republicans on Capitol Hill remain opposed to giving the agency more funds. FDA chief Robert Califf was grilled by lawmakers this week on the agency's response to the formula shortage. He said it will the situation is ""gradually"" getting better, but that it ""will be a few weeks before we're back to normal."" ABC News' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.

2022-05-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/paul-left-whelan-family-asks-trevor-reed-freed/story?id=84912888,"'Why was Paul left behind?' Whelan family asks, after Trevor Reed freed","For many, the images of former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed sitting beside his parents for his first television interviews after 985 days in Russian detention are a heartwarming scene of reunion -- a happy ending to a harrowing ordeal. But for David Whelan, whose twin brother Paul is still in the Kremlin's custody, they evoke more complicated feelings. ""Disappointed,"" he said during an interview with ABC News. ""Obviously we are thrilled to see Trevor home. But we keep going back to the same question: Why was Paul left behind?"" Paul Whelan, 52, is also a former U.S. Marine. While visiting Moscow to attend a wedding in December 2018, he was arrested and accused of espionage -- a charge he and American officials deny. He was convicted in 2020, and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian prison camp. Reed was seized a year after Whelan, and held on what officials have also called trumped-up charges. But this April, American officials were able to orchestrate a prisoner swap, securing Reed's freedom in exchange for the release of Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian national sentenced to 20 years behind bars in 2011 for conspiring to smuggle drugs into the U.S. David Whelan says that to his knowledge, his brother was never part of these negotiations. ""Mr. Yaroshenko was a concession the Russian government had asked for the entire time Paul was there. So, if the U.S. was willing to make that concession, why wasn't Paul included in that deal?"" he asked. Reed also questioned why Whelan wasn't part of the swap that brought him back to American soil. ""I thought when I found out that it was an exchange that was happening, that they had probably exchanged Paul Whelan as well. And I expected him to be coming home with me. And he-- he didn't,"" he told ABC's Patrick Reevell. ""I thought that that was wrong, that they got me out and not Paul,"" Reed said through tears. The Whelan family has also expressed vexation over what they say is the government's slow-moving approach to Paul's case. David says a State Department official told the family they needed to ""make more noise"" to draw attention to his plight. ""It's very frustrating to hear as a family member that we aren't doing enough. We aren't the decision makers here,"" David said, his voice thick with emotion. ""It's offensive."" David and his sister Elizabeth have put their lives on hold to advocate for their bother. Families of hostages are also typically encouraged to keep a low profile for fear of increasing the prisoner's value to a foreign entity and jeopardizing negotiations. ""The family of a wrongful detainee shouldn't be bearing the burden of persuading American government officials to act to secure the release of an American citizen wrongfully detained,"" David said in a statement last week. ABC News asked State Department spokesperson Ned Price about the guidance given to the Whelan family. ""We remain in regular contact with the families of those held hostage or wrongfully detained. We are absolutely grateful for their partnership and feedback and we continue to work to ensure that we're communicating and sharing information in a way that is useful to families,"" Price responded. ""We know that each of these cases deserve action, and we are taking action in each and every one of these cases,"" he added. But David Whelan says that so far, they haven't seen evidence of that. ""As Paul's twin brother, I would be willing for the U.S. to do anything to bring Paul home,"" he said. ""Every day that we spend without Paul is a day my parents won't have with him. And they don't have many days left."" David says he understands the administration must weigh other factors in lining up a trade. Russia has suggested exchanging Victor Bout, a Soviet Union-born arms trafficker behind bars in Illinois for Whelan and WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was detained by Russia in February for allegedly possessing vape cartridges in her luggage that contained hashish oil. Reed says it's a deal the U.S. should make. ""I don't care if it's 100 Victor Bouts. They have to get our guys out,"" Reed said.",2
2022-05-23,https://abcnews.go.com/US/fought-trevor-reed-speaks-survived-years-russian-prison/story?id=84806555,'I fought': Trevor Reed speaks out on how he survived nearly 3 years in a Russian prison,"When the war in Ukraine broke out in February, Trevor Reed said he believed it meant he likely would never come home. The American former Marine by that time had been imprisoned in Russia for nearly three years, held hostage after being convicted on trumped up charges. For 985 days, Reed was held in a series of Russian prisons, thrown in isolation cells as small as a closet for 23 hours a day, placed in a psychiatric ward and sent to a forced labor camp he described as looking and feeling like something ""out of medieval times.” But within two months, Reed was home in the United States, freed on April 27 as part of a prisoner swap agreed between the Biden administration and the Kremlin. Reed was freed in exchange for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot from Russia who was sentenced in 2011 to 20 years in prison for conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States. Now back in America and with his family for the first time, Reed is trying to adjust to normal life. ""I've been hanging out with the family a lot, been trying to get used to being free again,"" the former U.S. Marine told ABC News in one of his first interviews since being released. ""That takes a little bit of time, that process. But I feel better every day.” For more of the ABC News interview with Trevor Reed, watch “GMA” on Monday, May 23, at 7 a.m. ET. And for the full interview, tune into ABC News Live at 8:30 p.m. ET. He said that when he was arrested in Moscow in the summer of 2019, he was a healthy 175-pound student majoring in international security studies. When he was released, he said his weight had dropped to 131 pounds, he was ill, coughing up blood and feared he had contracted tuberculosis. ""He looked terrible. He looked really thin and he had dark circles under his eyes, and he just didn't look like the Trevor that left for Russia,"" Reed's mother, Paula Reed, told ABC News. ""So, that was hard to see him looking that way."" The 30-year-old Texas native's ordeal started in 2019 when he was visiting his Russian girlfriend, a recent law graduate, in Moscow. Reed, who had been studying Russian, was coming to the end of his time in the country and attended a party with his girlfriend’s friends, where plied with vodka shots he became drunk. On the drive home, Reed became unmanageable, according to his girlfriend, Alina Tsybulnik, and jumped out of the car. Unable to get him back in and fearing for his safety, Tsybulnik and her friends said they called the police to ask them to take Reed to a drunk tank to sober up. Two police officers agreed and after taking Reed to the station told his girlfriend to come pick him up in the morning. Reed, who says the last thing he remembers was being in the park, said when he woke up in the lobby of the police station the next morning initially he was free to leave. But as he waited for his girlfriend to arrive to pick him up, a shift change occurred and the police brass on the next shift decided to hold him. Then, he said, agents from Russia’s powerful domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service or FSB, arrived and interrogated him. ""I pretty much knew as soon as I saw FSB agents where this case was headed,” said Reed. ""The main thing that they wanted to know was about my military service,"" Reed added. ""They didn't ask me at all, not one question about if I had committed a crime, if I had done something wrong. They did not ask me anything related to that at all. They wanted to know about my military service primarily."" After the agents' arrival, the police abruptly accused Reed of assaulting the police officers who had taken him the night before, charging him with endangering their lives. He was arrested on the spot. Reed was put on trial, in what he described as a ""kangaroo court” and which the U.S. embassy denounced as absurd. At a hearing attended by ABC News, the two police officers Reed was alleged to have assaulted struggled to remember the incident and repeatedly contradicted themselves, at one point becoming so confused that the judge laughed at them. Reed told ABC News that during an interrogation with the two officers, they admitted to him they had been ordered to make the false allegations against him. ""I asked, you know, one of those officers, I said, 'Why are you guys doing this? Why did you write this, like, false, you know, accusation against me?' And he looked around at the door to make sure that there was no one there, and he looked at the other police officer, and he said, ""We didn't want to write this. They told us to write this.'"" Reed said. Despite believing the trial was predetermined, Reed battled to prove his innocence, repeatedly appealing rulings. He accused Russian authorities of trying to pressure him into dropping his resistance, including, at one point, sending him to a psychiatric treatment facility to ""scare me."" ""That was pretty terrible. You know, blood on the walls. There's a hole in the floor for the toilet,"" said Reed, adding that human feces were all over the floor of a cramped cell he shared with four other prisoners, who suffered from serious psychological conditions. ""I thought maybe they had sent me there to chemically disable me, to give me sedatives or whatever and make me unable to fight,"" Reed said. After over a year in a pre-trial detention center that he described as “extremely dirty” and infested with rats, in mid-2020 Reed was convicted and sentenced to nine years in a prison camp. He was transported to a prison in Mordovia, around 300 miles of Moscow, a former Gulag camp built just after World War II. But there, Reed said he refused to work or kowtow to prison rules. ""Ethically, I thought that would be wrong to work for a government who was kidnapping Americans and using them as political hostages,"" Reed said. ""I couldn't justify that with myself."" As punishment, he said he was placed in solitary confinement for 15-day stretches at a time, sleeping in the cold cell at night on the floor, trying to stay warm by huddling next to a hot-water pipe. ""I mean, it was difficult, but I wasn't going to let that change my actions,"" Reed said. Reed said that even as the guards in the camp ""hated him"" for not complying with their orders to work, his resistance attracted the admiration of fellow prisoners. ""I was consistently fighting and resisting the government there,"" he said. ""The prisoners inside of the Russian prison, the criminal element there, they respected that."" He said he survived by maintaining his battle for justice while at the same time refusing to allow himself to hope he would ever go home. Watch the ABC News Live special “985 Days: The Trevor Reed Interview” on Monday, May 23, at 8:30 pm ET/9:30 pm PT Meanwhile, Reed's parents continued to battle for his freedom. His father, Joey Reed, flew to Russia, spending over a year alone there to be at his son's court hearings and lobby U.S. diplomats in Moscow. Stateside, he and his wife and daughter mounted an intensive campaign of government leaders on both sides of the political aisle to take up his cause. Joey and Paula Reed took their fight all the way to the White House, eventually obtaining a meeting with President Biden which they credit as being decisive in persuading his administration to finally make the trade. ""My parents and my girlfriend, Alina, did everything,"" Trevor Reed said. ""They gave up their whole lives to help me."" Reed said on the day he was traded, he was loaded onto a plane by 20 FSB agents but told nothing of the destination. But as the plane headed south and he saw he was flying over water, Reed said he realized it must be the Black Sea and he must be headed for Turkey. The aging Russian government plane was so dilapidated though, Reed said, that he feared they might crash before they made it to any swap. On the tarmac in Turkey, he walked past Yaroshenko, he said. ""I remember looking at him and he looked over at me. I think both of us probably had that same feeling, that same thought of like, 'that's what that guy looks like,'"" Reed said. Treated by doctors on the plane back, Reed said he struggled to shake a new found anxiety around flying. ""Mostly I was hoping that the plane did not crash at that moment before I saw my family,"" he said. Reed said that when he initially landed in the United States, his parents were there to meet him, but he said he couldn't hug or touch them until he underwent a full medical examination to ensure he did not have tuberculosis or any other communicable diseases. Since being medically cleared, he said he has tried to adjust to normal life, even having to remember some English, after speaking Russian for the past three years. But Reed said he cannot stop thinking about the other former Marine held hostage in Russia, Paul Whelan, who was left behind. Whelan, who was seized in 2018 while attending a wedding in Moscow, is held on espionage charges that the U.S. government says were also fabricated to take him as a bargaining chip. Whelan is in a prison camp also in Mordovia, sentenced to 16 years. Russia had previously floated trading Whelan for Yaroshenko and other Russians held in the United States and at one time it had been thought Reed and Whelan might be traded as a pair. ""I had a really strong feeling of guilt that I was free and that Paul Whelan was still in prison. I thought when I found out that it was an exchange that was happening, that they had probably exchanged Paul Whelan, as well. And I expected him to be coming home with me. And he-- he didn’t,"" Reed said. ""I thought that that was wrong, that they got me out and not Paul,” Reed said, choking up. ""I knew that as soon as I was able to, that I would fight for him to get out and that I would do everything I could to get him outta there."" Reed said he also feared for the WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was seized on drugs smuggling charges in February after Russian authorities alleged they had found vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. The State Department has designated Griner as wrongfully detained. Russia has also floated the idea of trading the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout for Whelan and Griner. Bout, nicknamed the ""Merchant of Death"" is serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States, convicted on narco-terrorism charges. Reed said the United States should trade Bout without hesitation to free Whelan and Griner. ""I think that they need to do that. If that's for Viktor Bout, I don't care. I don't care if it's 100 Victor Bouts. They have to get our guys out,” Reed said. “You're getting two Americans who are going to have, you know, a huge amount of time left on their sentences for a guy who is getting out soon-- who has already been in prison for 15 years,” he said. He said if the freedom of the other American hostages means more prisoner exchanges, then the U.S. government shouldn't balk at taking that path again. When told that some have countered that prisoner exchanges only encourage countries to take more hostages, Reed scoffed at that notion. ""I would like to say that that's completely inaccurate,"" Reed said. ""That's not a concern at all because countries like Russia, China, Venezuela, Rwanda, Iran, Syria and places like that need absolutely no incentive to kidnap Americans.""",2
2022-05-23,https://abcnews.go.com/US/trevor-reed-us-trade-viktor-bout-free-americans/story?id=84900081,Trevor Reed says US should trade Viktor Bout if it will free Americans held in Russia,"Trevor Reed, the former U.S. Marine recently released after nearly three years in Russian captivity, has called on the U.S. government to negotiate a prisoner swap like the one that freed him to bring home Americans Paul Whelan, a former Marine, and WNBA player Brittney Griner, who are both being detained in Russia. Reed and his parents, Joey and Paula Reed, told ABC News if it meant freeing Whelan and Griner, the United States should trade the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence, and who Russia has floated as a possible candidate for a swap. ""I think that the United States should make any type of agreement to get Paul out. And if that includes an exchange, I think they should absolutely do that,"" the 30-year-old Reed said in a lengthy interview with ABC News on Saturday, one of the first he has given since being freed. Bout, dubbed the ""Merchant of Death” by the media and a notorious weapons trafficker, was pursued for over a decade by Western governments and is widely believed to have ties to Russian intelligence. He was finally captured during a sting operation led by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Thailand and extradited to the U.S. He was convicted in 2012 on federal narco-terrorism charges for agreeing during the sting to sell millions of dollars in weapons to Colombian terrorists who were purportedly targeting Americans. In reality, the supposed Colombian arms buyers were part of the DEA undercover sting. From the moment of his arrest, Russia has sought to return Bout, attempted to block his extradition in 2008 and Russian state media and officials for years have pressed for his release. Since Whelan was seized in 2018, Bout has repeatedly been suggested by Russian state media as a possible trade for him and Reed and last week for Griner. ""Viktor Bout has already been in prison for 15 years,” said Reed, adding that any value he had for Russian intelligence was long since blown. ""He's no longer a threat. He's paid for that crime. Maybe not as long as, you know, the U.S. government would have liked him to, but he has paid for that."" Reed said the United States should try to get the two Americans, who are both facing long sentences in Russia, freed in exchange for a man who will likely be released from prison in a few years. ""Fifteen years is not a joke in prison. And, you know, the fact of the matter is that Paul has another 13 years left in prison. And Brittney, who knows how long she's gonna be sentenced for? She may have ten years in prison. So you're getting two Americans who are going to have a huge amount of time left on their sentences for a guy who is getting out soon -- who has already been in prison for 15 years,” he said. “And I think that they need to do that,"" he said. ""If that's for Viktor Bout, I don't care. I don't care if it's 100 Victor Bouts. They have to get our guys out."" Whelan was arrested in December 2018 while visiting Moscow for a friend's wedding and charged with espionage by Russian intelligence officials. He is being held on espionage charges that the U.S. government says were also fabricated to take him as a bargaining chip. Whelan is in a prison camp in Mordovia, sentenced to 16 years. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, was visiting Russia to play basketball in the off-season and was arrested in February at a Moscow area airport for allegedly having vape cartridges in her luggage that contained hashish oil -- an illegal substance in Russia. The U.S. government considers Griner to be “wrongfully detained” in Russia, the State Department said. “With this determination, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens will lead the interagency team for securing Brittney Griner’s release,"" a U.S. State Department spokesperson told ABC News this month. Reed was released from a Russian prison on April 27 when the Biden administration orchestrated a prisoner exchange with the Russian government for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot from Russia who was sentenced in 2011 to 20 years in prison for conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States. American administrations are traditionally reluctant to make prisoner exchanges, fearing that it sets a precedent that encourages hostile governments to seize more Americans. Reed rejected that position, saying such governments would continue to target Americans regardless and were already doing so. “That's completely inaccurate. That's not a concern at all, because, you know, countries like, you know, Russia, China, Venezuela, Rwanda, Iran, Syria, places like that need absolutely no incentive to kidnap Americans,” he said. ""Even if they didn't get anything out of it, just for the simple fact that they could show the United States that we have your citizens here and that we're not scared of you,” he said. Reed’s father, Joey Reed, who spent more than a year in Russia trying to free his son and picketed the White House, said he believed the government needed to move with more urgency. “Don't get me wrong; we're super thankful that President Biden made the decision to trade for Trevor. And what we want is we want that to continue,"" Joey Reed said. ""If there's no other way to bring an American citizen home, do it. Don't wait until they've been there 20 years. Don't wait until they're near death."" In an interview with ABC News earlier this month, Paul Whelan's brother, David, said Paul spoke with his parents after Reed's release and said the news hit him hard. ""He asked, 'Why was I left behind?'"" David Whelan said. ""And we still don't really have a good answer for that."" Trevor Reed told ABC News that he's speaking out ""in order to make the American people aware that this is not an isolated situation."" ""We have political prisoners all over the world who are suffering and who need our help,"" Reed said. Speaking of Whelan, Reed became emotional. ""He was in some worse prisons than I was. His situation is a lot worse than mine and we need to do everything possible to get him out at any cost,"" Reed said. Reed said that when he found out his release was part of a prisoner exchange, he assumed Whelan would be freed, too. But Whelan was left behind. ""I thought that that was wrong, that they got me out and not Paul,"" Reed said. ""I knew that as soon as I was able to that I would fight for him to get out and I would do everything I could to get him out of there. The United States got me out, but they left him there. I can't describe to you how painful that feeling is.""",2
2022-05-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ballot-primaries-speak-future-parties-note/story?id=84913758,Down-ballot primaries speak to future of both parties: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The race to be governor of Georgia is Tuesday's main event, featuring boldface names and familiar stakes in a critical state that will be closely watched this midterm year and well beyond. But with former President Donald Trump's pick in that race headed toward what's likely to be a lopsided defeat, a group of lower-profile primaries up and down the ballot could offer more intriguing hints about the state of affairs inside both parties. The more impactful contest in Georgia might be for secretary of state, where incumbent Brad Raffensperger drew a primary challenger endorsed by Trump, Rep. Jody Hice, after standing behind President Joe Biden's victory. That race could determine who oversees voting and vote counting in the state in 2024. Trump's impact cuts at odd angles in races including Alabama's Senate contest, where he dumped Rep. Mo Brooks but Brooks has stood by Trump. Brooks, improbably, remains in the mix for the Republican nomination. The Trump angles might be even odder in Texas, where embattled Attorney General Ken Paxton is expected to prevail in a runoff for his current job against Land Commissioner George P. Bush. Bush is the only prominent member of his family to embrace Trump, but the former president still backed Paxton after Paxton led national legal efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Also in Texas, the only current House Democrat to oppose abortion, Rep. Henry Cuellar, has a progressive primary challenger, Jessica Cisneros, in the latest round of what's become an episodic series of establishment-backed Democrats facing off with outsiders. In Georgia, two Democratic stars of previous election cycles -- Rep. Lucy McBath and Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux -- are running against each other because of redistricting. And a long-shot bid to oust Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in a GOP primary comes just a week after the similarly polarizing Rep. Madison Cawthorn's reelection effort ended in defeat in North Carolina. Big voting nights are tempting targets for sweeping takeaways, particularly in the era of Trump. But individual races are again likely to reflect more complicated and more local political dynamics. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Georgia's incumbent secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, is hoping to stave off a primary challenge from Trump-backed Rep. Jody Hice. Raffensperger's resistance to pressure from then-President Trump notorious call to ""find"" votes to swing the election in Trump's favor earned him a spot on Trump's political hit list. Now, Raffensperger is hinging his candidacy on the notion of keeping non-citizens from voting. Hice objected to the counting of Georgia's electoral votes and he has continued to say, even a year and a half after the 2020 election, that he would try and decertify the results. The possibility of having a person who espouses false claims about the 2020 election at the helm of elections has alarmed Democrats in the state, especially with 2024 presidential election approaching. While Democrats have five candidates on the secretary of state ballot, Bee Nguyen, a state lawmaker who holds the same seat previously held by Stacey Abrams, is considered a favorite to win. Nguyen rose to prominence through her work to debunk GOP claims of voter fraud after 2020. She also organized Georgians against the state's controversial election legislation. If she prevails in the primary and the general election, Nguyen, who is the child of Vietnamese immigrants, could be the first Asian-American to hold statewide office in Georgia. The TIP with Brittany Shepherd Former President Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence's conscious uncoupling may finally be complete. Their political divorce is playing out on a national stage -- in part through their dueling endorsement in Georgia's Republican gubernatorial primary. Pence is backing Gov. Brian Kemp, a frequent target of Trump's ire. On the eve of Tuesday's primary, Pence and Kemp campaigned together in Kennesaw, Georgia, where Pence bragged he was ""for Brian Kemp before it was cool."" There, Pence boasted that Kemp was the only candidate able to face presumptive Democratic nominee Stacey Abrams and win (albeit narrowly, in 2018). One name noticeably absent from Pence's rallying cry was his former boss. Over the past year Pence has not-so-subtly laid the groundwork for a presidential run of his own. In fact, in a New York Times article published Monday morning, Pence said he would ""go where we're called"" when asked if he'd rule out vying for the White House in 2024. In the opposite corner, Trump has endorsed David Perdue, a former senator who backs Trump's debunked claims of a stolen and fraudulent election. Earlier Monday afternoon, Perdue suggested that he might not accept the results of his primary depending ""on if there's fraud or not."" He also said polls showing him trailing Kemp were ""full of crap."" In a virtual rally Monday night, Trump said his candidate was the ""only candidate who can beat Stacey Abrams because I don't believe Kemp can do it."" The Democratic National Committee painted Pence as an opportunist for flying into Georgia to support Kemp, the clear front-runner, as ""nothing more than another example of Pence being a coward who only does what is politically convenient."" And for once, Trump and the DNC may agree. In that same Times article, a Trump spokesperson said Pence was ""desperate to chase his lost relevance."" NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 10. That's the number of big primaries to watch in Georgia on Tuesday night. And as FiveThirtyEight's Geoffrey Skelley writes, Georgia might be Trump's biggest test yet. He's endorsed seven non-incumbent Republican candidates in races for Senate, the House, governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state and attorney general; and in many of those races, starting with Georgia's governor race, Trump's preferred candidate might not win. There's definitely more action on the GOP side in Georgia, but we'll also be keeping a close eye on the 7th Congressional District, as it's the second incumbent-vs-incumbent matchup of the season. Be sure to join us on the FiveThirtyEight liveblog as we cover Georgia's primaries, as well as Alabama's, Arkansas's, Minnesota's and Texas, starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.

2022-05-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-claims-change-policy-taiwan-gaffe-accident-analysis/story?id=84937418,"Biden claims no change in policy, but his Taiwan 'gaffe' may be no accident: ANALYSIS","President Joe Biden tried to clean up his own comments about the U.S. defending Taiwan ""militarily"" if China were to invade the island, telling reporters Tuesday during his last day in Asia that U.S. ""policy has not changed at all."" But after saying for a third time now that the U.S. was committed to coming to Taiwan's defense, it seems clearer the president is leaning into a more assertive U.S. stance that differs with decades of U.S. policy -- and not just misspeaking. To critics, the comments are making an already tense situation more unpredictable and worse, but to proponents, including Republican lawmakers who have otherwise criticized Biden's foreign policy, it's a stronger U.S. policy that's necessary to send a message to Beijing. Beijing often criticizes the U.S. for what it sees as interference in its domestic affairs, but the issue of Taiwan is of particular importance. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province, with strongman leader Xi Jinping openly committed to reunifying the island with mainland China -- over seven decades after its independent government was created. Since the Nixon administration's 1979 agreement with China, the U.S. has abided by the ""One China"" policy, recognizing Beijing as the sole legal government of China and acknowledging its position that Taiwan is part of China. But the U.S. has also maintained unofficial ties with Taiwan, starting with the 1979 law the Taiwan Relations Act and growing stronger in recent years because of Taiwan's vibrant democracy and powerful economy. As part of that ""One China"" policy, the U.S. is opposed to ""unilateral"" changes in Chinese-Taiwanese relations, like a Chinese invasion. But while the U.S. is committed to Taiwan's defense, it has for decades been ambiguous about whether it would intervene to preserve the status quo if China invaded -- a policy known as ""strategic ambiguity."" But Biden, who voted for the Taiwan Relations Act as a young senator, has three times now gone further than a commitment to Taiwan's defense. Asked whether he was ""willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan"" on Monday, Biden said simply, ""Yes."" The president didn't spell out what ""militarily"" meant -- from providing weapons and other military aid like the U.S. has with Ukraine, to deploying U.S. forces directly into combat. But he said while the U.S. abides by the ""One China"" policy, the idea that Taiwan can ""just [be] taken by force is just not a - is just not appropriate."" White House officials immediately cleaned up his comments, telling reporters U.S. policy had not changed. On Tuesday in Tokyo, the second stop of his first trip to Asia, Biden himself did, too -- saying the policy of strategic ambiguity was not dead. ""The policy has not changed at all, and I stated that when I made my statement,"" Biden said. It's not the first time Biden has been here, though. In an August interview with ABC News, Biden said the U.S. was committed to coming to Taiwan's defense if attacked, just as with NATO allies or South Korea and Japan. But Taiwan is not a treaty ally like the others, with no guarantee of U.S. aid. Two months later, Biden similarly told a CNN town hall that the U.S. had a ""commitment"" to come to Taiwan's defense if China invaded. After each time, the White House has made the same comment -- saying U.S. policy has not changed. But if a ""gaffe"" is a mistake, then making the same ""mistake"" three times doesn't seem like one at all. That's perhaps especially true because Biden has a deep history on the issue and clearly knows the difference made by even slight tweaks to the language here. In 2001, President George W. Bush told ABC News in an interview that the U.S. had an obligation to defend Taiwan. Asked if his commitment was backed by the ""full force"" of the U.S. military, Bush said, ""Whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself."" The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee pushed back hard -- then-senator Joe Biden, condemning Biden's ""startling new commitment"" and arguing the U.S. should ""not cede to Taiwan, much less to China, the ability automatically to draw us into a war across the Taiwan Strait."" ""We now appear to have a policy of ambiguous strategic ambiguity. It is not an improvement,"" he added. But that's exactly where the U.S. sits now, and to some analysts, they agree with the former senator's view. ""The confusion and misstatements are more likely to undermine deterrence than strengthen it,"" tweeted Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank. But others argue that Biden's more assertive stance of a U.S. commitment to defend Taiwan is stronger and more likely to give Xi pause, especially after the U.S. rallied with NATO allies, the European Union, and Indo-Pacific allies like Japan, South Korea, and Australia to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and supply Kyiv with weapons and financial aid. ""President Biden's statement that if push came to shove the U.S. would defend Taiwan against communist China was the right thing to say and the right thing to do,"" tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC. In Beijing, of course, it is the wrong thing to say -- with the Foreign Ministry escalating its criticism on Tuesday even as Biden tried to walk his comments back. ""I would like to remind the U.S. that no force in the world, including the U.S., can stop the Chinese people from achieving complete national reunification. There is no force in the world, including the United States, that can save the 'Taiwan independence' forces from defeat,"" said spokesperson Wang Wenbin ABC News's Karson Yiu, Molly Nagle, and Ben Gittleson contributed to this report from Tokyo.",6
2022-05-27,https://abcnews.go.com/International/lost-husband-unborn-son-bucha-now-shes-rebuilding/story?id=84917320,She lost her husband and unborn son in Bucha. Now she's rebuilding her life: Reporter's notebook,"KYIV -- Anna Polonska had struggled to get pregnant. So when she did, it was a moment of sheer joy; a happy family life lay ahead. But days after Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine, her husband and unborn son were killed in shelling as the family tried to flee their home country, she told ABC News. She was also gravely injured in the attack, and doctors did not think she would survive. Adding to her loss, soldiers stole almost all of her possessions and destroyed her apartment, she recalled. But in a remarkable interview, Anna said she is now focusing on picking up the pieces -- showing incredible courage and determination to live and walk again. This is her story: Anna, 32, said her nightmare began when Russian soldiers entered her town, which has since been decimated by war, in late February. Up until that moment she and her husband Anton, 37, lived a comfortable life in the up-and-coming district on the edge of Kyiv. They had a modern apartment on two floors. “Amazing” Anton owned his own construction business. Being fluent in German and English -- in addition to Russian and Ukrainian -- Anna was a language teacher. They got married 12 years ago after getting to know each other at the local gym. Their neighborhood was leafy and full of young families. For Anna, Bucha was “one of the most beautiful towns in Ukraine.” It felt like the ideal place to have a family of their own, she said. Anna had struggled to get pregnant, but eventually that magical moment arrived and a happy future lay ahead. But in late February war crushed their stable, comfortable life. Bucha had very quickly become a living nightmare and, for Anna, it had become “impossible to stay,"" she recalled. Escape So on March 4, she and her husband tried to escape. They took their Yorkshire terrier, Mia, and packed their most precious possessions into the car. Russian troops were already in control of the town. Horror and fear was all around. Human body parts were lying on the road as they drove away from their apartment, she recalled. With the boom of shelling in the background she said they drove for what felt like four or five minutes when their car was hit. Anton was killed immediately. “I only have this image of his head on the steering wheel, covered in blood,"" Anna remembered. She also recalled feeling a strange burning sensation in her back: sharp shards of metal had pierced her body in several places. Anna was 20 weeks pregnant at the time. 'No one thought I would live' Anna’s wounds were so serious that the doctors didn’t think she would survive. “No one thought I would live,"" Anna told ABC News. “The doctors were very surprised.” But to live, she had to undergo major surgery. Doctors were able to save her, but not her unborn baby. “My son didn’t die immediately,"" she said. Four days after her husband was killed, Anna’s unborn son died too. “Our boy didn’t die on the 4th of March, he was with me until the 8th of March,"" she recounted. “It was hard for me to get pregnant, so it was awful to lose my son.” Anna's Russian roots Anna is just one of the thousands of civilians killed and injured in Ukraine. The barbaric tactics of Putin's soldiers, who have occupied parts of Ukraine, are already well-documented and the evidence keeps mounting. According to Ukrainian police, investigations into more than 10,800 potential war crimes are underway across the country. But Anna’s family background, which is by no means unique in Ukraine, is worth a mention. It demonstrates the senselessness of Putin’s war. Because, like so many people in Ukraine, Anna has Russian blood. Her dad grew up in the Bryansk region of Russia which borders Ukraine. Her 86-year-old grandmother still lives in Russia today. As if the pain of losing her husband and her unborn child were not enough, Anna has been forced into another painful decision. Following Russia’s violent invasion and the atrocities carried out by its troops, Anna has decided that she will never again visit Russia. The annual summer visits to Russia to spend time with her grandma are done, she said. Anna said she is “devastated” that she will never see her grandma again. Nor will her father. So Anna’s grandma, a citizen of Russia, is also a victim of Putin’s invasion as she will be left “all on her own,"" she said. The tragic impact of Putin’s war on this family makes a mockery of Kremlin propaganda. The family’s close links to Russia and the fact that it is natural for them to speak both Ukrainian and Russian shows how twisted and bizarre the Kremlin’s claims are that Russian speakers are persecuted in Ukraine. 'Almost everything is gone' There is now extensive evidence that in the days after Anna and Anton tried to escape Bucha, Russian soldiers executed many civilians in the town. The bodies of many men were found with their hands tied, after having been shot in the back or in the head. According to Ukrainian police, around 1,200 civilians have been killed by the Russian army in the Kyiv region alone. In fact, at some point after Anna and Anton left, Russian troops occupied their apartment, Anna said. Her neighbors told her the soldiers stayed there for five days. When the soldiers left they stole almost everything, according to the neighbors. They took the couple’s coffee machine, their television, their computers and other valuable items. She said they also stole clothes, including underwear, make-up and even bottles of shampoo. Anna has not been able to visit her apartment yet because she can barely walk but a friend went on her behalf and sent a video showing extensive damage to the roof. “Almost everything is gone,” she said. Learning to walk again After almost three months in four different hospitals with countless doctors and nurses, Anna is learning to walk again. As a gym fanatic, it was not easy for her to be stuck in bed for weeks on end. So Anna set herself challenges every day, like learning poems by heart. ABC News met Anna at a hospital in Kyiv where she is now undergoing intensive physical therapy. Every step, with a walking aid, looks painful. But the fact that Anna can walk slowly along a treadmill is a mark of the progress she has made. She is brave and determined and is already giving English and German lessons again from her hospital bed. When we tell Anna her strength is inspiring she smiles and shrugs it off. “People keep saying it, but I don’t know why,” she said. (For the record, during her physical rehabilitation session we attended in the hospital gym, Anna was better at shooting basketball hoops than your ABC News correspondent.) The future? Like many Ukrainians right now, Anna is living day to day. She sets herself targets and goals and said she achieves them each time. Understandably, she can’t imagine ever going back to live in Bucha. Russia’s invasion shattered her near-term prospects of a happy family life. For now she wants the world to know about what happened to her; the grim and senseless way that her husband and unborn son were killed. She wants Russia to be held accountable for the countless crimes it is accused of committing in Ukraine. “My story is not unique”, she said. “I don’t know why Russia invaded, and what for.” “Time will pass, and they will regret it,"" she added. ""We will remain in a free and independent country with our borders.” With good reason, Anna believes Putin wants to destroy her country, but she epitomizes a brave and fearless spirit which is pervasive in Ukraine today.",22
2022-05-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-gop-leaders-hand-nra-relevance-amid-gun/story?id=85000030,"Trump, GOP leaders hand NRA new relevance amid gun debate: The Note","The TAKE with Rick Klein The National Rifle Association is not the force it once was -- not with its financial woes and legal troubles, along with infighting and jostling for influence that have come with the changing political landscape. Yet for at least one day, the NRA will be at the center of a raw debate -- and Friday promises to be quite the day ahead of an emotional if not combustible Memorial Day weekend. Former President Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz are among the boldfaced GOP names whose presence at the NRA gathering in Houston will confer fresh relevance on the gun lobby. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to give a virtual address. Geographically, they will be close -- at least by Texas standards -- to the grieving families of Uvalde, who will get a visit from President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden on Sunday. They might be too close emotionally for a large swath of Americans, including those represented by the range of advocacy groups planning to protest in favor of stronger gun laws near where the NRA is holding its first major in-person gathering since the pandemic. The big question in Washington is whether the NRA point of view and the assumed views of its members matter to the bipartisan group of senators engaged in the umpteenth round of talks on the topic of guns. Those views could also resonate with leaders in both parties who have given those senators limited leeway in pursuing a compromise package. The NRA has been tested before, with mixed recent results. The Manchin-Toomey bill has been effectively blocked for nearly a decade, first through the Obama years and then even after Trump himself oddly chided Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., for not going far enough because he was ""afraid of the NRA"" -- only to revert to his old, pro-gun position. The more instructive recent example may be when the NRA failed to stop then-Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., from signing laws raising the minimum age for long-gun purchases to 21 and creating a red-flag judicial process after the Parkland shooting in 2018. (Scott, now the chairman of the National Senatorial Campaign Committee, is so far steering clear of bipartisan talks on gun control, despite his endorsement of a national red-flag law.) This week that tested Trump's political sway, to decidedly mixed results, now closes with one of the most closely watched speeches of his post-presidency. If Republicans want to prove that other voices matter in messaging, even this close to the midterms, they'll have their chance. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Republicans have blocked a domestic terrorism bill that could have allowed for debate on gun violence in the wake of deadly mass shootings in Uvalde and Buffalo. The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2022 passed the House in the aftermath of the horrific Buffalo grocery shooting, in which all victims killed were Black. Investigators have called the attack a hate crime. Not a single Senate Republican voted in favor of the bill that aimed to make it easier for federal agencies to communicate in order to track domestic terrorism threats and take action to prevent violence. Some GOP senators said the proposed legislation was duplicative of other laws pertaining to terror, and some took issue with parts of the legislation that focus on tracking white nationalist activity, despite federal agencies like the FBI noting the growing threat. It highlights the challenge Democrats face in their efforts to address gun violence in a 50-50 Senate. Republicans have remained ardently opposed to gun-related measures. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer signaled openness to negotiation on the issue but tempered expectations, referring to ""MAGA Republicans for whom no amount of gun violence, whether it's domestic terrorism, a school shooting, a neighborhood shooting, or something else, will ever, ever convince them to take any action."" A bipartisan group of senators did meet Thursday to determine if there is a path forward. ""I'm not interested in making a political statement. I'm not interested in the same old tired talking points,"" said Sen. John Cronyn, R-Texas. ""I'm actually interested in what we can do to make the terrible events that occurred in Uvalde less likely in the future."" Even with the urgency of an elementary school massacre, successful negotiations are anything but guaranteed. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Democrats head into the holiday weekend with two congressional races yet to be determined in Oregon and Texas as intraparty divisions take center stage in both states. In Oregon, Rep. Kurt Schrader may have received one of just two presidential endorsements issued so far this year, but Biden's backing did not help him cinch a decided victory in the state's 5th Congressional District. The incumbent is currently trailing progressive challenger Jamie McLeod-Skinner while election officials wade through an ongoing process to verify damaged ballots. The election will be certified on June 13. The battle for Texas' 28th Congressional District was poised to illustrate a response to national fallout over the Supreme Court's leaked opinion on Roe v. Wade, as incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar -- the last anti-abortion Democrat in the House -- faced off with progressive immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros for a second time. As of Friday, Cuellar led Cisneros by fewer than 200 votes, and the margin separating the two candidates allows the losing candidate to request a recount no later than two days after all votes are tallied. The final vote count won't be available until next week after Tuesday's deadline for military and overseas ballots passes. Counties will then have until Thursday to tally their results and report them to the State Department. The campaign requesting a recount would also be required to put in deposits for the process to take place, and the cost is based in part on the number of Election Day polling places or precincts. Although she currently trails Cuellar in the vote count, Cisneros has been fundraising for a ""recount fund"" but has not yet filed a petition to start the process. In a recent fundraising email following Tuesday's runoff, Cisneros blasted ""Cuellar's corporate backers"" whom she alleged would ""spend as much money as they can on legal challenges, trying to muddy the waters and get as many of our votes thrown out as they can."" So far, Cuellar's campaign has not filed any legal challenges, but the race continues to expose fractures within the party. In an email with the subject line, ""What the Democratic Party did in TX-28 is infuriating,"" Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs Cisneros, blasted Democratic leadership for supporting Cuellar in the race. ""As we witness the end of Roe v. Wade and one horrific mass shooting after another, it's astonishing to see the Democratic Party dump resources into TX-28 to back an anti-abortion, NRA ""A-rated"" Democrat,"" the email said. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 58.

2022-05-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-describes-delicate-balance-isolating-enabling-china/story?id=84992791,Blinken describes delicate balance between isolating and enabling China,"In the eyes of the Biden administration, China is a daunting rival and an ever-present risk to global security. But it's also a necessary partner for tackling some of the world's most pressing issues. During an address laying out the president's policy towards China, Secretary of State Antony Blinken described a delicate balance between isolating and enabling the country, calling it the ""most serious, long-term challenge"" to the global balance. ""China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and increasingly, the economic diplomatic military and technological power to do it,"" he said. ""Beijing's vision would move us away from the universal values that have sustained so much of the world's progress over the past 75 years."" Delivered at George Washington University, his speech acknowledges that China was also a vital collaborator in the fight against climate change, pandemics and economic turmoil. Blinken boiled the quagmire down into a single phrase. ""Put simply, the United States and China have to deal with each other for the foreseeable future,"" he said. ""That's why this is one of the most complex and consequential relationships of any that we have in the world today."" The secretary said that while the administration was already employing strategies to curb China's influence, it would not try to limit its growth or create new Cold War. But while Blinken maintained that peace was its core goal, he vowed the U.S. would not compromise it own goals. ""Competition need not lead to conflict. We do not seek it. We will work to avoid it. But we will defend our interests against any threat,"" he said. The cost of China's rise Blinken acknowledged that China had undergone meteoric growth in the past half-century, but said its own people and other countries caught in its crosshairs had paid the price. ""Under President Xi, the ruling Chinese Communist Party has become more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad,"" he said, citing mass surveillance, power grabs in the South China Sea, widespread human rights violations, the subversion of trade rules and more. Blinken also noted the country's repression of freedom in Hong Kong, its brutal treatment of religious and ethnic minorities in Tibet and the Xinjiang region, and its indignation over any international criticism over draconian measures employed against its citizens. ""Beijing insists that these are somehow internal matters, that others have no right to raise. That is wrong,"" Blinken said. The secretary also reaffirmed the One China policy, which was called into question earlier this week when President Biden he would defend Taiwan militarily before walking back his statements. Blinken said the U.S. still acknowledges only one Chinese government, but said its posture towards Taiwan had intensified. ""What has changed is Beijing's growing coercion by trying to cut off Taiwan's relations with countries around the world and blocking it from participating in international organizations,"" he said, adding that China regularly put on shows of force by flying military aircraft near the island. ""These words and actions are deeply destabilizing. They risk miscalculation and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait."" For all its commitment to its own territorial integrity, Blinken argued China's unwavering alliance with Russia was hypocritical. ""Even while Russia was clearly mobilizing to invade Ukraine, President Xi and President Putin declared that the friendship between their countries was and I quote, without limits,"" he said. Checking China's spending power Blinken repeatedly stressed that the aim of the administration was not exclude China from the world market. Instead, senior administration officials say they want to make sure it ""plays by the same rules as everyone else."" Blinken said that by creating dependencies, Beijing was ""seeking to make China less dependent on the world and the world more dependent on China."" ""For our part, we want trade and investment as long as they're fair, and don't jeopardize our national security,"" he added. He warned other countries to go into trade partnerships with open eyes, wary of retaliation should they adopt a stance China disagrees with. ""Many of our partners already had a painful experience, how Beijing can come down hard when they make choices that it dislikes,"" he said. A decisive decade for the world The secretary predicted the ideological battle between superpowers would be decided in the next 10 years. ""President Biden believes this decade will be decisive,"" Blinken said, outlining the administration's three pronged approach. ""The Biden administration strategy can be summed up in three words, invest, align, compete."" Invest, he said, referred to invigorating industry, technology and research to ensure the U.S. was up to par with China in these arenas. Align meant strengthening ties with key allies. Blinken said efforts to do both these things were already underway through initiatives like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and revived geopolitical partnerships. But to truly compete, he contended that more needed to be done -- calling on Congress to resolve a months' long stalemate and send a massive spending bill aimed at ramping up the country's ability to economically contend with China to the president's desk. ""Beijing is determined to lead, but given America's advantages, the competition is ours to lose -- not only in terms of developing new technologies, but also in shaping how they're used around the world, so that they're rooted in democratic values, not authoritarian ones,"" he implored.",6
2022-05-28,https://abcnews.go.com/US/foundation-partners-united-methodist-church-donate-medical-supplies/story?id=85029071,Foundation partners with United Methodist Church to donate medical supplies to Ukraine,"Months into the brutal war in Ukraine, hospitals in the besieged areas of the country are overcoming incredible obstacles to treat patients who need them now more than ever. With thousands of people injured, there’s been a dire need for medical supplies and non-profit organizations like the North Zulch, Texas-based Arlene Campbell Humanitarian Foundation. “I see resilience,” said Lena Denman, president of the foundation. “I see a [Ukrainian] people who have great fortitude, who have a willingness to fight and win.” The foundation is partnering with the United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), part of United Methodist Global Ministries -- the worldwide mission, relief and development agency of The United Methodist Church. “The goal of UMCOR is to alleviate human suffering,” said UMCOR’s chief executive, Roland Fernandes. The power of the global ministry plus its small donors has added up to one of the biggest donations of medical supplies from a nonprofit organization during the war. Despite the logistical nightmare, the organizations say they have delivered 24 tons of supplies worth nearly $1 million. “We're working with specific doctors, specific requests, and we're meeting those requests so that we see where the aid goes,” said Denman. Since Russia’s invasion, Denman’s foundation and UMCOR have sent three massive shipments of supplies like gowns, gloves, surgical kits and mask respirators. The third truckload arrived in May to the Ukrainian Health Ministry Heart Institute in the capital, Kyiv. “I think really being able to get the supplies on the ground is something that we don’t often do,” Fernandes said. “So to see that happen was a sense of…hopefully this really helps people who really need this.” The relief has helped. One grateful recipient is Dr. Vitaly Demyanchuk. The cardiothoracic surgeon at the Ukrainian Health Ministry Heart Institute has been living in the hospital treating victims of the war. Demyanchuk told ABC News “that despite the hard times, we’re trying day by day to return to work at full capacity. We are dedicated to providing care for patients.” The doctor has also distributed some of the donated supplies to other medical facilities including a children’s hospital where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently visited and honored doctors. They have been taking care of orphans who escaped the bombarded city of Mariupol. Demyanchuk said the U.S. aid “plays an enormous role in helping us do our job and do it as effectively as we can.” Denman said she fell in love with the Ukrainian people and culture more than 20 years ago. In 2000, she traveled there with Arlene Campbell, who started a non-profit organization to ship containers of food, medical equipment, medicine, and supplies to the former Soviet states. Campbell also developed a student-teacher exchange program with the help of a grant from the U.S. State Department. In 2016, Denman started the Arlene Campbell Humanitarian Foundation near College Station, Texas with a mission to honor her late mentor and continue sending medical supplies and equipment to that region. Now with a new conflict after Russia’s recent invasion, Denman is stepping up efforts to help. “The need is outstanding. The need has only increased,” said Denman. “The UN sent out a flash appeal asking governments and NGOs to only increase the aid not to decrease it at all.” While the need grows larger by the day, the United Methodist Church and the Arlene Campbell Humanitarian Foundation say so does their support for the people of Ukraine. “Arlene was a widow and she had no children,” said Denman. “Her legacy is me carrying on her foundational work to help Ukrainians and I know that she would be so pleased if she was alive today to see it in existence and to see the relationship we’ve built with UMCOR.”",25
2022-05-30,https://abcnews.go.com/International/egypt-uncovers-2500-year-coffins-bronze-statues-ancient/story?id=85064291,"Egypt uncovers 2,500-year-old coffins, bronze statues in ancient necropolis","SAQQARA, Egypt -- Egypt has uncovered 2,500-year-old wooden coffins and bronze statues in the ancient necropolis of Saqqara, the country announced on Monday, as it hopes a string of discoveries will help revive its ailing tourism industry. Two months after five ancient tombs were found nearby, Egypt excavated more treasures as it continues its extensive digging operations in the ancient burial ground, some 19 miles south of Cairo. Mostafa El-Waziri, the head of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters at the scene that the ""biggest bronze cachette"" was unearthed in the Bubastian cemetery, which is named after the ancient goddess of Bastet that was often depicted as a cat-headed woman. The cachette included 150 bronze statues of ancient Egyptian deities including Bastet, Anubis, Osiris, Amunmeen, Isis, Nefertum and Hathor. ""We also found a statue of Imhotep … and we hope we can find his tomb soon,"" El-Waziri added, referring to a well-known architect who is widely believed to have designed the 4,700-year-old step pyramid in the 27th century B.C. Three weeks after that discovery, Egypt uncovered two burial shafts that included 250 wooden painted coffins, with mummies inside, El-Waziri said. The coffins also date back to the late period, or about 747 B.C. to 332 B.C. One of the highlights was the discovery of the ""first intact papyrus in over 100 years,"" which may contain verses of the Book of the Dead, a collection of funerary texts containing spells to help the deceased navigate the afterlife. ""Preliminary findings suggest that the papyrus, which is rolled, is nine meters. It was sent to the labs of the Egyptian Museum (in Cairo's Tahrir square) for more studies,"" El-Waziri added. He then displayed a small statue of Bastet, which he said ""shows the beauty of Egyptian women,"" as it was found along with a collection of cosmetics including combs, bracelets and earrings. ""Look at how she is standing and the purse she is holding. This is how ancient Egyptians showed to us the beauty of Egyptian women,"" El-Waziri said. Egypt's digging operations in Saqqara had resulted in a string of discoveries in recent years, including the unearthing of a 4,400-year-old tomb of royal priest Wahtye in 2018 and the discovery of hundreds of mummified animals and statues a year later. Last year, Egypt unearthed 52 burial shafts in Saqqara with more than 50 wooden coffins found inside. They date back 3,000 years, the oldest sarcophagi found there. They also discovered the funerary temple of Queen Nearit, the wife of King Teti -- the first pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt. Egyptian tourism was badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and took a fresh battering because of Russia's war in Ukraine, with citizens of both countries comprising a big chunk of visitors to Egypt.",0
2022-05-31,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/clinton-campaign-lawyer-found-guilty-charge-lying-fbi/story?id=85022535,Clinton campaign lawyer found not guilty on charge of lying to FBI in loss for Durham,"A Democrat-linked lawyer charged by Special Counsel John Durham with lying to the FBI in 2016 was found not guilty a federal jury in Washington on Tuesday following a nearly two-week trial that served as the first in-court test of Durham's more than three-year investigation into the Russia probe. Michael Sussmann was charged by Durham last year for allegedly bringing forward a tip to a senior FBI official in September 2016 about a potential connection between computer servers for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's company and Russia's Alfa bank -- and lying about who he was representing at the time. ""While we are disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury's decision and thank them for their service. I also want to recognize and thank the investigators and the prosecution team for their dedicated efforts in seeking truth and justice in this case,"" Durham said in a statement. ""I told the truth to the FBI and the jury clearly recognized that with their unanimous verdict today,"" Sussmann said outside the courthouse following the verdict. ""Despite being falsely accused, I'm relieved that justice ultimately prevailed in my case."" Through multiple days of witness testimony and evidence exhibits displayed in the D.C. district court, Durham's prosecutors sought to convince the jury that Sussmann brought the info to then-FBI general counsel James Baker as part of Sussmann's work for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and a technology company executive who had worked on assembling the data. ""He knew that if he told Mr. Baker that he was there on behalf of the Clinton campaign, the chances of the FBI investigating would be diminished,"" assistant special counsel Jon Algor said Friday in closing arguments. They alleged that Sussmann set up the meeting with the hope of generating an ""October surprise,"" to leak that the FBI was investigating a potentially suspicious tie between Trump's campaign and Russia at a time when Russia was carrying out its hack-and-dump campaign against the Democrats. While Sussmann's attorneys acknowledged that he was at the time representing Clinton's campaign and a tech executive named Rodney Joffe in handling the allegations, they claimed Sussmann's intention in setting up the meeting with Baker was to alert the FBI to what he believed was concerning information and notify them that major news outlets were also pursuing it as a story. In their closing argument Friday, Sussmann's attorney Sean Berkowitz accused Durham's team of pushing baseless ""political conspiracy theories"" through their prosecution of Sussmann, who he said brought forth the information to Baker in genuine good faith. As a result of Sussmann's meeting with Baker, according to his attorneys, the FBI was able to convince the New York Times to hold off on reporting the Alfa Bank allegations while investigators evaluated the data -- which they quickly determined showed nothing nefarious. When the Times did eventually report on the Alfa Bank matter, it was part of a pre-election piece with the headline, 'Investigating Trump, FBI Sees No Clear Link To Russia.' ""The meeting ... is the exact opposite of what the Clinton campaign would have wanted,"" Sussmann's attorney Michael Bosworth said last week. The two-week trial featured testimony from a host of current and former law enforcement officials as well as former key figures in Clinton's campaign. While the charge leveled against Sussmann was narrow, in the months since his indictment Durham used the case to bring forward other evidence that prosecutors suggested showed a broader conspiracy, alleging Clinton's campaign and other political operatives sought to gin up and spread false accusations to smear Trump and use the nation's law enforcement agencies as political tools. But Marc Elias, the Clinton campaign's former general counsel, and Robby Mook, the campaign's manager, testified there was no discussion in the highest levels of the campaign about ordering or authorizing anyone to bring the Alfa Bank allegations directly to the FBI. While Mook acknowledged that Clinton herself at one point signed off on disseminating the unverified allegations to the press so journalists could ""vet"" and report them out, he sought to throw cold water on the that the campaign believed it would have benefited from getting the FBI involved. ""Going to the FBI does not seem like an effective way to get information out to the public,"" Mook said. Mook said that after Clinton authorized sending the Alfa Bank data out to journalists, a press official -- not Sussmann -- was tasked with pushing it out to reporters. A report on the allegations was later published by Slate days before the election, though it made no mention of the FBI's investigation into the data. Sussmann's attorneys also focused their strategy around undercutting testimony from the government's star witness, Baker, who said under questioning from the special counsel's office last week that he was ""100% confident"" that Sussmann told him in their Sep. 19 meeting he was not there on behalf of a particular client. That testimony, Sussmann's attorneys noted, directly conflicted with past statements Baker had made in interviews under oath with congressional investigators and the DOJ's inspector general -- where he either said that he believed Sussmann was there on behalf of unnamed cybersecurity experts or didn't remember if Sussmann had mentioned representing clients one way or another. But prosecutors also entered evidence this week showing that Sussmann had billed several flash drives he purchased days before the meeting to the Clinton campaign -- two of which Durham says Sussmann provided to Baker in their meeting that included the unverified data purporting to show a connection between Trump and Alfa bank. Additionally, they flagged multiple hours of time entries Sussmann had billed to the Clinton Campaign and the tech executive Rodney Joffe leading up to and after the meeting with Baker, where he wrote he was working on 'confidential' issues that Durham says was in reference to the Trump-Alfa bank allegations. ""If an opponent had brought this information, [the FBI] would want to know more about it,"" Algor said. ""They would question the credibility of the source and whether the FBI was being used -- being played by politics."" In the three years since Durham was initially assigned to look into the origins of the Russia investigation, he has secured one guilty plea of a former lawyer with the FBI who admitted to doctoring an email that was used to support a surveillance application that targeted a former Trump campaign aide. The only other indictment brought by Durham outside of Sussmann was against Igor Danchenko, a lead analyst who contributed to the now-infamous Steele Dossier, who was charged last year with five counts of lying to the FBI about who his sources were for claims in the dossier. Danchenko has pleaded not guilty to all counts and his case is set for trial in Virginia in the fall. The FBI's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election was not launched as a result of the Alfa Bank allegations or the Steele Dossier, and neither eventually factored into findings released by special counsel Robert Mueller following his two-year investigation. While Mueller's probe found numerous instances of contacts between Trump campaign officials and individuals with ties to Russia's government, he determined evidence didn't support charging any individuals of engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Russia.",11
2022-06-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-followers-election-claims-grow-preposterous-note/story?id=85092573,Trump has few followers as election claims grow more preposterous: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The claims have gotten more outlandish. The silence -- even from former President Donald Trump's strongest supporters -- has become more conspicuous. It should no longer be a surprise that, after he loses or his candidate loses an election, Trump amplifies false and easily discredited claims of fraud. He did it way back in 2012, when Mitt Romney lost but Trump didn't buy it, again in early 2016, when Sen. Ted Cruz beat him in the Iowa caucuses, and even after he won the presidency but lost the popular vote. But unlike his false claims about the 2020 election, his most recent insinuations of voter fraud are being almost entirely ignored. That happened in Pennsylvania, where Trump-endorsed Mehmet Oz didn't follow Trump's advice to declare victory before all votes were counted in the Senate race and a recount is now proceeding with Oz still in the lead. Now comes Georgia, where Trump-backed candidates were blown out in the highest-profile competitive primaries last week. Trump on Tuesday circulated a blog entry citing as ""obvious fraud"" the fact that Gov. Brian Kemp got nearly 74% of the vote in the GOP primary -- since ""it doesn't happen"" that candidates win in such lopsided fashion. (Actually, plenty of incumbents win primaries by that margin or more.) Just about nobody is following Trump's lead on that. Former Sen. David Perdue conceded on election night -- ""we trust the people of Georgia,"" he said -- and counties certified their vote counts without incident on Tuesday. Even Rep. Jody Hice, the election-denying candidate Trump backed for secretary of state, has conceded his race and called for Republican unity -- even though his opponent most likely avoided a runoff only because Democrats crossed over and voted in the Republican primary, according to The Associated Press. One thing that makes these claims harder for some Republicans to swallow is surely that, for the most part, these are votes by Republicans that Trump is baselessly suggesting were not properly cast or counted. For some Republicans and many Democrats, there may be another lesson out of the primary season beyond the fact that some Trump candidates are losing. Also losing is the idea that fighting nonexistent voter fraud -- and maybe hurting GOP turnout in the process -- is a winning concept for Republicans moving forward. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema Legal developments continue to unfold against the backdrop of Pennsylvania's Republican primary recount, which officials must complete in less than a week. The Supreme Court has put a temporary administrative hold on a Third Circuit decision that undated Pennsylvania mail ballots must be counted in a contested 2021 Lehigh County election, ABC News' Devin Dwyer reports. The court's ultimate decision on that case could impact this year's high-profile GOP primary between Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dave McCormick. The order dropped hours after a Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court hearing in which representatives for the McCormick campaign argued in favor of counting undated ballots that were received by the required deadline in this year's primary election, based on the Third Circuit decision. ""The date that matters is the date that [the ballot] was received, not the date that is provided by the voter on the envelope,"" said Ron Hicks, an attorney for the McCormick campaign. Attorneys representing the Oz campaign and the Republican National Committee, respectively argued a decision should be put on hold until the recount is complete and maintained undated ballots should not be counted as was in accordance with state law when they were cast. In the meantime, the McCormick campaign is also asking the state Commonwealth Court for a hand recount in 12 counties due to discrepancies in the vote counts reported by Pennsylvania State Department and individual counties. Despite pointing to these discrepancies, the campaign is not alleging fraud in the vote tallies -- a sharp contrast from the fallout of the 2020 general election in Pennsylvania. ""We're going to understand with a hand recount where any abnormalities exist, and actually have a receipt that we can trust and verify... We don't want to elongate the process. We don't want to cause any delays. We want the Republican primary voters to know that they have a winner -- whether it's by one vote or 1,000 votes -- so we can all get behind the nominee and beat Fetterman in the fall,"" a McCormick campaign official told reporters Tuesday. The TIP with Brittany Shepherd The lengthy process of redrawing each state's congressional districts is finally winding to a close. On Tuesday, New Hampshire's Supreme Court approved the final version of the state's plans. And now, after months of map drawing and district disputes, all 50 states have legally operative congressional maps in place for the upcoming midterm season and beyond. But this doesn't mean the boundaries are set in stone. The maps are liable to change through litigation, and several state redistricting efforts were met with accusations of partisan gerrymandering and voter disenfranchisement. Perhaps one of the most notable litigious fights is in Florida, where in a particularly unusual move, the state legislature enacted a map drawn by advisers of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis' map majorly reconfigured districts with a majority of Black residents, notably northern Florida's 5th Congressional District, represented by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat. Voting rights advocates -- and even a federal judge -- have attempted to thwart the governor's map that gives Republicans a major advantage both in the state and nationally, but they have been unable to notch a win. Even as Democrats sued and a circuit judge filed an injunction on the map based on the idea that it ""diminishes African Americans' ability to elect candidates of their choice,"" the map will remain in place pending a final legal decision. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 6. That's how many more Democratic-leaning seats the new maps drawn in the 2021-22 redistricting cycle have compared to maps drawn in the last redistricting cycle, according to FiveThirtyEight's redistricting tracker. The number of Republican-leaning seats, meanwhile, remains unchanged. These numbers aren't likely to move much either as New Hampshire was the final state to approve its map on Tuesday. (Several maps are being challenged in court but only Florida's seems likely to be overturned before the midterm elections in November.)

2022-06-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russias-blockade-odesa/story?id=85083666,What you need to know about Russia's blockade of Odesa,"ODESA, Ukraine -- Russia's invasion of Ukraine has meant vital food exports are stuck in Ukraine's ports. ABC News foreign correspondent Tom Soufi Burridge explains a looming crisis by answering four key questions. 1. How important is Ukraine's food production for the world? Ukraine is a vast agricultural production house. The country produces 46% of the world's sunflower oil exports, 37% of global millet (a small grain cereal) exports, 13% of all barley exports, 10% of total wheat exports, 8% of honey and 7% of walnut exports, according to the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club. Before Russia invaded, most of Ukraine's food production was exported through the country's Black Sea ports. Earlier this month, the United Nations World Food Programme said those exports would normally feed 400 million people around the world. The Middle East and Africa are Ukraine's main food export markets, said Professor Oleg Nivievskyi from Kyiv's School of Economics. By gaining rare access inside a grain terminal in Odesa's port, ABC News was able to witness the vast infrastructure that would normally be used to ship the produce out. Pre-war, the terminal would receive a hundred truck loads and a hundred train wagons of grain in a single day, said Oleksandr Guzenko, the plant's chief engineer. In a single hour, 400 tons of grain would normally flow through the plant and out to ships waiting in the dock, Guzenko added. However, these are abnormal times. 2. What is the impact of the Russia's blockade of the Black Sea? The grain terminal at the Port of Odesa is depressingly idle and silent. Chief Engineer Oleksandr Guzenko told ABC News he felt ""helpless."" The Russian threat at sea means there is no safe route for commercial vessels to exit and vast quantities of food exports are stuck in Ukraine's Black Sea ports. It is becoming ""a disaster"" for Ukrainian farmers. ""If the ports don't open soon, we are stuck with the crops,"" said Kees Huizinga, who owns a 40,000-acre farm in Kyshchentsi in the Cherkasy region, south of Kyiv. His business would gradually run out of money, he told ABC News, and planting for next year's harvest is already at risk. Huizinga predicted the world's food supply could be ""disrupted for the coming decade"" if the situation isn't solved soon. However, the blockade is having a ripple effect far beyond Ukraine. The U.N.'s World Food Programme said global food prices have risen sharply since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and vulnerable communities in parts of East Africa are at risk. Even before Russia attacked Ukraine, the WFP was forecasting a year of ""catastrophic hunger,"" because global resources were not keeping pace with demand. In the first month of the war, export prices for wheat and maize rose by 22% and 20%, respectively, ""on top of steep rises in 2021,"" according to the WFP. WFP Executive Director David Beasley told ABC News the war is a ""catastrophe on top of a catastrophe."" ""The world demands [that the ports open], because hundreds of millions of people globally depend on food that comes through these ports,"" Beasley said. 3. What is causing the blockade? Russian President Vladimir Putin and his generals have spoken openly about their desire to capture Ukraine's largest port, Odesa, and possibly the entire Ukrainian coastline -- which would throttle Ukraine's economy. When Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, there was a possibility that the Russian navy might launch an assault on Ukraine's southwestern coast from the sea. By capturing Snake Island, a strategically important slice of dry land off Ukraine's western coast, on day one of the war, the Kremlin signaled its intent. In response to the Russian threat, Ukraine quickly placed mines in the Black Sea near Odesa and other major ports. In a briefing with ABC News this week, a NATO official said coastal defenses were necessary ""in order to deter or thwart a potential Russian amphibious landing."" The Russian government recently said it was ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for ships carrying food, in return for the lifting of Western sanctions. It called on Ukraine to de-mine the Black Sea. However, the U.K. Ministry of Defense accused Russia of ""introducing an alternative narrative"" to complicate people's understanding of the original cause of the blockade. Ukraine has only deployed maritime mines, the U.K.'s Ministry of Defense said, ""because of the continued credible threat of Russian amphibious assaults from the Black Sea."" 4. Why do Western leaders accuse Putin of ""weaponizing hunger"" and is there a solution on the horizon? U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently accused Putin of ""using food as a weapon."" The Biden administration and its Western allies make this accusation because Russia's invasion of Ukraine was unprovoked and the Kremlin has the ability to drop its threat on ports such as Odesa. ""If Kyiv solves the problem of de-mining ports, then the Russian navy will ensure unhindered passage of ships with grain to the Mediterranean Sea,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov responded on Tuesday to international criticism. The White House has already ruled out meeting Russia's demand to drop sanctions in return for an end to the blockade. What military guarantees Russia could offer Ukraine, in order for Ukraine to demine the Black Sea, is not at all clear. A senior NATO official offered a blunt assessment to ABC News in the context of Tuesday's back and forth: Ukraine cannot trust anything Russia says. That said, European countries, namely France and Germany, are negotiating the issue with Russia. In the meantime, Ukraine and the European Union are trying to increase Ukrainian food exports by road and rail. However, Nivievskyi, from Kyiv's School of Economics, warned it is ""not physically possible"" to transport the huge amount of grain by rail and road. By his calculation, rail and road routes have only about 10% of the export capacity of Ukraine's Black Sea ports.",25
2022-06-02,https://abcnews.go.com/US/arnold-schwarzenegger-visit-auschwitz-fight-terminate-hate/story?id=85134026,Arnold Schwarzenegger to visit Auschwitz in fight to 'terminate hate',"Arnold Schwarzenegger has vowed to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp in September with the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation to see firsthand what life was like in the camp. The AJCF will award the former California governor and actor the inaugural Award for Fighting Hatred on Thursday at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. He will receive the award from Simon Bergson, son of Holocaust survivors and AJCF's chairman. ""I am witness to the ruins of a country broken by the Nazis,"" Schwarzenegger said in a statement on the honor. He plans on joining in the organization's effort to ""terminate hate."" ""I saw firsthand how this hatred spun out of control and I share these painful memories with the world in the hopes of preventing future tragedies and educating soldiers about personal responsibility. I stand with the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation and their mission of education to ensure NEVER AGAIN."" Schwarzenegger has been a major donor to anti-hate organizations and has been an outspoken advocate against anti-Semitism and hate. He was born in Austria just two years after the end of World War II and the demise of the Nazi regime. He has spoken openly about the long-lasting damage that bigotry caused to those who were complicit in anti-Semitism and Nazism. ""Growing up, I was surrounded by broken men drinking away their guilt with their participation in the most evil regime in history,"" he said. ""Not all of them were rabid anti-Semites or Nazis. Many just went along step by step down the road. They were the people next door."" Bergson told ABC News that he's in awe of how, within one generation, those in close proximity to the Nazi party and the Holocaust are banding together against hatred. Both Bergson and Schwarzenegger were born in the late 1940s in Austria after the war. He said that learning about and addressing war crimes and hate is important considering the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as violence in the U.S. ""Hate is something that we try to educate young people on because we're not born with hate,"" Bergson told ABC News. ""We learn about hate and we adapt hate based upon our environment. And the key is to get to schools early and educate people today that hatred is not necessary. Hatred is not part of what our life should be all about."" At the event, military cadets and midshipmen from U.S. Army, Naval, Coast Guard, Air Force, and the Space Force Academies will be saluted as they embark on a journey to Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps, as well as the ghettos of Krakow and Warsaw. ACJF'S American Service Academies Program sends cadets to learn ""ethical responsibility in the military and war atrocity prevention."" ""The cadets are taken to Auschwitz where they learn about the atrocities, they learn about how to deal with ethical behavior while they're in the military,"" Bergson said. ""These are future leaders of the United States military."" ABC News' DJ Cunningham contributed to this report.",1
2022-06-02,https://abcnews.go.com/US/ukrainian-students-us-internships-housing-corporate-america/story?id=85093683,"Ukrainian students in US get internships, housing from corporate America","Sofia Surzhak remembers exactly where she was when she learned that Russia had begun invading her hometown of Kyiv, Ukraine. “I remember being in the dining hall and reading the news that the invasion started,” Surzhak, a student at the University of California, Berkeley, told ABC News. “And life just stopped for me for a moment because I realized how unpredictable and how dangerous the situation is.” For 19-year-old Surzhak, watching the war from afar seems surreal. She struggles to hold on to thoughts of the home she knew, not the one playing out in the news. “The road that I used every single day is now filled with reminders of tanks and burnt cars... I think that these are like pictures from the history textbooks, and I do not really recognize the city anymore,” said Surzhak. Just six months into her freshman year, the war has upended life for Surzhak and the roughly 1,700 other Ukrainian college students studying in the U.S., according to the Institute of International Education. Her father Ruslan remains in Kyiv, caring for the family’s four dogs and his small business, while her mother Natalia fled to Poland to live with a family that has taken in Ukrainian refugees. Surzhak and her mother communicate via FaceTime nearly every day. “When I phone home and phone Sofia,” her mother said, “I was happy that connection, it works, that it is possible to see and hear all my family.” Natalia Surzhak said she is grateful that technology allows her to stay connected to her family during the war and said she can only imagine how difficult it was for people during World War II, who had no easy way of communicating with loved ones once they were separated. Unable to return home for the summer, Sofia Surzhak - and many students like her - were left scrambling to find a way to remain in the U.S. once the school year ends. “I am genuinely scared that I will not be able to come back in a very long time,” Surzhak said. “I was just hoping to have such a beautiful summer with my former classmates, and I'm just scared that nothing will go back to normal.” The public and private sectors are working to lend support to these students. The Department of Homeland Security has temporarily extended visas for Ukrainian students and is offering special student relief to those experiencing extreme economic hardship, including allowing them to apply to work more hours while taking fewer courses. Colleges including the University of Chicago, Columbia University and Hampton University are offering various support, which includes scholarships and summer room and board for eligible Ukrainian students. Now, corporate America is answering the call. The San Francisco-based technology company AEye, which makes lidar sensors for self-driving cars, is one of a growing list of private companies offering Ukrainian college students paid summer internships. Surzhak will join AEye this summer as a software coder. Other companies offering similar internships to Ukrainian students in the U.S. are the Worcester, Massachusetts-based automation company Dynamic Control Technologies, the Omaha, Nebraska-based travel platform Sojern, and the Marin County, California-based beverage company Free Spirits. AEye’s CEO Blair LaCorte said the idea was an employee-led initiative. “We brainstormed a bunch of ideas,” he said. “Our company is all about safety, and that’s how we got here. We started to think about the children inside Ukraine, and then we looked at children who were outside of Ukraine who couldn't get home. That really resonated with our employees, who also had children and thought, how would I deal with this?” Three of AEye’s ten summer interns this year are from Ukraine, and LaCorte said the company crowdsourced to find them temporary summer housing. Surzhak said the internship is a lifeline. It not only helps her remain in the U.S. in between her freshman and sophomore years, but it also helps her earn money for tuition at a time when her father’s business in Kyiv is struggling because of the war. She has found a community of Ukrainian and Russian students at UC Berkeley who have organized fundraisers on campus to send money and supplies to Ukraine and spread awareness about the war. “We all comfort each other,” she said. “It’s difficult for us [Ukrainians], but it’s also difficult for the Russians. Many don’t agree with what’s going on right now with the war.” When asked what she misses most about home, without hesitation Surzhak answered - her dogs, especially the young one named Princess. When she does finally return to Kyiv, Surzhak said, “I would just love to have a nice quiet evening walk in the center of the city and go to a nice restaurant - somewhere that is peaceful.”",22
2022-06-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-faces-pressures-russias-war-ukraine-note/story?id=85114961,Biden faces new pressures over Russia’s war with Ukraine: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Nearly 100 days into a grinding and tragic conflict, a new voice is emerging at a critical moment for President Joe Biden as he seeks to manage the U.S. response. Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska is speaking out about the personal toll of Russia's war with Ukraine -- the burdens borne by children and family as well as the costs for her nation and all nations if they give in to Russian demands. ""You just can't concede … parts of your territory. It's like conceding a freedom,"" Zelenska told ABC News' Robin Roberts in an interview airing Thursday on ""Good Morning America."" Asked about the importance of assistance from other nations, Zelenska replied: ""It's really important because you feel you're not alone."" The power of her voice is not in enumerating Ukraine's asks, as her husband has done consistently over the past several months. The Biden White House is clearly aware of those asks and more as the president continues to calibrate expectations and define limitations. When Biden explained the latest military aid he is providing Ukraine in a New York Times op-ed, he made clear weapons will only be for use ""on the battlefield in Ukraine"" -- which is to say, not in Russia. He also said he would not ""seek a war between NATO and Russia,"" and that -- despite a previous assertion that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" -- ""the United States will not try to bring about his ouster in Moscow."" ""We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia,"" Biden wrote. Biden has been clear on that point from the start. But at a moment when the president's credibility is being tested at home on inflation, baby formula and so much else, pain being felt in Ukraine could still break through in ways that are difficult to anticipate. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Several states are moving forward with gun reform legislation, getting ahead of congressional negotiations that may or may not yield any change on the issue. It comes as victims of the Uvalde school shooting are laid to rest and after the conclusion of funeral services for victims of the Buffalo grocery shooting. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state's Democratic-led legislature is pushing a package of 10 gun-related bills. Among the proposals is raising the minimum age to purchase a semiautomatic rifle to 21, restricting the purchase of body armor and expanding eligibility to file protection orders in connection with ""red flag"" laws. ""Within the last month, two horrific mass shootings in Buffalo and in Texas have rattled this nation to our core and shed a new light on the urgent need for action to prevent future tragedies,"" Hochul said. ""New York already has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, but clearly we need to make them even stronger. Lawmakers in New Jersey and California have also pushed gun reforms. Those states, however, are all led by Democrats, while Republican-led states, like Texas, are far less likely to embrace such reforms. Advocates would argue that the piecemeal approach to gun reform limits its efficacy, and many want to see more far-reaching change through federal legislation. Attempts to pass federal gun reform measures have repeatedly failed after deadly mass shootings, and there aren't any signs to indicate that current negotiations will fare better. Even President Biden expressed his doubts to reporters Wednesday. ""I've been involved [in negotiations],"" Biden said. ""I'm just not confident."" The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Amid a national reckoning over gun reform in the wake of the deadly Uvalde shooting, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called for the state legislature to create special committees to make recommendations on issues that would ""prevent future school shootings."" The governor said lawmakers should examine topics covering school safety, mental health, social media, police training and firearm safety. The move is not a call for a special legislative session, which would have set forth a process that could ultimately pass laws. The Texas governor is the only person who can call for a special legislative session, and his chosen priority policies are the only items the legislature could address during it. Texas State Teachers Association President Ovidia Molina on Wednesday called Abbott's move ""very weak"" in a statement, adding that committees already studied school safety after the 2018 Santa Fe High School and the 2019 El Paso Walmart shootings. Despite past recommendations ""schools obviously aren't safe from mass shooters,"" Molina said. ""This is because the governor and legislators refuse to address the real issue and enact reasonable gun laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. The governor didn't even put this issue on the agenda for the new committees,"" Molina said. The development is also edging onto the campaign trail with Abbott's Democratic challenger, Beto O'Rourke, tweeting, ""Anyone can call for a committee. Only a governor can call a special session. Do your job."" So far, Abbott has not publicly ruled out calling for a special session, but it seems unlikely the incumbent governor would take on the endeavor amid an already tense reelection campaign.

2022-06-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/kids-experience-traumatic-event/story?id=85112269,What happens when kids experience a traumatic event?,"This is a MedPage Today story. Three days after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, social worker and child therapist Bonnie Rumilly arrived in Newtown, Connecticut, to help with crisis counseling. It quickly became obvious that this would become ""a long-term deployment,"" said Rumilly, who spent 4.5 years working with children who survived the attack. While she feels a fierce loyalty to her young patients and their privacy, Rumilly said her experience with Sandy Hook revealed that pediatric trauma is highly individualized, and that children are not just little adults when it comes to the way trauma manifests. Furthermore, the traumatic event can leave marks on the wider community for years to come, she noted. ""When something like this happens, the ripple effects are so, so large,"" Rumilly told MedPage Today. ""If you think of people in a community, there are families who have other children. You think of employees of other schools in the same district. There's the mailman who comes to deliver the mail every day who has a connection to that child. … [There are] grandparents in that community."" ""It really impacts on a multi-generational level,"" she added. ""It's very hard to measure."" While both adults and children can be resilient in the face of devastating events, it's important to have a plan in place early to get people the help they may need, Rumilly said. Mental health professionals like Rumilly who responded to the Sandy Hook shooting, and other experts in child psychiatry, described their experiences and spoke to the effects that survivors of the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, are likely to face in the days, weeks, months, and years ahead -- especially the youngest survivors. Signs of trauma in children When someone experiences a traumatic event like a school shooting, they can become stuck in that moment, said Dr. Laurel Williams, a child psychiatrist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Williams used the example of a tree falling through a house during a hurricane. ""Now, any time someone hears a loud noise at night, or a storm happens, they keep visualizing the tree that came into the house and they remember the fear of that moment,"" she told MedPage Today. A trigger in the environment can set off a flashback, like those experienced by patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which brings back the memory ""in 3D with sound, smell, taste, and visuals,"" she continued. ""It's like watching a movie again that you don't want to be watching."" With PTSD, the brain's survival mechanism for keeping someone out of harm's way is hijacked, Williams said. ""Your brain has gotten too good at picking up clues in your environment that you're in danger."" Treatments focus on desensitizing people to that memory, she noted, so they can ""move through"" the trauma. ""It's really about re-training your brain to be not so responsive to a clue in the environment that you should be scared and run away."" However, most people who experience a traumatic event won't go on to develop PTSD, or any other mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety, Williams said. ""We're not saying that you are destined to have a mental health issue because you watched somebody be shot,"" she explained. ""That is not the case. Most people actually don't go on to develop a disorder."" But recognizing the signs of struggle early is key, especially when it comes to children, she said. It may be difficult to pick up on those signs, especially with elementary school children like those impacted by the Uvalde shooting, who may not be able to express their feelings well. Children also respond to trauma very differently from one another, and ""big trauma really is very individually dependent,"" she added. Maureen Brogan, statewide program manager of the Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth Program at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said that while younger kids may not have the verbal capacity to describe their emotions after they experience trauma, they may express physical manifestations, such as headaches, chest tightness, feeling like their heart is beating out of their chest, or stomach pain. ""They'll be able to describe somatic things that are going on that would not bring you necessarily to a therapist, but might bring you to your pediatrician,"" Brogan said. Kids who experience trauma may also show signs of regression, she added. For example, kids who were used to separating from their parents to go to school might become clingy, or not want to leave the house. Younger children might start wetting the bed, or return to former self-soothing practices such as sucking their thumb. Elementary school children who are struggling may also exhibit repetitive play, Williams said. ""If you witness a trauma … you might just keep playing that experience over and over in your play."" Since children ""love to express themselves with drawings, they might start to draw things that are different themes [from] what they've ever drawn before."" These behaviors may not be consistent throughout the day, she noted. ""It's really about a parent being able to tell how [the child is] doing throughout the whole day."" Sometimes, symptoms of a trauma may not become apparent until months -- or even longer -- after the event, Williams added. In the early days after the event, it could be so overwhelming that there's no noticeable change in behavior. ""For many young people, their symptoms will not come to the forefront until several months later,"" she said. ""There's often a delay between when something happened and when there's really a problem."" That's why, mental health clinicians said, it's important to have resources available immediately in the aftermath of a tragedy, and to have a plan to provide those resources in the long term — as was done for the Newtown community following the Sandy Hook shooting. Sandy Hook response Dr. Melissa Brymer, director of terrorism and disaster programs at the UCLA-Duke National Center for Child Traumatic Stress Network, was the lead advisor to the Newtown Public Schools Recovery Program following the school shooting there. Immediately after the shooting, mental health professionals employed an approach called Psychological First Aid, an early intervention designed to stabilize a community and meet basic needs after a crisis, which Brymer helped to develop. ""Part of Psychological First Aid is, how do we make sure that we support people where they're at right now?"" Brymer told MedPage Today, adding that helping people access safety and comfort is key to recovery. Fulfilling immediate needs might look like delivering warm meals, coordinating childcare for parents who are grieving or need mental health support, or even assisting in decision making about memorial services, she said. Additionally, providers might help connect people who are grieving to the social networks they need to cope, such as faith groups, friends or neighbors. The program at Sandy Hook focused on crisis work for at least six months, Brymer said. As the community prepared for the following school year, Brymer's team conducted 25 to 30 focus groups to assess the needs of the district. The groups involved families who lost a child, parents whose children witnessed the shooting, educators, bus drivers, community leaders, clergy, and others. The response team also identified children who were considered most vulnerable -- including the first-graders who were in the classroom and witnessed the shooting, as well as siblings of children who died. Community mental health providers who were trained in trauma-informed care came to Newtown to assist with counseling and care coordination in the months following the shooting. Then, the district hired additional social workers and psychologists with grant funding, trained them in trauma practices, and placed them in schools, while phasing out the community providers. There were several decisions that needed to be made for children to resume school safely, one of which was whether or not they would return to Sandy Hook Elementary. Ultimately, students resumed school at a vacant middle school a few towns over. Upon their return, the recovery team aimed to remove triggers that might re-traumatize students, such as the slamming of lockers or alarms during a fire drill. At the start of the following academic year, Brymer said that Sandy Hook began implementing programs that made trauma-informed interventions a focus in each school. Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS) was one of those programs, designed to reduce signs of PTSD in middle and high school kids. But that program wasn't applicable to the younger elementary school children who were involved in the Sandy Hook shooting. Instead, Brymer's group employed an initiative called Bounce Back, a program for younger students based on CBITS. It combined group, individual, and parent psychoeducational therapy to manage children's stress response. ""We did have to … think about what interventions were appropriate for young kids and which were not,"" Brymer noted. Bounce Back was implemented for 4 years through grant funding. In addition to providing support directly to the elementary school students who survived the Sandy Hook shooting, the group also implemented trauma-informed care in the other elementary, middle, and high schools throughout the district. As the children affected by Sandy Hook moved through the school system, the educators and other faculty members were already trained to support them at each developmental stage. ""It is important that we mold with them, that we adapt with them,"" Brymer said. ""We have to have interventions that mature as the kids mature."" She added that suicide prevention interventions were implemented for middle and high school students, and were eventually integrated into health classes across the district. Rumilly, who cared for the children of Sandy Hook, emphasized that long-term planning is crucial following such a tragedy, given its lasting impacts on the entire community. ""This is beyond a 10-year plan,"" she said. ""This is, how do we plan for the next couple of generations after this … because transgenerational trauma is also something that has to be considered. For people that aren't going to seek help and have symptoms, they're passing that on to the next generation of children."" At the same time, she added, having to map out mental health resources, should such an event occur in a community, shouldn't become the norm. ""This should not be what we have to plan for,"" she said, but ""I think the onus is on communities and cities to think about, 'What would I do if this happened tomorrow in my community?'""",22
2022-06-06,https://abcnews.go.com/International/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-faces-confidence-vote/story?id=85208468,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson wins 'no-confidence' vote,"LONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a ""no-confidence"" vote on Monday evening, with Conservative lawmakers voting in favor of his leadership by a margin of 211-148. The vote could have forced his resignation after the prime minister became embroiled in a series of scandals. Johnson called the vote ""an extremely good result"" and ""conclusive"" and ""decisive"" and said he can now focus on delivering what people care about, including rising costs and crime. ""We have now the opportunity to put down all this stuff people in the media like going on about,"" Johnson added. Held by Johnson's Conservative Party, the vote was the latest challenge aimed at ending the political career of the United Kingdom's controversial leader. ""Conservative MPs made their choice tonight,"" Keir Starmer, leader of the opposing Labour Party, said in a speech following the results. ""They have ignored the British public and hitched themselves and their party firmly to Boris Johnson, and everything that he represents."" Graham Brady, a Conservative MP, announced the vote on Monday morning, saying it had been triggered on Sunday when a 15% threshold of Conservative lawmakers in the House of Commons had decided they no longer trusted Johnson to lead. ""The PM welcomes the opportunity to make his case to MPs and will remind them that when they're united and focused on the issues that matter to voters there is no more formidable political force,"" No. 10 Downing St., Johnson's office, said in a statement. Brady told BBC News that he had informed Johnson on Sunday. Members who filed no-confidence letters with Brady had dated them to coincide with the end of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee on Sunday, so as not to interrupt the celebration, he said. The prime minister required a simple majority to survive. The Conservative Party holds 359 seats in the U.K. Parliament, meaning he required 180 MPs to back him in order to stay in office. Despite living to fight another day, the scale of victory could still prove to be a problem. With a close vote, observers say, he could still be pressured to resign at a later date. Under the current rules, however, he will be immune from a similar challenge to his leadership for a year. Theresa May, Johnson's predecessor, won a confidence vote 200-117 in December 2018, but would still resign five months later. Johnson received an even lower percentage of support. The no-confidence vote comes after months of pressure building on Johnson's leadership, and this is the first vote of its kind since Johnson became prime minister in July 2019. A much publicized investigation by a top civil servant, Sue Gray, into over a dozen gatherings held at key government residences attending by Downing Street staff concluded in May. The prime minister himself was personally issued a fine by the Metropolitan Police in April for attending an illegal gathering during COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, becoming the first sitting prime minister in British history to receive a sanction for breaking the law. Johnson apologized, but has since faced a chorus of calls to resign from opposition lawmakers and, now, members of his own party. The report included a photo of the prime minister making a toast at a gathering held in No. 10 to mark the departure of one of his special advisers, at a time when the nation was under a strict lockdown. There were also a number of damning details in the report, including ""multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff"" and instances of ""excessive alcohol consumption."" ""Many will be dismayed that behaviour of this kind took place on this scale at the heart of Government,"" Gray wrote in the conclusion of the report. ""The public have a right to expect the very highest standards of behaviour in such places and clearly what happened fell well short of this."" While the government has received praise at home and abroad for their support for Ukraine, the scandal over ""Partygate"" and growing concern about the cost of living has overshadowed Johnson's recent premiership. On Friday, Johnson was booed by spectators at St. Paul's Cathedral as he arrived for the National Service of Thanksgiving. He has received public backing from several key lawmakers ahead of the no-confidence vote, which is a secret ballot, and Johnson will reportedly address his own MPs in order to make the case for his leadership ahead of the final vote on Monday evening.

2022-06-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-grain-leaving-ports-russian-ships-us-official/story?id=85229887,"Ukrainian grain may be leaving ports -- but on Russian ships, US official says","There is evidence of Russian vessels departing ""from near Ukraine with their cargo holds full of grain,"" a U.S. Department of State spokesperson told ABC News on Monday night. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reported that Russia seized at least 400,000 to 500,000 tons of grain worth over $100 million, according to the State Department spokesperson. ""Ukraine's MFA also has numerous testimonies from Ukrainian farmers and documentary evidence showing Russia's theft of Ukrainian grain,"" the spokesperson said. The news of Ukrainian grain aboard Russian ships partly confirms a recent report by The New York Times that Moscow is seeking to profit off of grain plundered from Ukraine by selling the product while subverting sanctions. Ukraine has already accused Russia of shipping the stolen grain to buyers in Syria and Turkey. Since Russian forces invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, the cost of grain has skyrocketed worldwide. Russia and Ukraine -- often referred to collectively as Europe's breadbasket -- produce a third of the global supply of wheat and barley, but Kyiv has been unable to ship exports due to Moscow's offensive. Earlier this month, the Ukrainian Grain Association warned that Ukraine's wheat harvest is expected to plummet by 40%. In recent weeks, there has been an all-out push from the United States and the United Nations to facilitate exports from war-torn Ukraine, desperate to offset what they foretell is a looming global food crisis with the potential to devastate the developing world. A Russian blockade in the Black Sea, along with Ukrainian naval mines, have made exporting siloed grain virtually impossible and, as a result, millions of people around the world -- particularly in Africa and the Middle East -- are now on the brink of famine. As part of ongoing efforts to assist food exports, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is expected to meet with his Turkish counterpart in Ankara this week. But State Department spokesperson Ned Price has set low expectations for the meeting. ""I don't know if we should expect breakthroughs,"" Price told reporters during a press briefing on Monday afternoon. ""Of course, we'll be watching closely. We'll be talking with our Turkish allies in the aftermath of that visit."" Price underscored the pain the world is feeling because of Russia’s crunch on its food supply. “This is a war that not only has brutalized -- and, in many ways, terrorized -- the people of Ukraine, but it has put at risk food security around the world,"" he said. Currently, there are approximately 84 merchant ships and 450 seafarers trapped at Ukrainian ports, according to Price. ""Not only is there grain aboard these vessels, but there are about 22 million tons of grain sitting in silos near the ports that also needs to move out to make room for the newly harvested grain,"" he said. ""In addition, Russia has actually taken aim at ships at sea. They have taken aim at grain silos. They are continuing to effectively implement what amounts to a blockade of Ukraine’s ports.""",25
2022-06-09,https://abcnews.go.com/International/mariupol-residents-face-risk-cholera-epidemic-amid-water/story?id=85231056,"Mariupol residents face risk of cholera epidemic amid water, sanitation crisis","LONDON -- The port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine is facing the risk of a cholera epidemic amid the destruction of water supplies and sanitation during the Russian invasion, city officials and health agencies warn. ""The risk of cholera is very high, like red, red level,"" Petro Andriushchenko, an advisor to Mariupol’s mayor, told ABC News, adding that the municipality could not provide an estimation of the number of infected cases due to lack of proper access to the occupants amid the occupation by Russian forces. While the warnings have intensified in the past few days, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said on Telegram last month that due to problems with water supply, the city is threatened by an infectious catastrophe and more than 10,000 people may die by the end of the year. The deteriorating water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure has set an alarmingly high risk of an outbreak, according to a report in April from the World Health Organization's Health Cluster Ukraine agency. The warming spring and summer weather will likely increase transmission, the report said. ""The weather is hot. There are still dead bodies on the streets of the city -- especially under the debris of residential buildings. In some blocks, it is impossible to walk by -- due to the stench of rotten human flesh. There was no rain for a while, and it is getting hotter,"" a resident of Mariupol, who did not want to be named for security concerns, told ABC News. The condition of hospital staffing is also ""catastrophic,"" Andriushchenko wrote on his official Telegram channel on Wednesday. ""Visual demonstration of complete paralysis and collapse of medical system… In this state of medicine, any infectious disease turns into a deadly epidemic,” he said. Andryushchenko told ABC News that swimming has been banned in the sea [of Azov] as a means to control the spread of the disease. Russian occupation authorities were beginning to quarantine the captured city of Mariupol, he said. Dorit Nitzan, the WHO’s Ukraine incident manager, told reporters last month the international agency’s partners on the ground in Mariupol are observing ""actual swamps in the streets."" Sewage water and drinking water are getting mixed, Nitzan said at a press briefing in Kyiv. ""This is a huge hazard for many infections, including cholera,"" she said. ""Accessing Mariupol is an issue, but we are looking for opportunities via partners on the ground,"" WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told ABC News. To take necessary measures in controlling the risk of spreading the disease, the international body ""has provided Ukraine with guidance on prevention, preparedness, case definitions, detection -- including in wastewater monitoring-- [and] standards of care and case management,"" Harris added. Due to the lack of water, the city’s residents have drawn untreated water from rivers and lakes, the April report warns, saying Ukraine was also the last European country to declare a cholera epidemic, with 33 cases in Mariupol in 2011. ""There is still no water supply – it is delivered by trucks, and people on the streets are staying in the lines to fill some bottles,"" the Mariupol resident who spoke to ABC News said, adding that people in the city have no information about possible affected cases. Besides facilitating readiness for the use of cholera vaccines in Ukraine, the WHO says it is working with the Ministry of Health to provide risk communication materials advising people on ""how to protect themselves, on prevention, but also on treatment, including on what to do at-home."" The international body has also offered medical supplies, including WHO cholera kits with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), Harris said. The city was reportedly home to over 400,000 people before Russia invaded Ukraine in February. While there are no accurate statistics on the number of current residents, Ukrainian officials estimate that 100,000 to 150,000 people are still living in the occupied city, many in hiding in the basements and bomb shelters. Harris underlined the critical psychological condition of the people left in the city and how it would contribute to the likely outbreak. ""The fact that people have to be on the move, the fact that they often have close together, that they're huddling in basements, in bomb shelters, and the incredible trauma, psychological pressure they are under has got to be having a severe effect on their immune systems, weakening their immune system,"" she said. ""So even what's normally just a mild infection for you or me is a much more serious infection in somebody under those conditions,"" she added.",25
2022-06-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-mounting-nuclear-threats-north-korea-iran/story?id=85266831,"Biden's mounting nuclear threats from North Korea, Iran","While the world's focus has been trained on Russian President Vladimir Putin's nuclear saber-rattling over Ukraine, two other longstanding threats to U.S. national security have been not so quietly amplifying their ability to wreak international havoc. In recent months, North Korea has test-launched an unprecedented number of ballistic missiles, and the U.S. assesses the country has imminent plans to resume nuclear testing after a five-year hiatus. The U.N.'s atomic watchdog announced this week that Iran is mere weeks away from enriching enough uranium to potentially manufacture a nuclear explosive device and is blatantly blocking its surveillance efforts. The threats posed by a Tehran or Pyongyang with weapons of mass destruction are vast, and the U.S. diplomatic approach to both countries is nuanced. But the core question facing the Biden administration is straightforward: What -- if anything -- can it do to stop to prevent Iran and North Korea from becoming nuclear powers? A cold shoulder from North Korea The State Department has publicly messaged to Pyongyang that the door for diplomacy is open, but the U.S. Special Representative to North Korea says that sentiment has been communicated through ""high-level personal messages from senior U.S. officials"" via ""private channels"" as well. Sung Kim revealed on Tuesday that in recent weeks, officials have even laid out specific proposals for humanitarian assistance in response to the Hermit Kingdom's coronavirus outbreak. But these offers have gone unanswered, Kim said, as the country continues ""to show no indication that is interested in engaging."" The silence of Pyongyang's leadership is in direct contrast to the explosive missile launches that regularly light up the sky over the waters surrounding the Korean peninsula. ""North Korea has now launched 31 ballistic missiles in 2022. The most ballistic missiles it has ever launched in a single year, surpassing its previous record of 25 in 2019. And it's only June,"" Kim said, adding the country has ""obviously done the preparations"" to resume nuclear testing as well. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said earlier this week the response to any such test by North Korea would be ""swift and forceful,"" but so far, no official has publicly stated what exactly the reaction would be. State Department Spokesperson Ned Price downplayed the extraordinary displays of force on Monday, calling them ""cyclical."" ""We've seen periods of provocation; we've seen periods of engagement. It is very clear at the moment that we are in the former,"" Price said. But Bruce Bennett, a defense researcher at the RAND Corporation who has previously worked with Department of Defense, says it might be time for the U.S. to take a bolder approach. Bennett argues that giving North Korea's authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un the opportunity to rebuff an invitation from the U.S. plays into his hand. ""He's just able to say no, makes him look superior, like he's in control. So that's not helping us on the deterrence issue,"" he said. Similarly, Bennett argues that following up Kim Jong Un's test launches by firing off short-range missiles with South Korea, as the U.S. did on Sunday, is unlikely to yield results. A better route, he says, would be directly punishing the dictator. Some options? Bennett suggests threatening to fly reconnaissance aircraft along the country's coast, playing off Kim's abhorrence for spying. Or perhaps vowing to drop hard drives loaded with what he has called a ""vicious cancer"": K-Pop. ""That's where we've got to get creative -- with what Kim hates himself,"" Bennett said. While those strategies might seem lighthearted, Bennett says the threat North Korea poses is anything but. ""The last North Korean nuclear test was of a 230 kiloton nuclear weapon. That size weapon detonated, focused on the Empire State Building will kill or seriously injure just under three million people,"" he said. ""We're talking about massive damage that this North Korea threat can do if it's ever really completed and made operational. And so the U.S. should be very anxious to stop and to rein it in. But we don't seem to have figured out what we need to do to do that."" Iran on the verge As the top brass of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned of Iran's stockpiling of enriched Uranium and failure to comply with U.N. inspectors this week, the U.S. and its allies successfully pushed for a censure. The rebuke is largely symbolic, but it may be telling when it comes to the administration's dimming hopes of returning to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—the 2015 nuclear agreement former President Trump withdrew from in 2018. When President Joe Biden entered the White House, top officials promised ""a longer and stronger"" deal. The administration loosened the enforcement of some sanctions and held back in forums like IAEA meetings in order to create space for negotiations. But after more than a year of indirect, stop-and-go talks, the odds of reviving the even the original JCPOA seem slim to none. The Biden administration said in February it would soon be ""impossible"" to return to the deal given the pace of Iran's nuclear advances. But Ali Vaez, the Iran Project Director at The International Crisis Group and former Senior Political Affairs Officer at the U.N., says there is still time—but not much. ""Iran has never been closer to the verge of nuclear weapons,"" Vaez said. ""And restoring the JCPOA is going to become more and more difficult as time passed."" While Vaez notes that having the material to make an explosive isn't the same as having the capability to manufacture a nuclear weapon, he says the U.S. and other agencies have little oversight of those next steps. ""The reality is that we have no visibility over the weaponization part of this,"" he said. Despite the diminishing sunset clauses—expiration dates of provisions in the nuclear agreement—Vaez argues the JCPOA still holds value and is the most straightforward path to curbing Iran. ""The break out time -- if the original deal is restored with all of its thresholds -- will be about six months. But six months is better than six days,"" he said, adding that many key restrictions would remain in place until 2031. ""It basically puts this issue on the back-burner for a long period of time."" But because of the time needed to lock in an agreement, the approaching midterm elections, and the possibility that Democrats may lose control of one or both chambers of Congress, Vaez says if an agreement is going to be reached, it likely needs to happen this month or next. Vaez also warns that failure could spell political disaster for the president if he is blamed for allowing Iran to develop weapons of mass destruction under his watch. ""Six months from now, that breakout time will be really near zero. And so the president will face an impossible choice of either acquiescing to a virtual nuclear weapons state in Iran or taking military action against Iran's nuclear program,"" he said. ""So six months from now, it will be Biden's war or Biden's bomb."" A more dangerous world While the hazards posed by Iran and North Korea are separate from the nuclear threats posed by the Kremlin, Putin's shadow extends far beyond Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""The whole conflict has a nuclear dimension that is going to have an effect on how we deal with Iran and North Korea, with other proliferators"" said John Erath, Senior Policy Director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation and a 30 year veteran of the State Department. ""We need to maintain this idea that Russia should not be allowed to benefit from using nuclear blackmail,"" he added. ""Because what happens when North Korea then says I'm going to nuke the South?"" Bennett adds that if adversaries are allowed to acquire functional nuclear weapons, other countries following suit, like South Korea and Japan. Although these countries are allies to the U.S., more nuclear powers means more opportunity for catastrophic wars and destruction unlike the world has ever seen. ""You have this dynamic going on in the region which is really not what the U.S. wants,"" he said. ""That's a world which we're reluctant to have happen, but we're kind of letting happen.""",7
2022-06-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jan-hearings-target-current-gop-officeholders-trump-note/story?id=85291987,Jan. 6 hearings target current GOP officeholders along with Trump: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein What happened is not solely in the past -- and is not only about former President Donald Trump, either. Thursday's primetime opening by the House Jan. 6 committee targeted Trump directly -- in part by using the words of his family members and close associates to make the case that Trump and those around him knew he lost but fomented violence anyway. Perhaps just as striking was the focus on GOP lawmakers who appear to have enabled and, in many cases, continue to excuse the lawlessness around that horrific day. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., offered the startling revelation that multiple House members reached out to the Trump White House in its final days to request pardons for their roles in trying to overturn the election -- at least a tacit admission that they knew what they had done was wrong. Cheney addressed her fellow Republicans directly: ""There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone. But your dishonor will remain."" Honor as well as political futures are at stake -- not least for Cheney, who is facing a Trump-backed primary opponent later this summer and whose service on the committee continues to leave her colleagues fuming. Then there are the stakes for democracy. Just in the hours leading up to Thursday's hearing, a GOP candidate for governor in Michigan was arrested for alleged participation in the Jan. 6 riot; House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy refused to say whether he believes the 2020 election was stolen; and Trump himself called the Jan. 6 protest ""the greatest movement in the history of our country."" Grabbing the attention of the American public is no small task, for the committee or anyone else in the political arena. But the stakes aren't small either -- and, as Cheney and Chairman Bennie Thompson made clear, aren't solely about the former president's actions or potential future. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Former Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is hitting the campaign trail with Republican Rep. Nancy Mace in the final days before the state's primary on Tuesday. Haley's endorsement puts her, a potential Republican presidential contender, opposite former President Donald Trump, who has endorsed Mace's opponent. ""Nancy Mace is tough as nails,"" Haley said in a campaign ad released last month.""She won this seat from a liberal Democrat and she'll keep it Republican."" Trump endorsed Katie Arrington after Mace blamed him for rhetoric she said caused the Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol. In his endorsement of Arrington, Trump said Mace was ""an absolutely terrible candidate"" and also ""disloyal."" It came in spite of Mace's February social media post that featured a recording of her outside Trump Tower in New York City praising Trump in a plea for support. Mace has the backing of both GOP leadership, such as Reps. Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, and conservative groups, including the NRA and Club for Growth. But it remains to be seen if she'll fend off her Trump-backed challenger. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Michigan's political landscape was rocked by scandal yet again on Thursday, when Republican gubernatorial candidate Ryan Kelley was arrested over his role in the Jan. 6 attack last year. Kelley was taken into custody in Allendale, where he lives, and faces four misdemeanor charges ""stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol breach,"" according to prosecutors, ABC News' Alex Mallin reports. A law enforcement official told ABC News that Kelley was arrested at his home. While court documents do not accuse Kelley of entering the Capitol itself, he is charged with being on restricted grounds, engaging in disorderly conduct and other misdemeanors. The arrest happened the morning before the House committee tasked with investigating the insurrection was set to hold its first public hearing. In a possible preview of how those hearings will play out across party lines, Ron Weiser, who serves as chair of the Michigan Republican Party, issued a politically combative statement in response to the arrest, claiming ""Democrats are weaponizing our justice system in an unprecedented way against their political opponents."" The arrest comes on the heels of additional fallout among candidates in the state's Republican gubernatorial field. Five GOP candidates -- who campaigned in favor of election integrity -- are now blocked from appearing on the ballot after election officials discovered a large number of fraudulent signatures on their nominating petition filings. One of the five candidates, Michael Brown, withdrew from the race last month. Michigan election officials outlined their findings in a report, saying they ""identified 36 petition circulators who submitted fraudulent petition sheets consisting entirely of invalid signatures."" In total, the state bureau of elections estimates ""at least 68,000 invalid signatures [were] submitted across 10 sets of nominating petitions."" Kevin Rinke and Garrett Soldano -- two of the GOP gubernatorial candidates remaining on the ballot -- appeared to express support for Kelley on Thursday. In a tweet, Rinke said he hopes ""that the FBI is acting appropriately, because the timing here raises serious questions."" Meanwhile, Soldano alleged ""the FBI has become an arm of the Democrat Party."" THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-06-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/midterms-historically-bad-presidents-party-now-add-inflation/story?id=85114688,Midterms are historically bad for the president's party. Now add inflation.,"With inflation at a level not seen in four decades and food and energy prices skyrocketing, Americans experienced another blow when the national average price of gas this week reached $5 per gallon. Responding to the news, President Joe Biden once again laid blame on Russia. ""It's outrageous what the war in Ukraine is causing,"" the president said Saturday. The midterm elections are just 150 days away, and the Biden administration is doing everything it can to improve its standing with voters on the economy. The issue is a major risk factor in what would already likley be an uphill battle for the president's party, which tends not to fare well in the midterm cycle regardless of who is in power. All this month, the administration will be making a ""concerted effort"" to talk about its accomplishments to date and plans to tackle inflation, a White House official told reporters. ""The job market is the strongest it's been since World War II,"" Biden said on Friday as he toured the Port of Los Angeles, before adding: ""notwithstanding the inflation."" The president is touting the 390,000 jobs added in May, unemployment dropping to its lowest level in nearly 50 years and a reduction in the deficit. But inflation climbed to 8.6% in May -- a significant increase from 8.3% the month prior -- and the result could spell a political nightmare for Democrats as they aim to maintain their narrow majority in Congress this November. ""It's the exception rather than the rule when the economy isn't a leading election issue, and it certainly is the leading issue this year,"" William Galston, the chair of governance studies at the Brookings Institute, told ABC News. ""Every single poll indicates that it is top of mind for the American people."" In a new ABC News /Ipsos poll, 80% of Americans said inflation is an extremely or very important factor in how they'll cast their ballot this fall. Roughly three-quarters of Americans said the same about gas prices. Biden's approval rating on such issues were low: just 28% approve of his handling of inflation while only 27% approve of his work on gas prices. Such numbers, compounded with the Democrats' historical disadvantage for holding the presidency, could spell trouble for the party. In 1974, with inflation at 12%, Republicans lost 48 seats in Congress. Two years later, President Gerald Ford and his "" Whip Inflation Now"" campaign -- an unsuccessful effort to bring prices down -- also lost at the polls to Jimmy Carter. High inflation persisted through the rest of the decade and early 1980s. Democrats lost 15 seats in the House in 1978 and Republicans lost 26 House seats in 1982. ""I'd say we're in a situation now, where the influence of the economy on the election is similar to what it was in the late 1970s and early 1980s,"" Galston said. ""And I don't think that's a coincidence, because this is the first time in nearly 40 years that inflation has become a central issue for the electorate."" Perception vs. reality The administration's anti-inflation push comes after officials spent much of the past year describing inflation as transitory. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told ABC's ""This Week"" in March 2021 that rising prices only posed a ""small risk"" to the economy. But on CNN earlier this month, Yellen acknowledged she got it ""wrong."" Biden pledged Friday his administration will ""continue to do everything we can to lower"" prices, which he largely blamed on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""I understand Americans are anxious, and they're anxious with good reason,"" he said. ""I was raised in a household when the price of gasoline rose precipitously, it was the discussion at the table. It made a difference when food prices went up."" But experts said there may not be much Biden can do to alleviate inflation. ""This particular economic situation is tricky,"" said Gabriel Lenz, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. ""The best thing the president can do, or the only thing that the president can do, is to try to increase supply of various goods. But the president's ability in the short term to do too much on that front is quite limited."" On reigning in gas prices, Biden is pointing to his administration's two releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But Lenz said that has had little effect on gas prices, which have risen $1.70 since the beginning of the year. The president is also calling on lawmakers to pass legislation to crack down on instances of price gouging and pass other measures to help families like lowering the price of prescription drugs, but that could prove difficult as much of his agenda has been stalled in the 50-50 Senate. The House's Democratic majority overcame some internal opposition to pass legislation this week addressing high gas prices by cracking down on possible price gouging from oil companies. It's unclear whether the bill will in the Senate after all House Republicans opposed it. ""The Congress has to act,"" Biden said on Friday, ""and they have been of late."" But Galston said once inflation strikes, ""the scene of the action shifts away from the president, shifts away from Congress, towards the Federal Reserve Board."" Biden has vowed to let the Federal Reserve operate independently. The board is expected to meet this upcoming week, and raising interest rates again may be on the table. ""Americans should buckle up their seat belts because it's going to be a bumpy ride,"" Galston said. ABC News' Justin Gomez and Lelee Ibssa contributed to this report.",21
2022-06-14,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-court-extends-detention-wnba-star-brittney-griner/story?id=85385157,Russian court extends detention for WNBA star Brittney Griner,"A court in Russia has extended the pre-trial detention for WNBA star Brittney Griner. Griner, who was detained in February, will remain in custody at least through July 2, according to Russian state media outlet TASS. The 31-year-old was taken into custody at Sheremetyevo International Airport, near Moscow, on Feb. 17 after officials allegedly found vape cartridges with hashish oil in her bag. Hasish oil is illegal to possess in Russia. Her detention was extended for another 18 days at ""the request of the investigation,"" according to a representative from the Khimki Court of the Moscow Region, per TASS. Griner has been detained in a Russian prison for 117 days, more than three months. She was visiting Russia in February to play basketball for the Russian Premier League team UMMC Ekaterinburg during the offseason when she was arrested at Sheremetyevo International Airport near Moscow for allegedly having vape cartridges in her luggage that contained hashish oil -- an illegal substance in Russia. She was charged with ""large-scale transportation of drugs"" and could face up to 10 years in prison, according to The New York Times. The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained"" in Russia, which means that the U.S. would work to negotiate her release. “Our position for some time on this has been very clear. Brittney Griner should not be detained. She should not be detained for a single day longer,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Tuesday. Price said that based on his understanding, no American diplomats were able to gain access to Griner amid news of the extension. He added that the State Department continues to work to gain regular access to U.S. detainees in Russia, including Griner and Paul Whelan, who has been in a Russian prison since 2018. Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, told ""GMA"" co-anchor Robin Roberts last month that the support her wife has received from the league has brought the WNBA star ""comfort"" amid her detention. The WNBA, which kicked off its 2022 season on May 6, is honoring Griner with a floor decal bearing her initials and jersey number (No. 42) on the sideline of all 12 WNBA courts. ""Things like that matter, like, it has her hopeful,"" Cherelle Griner told Roberts. ""It lets her know she's not forgotten."" ""Those small moments, I know, give her some type of hope,"" she added. The 6-foot-9 center won an NCAA title at Baylor in 2012; a WNBA title with Phoenix, her current team, in 2014; and gold medals with the U.S. women's team at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. Russia's invasion of Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained on Feb. 17. Some officials are concerned that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing conflict. Cherelle Griner said that she would like to speak with President Joe Biden. ""I just keep hearing that, you know, he has the power. She's a political pawn,"" she said. ""So if they're holding her because they want you to do something, then I want you to do it."" Price said last month that a U.S. consular officer was able to meet with Griner on May 19. Price said the officer ""found her continuing to do as well as could be expected under these exceedingly challenging circumstances."" ""But again, our message is a clear and simple one -- we continue to insist that Russia allow consistent and timely consular access to all U.S. citizen detainees,"" he added. ""One-off visits are not sufficient, and we will continue to call on Moscow to uphold its commitments under the Vienna Convention for consistent and timely access, as well."" The Phoenix Mercury said Monday the team and coaching staff had met with State Department officials and Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, and Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., while they were in Washington, D.C. ""We’re here to do whatever we can to amplify and keep BG at the forefront, which is more important than any basketball game and anything else that’s going on in our lives,"" Mercury star and longtime teammate Diana Taurasi said in a statement following the meetings. ""We want BG to come home as soon as possible, it’s number one on our list."" Cherelle Griner said she hadn't spoken to Brittney since just after her arrest since her cellphone was confiscated, but she has corresponded in a few letters. ""Every single day matters for me to be sound, for me to be alert, for me to be attentive, to make sure that she comes back,"" she told ""Good Morning America"" in late May.

2022-06-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/911-families-respond-biden-saudi-arabia-trip-empathy/story?id=85390242,9/11 families respond to Biden Saudi Arabia trip: 'Empathy is not enough',"A coalition of families and survivors of the Sept. 11 attacks on Tuesday urged President Joe Biden, during his visit to Saudi Arabia next month, to hold the kingdom accountable for its role in the terrorist strike that killed almost 3,000 people. “We appreciate the president’s commitment to do everything he can to support the 9/11 family community, but empathy is not enough,"" Terry Strada, the national chair of ""9/11 Families United,"" said in a statement. ""President Biden must do what past presidents have not, which is to demand transparency from Saudi Arabia and accountability for those who supported al Qaeda and the hijackers who murdered our loved ones."" The White House said Tuesday Biden would travel to Saudi Arabia next month for a summit of Arab leaders. The visit will include a meeting with Saudi Arabia's King Salman, as well as with the effective leader of the country, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to White House officials. Strada was responding to a comment by White House spokesman John Kirby during an interview with CNN earlier in the day. “What I can tell you is that the president will never shy away of representing the interests of the American people on a national security level wherever he goes,” Kirby said, when asked if he could assure the victims' families that Biden would address some of their concerns with Mohammed. ""He continues to do everything he can to support the families of the victims of 9/11,"" Kirby added. ""He knows what a devastating grief they still endure, and he will not shy away from representing them and their concerns.” A White House spokesperson told ABC News that ""our hearts are always with the 9/11 survivors and families who are suffering"" and noted the president has taken steps toward accountability. ""President Biden made a commitment to ensuring the maximum degree of transparency under the law and to assist these families in their work to seek full accountability regarding the declassification of 9/11 documents,"" the spokesperson said, pointing to an executive order Biden signed that required certain federal agencies to review classified documents related to Sept. 11; that action has resulted in the declassification and release of thousands of pages of documents since he took office. Biden has come under intense criticism for agreeing to meet with Mohammed, whom the U.S. has assessed ordered the operation that murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. As a candidate, Biden pledged to make Saudi Arabia a ""pariah"" over its human rights abuses. But the president has also struggled to rein in sky-high inflation. While many ways out of his control, the rapidly rising cost of goods is weighing on Americans' wallets and proving to be a major political liability for Biden and Democrats heading into this fall's midterm elections. Biden is seeking ways to relieve high gas prices, which have in large part been pushed higher by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on Moscow's oil and gas sector. A major oil producer, Saudi Arabia chairs the Gulf Cooperation Council grouping of oil-producing Arab nations. The White House has welcomed increased oil production with the hope it would drive down gas prices in the U.S. Biden authorized a historic release of oil from the nation's strategic reserve of petroleum, and his White House welcomed a decision by the OPEC+ oil cartel to boost its production levels. While Saudi Arabia and the Biden administration have both said energy security will be part of Biden's discussions during his visit, the White House has sought to avoid the negative optics of an American president flying to Saudi Arabia in a bid for more oil. ""Of course, he will be -- they will discuss energy with the Saudi government,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday. ""I think what I'm trying to say is to look at this trip as it being only about oil is not -- it would be simply wrong to do that."" The president had even danced around whether he was even going to go to Saudi Arabia at all; ""I have no direct plans at the moment,"" he said on June 3, after multiple reports said he planned to travel there. But while Biden once pledged to isolate Saudi Arabia, Jean-Pierre said Tuesday he was ""not looking to rupture relationships."" Asked if Biden would bring up Khashoggi during his meeting with the crown prince, Jean-Pierre would not directly answer. ""Human rights is always part of the conversation in our foreign engagements,"" she told reporters on Air Force One, en route to Philadelphia. ""So, that will always be the case."" Biden will also travel to Israel and the West Bank during the trip, which will take place July 13 to 16, according to the White House.",15
2022-06-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-exits-dc-hotel-celebrity-chef-jos-andrs/story?id=85384768,"After Trump exits D.C. hotel, celebrity chef José Andrés returns with new restaurant","Celebrity chef José Andrés on Monday announced plans to open a restaurant in the Old Post Office, the Washington landmark which recently reopened as the Waldorf Astoria Washington D.C. after operating for five years as the Trump International Hotel. ""People of DC big news! Today after a dream of 30 years I'm announcing we will open @bazaarbyjose in the Old Post Office!"" Andrés tweeted. ""Building longer tables in the heart of our nation's capital, welcoming people from across the city & the world."" The new restaurant follows Donald Trump's company agreeing to sell its hotel lease in May. It's not the first time Andrés has planned to have a location in the complex -- or the first time his career overlapped with Trump. According to The Washington Post, Andrés was in progress on the $7 million Topo Atrio, at Trump International, when Trump launched his 2016 presidential candidacy. The chef split with Trump after the latter, then a businessman and reality TV show host, announced his campaign at an event in New York where he notoriously disparaged some immigrants. Andrés subsequently sought to exit their partnership and a legal battle ensued. (It was settled in 2017.) The chef went on to repeatedly, publicly criticize Trump-the-politician, tweeting in 2017 that Trump's continued behavior only reaffirmed his decision to pull out of the hotel partnership. The forthcoming eatery, The Bazaar by José Andrés, has locations in Chicago, Miami's South Beach and in Las Vegas. It offers a ""vibrant mix of sophisticated cuisine"" and ""playful lounge spaces,"" according to the restaurant's Twitter. A hotel spokesperson told ABC News they ""look forward to sharing more details about new partnerships in the coming months"" but that ""with a long history of innovation across the culinary industry, Waldorf Astoria creates iconic, award-winning dining experiences at its landmark locations worldwide. We are continuing that tradition with exciting food and beverage concepts at our newest hotel."" In a video Andrés -- whose humanitarian organization World Central Kitchen is also working to provide meals to Ukrainians during the Russian invasion -- tweeted with his announcement on Monday, he took in the historic bells of the Old Post Office ringing in the background. ""For whom the bells toll?"" he asked. ""Well, for a new restaurant by José Andrés at the Old Post Office.""",17
2022-06-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fired-biden-blames-republicans-blocking-plan-fight-inflation/story?id=85386153,Fired-up Biden blames Republicans for blocking his plan to fight inflation,"President Joe Biden delivered fired-up remarks on the economy before a friendly, cheering audience of union workers in Philadelphia Tuesday -- nodding to inflation, high food and gas prices, and his plans to try to ease the economic pressures American families are facing. Shouting at times, receiving standing ovations, and delivering plenty of classic ""Bidenisms,"" the president spoke about the economy to a convention of the AFL-CIO federation of labor unions -- and acknowledged the record-high inflation rates his administration is trying to combat. ""Jobs are back, but prices are still too high,"" Biden conceded, arguing Republicans are blocking him from carrying out his plan to bring down costs. ""COVID is down, but gas prices are up. Our work isn't done."" High inflation is a major political liability for Biden, who blamed Republicans for blocking a lot of his ideas to lower prices for Americans. During his campaign-like speech, he heavily praised organized labor -- and delivered a midterm message. ""You're a gigantic reason why I'm standing here,"" Biden told the crowd. ""Standing here today as your president. I really mean it."" While Biden focused his message on the economy, he did not address inflation until well into his speech, and when he did, he reiterated how his personal experience with inflation gave him an understanding of what families are facing. ""Republicans in Congress are doing everything they can to stop my plans to bring down costs on ordinary families. That's why my plan is not finished and why the results aren't finished either,"" Biden argued. The president pointed to his efforts to bring down prices at the pump in particular by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to get more oil to market, but noted the entire world is facing high inflation, and that in the United States, ""It's sapping the strength of a lot of families."" Biden also went into more detail than usual about the food crisis stemming from the war in Ukraine, saying, part of his plan to help bring down food costs included the U.S. working to get Ukrainian grain out of the country and to the global markets. He acknowledged the complicating factors involved in doing so, particularly because of the differences between Ukraine's rails and the rest of Europe. ""We're going to build silos, temporary silos in the borders of Ukraine, including in Poland, so we can transfer it from those cars into those silos into cars in Europe and get it out to the ocean and get it across the world,"" Biden pledged, but conceded, ""it's taking time."" With the midterm elections just a few months away, Biden used his remarks to also deliver a message to voters -- trying to draw contrast between his party and Republicans on the economy, despite the dreary headlines his administration has been facing. ""Our work isn't done but here's the deal. America still has a choice to make. A choice between a government by the few for the few or a government for all of us. Democracy for all of us, an economy where all of us have a fair shot and a chance to earn our place in the economy,"" Biden pitched to the crowd. The president, who had prided himself on bipartisanship, said he is under no ""illusions"" when it comes to the Republican party today, hitting Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott's tax proposal in his remarks. ""The fact is Republicans in Congress are still in the grip of the 'ultra-MAGA' agenda. And they still refuse to consider any part of the Trump tax cuts, which delivered a massive windfall to billionaires and others. And they weren't paid for,"" Biden said. ""They still refuse to consider a minimum corporate tax of 15%, minimum tax,"" he said. ""They seem to think that the problem in America today is the working families aren't paying enough."" He also delivered messages of support for two midterm candidates in particular: Pennsylvania Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia, Stacey Abrams. Biden said he held a Zoom call on Monday with Fetterman, who is running for Senate in Pennsylvania and recently suffered a stroke, telling the crowd Fetterman was ""looking good"" and ""can't wait to get back on the trail"" -- adding a joke about Fetterman's size. ""If you're in a foxhole, you want John with you man,"" Biden said. ""I know he can't wait to get back on the trail. He's looking good. He's no bigger, stronger voice for working people in this state than John. Certainly no bigger one, for that matter."" He also called on the union members to support Abrams, who he said was in attendance. ""I gotta ask y'all a favor: Help her in Georgia. Help Stacey Abrams in Georgia,"" he said. ""There's three things I learned about her early on. One, she's loyal. Two, she's capable. And three, she's smarter than me. She knows what she's doing. So folks, please help her out."" Speaking before the union crowd, Biden said ""nothing had made me prouder than that"" to be called ""the most pro-union president in history"" by the AFL-CIO'S leadership. ""I promised you I would be, and I commit to you as long as I have this job I will remain that,"" Biden said. The president also called on Congress to pass the PRO Act, which would expand labor protections and the right to organize. He touted his accomplishments, including the infrastructure bill, the millions of jobs created during his time in office, and how American families are carrying less debt and have more savings. ""I love these guys talking about why these guys left my employment, went to another job,"" Biden said. ""Because he got paid more! Isn't that awful, isn't that a shame that they gotta compete for labor. Better paying jobs, for better jobs for them and their families. It's been a long time since that's happened in this country, but it's happening now."" He contrasted himself with his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, and the poor state of the economy in 2020. ""I promise you, I'm going to keep fighting for you,"" Biden shouted, to loud cheers. ""Are you prepared to fight with me?""",7
2022-06-16,https://abcnews.go.com/International/malnutrition-animal-attacks-horn-africa-experiences-severe-drought/story?id=85436833,"Malnutrition, animal attacks on the rise as Horn of Africa experiences severe drought","LONDON -- An estimated 185,000 children in eastern Ethiopia are suffering from severe malnutrition as the region experiences a “once-in-a-lifetime” drought, the charity Save the Children said on Thursday. UNICEF previously warned of an “explosion of child deaths” in the Horn of Africa without immediate action, with over 1.7 million children across Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia in need for treatment for severe acute malnutrition. Experts have said that climate change has intersected with man-made crises to worsen the famine, withrecent fighting in Ethiopia and the disruption to global food supplies brought by the war in Ukraine exacerbating the situation. Earlier this month, UNICEF’s deputy regional director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Rania Dagash, made a desperate plea to the international community to intervene. “[I]f the world does not widen its gaze from the war in Ukraine and act immediately, an explosion of child deaths is about to happen in the Horn of Africa,” she said. “Four rainy seasons have failed in the space of two years – killing crops and livestock and drying up water sources. Forecasts suggest the next October to December rains are likely to fail too.” In a new report, Save the Children warned that the situation is set to worsen over the coming months as food prices continue to rise. The unprecedented conditions have also led to a change in animal behaviors, the charity said, as desperate monkeys and warthogs are encroaching on human communities in search of food and water. In the Shabelle zone of the Somali region, families have reported witnessing monkeys attacking children out of desperation. “We have been receiving reports that many families have had to fend off hungry monkeys with sticks,” Abdirizak Ahmed, Save the Children’s area operation manager in the east of Ethiopia, said. “The monkeys never normally attack people, but the situation is so terrible that they are resorting to unnatural behavior like this especially in Dawa and Shebelle areas, the first areas affected by the drought and the driest. We understand the children were unharmed, but it's filled people with fear about what the future will bring.” Twenty-three million people are experiencing extreme hunger across Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, Save the Children said. The charity is urgently calling for donors to help avert the humanitarian crisis. “Children – especially small children – are bearing the brunt of a harrowing and multifaceted crisis in Ethiopia,” said Xavier Joubert, Save the Children’s director in Ethiopia. “A prolonged, expanding, and debilitating drought is grinding away at their resilience, already worn down by a grueling conflict and two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.”",25
2022-06-16,https://abcnews.go.com/International/families-waiting-word-americans-missing-ukraine/story?id=85437322,Families waiting for word on Americans reported missing in Ukraine,"Family members are desperately waiting for word after two Americans who volunteered to assist Ukrainian forces have gone missing amid unconfirmed reports of their capture. U.S. officials revealed they're also aware of a third American who has been reported missing during the war. U.S. lawmakers said Wednesday they have been asked by the families of the former service members from Alabama -- Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh -- for their help in locating them. A photo that appears to show both men with their hands behind their backs also started circulating online Thursday. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., said in a statement her office is helping a family locate Drueke, 39, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. ""Earlier this week, the mother of Alexander Drueke, a Tuscaloosa Army Veteran who volunteered to assist the Ukrainian Army in combating Russia, reached out to my office after losing contact with her son. According to his family, they have not heard from Drueke in several days,"" she said in a statement. Sewell said her office has been in contact with the State Department, the FBI and other members of the Alabama Congressional delegation. Drueke, an Army veteran, reportedly went to Ukraine in mid-April to volunteer to help train the Ukrainian forces, his mother, Lois ""Bunny"" Drueke, told ""Good Morning America."" ""He wanted to go over and help train the Ukrainian soldiers and show them how to use the equipment that the U.S. has been sending over there for them,"" she said. Drueke was a chemical operations specialist in the Army Reserve from 2002 to 2014 and held the rank of staff sergeant at the end of his service, an Army official confirmed to ABC News. He was deployed to Kuwait from December 2004 to December 2005 and to Iraq from November 2008 to July 2009, the official said. Lois Drueke said she last heard from her son in a text message on June 8. ""He said that he was going dark for a day or possibly two. And I responded to stay safe, that I loved him and he responded, 'Yes, ma'am. I love you too,'"" she said. ""And that was my last communication with him."" She said he was with Huynh at the time, whom he had met since going to Ukraine, and there are unverified reports that they may have been captured by Russian forces. His family also acknowledged the newly circulating photo that appears to show Drueke and Huynh. ""Our contact at the State Department is aware of possible photographic evidence of Alex's and Andy's capture circulating on Russian media,"" the Drueke family said in a statement to ABC News. ""They are working to verify it. We are very hopeful."" Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., said his office is helping in the search for Huynh, 27, of Trinity, Alabama, after his family reached out to the congressman's office this week. ""According to Huynh's family, they have not been in contact with him since June 8, 2022, when he was in the Kharkiv area of Ukraine,"" he said in a statement. Aderholt said his office has reached out to the State Department and FBI to ""get any information possible."" Huynh, a former Marine, spoke to Huntsville, Alabama, ABC affiliate WAAY in early April about his decision to help defend Ukraine. ""I've made peace with the decision. I know there's a potential of me dying. I'm willing to give my life for what I believe is right,"" he told the station. Huynh served in the Marines from 2014 to 2018, reaching the rank of corporal, a Marine Corps spokesperson confirmed to ABC News. He got engaged in March, before he left for Ukraine the following month. ""We just really want him back,"" his fiancée, Joy Black, told ""Good Morning America"" through tears. ""He's got such a big heart. He knew this wasn't the easy thing, but this was the right thing."" ""Even though not great things have happened I'm still really, really proud of him,"" she continued. White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he ""can't confirm the reports"" of two Americans captured in Ukraine. ""We'll do the best we can to monitor this and see what we can learn about it,"" he said. ""Obviously, if it's true, we'll do everything we can to get them safely back home."" The State Department also is aware of the ""unconfirmed"" reports, a spokesperson said. ""We are limited in terms of what we know at the moment,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters Thursday. ""We're closely monitoring the situation, we are in contact with Ukrainian authorities, as well as with the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the families of the two reported missing U.S. citizens."" Price said the State Department had not had any direct communication with Russia concerning the whereabouts of the two men. ""If we feel that such outreach through our embassy in Moscow or otherwise would be productive in terms of finding out more information on the whereabouts of these individuals, we won't hesitate to do that,"" he said, adding that the department had not ""seen anything from the Russians indicating that two such individuals are in their custody."" Price said the department is also aware of a third, unidentified American who reportedly traveled to Ukraine to fight and whose ""whereabouts are unknown."" ""Similarly, our understanding was that this individual had traveled to Ukraine to take up arms,"" Price said, adding that the person was identified as missing ""in recent weeks"" and that the State Department was also in contact with their family. The State Department has warned U.S. citizens against traveling to Ukraine during the war and that Russian security officials could be ""singling out"" U.S. citizens. When asked about Drueke and Huynh earlier Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that he did not have any information on the missing men. ""Perhaps the Defense Ministry has some information, but I don't,"" Peskov said at a press briefing.

2022-06-18,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-outlets-share-videos-claiming-show-americans-reported/story?id=85469521,Russian outlets share videos claiming to show 2 Americans reported missing in Ukraine,"Russian state-controlled news outlets released videos Friday that they claim show two Americans who have been reported missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, both former service members from Alabama, volunteered to assist Ukrainian forces in the war against Russia, U.S. officials and their families said. They both have not been heard from since June 8, when they were in the Kharkiv area of Ukraine, their families said. On Friday, state-controlled paper Izvestia released a 37-second video that it said depicts Huynh. In it, he can be heard delivering a pro-Russian statement while a Russian translation plays over the footage. Russian state-controlled outlet RT also has released footage of an interview it said is with Huynh. A journalist from RT posted a 10-second video that he said shows Drueke, during which he can be heard addressing his mother directly to the camera. ""I hope to be back home as soon as I can,"" he said while wearing fatigues and sitting in what appears to be an office. In an article on its website, RT said its interviews with Huynh and Drueke were conducted on Thursday in a detention center in the Donbas region of Ukraine. The videos come a day after a photo that appears to show both men with their hands behind their backs started circulating online. The U.S. State Department is aware of the photo and videos of the two U.S. citizens ""reportedly captured by Russia's military forces in Ukraine,"" a spokesperson said Friday. The former service members have been in Ukraine since April and met while in the country, their families said. Drueke, an Army veteran, wanted to help train the Ukrainian forces, his mother, Lois ""Bunny"" Drueke, told ""Good Morning America."" ""He wanted to go over and help train the Ukrainian soldiers and show them how to use the equipment that the U.S. has been sending over there for them,"" she said. She said she last heard from her son in a text message on June 8. He said he was with Huynh at the time, and there were unverified reports that they may have been captured by Russian forces, she said. Huynh, a former Marine who reached the rank of corporal, went to help defend Ukraine during the war, his fiancée, Joy Black, told ""Good Morning America."" ""We just really want him back,"" Black said through tears. ""He's got such a big heart. He knew this wasn't the easy thing, but this was the right thing."" Two Alabama lawmakers said Wednesday they have been asked by the men's families for their help in locating them. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., said his office has reached out to the State Department and FBI to ""get any information possible"" about Huynh's whereabouts after his family reached out to the congressman's office this week. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., said her office has been in contact with the State Department, the FBI and other members of the Alabama Congressional delegation after Drueke's family contacted her for help this week after losing contact with him for several days. Drueke's family also said it was aware of the newly circulating photo that appears to show the missing men. ""Our contact at the State Department is aware of possible photographic evidence of Alex's and Andy's capture circulating on Russian media,"" the Drueke family said in a statement to ABC News. ""They are working to verify it. We are very hopeful."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday that he did not have any information on the missing men when asked about Drueke and Huynh. The State Department said is it constrained in discussing the matter due to privacy concerns. ""We are limited in terms of what we know at the moment,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters Thursday. ""We're closely monitoring the situation, we are in contact with Ukrainian authorities, as well as with the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the families of the two reported missing U.S. citizens."" Price said the State Department had not had any direct communication with Russia concerning the whereabouts of the two men. ""If we feel that such outreach through our embassy in Moscow or otherwise would be productive in terms of finding out more information on the whereabouts of these individuals, we won't hesitate to do that,"" he said. Price said the department is also aware of a third, unidentified American who reportedly traveled to Ukraine to fight and whose ""whereabouts are unknown."" ""Similarly, our understanding was that this individual had traveled to Ukraine to take up arms,"" Price said, adding that the person was identified as missing ""in recent weeks"" and that the State Department was also in contact with their family. A family spokesperson told ABC News that the missing American is retired Marine captain Grady Kurpasi, who served 12 years in the Marine Corps. ""We have had just as many leads pointing to the direction that he may not be alive anymore, and we've had just as many leads point to the direction that he's a P.O.W.,"" the family's spokesperson, Don Turner, told ABC News. Kurpasi's wife, Soohee Kim, told ABC News her husband left Wilmington, North Carolina, on March 7 bound for Ukraine and she last heard from him in late April. She said that she has been in regular contact with the State Department and hears from them almost daily. Turner said they're not going to quit searching for him. ""Marines don't leave anyone behind,"" Turner said. ""Right now, he's not been left behind because we're still trying to find him."" The State Department has warned U.S. citizens against traveling to Ukraine during the war and that Russian security officials could be ""singling out"" U.S. citizens.

2022-06-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-pilots-flew-secret-aid-missions-azovstal-plant/story?id=85381756,Ukrainian pilots flew secret aid missions to Azovstal plant during Mariupol siege,"KYIV, Ukraine -- It was a dark night when Oleksandr, a 51-year-old pilot, was set to fly to Mariupol. ""I have more than 30 years of experience. But this was the most difficult flight in my career,"" he said of the mission he flew on April 4, more than a month into the Russian siege of Mariupol. The Azovstal steel plant was at the time the city's last stronghold for the Ukrainian troops, including many who were severely wounded, as well as hundreds of civilians who were sheltering there. While the Ukrainian authorities tried to negotiate with the Russian side to evacuate the plant, Ukraine's military intelligence secretly organized aid deliveries. The mission was offered to several pilots. ""We could refuse, but my crew didn't,"" said Oleksandr, who spoke to ABC News wearing a mask. ""We knew there are our people in Mariupol and we have to help them."" The task was to deliver around 2 tons of aid from Dnipro, about 150 miles north of Mariupol, and evacuate the wounded from the plant. Having the latest intelligence, the crew designed a route to the besieged city to bypass the Russian air-defense system. It was a just another landing-and-cargo operation, Volodymyr, a 27-year-old navigator joked, although they knew that a previous mission had failed and their colleagues had died. (The navigator also spoke to ABC News while wearing a mask. Volodymyr is a family name, used here to obscure his identity.) Two helicopters flew at around 130 miles per hour at a super-low altitude of three to five meters to stay invisible to the enemy, the pilot and navigator said. ""We had to fly over the power lines sometimes, and that was a risky maneuver given the speed,"" the pilot said. The road to the plant was rather calm, he said. Then the helicopter landed at the plant. ""We stayed in our places, while the cargo was taken and the wounded were loaded. It lasted only 20 minutes but felt like two hours. It was so scary,"" Oleksandr said. They heard and saw explosions all around them, they said. The helicopter was shaking. ""When we took off I noticed a Russian ship in the sea and understood that they could now hit us. But my hands did the job before my brain realized how dangerous it was,"" the pilot said. The helicopter continued the daring ride and safely landed in Dnipro at dawn. ""I turned around to the guys we evacuated. And I saw so much gratitude in their eyes,"" he said. ""We had only 15 minutes to talk, I found out that some of them were married, one soldier's wife was pregnant and he said he was so much looking forward to seeing her… Unforgettable moment."" According to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, there were seven such missions to Azovstal during the Russian siege. Some pilots never returned, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later told the media. One of Oleksandr's friends was among those who went missing ""We were on our way back from Mariupol,"" he said. ""And I heard the pilot of the second crew saying they are seven kilometers from the contact line and have only 250 liters of fuel left. That's three times less than we had, so I presumed that their helicopter was damaged. That was the last phrase I heard from my friend."" They later found the crashed helicopter, but there were no bodies in or around it, he said. ""That's why we still hope they are alive,"" Oleksandr said. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the Azovstal surrendered in mid-May. Ukrainian officials said the order was given to save the lives of the troops, who are now supposed to be exchanged. Both the pilot and navigator who spoke to ABC News declined to make any judgements about the surrender. It probably had to be done, they said. But if they were again asked to carry that risky mission, they would probably do it, Volodymyr, the navigator, said. ""That flight changed me, I now appreciate life more,"" he said. ""But If I were told that I'm the only one who can do that I would accept the challenge.""",22
2022-06-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-georgia-failures-highlight-gops-jan-dilemma-note/story?id=85509205,Trump’s Georgia failures highlight GOP’s Jan. 6 dilemma: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Tuesday is runoff day for voters in Georgia -- though notably not for the two highest-profile races where former President Donald Trump tried and failed to defeat incumbents. Tuesday will also showcase another time where Trump tried but failed to exert his influence among Georgia Republicans. The next hearing of the House Jan. 6 committee will examine Trump's efforts to pressure lawmakers to overturn the 2020 presidential election -- including the infamous phone call where he implored Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to help ""find"" the votes he needed to win the state. As the recording of the Jan. 2, 2021, call made clear, Trump warned Raffensperger that he appeared to be committing a ""criminal offense"" by not reporting potential election irregularities. But authorities in Georgia have been working to establish whether it was Trump and others around him who may have committed a crime. Jan. 6 committee members say Tuesday will also shed light on Trump's efforts to get states to name alternate slates of electors -- which would have been key to securing the presidency for Trump after the Jan. 6 attack, if then-Vice President Mike Pence went along with Trump's plan. Trump has offered a prebuttal to the committee, with a series of statements where he said he always ""felt"" the election was stolen from him -- suggesting his efforts were within the bounds of appropriate conduct. He also said his call with Raffensperger was ""absolutely PERFECT and appropriate""; Raffensperger is expected to disagree with that assessment when he testifies Tuesday. Raffensperger and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp both survived primary challengers from election-denying, Trump-endorsed candidates last month. But the ""big lie"" retains a strong appeal in GOP primaries, as other races Tuesday in Georgia, Alabama and Virginia are likely to make clear. Trump's efforts to overturn the election he lost have long mattered politically. The question now for authorities in Georgia and Washington is whether they should matter legally as well. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Tuesday marks a deadline for Senate negotiators to deliver the details of proposed gun reforms. The ongoing, sensitive deliberations could only be complicated by external pressures. The fraught nature of engaging in these talks as a conservative was on full display in Texas last week when Sen. John Cornyn, who is the lead Republican negotiator, was both audibly booed and formally rebuked by his party in his home state. ""We reject the so called 'bipartisan gun agreement,' and we rebuke Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), 1600 Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lindsey Graham 1601 (R-S.C.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.),"" the Texas Republican Party said in a resolution adopted at its convention on Saturday. While the pending gun package won't be all that Democrats want, which the White House acknowledges, administration officials view it as an opportunity to make the most significant legislative move on guns since the federal assault weapons ban in 1994. Additional reforms can be taken up later, an administration official told ABC News. Biden himself expressed optimism Monday. He told reporters he was confident that ""there's a serious, serious negotiation that's getting close to becoming fruition."" The goal, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, is to have a deal done before the chamber's two-week July 4 recess. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The runoff in Alabama's Republican Senate primary is set to conclude Tuesday with unique positioning for both candidates -- each of whom has been able to claim having former President Trump's endorsement at some point in the cycle. Rep. Mo Brooks spoke at the rally preceding the Jan. 6 insurrection on the Capitol and remains one of the most vocal election deniers in Congress. He was also among the first endorsements Trump issued post-presidency. But months before the May 24 primary election, the six-term congressman lost that endorsement when Trump accused Brooks of going ""woke"" for making comments that voters should move past 2020 election fallout and that there was no way to have legally reinstated Trump. In rescinding his endorsement, Trump also took a Trump-like swipe at Brooks' standing in the polls. The deeply red political landscape of Alabama made Trump's change of heart perilous for Brooks' candidacy, leading him to make a public appeal for Trump to re-endorse him earlier this month. In a tweet outlining his case, Brooks laid blame squarely on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, saying, ""I had President Trump's endorsement at the beginning, but then Mitch McConnell spent millions on TV attacking me. At that time, it looked like our campaign was going nowhere, and sadly, President Trump pulled his endorsement."" Trump ignored that request and pivoted to endorsing Brooks' chief opponent, Katie Britt, a few days later. The first half of his new endorsement fixated on blasting Brooks again before praising Britt as ""a fearless America First Warrior"" and distancing her from political allegiance to McConnell. Britt, a former chief of staff to retiring Sen. Richard Shelby, led Brooks by double digits in the primary election, earning 45% of the vote to his 29%. Tuesday's winner will face off with Democratic candidate Will Boyd, a reverend and previous Senate hopeful, in November. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 8. That's the number of key races to watch in Alabama, Georgia and Virginia on Tuesday night. And as FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich writes, Tuesday will once again be a test for Trump, especially in Georgia where two of his endorsees face close House runoffs.

2022-06-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/2nd-american-confirmed-dead-ukraine/story?id=85527627,2nd American confirmed dead in Ukraine,"U.S. citizen Stephen Zabielski has died in Ukraine, the State Department confirmed to ABC News Tuesday morning. Zabielski was a 52-year-old U.S. Army veteran. His death was first reported by Rolling Stone. According to an obituary posted online by his family, Zabielski died on May 15 while fighting near a village called Dorozhniank. ""We can confirm the death of U.S. citizen Stephen Zabielski in Ukraine. We have been in touch with the family and have provided all possible consular assistance,"" a state department spokesperson told ABC News. The State Department also said U.S. citizens should not travel to Ukraine because of the ongoing war and due to Russian government security officials singling out U.S. citizens in Ukraine. Americans in Ukraine should depart immediately if safe to do so, the State Department said. Willy Joseph Cancel, a 22-year-old former U.S. Marine, was killed in Ukraine in April while fighting aside Ukrainian forces. He was the first American to be reported killed in Ukraine. Two U.S. citizens have been reportedly captured by Russian soldiers in the conflict zone in Donbas. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he did not know their whereabouts, in a press briefing. Peskov said they were mercenaries who made attempts on the lives of Russian service members. They are charged with mercenary practices, he said. ""The Geneva Convention absolutely does not apply to them. Their crimes must be investigated, and they must stand trial,"" Peskov said. As to whether the two Americans were facing the death penalty, Peskov said, ""Yes, we do not rule out anything, because this is a decision to be made by a court, we never comment and, above all, have no right to intervene in court rulings.""",20
2022-06-23,https://abcnews.go.com/US/increased-threat-foreign-terrorists-election-influence-operations-2022/story?id=85598905,"'Increased threat' of foreign terrorists, election influence operations in 2022: DHS","The Department of Homeland Security recently warned that the threat from foreign terrorist organizations and cyberthreat from adversaries like Russia, including election interference, will likely increase in 2022 according to an intelligence analysis obtained by ABC News. The document, titled ""Key Threats to the Homeland in 2022"" and dated June 8, asserts that the greatest threat to the United States this year comes from lone wolf actors and small groups of individuals motived by a cadre of extremist beliefs like the alleged shooter in Buffalo, New York who is currently facing hate crimes charges for killing 10 African-American shoppers at a grocery store. Federal law enforcement agencies including the DHS and Justice Department have previously prioritized combatting domestic violent extremism since the start of the Biden administration. But DHS also warned about the potential for a resurgence of foreign terrorism due to the relaxing pandemic travel restrictions and said they will be ""highly visible"" online -- focused on messaging inspiring homegrown terrorism. ""Foreign terrorists probably will continue to hone their abilities to facilitate international travel, expand their networks, raise funds, and organize, ultimately to improve their ability to target the United States and the Homeland,"" the bulletin says. ""While some travel was very likely curtailed by COVID-19 travel restrictions, we anticipate an increased threat from these actors in 2022 as travel restrictions are relaxed."" Some with terrorist connections may seek to travel to the United States and apply for tourist visas, DHS says. ""What this assessment reinforces is other intelligence indicating that the U.S. continues to experience unacceptable levels of violence by individuals inspired by extremist content promoted online by a diverse array of foreign and domestic threat actors,"" said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. ""Law enforcement officials are particularly concerned about the potential for targeted acts of violence directed at law enforcement, election, other elected officials due to increase calls for violence by domestic violent extremists."" Threats to the nation's cyberspace stem from three countries according to DHS: China, Russia and Iran, according to the assessment. Russia will continue to target U.S. critical infrastructure through various cyberattacks and sow discord in the country as it has in previous elections, according to DHS, in some cases leveraging emerging technology like artificial intelligence. ""Russian malign influence actors likely will attempt to dissuade U.S. voters from participating in the 2022 midterm elections using similar tactics employed during the 2020 and 2016 presidential elections, such as targeting audiences with false information about voting logistics, exacerbating racial tensions, and levying attacks or praise on candidates from either political party,"" the memo said. ""Russia probably could use emerging technologies to enhance its cyber and malign influence efforts when attempting to affect the outcome of U.S. elections. For instance, advancements in artificial intelligence allow for automated data analysis, classification, creation, and manipulation of digital content, which could be deployed in future foreign malign influence and disinformation campaigns."" Russia, according to the Department, embeds intelligence officers ""to establish front companies and recruit Russian emigres and American citizens to steal sensitive US academic, government, and business information."" ""It is a threat environment in which a diverse array of foreign and domestic threat actors use internet-based communication platforms to spread content intended to sow discord, inspire violence, undermine confidence in government institutions and achieve other illicit objectives,"" Cohen, the ABC News contributor, said. Chinese state-sponsored actors ""aggressively target U.S. political, economic, military, educational, and critical infrastructure personnel and organizations to steal sensitive data, key technologies, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information."" The department assessed that PRC-sponsored hacking compromised at least 30,000 organizations by exploiting an an email server, DHS says. ""We assess that the PRC will seek to engage in a range of activities to support policies favorable to Beijing and its interests and will likely prioritize messaging against US audiences in the run-up to midterm elections to influence political outcomes favorable to Beijing,"" DHS says. The malign influence campaign from China ""use at least 30 social media platforms and more than 40 websites and niche forums in several languages, including English, Russian, German, Spanish, Korean, and Japanese, to target US audiences."" Additionally, ransomware will continue to increase, according to DHS, because it has been profitable for cybercriminals. ""We assess that ransomware attacks targeting US networks and infrastructure will increase in the near and long term because cybercriminals have developed effective business models to increase their financial gain, likelihood for success, and anonymity,"" the Department says. The bulletin was first reported by the Daily Beast.",12
2022-06-23,https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-nuclear-scientist-reportedly-rescued-russia-occupied-ukraine/story?id=85572177,US nuclear scientist reportedly rescued from Russia-occupied Ukraine,"American nuclear scientist John Spor escaped from Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine this week with the help of a rescue organization called Project Dynamo, a Tampa-based nonprofit group run by U.S. veterans. Spor, a Texas native and founder of Texas Photonics Inc., had been living in Mariupol for several years before the Russia invaded Ukraine last February. He reportedly went into hiding during the siege. The group said that Spor was considered a high-value target because of the sensitive nature of his work in laser-guided weapons systems and that Chechen-Russian forces “have been actively hunting him.” Project Dynamo claims Spor was able to pass through more than 30 Russian checkpoints in Eastern Ukraine and was then driven nearly 20 hours straight across the rest of the country and into Poland. ABC News has not been able to independently confirm the details of the escape but the State Department said Wednesday they’re “aware of the reports” and reiterated that all U.S. citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately. In Poland, Spor was reunited with his son and his sister, who had contacted the rescue group. “Project DYNAMO has been with our family every step of the way through this nightmare. DYNAMO has been the answer to our family’s prayers,” said Lauri Weigle, Spor’s sister said in a statement released by Project Dynamo. “We are in amazement that he is finally on his way to us and safe after months of hoping and praying.” Project Dynamo said it had been working on this complex and dangerous mission to rescue Spor for more than a month. Due to the ongoing nature of the missions, some details and locations are being withheld, according to the statement released by the group. “I’m so grateful for Project DYNAMO and the support they have provided to me and my family during this time,” said Sean Spor in a statement, who flew to Europe to reunite with his father. “They’ve rescued my dad from harm’s way, and I am eagerly awaiting his arrival.”",2

Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, the first woman of color elected to Congress, now has a portrait to honor her legacy at the U.S. Capitol. A painting of the late congresswoman was unveiled in Statuary Hall Thursday in a ceremony celebrating her trailblazing efforts in the fight against sexual discrimination in sports and education. The portrait will be displayed as part of a series of portraits that recognize members of Congress who've increased diversity and representation in the House. Other portraits include former Reps. Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman in Congress, and Florence Kahn, the first Jewish woman in Congress. ""By force of her personality, the power of her brilliance, her persuasiveness, nobody could ever say no, to Patsy Mink, that's just the way it was. You could but you'd be wasting time because eventually, you'd be saying yes,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, talking about Mink's legislative work. Most notably, Mink, first elected in 1964, was key in ensuring what's become known simply as Title IX -- was signed into law. The law states: ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."" Following Mink's death, caused by viral pneumonia, in 2002 at age 74, Title IX was renamed the ""Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act"" in tribute. Lawmakers, also commemorating the 50th anniversary of Title IX Thursday, spoke about the opportunities the legislation provided for women while also acknowledging that work remained, such as fighting for pay equity, ending campus sexual harassment, and securing access to health care for women. ""Of course, we still have a way to go for true equity, and we need to strengthen Title IX and protect the rights of every student to a welcoming and supportive school environment by working to build on the progress Congresswoman Patsy Mink worked so hard to secure,"" Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii said. Mink's daughter, Dr. Gwendolyn Mink also used Thursday's ceremony as a call to action for Congress to continue to push toward equal opportunity. ""My mother held the view that justice requires eternal vigilance. We can't rest on our laurels. We must never greet accomplishment with complacency,"" Mink said. ""I think she would hope that her portrait would help inspire that rededication as a reminder to vigilance, a call to activism, and an inspiration to keep doing the work of U.S. democracy."" Members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus also tearfully told stories about the importance of her representation in Congress and what her portrait will symbolize for people who visit the Capitol. ""Growing up, I never thought I would be in elected office, let alone a member of Congress. It's because I never saw anyone who looked like me in such positions. So, it never even occurred to me that it was a possibility. But think of how different this will be with the installation of this portrait. So many young girls will see it as they walk through the halls of the U.S. Capitol. And they will see a shining example of what Asian American women and women of color can do as trailblazers in Congress,"" caucus chair Rep. Judy Chu said.",26
2022-06-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-heads-europe-amid-domestic-turmoil-abortion-guns/story?id=85656265,"Biden heads to Europe amid domestic turmoil over abortion, guns","President Joe Biden departs for Europe on Saturday in an effort to stave off cracks in the Western alliance against Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- and shore up the global economy -- amid domestic turmoil over abortions and guns. Just after a historic Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade -- and a bipartisan compromise in Congress on guns – the president turns to foreign policy with meetings in Germany and Spain. He plans to gather with the leaders of the other ""Group of Seven"" major economic powers in Germany before flying to Spain to confer with NATO allies. There, he'll seek to gain Turkey's approval of Finland and Sweden's bid to join the alliance in the face of Russia's attack. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy plans to address both summits, according to a senior Biden administration official. When Biden last met in person with allies in Europe in March, they spoke with a unified voice about the need to harshly sanction Russia's President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine. Now, four months from the start of the war and as the global economy continues to suffer, Biden will seek to stave off any fractures -- particularly as Russia makes more gains on the battlefield and leaders worry about an even more protracted war. Meeting with leaders at a resort in the Bavarian Alps on Sunday and Monday, Biden will push for ""new commitments to further isolate Russia from the global economy, target the Russian defense supply chain and continue cracking down on the evasion of these unprecedented sanctions,"" White House spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. Kirby, who also said there would be ""new commitments"" related to energy and food prices, added Biden's trip was taking ""at a watershed moment in transatlantic solidarity in the post-Cold War era, not just for European security, but for an alignment like we've never seen before in how we confront some of the biggest challenges of our time. "" Biden will head to Madrid for a NATO leaders' summit on Tuesday. He'll again seek to keep the defense alliance united against Putin while also pushing for its expansion. The U.S. has embraced Finland and Sweden's bids to join NATO, which would require all 30 current members' agreement. But Turkey has so far blocked their applications over what it says is those countries' support for Kurdish fighters it considers terrorists. Kirby told reporters Thursday the U.S. was ""confident"" ongoing conversations between Turkey, Finland and Sweden would lead to both countries eventually joining the alliance, although he said he could not predict when that would happen. Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand will also for the first time join the NATO leaders' summit. Biden plans to depart one day after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which in remarks Friday he called a ""sad day"" and a ""very solemn moment"" for America. He also is leaving just after Congress passed gun safety legislation -- the first major piece of federal gun reform in nearly three decades -- and after the Supreme Court struck down a century-old New York law restricting the concealed carry of handguns. These developments threaten to overshadow Biden's trip and potentially distract the president as the United States reels from historic upheaval.

The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment plans on disbursing $600 billion by 2027 in infrastructure investments, with President Joe Biden announcing the U.S. alone would aim to spend $200 billion in public and private partnerships. Biden and other world leaders, speaking in Germany's Bavarian Alps, cast the investments as ""critical"" amid crises on multiple fronts, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, an energy crunch fueled in part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and more. ""These strategic investments are in areas critical to sustainable development and to our shared global stability: health and health security, digital connectivity, gender equality and equity, climate and energy security,"" Biden said. ""We need a worldwide effort to invest in transformative clean energy projects to ensure that critical infrastructures resilient to changing climate. Critical materials that are necessary for clean energy transition, including production of batteries, need to be developed with high standards for labor and environment,"" he added. The G-7 announcement comes as the alliance looks to lay down markers of tangible investments and accomplishments at a time when China and Russia are looking to make inroads elsewhere. China has become increasingly involved in Africa and Latin America, investing hefty sums in building roads, bridges and more in an aggressive diplomatic effort on both continents. In his remarks on Sunday, Biden directly contrasted the new announcement with what China has done, emphasizing that the G-7's investments will be based on ""shared values,"" a signal to nations that it's in their benefit to align with the U.S. and others compared with China. ""What we're doing is fundamentally different because it's grounded on our shared values of all those representing the countries and organizations behind me. It's built using the global best practices: transparency, partnership, protections for labor and the environment,"" he said. He said the infrastructure program was not ""aid or charity,"" but instead ""an investment that will deliver returns for everyone, including the American people and people of all"" nations. ""It'll boost all of our economies, and it's a chance for us to share our positive vision for the future .... Because when democracies demonstrate what we can do, all that we have to offer, I have no doubt that will win the competition, every time,"" he said. The investments in energy and climate infrastructure have taken on heightened on importance both as nations race to combat climate change's effects and make themselves less reliant on countries like Russia for oil and natural gas -- a dependency that has hindered the response to Moscow's war in Ukraine. There was no question-and-answer session at the end of the G-7 announcement, but when one reporter shouted a question, it was about whether the recent Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade had come up in meetings. ""What decision?"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen could be heard asking as she walked off stage.

2022-06-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-state-scramble-defines-post-roe-future-note/story?id=85745205,State-by-state scramble defines the immediate post-Roe future: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The era of ""settled law"" has given way to an unsettled immediate future. That's likely to mean much different things for politics depending on the race, the state and the bigger-than-ever stakes. Tossing aside Roe v. Wade doesn't make much of anything automatic, notwithstanding the states with ""trigger laws"" and the quick fundraising bursts fueled by either outrage or relief at the Supreme Court's bombshell decision last week. Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion anticipated part of what comes now, writing that the best course ""for this Court and the country"" would be ""to face up to the real issue without further delay."" But any real issues diverge dramatically depending on the jurisdiction. Red states are acting on trigger laws (set to automatically enforce bans in the aftermath of the court's ruling) and pursuing special legislative sessions to restrict abortion rights. Blue states are expanding access and make sure women seeking abortions in other states can find their way to appropriate services. New battles are being joined in battleground states that have already been the focus of a divided and divisive political era. In Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin -- just for starters -- it's not a stretch for candidates to say that abortion rights will be on the ballot this fall. The end of Roe naturally brings demand for national responses, particularly given frustrations with a rightward policy march during a time of Democratic governance, and the way this played out as a direct result of former President Donald Trump getting three Supreme Court picks confirmed. But any fallout won't be national in nature -- and, indeed, will be intensely personal for countless women. It marks a test for candidates in both parties and carries timing that makes pat predictions silly to even suggest. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Backlash to a tweet from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has called further attention to other rights that could be in jeopardy after Roe's overturning. In response to former President Barack Obama's statement decrying the Supreme Court's decision on abortion as reversing ""nearly 50 years of precedent,"" Cornyn tweeted, ""Now do Plessy vs Ferguson/Brown vs Board of Education."" That post set off a flood of social media outrage accusing the senator of wanting to see the landmark decision that outlawed racial segregation in schools overturned. Cornyn later attempted to clarify his comment. ""Thank goodness some SCOTUS precedents are overruled,"" he wrote, referring to the fact that Brown overturned the previous ruling that infamously upheld the notion of ""separate but equal."" Regardless of his intent, Cornyn's comparison gets at growing fears that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could take actions that would overturn other court precedents. It's something Justice Clarence Thomas explicitly called for in his opinion concurring with the reversal of Roe. Thomas named specific cases: Griswold v. Connecticut, which established the right of married couples to use contraception; Lawrence v. Texas, which forbid the criminalizing of intimate same-sex relationships; and Obergefell v. Hodges, which guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage. The liberal wing of the court, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, issued a stark warning about this in their dissent. ""No one should be confident that this majority is done with its work,"" they wrote. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Donald Trump's Saturday rally in Mendon, Illinois, made unsavory headlines amid the political fallout over the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade. While taking the stage with Trump, freshman Republican Rep. Mary Miller said the court's decision was a ""historic victory for white life."" ""President Trump, on behalf of all the MAGA patriots in America, I want to thank you for the historic victory for white life in the Supreme Court yesterday,"" Miller said in an apparent reference to the former president having appointed three of the justices delivering the opinion. According to The Associated Press, Miller's spokesperson, Isaiah Wartman, called it ""a mix-up of words"" and said the congresswoman intended to say ""right to life."" ""You can clearly see in the video ... she's looking at her papers and looking at her speech,"" Wartman told The AP. Although the newly redistricted boundaries of the 15th Congressional District still cover much of Miller's old district, she is facing off in a tough primary on Tuesday with six-term incumbent GOP Rep. Rodney Davis, who chose not to run in the 13th District. Prior to redistricting, Davis' 13th Congressional District had an eight-point Republican lean, according to FiveThirtyEight's analysis. Under the new parameters, the 13th District now covers a sliver of its former land mass and leans in favor of Democrats by seven points. The race in the ultra-red district is becoming yet another example of intraparty divisions over Trumpian loyalty -- Davis voted to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 capitol attack, while Miller voted against the measure, which landed her Trump's endorsement in January. Miller also has the backing of the Club for Growth, an anti-tax super PAC. In a tweet addressing Miller's comments this weekend, Davis took a jab at President Joe Biden, while also raising the congresswoman's past statements that quoted Adolf Hitler in 2021. ""Mary Miller's comments [Saturday] are just another part in a disturbing pattern of behavior she's displayed since coming to Congress. This is why she uses the Biden basement strategy and refuses to answer questions or hold public events,"" Davis said. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 9. That's the number of key Democratic primaries to watch in Illinois and New York on Tuesday night during the June 28 primaries. (We're not expecting competitive Democratic primaries in the other seven states voting Tuesday.) And as FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich writes, there's a wide array of Democratic primaries this Tuesday, including an incumbent-versus-incumbent matchup, several progressive-versus-moderate skirmishes, more involvement from the cryptocurrency industry and multiple races where Democrats could elect new female, nonwhite or LGBT candidates to Congress.

2022-06-27,https://abcnews.go.com/International/brittney-griners-preliminary-hearing-moscow-scheduled-monday/story?id=85753028,WNBA star Brittney Griner's trial in Russia set to begin July 1,"WNBA star Brittney Griner's detention in Russia has been extended through Dec. 20, according to reports. The decision was made during a preliminary hearing that Griner attended on Monday, Russia's state-run TASS reported. Griner is expected to remain in custody throughout this time, according to The Associated Press. The WNBA star did not respond to an ABC News reporter's question as she walked out of the courtroom on Monday. The next hearing is scheduled for July 1, when her trial is expected to begin. Griner was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Russia on Feb. 17 after she was accused of carrying vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in Russia. ""Our position for some time on this has been very clear. Brittney Griner should not be detained. She should not be detained for a single day longer,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on June 14. Russia had issued multiple extensions of her pre-trial detention. If convicted, Griner, 31, faces up to 10 years in prison. Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, told the AP that she has ""zero trust"" in the U.S. government after its handling of her wife's detention. Russia's invasion of Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained. Some officials are concerned that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing conflict. Calls to free Griner escalated following the release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed in April, who was freed from a Russian prison as part of a prisoner exchange. Former Marine Paul Whelan has also been detained in Russia since 2019. The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained."" Cherelle Griner told ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts in May that she would like to speak with President Joe Biden. ""I just keep hearing that, you know, he has the power. She's a political pawn,"" she said. ""So if they're holding her because they want you to do something, then I want you to do it."" Asked about a potential meeting between Cherelle Griner and President Biden, Jean-Pierre said, ""We don't have anything to share about a potential phone conversation or meeting.""

2022-06-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumpism-tempts-democrats-republicans-primaries-note/story?id=85796111,Trumpism tempts Democrats as well as Republicans in next primaries up: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Some of the most Donald Trump-friendly candidates on the ballot have some unusual allies -- at a most unusual moment. The last major multi-state voting day until August will put a high-risk strategy on display. Primaries in Colorado and Illinois on Tuesday are the latest races where Democratic-aligned groups are spending heavily to boost the candidacies of far-right Republicans under the assumption that they will be easier to defeat in November. The candidates are being boosted under the guise of attacks that all involved -- including the candidates themselves -- think actually helps them in GOP primaries. State Rep. Ron Hanks, an election-denying Senate candidate, is labeled in ads funded by Democrats as ""too conservative for Colorado."" That same line is being applied to Greg Lopez, a GOP gubernatorial candidate who has said he would likely sign an abortion ban in Colorado if the legislature passes one. State Sen. Darren Bailey, who was just endorsed by former President Trump in his race for governor, is likewise called ""too conservative for Illinois"" in ads being run by Democratic groups. Similar spending already may have helped Doug Mastriano in his quest for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Pennsylvania. Trying to choose one's own opponent is not a new trick in politics. Some Democratic strategists argue that it's a smart way to try to win elections and that defining rivals early, particularly in a Trump-dominated party, is the best course. But between challenges to democracy highlighted by the House's Jan. 6 committee and the future of abortion rights thrown into question by the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade, the stakes of this year's midterm elections might be different. That, at least, is Democrats' hope -- even as they lend something of a hand to candidates loyal to Trump. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Despite the advanced notice of Roe's imminent demise, via the leak last month of the Supreme Court's decision, Democrats are still plotting their next steps in the aftermath of the ruling, which was handed down Friday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced in a letter to fellow House Democrats that her conference would ""explore"" legislation aimed at reinforcing the right of Americans to interstate travel, codifying the right to an abortion and protecting women's personal data in reproductive apps to prevent that data from being used to penalize women for seeking abortions out of state. ""While this extremist Supreme Court works to punish and control the American people, Democrats must continue our fight to expand freedom in America,"" Pelosi wrote. In an interview with CNN on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized that the administration would work to ensure that women have access to FDA-approved medical abortion. Her comments follow statements from Attorney General Merrick Garland, who asserted Friday that states can't ban such medication. ""We're do everything within our power as an administration through the executive branch to ensure that women have access to the medication they need,"" Harris said. Still, progressives are calling for bolder action and some have expressed dissatisfaction with the White House's response. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a set of specific actions that could be taken, including expanding the Supreme Court, opening abortion clinics on federal lands and repealing the Hyde Amendment which prohibits federal money from being used to fund abortions -- though the likelihood of those ideas coming to fruition is slim. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, seemed to imply the White House should have been prepared with an action plan sooner. ""He [Biden] made a strong statement the day of. I would have liked to see some more specific actions rolled out,"" Jayapal told Politico on Monday. ""We all knew this was coming."" The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The 2022 landscape of battleground states is evolving into dual tracks of importance post-Roe's overturning. In addition to underscoring the future of the Senate majority, several states' gubernatorial races are now also at the forefront of the battle over abortion rights given that governors would in many cases be able to either enforce or revoke states' existing abortion laws. Tuesday's primary elections will highlight developments in Illinois and Colorado -- two states that are among the few areas permitting abortion access in their respective regions. The final weekend of campaigning in New York's gubernatorial race also featured a heavy emphasis by candidates on both sides of the aisle against a backdrop of mass protests over the Supreme Court's ruling. Pennsylvania is already seen as Democrats' best Senate pickup opportunity this year; and now the state is becoming an abortion access battleground in its gubernatorial contest. Democratic candidate and sitting state Attorney General Josh Shapiro is campaigning on a promise to veto anti-abortion legislation proposed by the Republican legislature, if elected. Across the aisle, Republican Doug Mastriano is positioned as one of the toughest opponents of abortion access -- the state senator has publicly said he does not support exceptions for abortion and would criminalize abortions if he takes the state's top executive role. Meanwhile, state-level legal complications are already stemming from the Supreme Court's decision and making their way onto the campaign trail. In Michigan -- where incumbent Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is fending off a crowded field of Republican challengers -- a 1931 law is causing confusion about the state's current abortion access. Whitmer is seeking to have the Michigan Supreme Court strike down the nearly 100-year-old law criminalizing abortions that are performed outside of situations to save a mother's life, arguing that it goes against the state's constitution. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 22. That's the number of key Republican primaries to watch in Colorado, Illinois, Mississippi, New York, Oklahoma and Utah on Tuesday, along with a special election in Nebraska. And as FiveThirtyEight's Geoffrey Skelley and Nathaniel Rakich write, Trump's influence is once again on the ballot. But in addition to that well-worn storyline is Democratic involvement in GOP primaries. One thing Democrats have tried this cycle is to elevate the candidacies of more extreme right-wing candidates in the hopes that they'll be easier to defeat in the general election. Will that pay off in states like Colorado? Join us Tuesday as we live-blog the results at FiveThirtyEight. The PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-06-29,https://abcnews.go.com/US/giuliani-associate-lev-parnas-sentenced-20-months-unlawful/story?id=85926158,Ex-Giuliani associate Lev Parnas sentenced to 20 months for unlawful campaign donations,"Lev Parnas, the one-time associate of former President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, was sentenced Wednesday to 20 months in prison for pumping foreign money into U.S. elections. Parnas, who became briefly known for helping Giuliani investigate Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine in the lead-up to the 2020 election, was convicted last year of using funds from a wealthy Russian businessman, Andrey Muraviev, to make unlawful donations to American political candidates that Parnas thought could help with his nascent marijuana business. The defense sought leniency and a sentence of time served, while federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Parnas deserved eight years in prison. ""Parnas will now serve time in prison for his many crimes,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said following sentencing. ""Not content to defraud investors in his business, Fraud Guarantee, out of more than $2 million, Parnas also defrauded the American public by pumping Russian money into U.S. elections and lying about the source of funds for political contributions."" Parnas, after the sentencing, said, ""I'm doing good. I am relieved that it's finally over. It's been a long time coming."" He also thanked the judge in the case. ""I think he did an incredible job,"" Parnas said. ""He's a great judge."" In addition to 20 months' prison time, Parnas was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $2,322,500 in restitution. ""The record before this Court shows that Parnas has -- for years -- lied and swindled and corrupted for his own benefit,"" prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum. ""Parnas put himself above this country, his investors, and the public."" Parnas also made straw donations to a number of federal candidates, joint fundraising committees, and independent expenditure committees that were made in Parnas' name to conceal the fact that the donations were funded by others, prosecutors said. Parnas began attending a number of political fundraising events and making high-dollar contributions in order to ingratiate himself within political circles, they said. ""The evidence at trial and before the Court overwhelmingly establishes that Parnas engaged in a veritable crime spree for seven years,"" said prosecutors. The defense conceded that Parnas' offenses were serious but said he deserved no additional prison time. ""Mr. Parnas is remorseful for his conduct and intends to repay the victims of his offenses,"" defense attorney Joseph Bondy wrote in a sentencing memorandum. ""His family circumstances are different that those of his codefendants, as Mr. Parnas is a father to three children under the age of ten, two teenagers, and an adult son, who rely upon him for emotional support and guidance on a daily basis."" Bondy said the Soviet-born Parnas has lived a law-abiding life for nearly three years. ""Mr. Parnas has undertaken to work as a DoorDash delivery person, attend Gamblers Anonymous, participate in marital and faith counseling, and engage in humanitarian aid and relief efforts in Ukraine,"" Bondy said.",0
2022-06-29,https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-veteran-held-russian-backed-forces-ukraine-captors/story?id=85880832,US veteran held by Russian-backed forces in Ukraine says captors want to negotiate release: Family,"The family of a former U.S. soldier captured in Ukraine said Tuesday he has contacted the U.S. State Department twice since the weekend to read statements that identified his captors as forces from the Donetsk People's Republic, a Russian-backed region in Ukraine. Alex Drueke, 40, left his home from outside Tuscaloosa, Alabama in mid-April, intending to join Ukrainian forces as a volunteer. Upon arrival, he helped train soldiers on equipment they received from other nations. Drueke last contacted his family on June 13, they said. On June 15, photos of Drueke and Andy Huynh started appearing online via Ukrainian and Russian social media that showed the men in captivity. According to Drueke's aunt, Dianna Shaw, Drueke first called the State Department Saturday from a Russian phone number. He read a statement that said the DPR wanted to negotiate the release of Drueke and Huynh. He added that he was being treated well and had shelter and water. During a second phone call on Tuesday, Drueke read a second statement from his captors regarding negotiations without specifying terms, she said. He said he was spending most of his time in solitary confinement and had not seen Huynh in several days, according to Shaw. ""We have been in contact with the Ukrainian and Russian authorities regarding U.S. citizens who may have been captured by Russia's proxies while fighting in Ukraine,"" the State Department said in a statement to ABC News. ""We are seeking to learn as much as we can and are providing every form of support possible, including for the families, with whom we are in contact. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment at this time."" The Kremlin has not confirmed where both men are being held. Shaw said the phone calls are evidence that ""Russia knows the world is watching"" and suggested the Russian government is playing a role in protecting the men. ""Russia has the influence over their surrogates to see that Alex and Andy are given humane treatment as POWs and eventually released unharmed,"" she said. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called both men ""heroes"" and said he would fight for their release. ""We'll fight for them and get them back, and of course they will come back to their families,"" he said. ""To me, it is a great honor that in the world there are some soldiers that are not afraid, and they came to support us and our sovereignty and independence."" In a statement, Bunny Drueke, the veteran's mother, said it was ""very encouraging to hear the Ukrainian government is committed to securing Alex's and Andy's release."" Drueke served in the U.S. Army for 12 years, including two tours in Iraq.",27
2022-06-30,https://abcnews.go.com/International/hard-isolate-russia-experts/story?id=85415448,Why it may be hard to isolate Russia and has it become a pariah state?,"In response to the invasion of Ukraine, the West has imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia, nearly crippling its economy and isolating it from all but a few allies. President Joe Biden and other government officials have said sanctions from the U.S. and its allies will make Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, pariahs on the world stage. However, one expert who spoke with ABC News says that casting Russia out of the international community, making it a pariah state, may not be so easy. ""Russia is a member of the UN security council, it has veto power there. It is just a major actor on the world stage in so many ways. So isolating Russia, shaming it, making it a pariah is a huge challenge,"" said Daniel Hamilton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute. Yet, ""Russia has not done too well with allies,"" Hamilton also said. ""Today, it's real allies are ... sort of also pariah states. It's Assad's Syria, it's Venezuela, it's Cuba and that's about it. Others tolerate Russia. They figure out ways to deal with it, in the former Soviet space. But they're not really allies,"" Hamilton said. China has also kept a relationship with Russia, which Hamilton called ""pro-Russian neutrality,"" with China falling short of giving Russia its full support, he said An analysis of American policymakers found that the U.S. punishes pariah states committing one of five acts: the development of weapons of mass destruction, involvement in terrorism, posing a military threat, challenging international norms and, most recently, cyberthreats. The U.S. currently designates Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Syria as state sponsors of terrorism, according to the Department of State. Russia's gross domestic product, a metric used to gauge the size of an economy by quantifying all the goods and services it produced, will be hard hit, according to Andrew Lohsen, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Russian GDP, by their own estimates, is expected to to fall by between eight and 12%. This is the sharpest contraction since 1994,"" said Lohsen. ""Other former finance officials in Russia put that number close to 30%,"" Lohsen said. Lohsen also told ABC News the way Russia has conducted its war warrants a strong response from the international community. ""I think the images of civilians with their hands tied behind their back or shot execution style is an indication that Russia simply cannot be treated the way it has before, that this is a war crime,"" Lohsen said. ""The way that Russia has fought this war in a way that is so obviously meant to terrorize and inflict pain and suffering on civilian noncombatants,"" Lohsen added. Putin considers Ukraine not as a sovereign country, but rather, a lost tribe of Russia, Hamilton said. ""He really is determined to either cripple it or to absorb it, if possible. He's having some trouble doing that,"" Hamilton said. As it moves to isolate Russia, the U.S. is softening relations with Iran and Saudi Arabia, despite Biden's campaign promise to make Saudi Arabia a pariah for its killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. While the U.S. has been able to cut out Russian oil, the European Union still relies on Russia for 25% of it's oil and 40% of its natural gas.",7
2022-06-30,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-backs-exception-senate-filibuster-rule-abortion-rights/story?id=85991630,Biden backs exception to Senate filibuster rule to get abortion rights codified,"President Joe Biden on Thursday blasted the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and said he would support carving out an exception to the 60-vote threshold required by the Senate filibuster rule to codify abortion rights and other privacy rights as well. ""One thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States and overruling not only Roe v. Wade, but essentially challenging the right to privacy,"" he said at a news conference in Madrid at the end of a NATO summit. ""We have to codify Roe v. Wade in the law,"" he said. ""And the way to do that is to make sure Congress votes to do that. And if the filibuster gets in the way it's like voting rights, it should be we provide an exception for this, except the required exception to the filibuster for this action to deal with the Supreme Court decision."" Biden has previously said he would back a carveout for voting rights legislation, but Democrats lack the votes to support altering the rule, facing opposition from Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Still, some progressives applauded his position Thursday, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeting in response, ""Now we’re talking!"" ""Time for people to see a real, forceful push for it. Use the bully pulpit. We need more,"" she wrote. Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats have called on the Biden administration to take stronger action to protect abortion access, such as declaring a public health emergency, authorizing procedures on federal lands, or enacting concrete ways to protect patients' personal health and location data -- actions the administration has, so far, declined to do. Noting his evolution on the topic of abortion, one reporter asked Biden if he's the ""best messenger"" to lead the fight to codify Roe. ""Yeah, I am,"" he replied. ""I'm the president of the United States of America. That makes me the best messenger."" On other domestic issues, he said NATO and G-7 leaders ""do not think that"" the United States is going in the wrong direction -- with reporters raising the Supreme Court abortion decision, continued mass shootings, including a massacre of children in Uvalde, and record-high inflation. Addressing inflation and soaring prices across the board for goods at home, Biden said, ""I can understand why the American people are frustrated because of inflation,"" but argued it's a world problem and not isolated to the U.S. ""The reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia, Russia, Russia,"" he said. Biden participated in the press conference to close out his European trip made to meet with NATO and G-7 leaders to amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. In opening remarks, he delivered a message of NATO unity and strength in the face of new challenges, touting, above all, the addition of Finland and Sweden into the alliance. ""Putin thought you can break the Transatlantic Alliance. He tried to weaken us and expected our resolve to fracture. But he's getting exactly what he did not want,"" Biden said. ""He wanted the federalization of NATO he got the NATO-ization of Finland."" ""With the addition of Finland and Sweden will be stronger than ever,"" he added. Saying that the U.S. will support Ukraine ""for as long as it takes,"" Biden also said the U.S. will soon announce $800 million in new military aid to Ukraine including air defense systems and offensive weapons.",7
2022-06-30,https://abcnews.go.com/US/calls-free-brittney-griner-escalate-ahead-wnba-stars/story?id=85849852,Calls to free Brittney Griner escalate ahead of WNBA star's trial in Russia,"Friends and family members of Brittney Griner gathered for a vigil outside the Russian Consulate in New York City on Wednesday evening, calling for the WNBA star's release ahead of her trial in Russia. “Feb 17 was the last time I talked to my sister,” said Janell Roy, Griner’s childhood friend said at the vigil. “I haven’t been in communication with her, I haven’t been able to talk to her and it hurts.” Griner was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Russia on Feb. 17 after she was accused of carrying vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in Russia. Griner's detention in Russia was extended repeatedly, most recently through Dec. 20, which is the expected length of her trial. If convicted, Griner, 31, faces up to 10 years in prison. The Phoenix Mercury player’s trial is set to begin on Friday and she is expected to remain in custody throughout. The WNBA star, who attended a preliminary hearing on Monday in Khimki, a suburb of Moscow, did not respond to an ABC News reporter's question as she walked out of the courtroom. Asked how Griner is feeling at the hearing, her attorney Aleksandr Boikov told ABC News on Monday, “She's fine as she could be.” The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained,” meaning the United States will more aggressively work to negotiate her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department said. https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/us-officials-griner-now-considered-wrongfully-detained-84467439 “... The fact remains that the U.S. Government has determined that Brittney Griner is wrongfully detained and being used as a political pawn,” Griner’s agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, wrote in a series of tweets on Monday. “The negotiation for her immediate release regardless of the legal proceedings should remain a top priority and we expect [President Joe Biden] and [Vice President Kamala Harris] to do everything in their power, right now, to get a deal done to bring her home.” White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters on Tuesday that Griner is “unjustly detained” and called on the Russian government to release the American basketball star. Sullivan further stressed the U.S. is “actively engaged” in working to secure Griner’s release, but added that the diplomatic efforts are “sensitive matters.” ""But I will tell you it has the fullest attention of the president and every senior member of his national security and diplomatic team, and we are actively working to find a resolution to this case, and will continue to do so without rest until we get Brittney safely home,” he said. “We also are trying to work actively to return all unjustly detained Americans and hostages being held overseas, whether that be in Iran or Afghanistan or Russia or Venezuela, or China or elsewhere."" The 6-foot-9 center won an NCAA title at Baylor in 2012; a WNBA title with Phoenix, her current team, in 2014; and gold medals with the U.S. women's team at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. Russia's invasion of Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained. Some officials are concerned that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing conflict. Calls to free Griner escalated following the release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed in April, who was freed from a Russian prison as part of a prisoner exchange. Former Marine Paul Whelan has also been detained in Russia since 2019. An international prisoner swap potentially involving Griner, Whelan and convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout has been discussed, according to Russian media reports, but it’s unclear if there has been any substantial movement on the issue. Russian officials have also indicated that they want Griner to stand trial. Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, told the AP that she has ""zero trust"" in the U.S. government after its handling of her wife's detention after the State Department jumbled a planned anniversary call between the couple. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday that Brittney Griner’s inability to reach her wife was an “unfortunate mistake,” adding that another phone call has been scheduled. It would have been the first time that Brittney Griner speaks to her wife since her detention more than three months ago. “This was an unfortunate mistake, and the Department of State is working to rectify this as quickly as possible,” Jean-Pierre said, adding that another call between the couple was scheduled. It is unclear if the call has taken place.Cherelle Griner previously told ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts in May that she would like to speak with President Joe Biden. ""I just keep hearing that, you know, he has the power. She's a political pawn,"" she said. ""So if they're holding her because they want you to do something, then I want you to do it."" Asked about a potential meeting between Cherelle Griner and President Biden, Jean-Pierre said, ""We don't have anything to share about a potential phone conversation or meeting.""

2022-06-30,https://abcnews.go.com/US/14-year-tiger-dies-contracting-covid-19-zoo/story?id=85986701,14-year-old tiger dies after contracting COVID-19 at zoo,"A 14-year-old tiger has died from health complications after contracting COVID-19 at an Ohio zoo, officials said. Jupiter, a 14-year-old Amur tiger, passed away on Sunday after officials at the Columbus Zoo confirmed that he had developed pneumonia which was caused by the COVID-19 virus. “On Wednesday, June 22, Jupiter was reported by his care team to be acting ill. (He was not interested in eating, and was reluctant to stand, move or interact with keepers.),” the zoo wrote in a statement on social media. “When this continued into the next day, Jupiter was anesthetized for examination and treatment. Initial exams suggested an infection, and treatment was started.” To complicate matters, Jupiter had been dealing with long-term treatment of some chronic underlying illnesses, said the Columbus Zoo, and this made him more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus. “Unfortunately, Jupiter did not improve with this treatment and remained reluctant to move and eat,” officials continued. “The following day, he was given additional treatments and had more diagnostic testing.” Jupiter passed away on Sunday and is the first animal at the Columbus Zoo to succumb to COVID-19, the zoo said. “Jupiter's care team remembers him as a big and impressive tiger who loved fish, sleeping in the habitat’s cave, playing with cardboard boxes, and interacting with another favorite item—a 75-pound firehouse “plus sign” that was heavy for keepers to move but something he carried around like it weighed nothing,” said the Columbus Zoo. “His care team also fondly remembers the trust they built with Jupiter over time through training and how he was always very friendly with the female tigers, Mara and Natasha.” Jupiter was born on July 9, 2007, at the Moscow Zoo in Russia but eventually ended up at the Columbus Zoo on March 19, 2015, after spending the first half of his life at the Zoo Dvur Kralove in the north of the Czech Republic. Jupiter leaves quite a legacy and sired nine cubs during his life -- six of which were born at the Columbus Zoo -- which officials say has contributed to the future of Jupiter’s endangered species. Employees at the Columbus Zoo require their staff working with cats, great apes, otters and wolverines -- among other species -- to wear masks whenever they come within six feet of the animal as a precautionary measure. Said the zoo: “Jupiter will be greatly missed…Please keep our Asia Quest team in your thoughts.”",22
2022-07-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wnba-star-brittney-griners-trial-begins-russia-us/story?id=86060104,WNBA star Brittney Griner's trial begins in Russia as US works to secure her release,"Brittney Griner appeared in a courtroom in Khimki, a suburb of Moscow, on Friday morning for the first day of the WNBA star's trial in Russia, where she has been in custody for 134 days. Griner was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Russia on Feb. 17 after she was accused of carrying vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in Russia. The first witness at Griner's trial was a customs officer who was at the airport when she was arrested. According to a Russian reporter inside the courtroom, who spoke with ABC News, Griner said through a translator that she understood the accusation but declined to comment on the charge, saying she will share her thoughts at a later time. The judge began the examination of evidence with the interrogation of witnesses. Representatives of the U.S. Embassy, as well as two representatives from Russian and foreign media were allowed into the courtroom. An American reporter inside the courtroom, who spoke with Griner, told ABC News on Monday that Griner said she is fine, but she misses her ability to work out like she used to. She also said that since she doesn't speak Russian, the court appearances are difficult for her, but she has been provided an interpreter. As Griner left the courtroom, she did not respond to ABC News' question when asked how she's doing. The Phoenix Mercury player is expected to appear in court again for the second day of the trial on July 7. Griner's detention in Russia was extended repeatedly, most recently through Dec. 20, which is the expected length of her trial. If convicted, Griner, 31, faces up to 10 years in prison. Ahead of the trial, friends and family members of Griner gathered for a vigil in New York City in honor of the detained athlete on Wednesday. ""Feb 17th was the last time I talked to my sister,"" said Janell Roy, Griner's childhood friend. ""I haven't been in communication with her, I haven't been able to talk to her and it hurts."" The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained,"" according to a report from The Associated Press -- meaning the United States will more aggressively work to negotiate her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department said.

A handwritten letter from Griner, portions of which were made public, was delivered to the White House on Monday. In it, she expressed fears she will be held in Russia ""forever."" ""As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey, or any accomplishments, I'm terrified I might be here forever,"" Griner wrote to the president. On Feb. 17, the WNBA star was detained at Russia's Sheremetyevo International Airport after being accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. ""It hurts thinking about how I usually celebrate [the Fourth of July] because freedom means something completely different to me this year,"" she wrote. Last Friday marked the first day of Griner's trial. She appeared in person at a courtroom in Khimki, a suburb of Moscow, ABC News reported. Her detention in Russia was extended to Dec. 20, the expected length of her trial. Griner's family and friends have called for the Phoenix Mercury star to be released and for the Biden administration to act. ""I just keep hearing that, you know, he has the power. She's a political pawn,"" Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, told ABC News' Robin Roberts in May. ""So, if they're holding her because they want you to do something, then I want you to do it."" In the Monday letter, the basketball star asked Biden to not forget about her and other American detainees in the country and to work toward bringing them back to the U.S. ""I still have so much good to do with my freedom that you can help restore. I miss my wife! I miss my family! I miss my teammates! It kills me to know they are suffering so much right now. I am grateful for whatever you can do at this moment to get me home,"" she said. It's unknown if Biden read the letter, but National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement obtained by ABC News the president ""has been clear"" about seeing all detainees who are wrongfully detained oversees, including the WNBA star, released. ""The U.S. government continues to work aggressively – using every available means – to bring her home,"" Watson said. ABC News' Courtney Condron and Sarah Kolinovsky contributed to this report.",20
2022-07-04,https://abcnews.go.com/US/family-pleads-release-texas-father-held-russia-custody/story?id=86091262,Family pleads for release of Texas father held in Russia following custody battle,"A Texas man who has spent more than five months in a Russian detention center is facing a different challenge from other recent American detainees such as Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner, as authorities in Moscow are accusing him of wrongdoing in his home country. David Barnes, a Huntsville, Alabama, native who has lived in the Houston area in recent years, was taken into custody by law enforcement in Moscow in January and has been incarcerated on Russian soil ever since. ""If I could go over there and just sit in that place with him, I would do it in a minute, because this is the most unjust situation I've ever experienced in my entire life,"" Carol Barnes, David's older sister, told ABC News. ""I feel like part of me is missing."" David Barnes was in Russia attempting to gain legal clearance to either see his children or bring them home, after his Russian ex-wife allegedly violated a court custody order and fled the United States with them, his family says. On Jan. 13, Russian investigators apprehended Barnes in Moscow, accusing him of abusing his two children years earlier in Texas, according to translations of court documents. Similar allegations against Barnes were brought to authorities in Texas by his now-ex-wife Svetlana Koptyaeva during their long and acrimonious divorce proceedings. The allegations were investigated in 2018 by the Department of Family and Protective Services, which found insufficient evidence to support them and closed the case without any findings of abuse or any charges against Barnes. Barnes' ex-wife is herself now wanted in the U.S. on a felony charge of interference with child custody, after she fled with the children in 2019. ""His mission was to save his children,"" Carol Barnes said. ""His mission all along has not been really revenge against her at all."" With her brother locked up abroad in a country that is currently fighting a war in Ukraine that has lead to a diplomatic dispute with the United States, Carol Barnes says she worries about his future. ""I've never been so sad and so hurt,"" she said. ""All I think about is the conditions that he's living in."" For much of his time in Russia, David Barnes has been in Moscow's Detention Center 5, according to his family. He is not the only American -- or even the only Texan -- who has been held there in recent years. Trevor Reed, a former Marine from Texas, was arrested by Russian authorities in 2019 and sentenced to nine years in prison. After being accused of assaulting two police officers in Moscow, Reed spent part of his time behind bars in Detention Center 5. After Reed's case gained widespread publicity in the U.S., he was released by Russian authorities in April in exchange for a Russian man who was being held in Connecticut on a federal drug trafficking conviction. In an interview with ABC News, Reed described his pretrial Russian detention facility as rat-infested and ""extremely dirty."" ""It took Trevor Reed three years to get out and his alleged crime was much less severe than what David is being accused of,"" Carol Barnes said. ""We're talking about Russia. They're going to make examples out of U.S. citizens."" Another Texan, Brittney Griner, is still being held by Russian law enforcement in the Moscow area. The WNBA star and Olympic gold medalist was arrested at an airport after Russian authorities alleged that she had vape cartridges with hashish oil in her luggage, but the U.S. government says Griner is being ""wrongfully detained."" Barnes had been living in Texas since 2007, working initially as a design engineer for an Alabama-based software company's Houston office. Houston is where he met Svetlana Koptyaeva, who was also living there for work. The two would go on to marry and have two sons, at least one of whom has dual Russian and American citizenship. ""I saw a difference in him when he had those two children,"" Carol Barnes said. ""His boys were his only focus in this life."" Svetlana Barnes filed a petition for divorce in 2014, and over the next five years, a lengthy and ugly custody battle ensued between the two parents, resulting in a jury trial and numerous court hearings in Texas. ""It was horrible,"" David Barnes' younger sister Margaret Aaron said. ""She tried everything she could to take the children from him and to get sole control, and he fought her tooth and nail."" Of Barnes' two children, Carol Barnes said, ""He wanted them -- even though their parents were divorcing -- to have two parents. He thought that children should be raised by two parents' influence."" Paul Carter, a lifelong friend of David Barnes who is also divorced with two sons, said the struggle between Barnes and his ex-wife became ""a cascading series of events"" stemming from ""her desire to not have David in any part of their lives."" ""My boys are everything,"" Carter said. ""Watching my sons grow up has been a wonderful experience. I've wanted so much for David to have that."" In early 2019, as part of a custody arrangement, Svetlana Barnes was expected to bring the children to an agreed-upon meeting point so David Barnes could have the boys for a few days. However, she never showed with the children. According to law enforcement records, David Barnes called the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office multiple times to ask for welfare checks on the two boys. ""She was a flight risk and somehow was able to flee with the passports,"" Carter said. ""I think that's a real travesty. It's a real breakdown of the system."" By April 6, 2019, the FBI was able to track Svetlana Barnes to Turkey, according to a criminal complaint. ""He was completely and totally devastated,"" Aaron said. ""He had gotten their room ready at his apartment and bought them toys, and he was just so happy that they were going to come back to him, and then they were gone. He was crushed."" In August 2020, a judge in Montgomery County signed an order designating David Barnes as the sole managing conservator of his children, which gave him rights to decide the primary home for his children, make decisions regarding their education, represent them in legal actions, and possess their passports. Yet despite the order, the two boys were nowhere to be found in the U.S. and Barnes was unable to reestablish contact with them. His family said he had a gut feeling about where the children had ended up. ""He was pretty certain what had happened, that [Svetlana] had taken them back to Russia,"" Aaron said. ""He knew that she would probably do this if she had the opportunity."" Svetlana Barnes was eventually traced to her homeland, with court-appointed receiver Robert Berleth writing in a November 2020 report, ""It is understood by the Receiver the Defendant has fled to Russia and has no intention of returning"" to her home in Texas. Carol Barnes said that after locating and hiring an attorney in Moscow, her brother decided to fly there in December 2021 to see if he could secure at least partial custody or limited rights to visitation with his children in Russian court. ""Society doesn't consider fathers to be as important as mothers,"" Carol Barnes said. ""They don't take into consideration that maybe there are fathers out there that are willing to fight for their children."" Not long after David Barnes arrived in Moscow and rented a room near where Svetlana Barnes was believed to be living, the former spouses ran into each other, according to Carol Barnes, who alleges that the ex-wife then contacted Russian authorities to make the same past child abuse allegations that Texas authorities could not substantiate. David Barnes was soon arrested by law enforcement in Moscow. ""After reviewing the decision to initiate a criminal case against me, I think that this is absurd,"" court records say that David Barnes told Russian investigators during an interrogation. ""I did not take the actions set forth in the decision to initiate a criminal case against me."" ""I'm sure he was panicked,"" Aaron said. ""You feel so helpless."" David Barnes' detention in Russia has come as news to prosecutors in the Lone Star State. ""We were not aware that Mr. Barnes was being held in a Russian detention center,"" Montgomery County District Attorney's Office Trial Bureau Chief Kelly Blackburn told ABC News when informed of Barnes' incarceration. ""At this time, there are no accusations out of Montgomery County that we are aware of that would allow Mr. Barnes to be held in custody."" Nor have any child abuse charges been made against David Barnes in neighboring Harris County, which covers the part of Houston also referenced in Russian court documents, according to the district attorney's office there. A 2014 petition for divorce that was filed on Svetlana Barnes' behalf said that ""Petitioner believes that Respondent [David Barnes] has a history or pattern of sexual abuse directed against"" one of the children, but did not go into detail. ""There was not a lot of information in 2014,"" Carol Barnes said. ""All I remember from talking to David was she started accusing him of some kind of abuse, but there was nothing definitive really said."" In 2017, a settlement agreement between David and Svetlana Barnes noted in part that Svetlana Barnes was ""to refrain from making statements, either written or oral, to any third party, alleging that … [David Barnes] … molested his minor child and/or engaged in improper sexual contact with his minor child"" -- though she did not waive any legal reporting duties. An incident report from a constable's office in Montgomery County said that law enforcement interviewed Svetlana Barnes and the children in 2018 regarding sexual assault concerns that she reported. A search warrant was subsequently executed on David Barnes' apartment in The Woodlands, but no charges were ever filed. ""I know my brother. I know that he loved his children and he would never do those things that she has accused him of,"" Aaron said. ""It was all made up to destroy him and to get the children away from him."" While David Barnes is not currently facing criminal charges in Texas, the same cannot be said for Svetlana Barnes, who was indicted in 2019 for interference with child custody, a felony. The Montgomery County Sheriff's Office alleged that despite a judgment allowing David Barnes to have partial custody of the two children, Svetlana Barnes ""failed to comply with any condition for travel outside of the United States with the children,"" and left the country with the boys on a Turkish Airlines flight from Houston to Istanbul on March 26, 2019. ""Svetlana Barnes still has yet to be arrested on the charge of interference with child custody, and the warrant for her arrest is still active,"" Blackburn said. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organization, considers March 26, 2019, to be the date on which the children disappeared. The organization, which published yellow global police notices containing pictures of the boys, still considers them missing. In an attempt to reach Svetlana Barnes for comment, ABC News sent an email to an address previously associated with her, but received an unsigned response from the email account that stated in part, ""as her attorney I won't recommend her talking to you."" The news that David Barnes is being detained in Russia has prompted calls for his release from many of those closest to him, including his employer. ""We continue to hope for his well-being and safe return home as soon as possible,"" Philip Ivy, vice president of Houston-based engineering firm KBR, said. David Barnes' arrest was covered by state media outlets in Russia, but has not previously made headlines in the U.S. In the months since he was taken into custody, Barnes has been visited by representatives of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, according to emails between his family and the State Department. A trial date has not yet been scheduled and his future remains uncertain. ""We are aware of reports of the arrest of a U.S. citizen in Moscow,"" a U.S. State Department spokesperson told ABC News. ""We take seriously our responsibility to assist U.S. citizens abroad, and are monitoring the situation. We stand ready to provide all appropriate consular services in cases where U.S. citizens are detained abroad."" Back in Huntsville, his family and friends are hoping that he will be able to rejoin them soon. ""I want to see his release,"" said his sister Margaret Aaron. ""He is being held there as guilty until they can prove him innocent, but there's nothing to hold him there, there's no evidence of anything, [and] he did not do anything. We would like some action taken for his freedom."" ""President Biden, if you could help David in any way, God bless you,"" said his friend Paul Carter. ""We want him back.""

Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday that Biden read Griner's handwritten letter, which was sent to the White House on Monday, and her note was ""very personal"" to him. ""I'm not going to share any personal interaction that I had with the president,"" Jean-Pierre told ABC News when asked about Biden's reaction. ""I just wanted to confirm that he did read the letter. And I will say again, this is very personal to him. Especially when someone writes a letter in such a personal way … we have made this a priority,"" she added. Jean-Pierre wouldn't say whether Biden was going to respond to Griner's letter. Griner personally reached out to Biden, urging him to help get her out of Russia -- where she has been held for some five months for allegedly possessing hashish oil -- according to her representatives. In the handwritten letter from Griner, portions of which were made public, she expressed fears she will be held in Russia ""forever.""

""I just don't have anything to share on what communication the president's going to have with Mrs. Griner and her family,"" Jean-Pierre told ABC News when asked about a potential meeting. ""All I can confirm is that he's read the letter, and he's making this a priority."" Last Friday marked the first day of Griner's trial in Russia. The Phoenix Mercury star appeared in person at a courtroom in Khimki, a suburb of Moscow, ABC News reported. The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained,"" meaning the U.S. will more aggressively work to negotiate her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department has said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained. Some officials are concerned that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing conflict. Griner's family and friends gathered at a vigil outside the Russian consulate in New York City ahead of her trial last week, calling on the U.S. to bring her home. Her next court appearance is on Thursday. Leaders and players in both the WNBA and the NBA have also called for Griner's release and raised awareness about her case, as have advocates. The WNBA, which kicked off its 2022 season on May 6, is honoring Griner with a floor decal bearing her initials and jersey number (42) on the sidelines of all 12 WNBA teams. The 6-foot-9 center won an NCAA title at Baylor in 2012; a WNBA title with Phoenix, her current team, in 2014; and gold medals with the U.S. women's team at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. Civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton said he wants Biden and Blinken to arrange a trip for faith leaders to see Griner in prison as part of a prayer visit. ""After speaking with her wife last week, I am deeply concerned for Brittney Griner's physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing,"" Sharpton said in a statement on Tuesday. ""She deserves to see the United States is doing something for her, so she can find the strength as this show trial goes on,"" he said. The public campaign to free Griner escalated following the release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed in April, who was freed from a Russian prison as part of a prisoner exchange. Former Marine Paul Whelan has also been detained in Russia since 2019. Jean-Pierre on Tuesday said that the Biden administration was working on both Griner and Whelan's cases just as hard as it done to secure Reed's freedom. ""We are going to make this happen,"" she said. An international prisoner swap potentially involving Griner, Whelan and convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout has been discussed, according to Russian media reports, but it's unclear if there has been any substantial movement on the issue. Russian officials have also indicated that they want Griner to stand trial. Asked about a potential swap, Jean-Pierre said she ""cannot speak to any discussions"" regarding the process of securing the release of any American detained abroad. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that secrecy is crucial to ensure that efforts to secure the release of Griner and others detained abroad are not jeopardized. ""While we update families -- and certainly in broad strokes -- on our efforts, it's not something that we are in a position to speak to publicly in any detail,"" Price told reporters on Tuesday. ""We do not want to do anything, we do not want to say anything, that would potentially jeopardize the chances of seeing an American released or that would delay by a single day, a single hour or a single minute the safe return of an American to her his family and loved ones back here,"" Price added.

Biden did not mention Johnson by name or his resignation explicitly, but underscored that the U.S. will continue to work with the U.K. government on critical issues, including the war in Ukraine -- an issue Biden and Johnson have worked closely on together. ""The United Kingdom and the United States are the closest of friends and Allies, and the special relationship between our people remains strong and enduring,"" Biden said in the statement. ""I look forward to continuing our close cooperation with the government of the United Kingdom, as well as our Allies and partners around the world, on a range of important priorities. That includes maintaining a strong and united approach to supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Putin's brutal war on their democracy, and holding Russia accountable for its actions."" Later Thursday, when departing the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony at the White House, Biden was asked by reporters if he had a reaction to Johnson's announcement. ""No, this is part of the process,"" he responded. Nevertheless, Johnson's resignation could complicate Biden's goal to strengthen the Western alliance in the face of Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The two spoke on the issue during a call in April, and ""affirmed their commitment to continue providing security and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in the face of ongoing atrocities by Russia,"" according to a White House readout of the conversation. The two leaders then met in June at a summit of G-7 countries, where they both urged nations to remain united against Russia amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The conflict, entering its fifth month, has roiled global energy markets. In his remarks Thursday announcing his resignation, Johnson cited Britain's support of Ukraine as a top achievement. ""I'm immensely proud of the achievements of this government, from getting Brexit done to settling our relations with the continent for over half a century … and, in the last few months, leading the West in standing up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's aggression in Ukraine,"" he said. ""And let me say now, to the people of Ukraine, that I know that we in the U.K. will continue to back your fight for freedom for as long as it takes,"" he added. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday that the administration doesn't believe Johnson's resignation will impact Biden's efforts to unite Europe. ""Our alliance with the United Kingdom continues to be strong,"" Jean-Pierres said. ""Our special relationship with the people in the country will continue to endure. None of that changes."" Jean-Pierre also pointed to Biden's recent meeting with NATO leaders in Madrid, where leaders made clear that Russia now poses the ""most significant threat to Allied security."" ""What you're seeing currently today, because of the leadership of this president, is a more unified NATO. I don't think that changes at all,"" Jean-Pierre said.

2022-07-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/reporters-notebook-mom-daughters-incredible-account-russian-missile/story?id=86359118,Reporter's Notebook: Mom and daughter's incredible account after Russian missile hit their apartment,"KYIV -- Their apartment shook when the first missile landed nearby. Ekaterina Volkova’s husband, Liosha, ran upstairs to check that she and their 7-year-old daughter Xenia were alright before going back downstairs to check on their dog, Ennie. Then it went black. Another Russian missile had struck their apartment. Suddenly, Ekaterina said she could feel herself falling, through the debris. Their family apartment at the very top of a modern eight-story block in central Kyiv was caving-in as thick acrid smoke billowed up and across the city skyline. Where they had laughed, played and enjoyed family meals, there was now a triangular-shaped hole of carnage. With acute pain running through her body, Ekaterina said her first wish was for “a quick death.” Then she heard a voice. “Mummy are you alive, are you here?” It was Xenia. Ekaterina, only able to breathe through her mouth because her nose was clogged-up with dust and crumbs of debris, struggled to talk. Amid the darkness she tried to reassure her daughter, unaware that their beloved husband and dad, Liosha, was dead. Earlier on that Sunday morning in late June, Russian pilots had launched several missiles, including the one which hit the Volkova family home. The Ukrainian military later said the cruise missiles had been fired from Russian bomber planes flying over the Caspian Sea. The Volkova’s family home was probably not the Russian pilot's intended target. A month earlier Russian missiles hit the same street where there is a factory that used to produce missiles though the use of the building today is unclear. However, the pilot's Russian commander who ordered the attack would have known that the risk of collateral damage in a crowded part of downtown Kyiv, and with it the death of innocent civilians, was very high. The Russian military launched the missiles regardless and now, 7-year-old Xenia, oblivious to the fact that she had just lost her dad, was trapped in a hellish nightmare under a ton of rubble. “Sometimes she was screaming. Screaming for someone to come and help”, Xenia's mother, Ekaterina, recalls. And although, externally, she was reassuring her daughter that someone would come, internally she felt fear -- fear that the smoldering ruins would ignite into more perilous flames. Ekaterina was also completely oblivious to what was going on outside as she and her daughter remained trapped inside a prison of dust and rubble. Ultimately, she feared nobody would come to save them and, in the time that passed, her thoughts overwhelmed her. At first she felt guilt. It had been her decision to return to Kyiv from Slovakia in May after the family had spent two months there while fleeing from Kyiv in the early stages of the war which had launched in February. But following the retreat of Russian troops from areas around Kyiv in early April, a semblance of normality quickly returned to the capital. Since then, Russian missile strikes on the capital have been few and far between. So, motivated by a yearning for their home and everything that comes with it, the Volkovas, like many others, travelled back to Kyiv. But, in that moment, the overriding thing on Ekaterina’s mind was maternal instinct and the survival of her only child. So when she heard faint voices, she gave Xenia the command. “I told her to scream”, she told ABC News from her hospital bed. “And she was screaming. And then I heard that they were able to hear her”. According to Ekaterina, it was then that a feeling of release came over her body even though her arm was still wedged underneath a big slab of concrete and, unbeknown to her at this point, her spine was fractured. But, more importantly to her, she was quite sure by now that her daughter did not have any life-threatening injuries. A team of professionals were now working frantically to get to the victims of the blast and while the rescue mission unfolded inside, my ABC News colleagues and I were watching from outside the building as Ukrainian firefighters were quickly winched-up, high onto the wreckage of their apartment building. The rescue team’s videos from inside the building as they worked their way through the rubble to get to Xenia and Ekaterina provide a valuable insight into the bravery, expertise and professionalism of the men and women involved. Ekaterina could hear every part of the process to free her daughter and -- at one moment -- she felt it too. The fire crew had to move a wall or heavy panel to slide Xenia’s small body out. But in the process it increased the pressure that the debris was exerting on Ekaterina’s head. It was “making my head smaller and smaller,” Ekaterina said. At one point she had to scream out for the rescue team to pause, pleading with them to think about trying to free Xenia in a different way. But her strength as mom came through. “I tried not to scream. I was telling myself, come on, it’s your child, so let them do their job,” she continued. But when 7-year-old Xenia was excavated from the rubble and completely covered in dust, her confused expression spoke only of acute trauma and shock. Ekaterina says that in the days since, she has not seen her daughter cry. “I think it’s still deep inside,"" she said. ""There is still quite some mental health recovery needed.” Back at the apartment building, four hours after the missile hit the family’s home, a badly-injured but conscious Ekaterina, also showered in gray dust and debris, was stretchered out of the building. 35-year-old Ekaterina says she is deeply grateful to the team from the Kyiv State Emergency Service who rescued her and her daughter and two of the team, firefighters Maksym Khorunzhyy and Artur Morkotenko, even visited the pair this past week just before they were discharged from hospital. The missile that struck their building, however, managed to destroy virtually all of the family’s possessions. Maksym and Artur, however, were able to recover something from the wreckage for Ekaterina and Xenia. One of the few things that were salvaged from the wreckage of their home? Xenia's favorite sparkly dancing dress. They also gave Xenia a stuffed animal of a dog -- a gesture in recognition of the fact that Ennie -- the family’s beloved beagle -- was also killed by the blast. And what about Ekaterina’s feelings towards her country of birth? The country which fired the missile that killed her husband, her dog, destroyed her home and virtually all of her possessions and left her badly injured and her daughter psychologically scarred. Russia, and by which she means the regime of Vladimir Putin as well as the population at large, “does not care” who they kill, said Ekaterina. Factors like nationality, children, women, “do not matter for them. They just shoot.” Like other residents of Ukraine who have Russian family members who consume Russian state media, some of her relatives don’t recognize that Russia’s invasion has killed many civilians in Ukraine. A data-driven group, ACLED, estimates that around 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed by the war. Ekaterina says she believes that within the walls of most Russian people’s own parallel world, the truth would be too painful for them to take. She pleads to Western nations to keep supplying Ukraine with more weapons because she feels like most Ukrainians, that the days of talking with Vladimir Putin are done. For her, it is obvious that Russia is trying to destroy an independent and free Ukraine. Ekaterina now says she shrugs at those who promote Kremlin propaganda and lies on social media and falsely claim that the inhumane and deep suffering inflicted on her family was fake. For the record, Ekaterina’s and Xenia’s scars are real. But, for now, she is not thinking about the future She is fighting every day to get better as she lays bed-ridden healing from the injuries suffered in the blast. Doctors, however, believe she will walk normally again. She also says that she will not renew her Russian passport which recently expired or return to the country of her birth, where her mother still lives because she does not want to “look into the faces of some people” who do not accept the reality of what is happening in Ukraine. She says she feels the strength of her dead husband, Liosha, and she remembers his “humor, fun, sarcasm and sometimes black humor. People were in love with him and he was in love with life.” She focuses on the positives, however small they may be, like the fact that the family’s cats were not found in the rubble of their apartment. It gives her hope that the cats were scared away by the first missile landing and might return to Xenia and Ekaterina one day. For the hospital staff, however, they are “super heroes who survived.” Said Anastasia Mageramova from Kyiv’s Childrens Hospital, who cared for them both in the days following the horrific events of Sunday, June 26: “Ekaterina is a symbol of strength, she’s a symbol of hope and she’s a symbol of Ukraine today.”",22
2022-07-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-calls-china-biggest-us-threat-authorities/story?id=86336590,FBI director calls China 'biggest' US threat; authorities warn of North Korean cyber attacks,"Speaking alongside his British counterpart in London on Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray called China the ""biggest long-term threat"" to both the U.S. and the U.K. ""The Chinese government is set on stealing your technology -- whatever it is that makes your industry tick -- and using it to undercut your business and dominate your market,"" Wray said while giving remarks to international business leaders. ""And they're set on using every tool at their disposal to do it."" Wray also warned of potential tactics by Chinese officials, saying they steal technology by using intelligence officers to ""target"" valuable pieces of information and companies. ""We've even caught people affiliated with Chinese companies out in the U.S. heartland, sneaking into fields to dig up proprietary, genetically modified seeds, which would have cost them nearly a decade and billions in research to develop themselves,"" Wray said. ""And those efforts pale in comparison to their lavishly-resourced hacking program that's bigger than that of every other major country combined."" The Chinese, Wray said, use cyber to ""steal"" volumes of information. He said U.S. officials are working with MI5, the British intelligence service, to identify other investments that the Chinese government makes in proxy relationships -- a kind of third-party venue through which China steals information. Wray said that U.S. companies should be wary of working with or in China, something about which he has warned before, and he urged business leaders to contact the FBI for further information on ways to mitigate the Chinese cyber threat. His warning was the latest episode of the U.S. pushing back on what they describe as Chinese hostility. Relations between the U.S. and China have evolved since President Joe Biden took office -- his predecessor Donald Trump embarked on a trade war with the country -- and the U.S. and China remain deeply intertwined, though they are often opposed on various issues. After one call between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this year, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry said, ""The U.S.-China relationship has not yet emerged from the predicament created by the previous U.S. administration but has instead encountered more and more challenges. The U.S. side has made a misreading and misjudgment of China's strategic intentions."" On Wednesday, Wray warned that if China were to invade Taiwan, U.S. companies could see a repeat, on a much larger scale, of the economic disarray from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting international condemnation. ""Just as in Russia, Western investments built over years could become hostage capital stranded, supply chains and relationships disrupted,"" he said. ""Companies are caught between sanctions and Chinese law forbidding compliance with them. That's not just geopolitics. It's business forecasting."" Wray concluded by saying the U.S. and U.K. were working together to combat this threat. His remarks come as American law enforcement agencies and the Treasury Department cautioned the public of another overseas adversary, this one targeting hospital systems. North Korean-backed cyber actors are targeting the health care and public health sector, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the FBI and Treasury Department said on Wednesday. These actors use Maui ransomware, a specific technology that has a North Korean hallmark, to infiltrate health care sectors and hold their systems ransom in exchange for a payment, American officials said in an advisory. The officials said that since May 2021, the agencies have observed and reacted to ""multiple"" Maui ransomware incidents indicating that they came from North Korea. ""North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors used Maui ransomware in these incidents to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services—including electronic health records services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet services,"" the advisory states. ""In some cases, these incidents disrupted the services provided by the targeted HPH Sector organizations for prolonged periods."" The agencies believe that because health care organizations ""provide services that are critical to human life and health,"" they are likely to pay ransoms when attacked. Law enforcement advise not paying the ransom and to contact CISA or the FBI instead. ""Because of this assumption, the FBI, CISA, and Treasury assess North Korean state-sponsored actors are likely to continue targeting HPH Sector organizations,"" the officials said.",12
2022-07-07,https://abcnews.go.com/US/prime-minister-boris-johnson-resigns-amid-scandal/story?id=86371742,What happens next after Prime Minister Boris Johnson resigns amid scandal?,"LONDON -- After more than 50 resignations from government ministers and aides, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation Thursday. For a moment on Tuesday evening, it seemed as though the prime minister, who had vowed to carry on despite the collapse of his authority and allies deserting him on all sides, would remain in office, sparking a potential constitutional crisis. But outside Downing Street on Thursday, Johnson caved into the pressure. Soon enough, from within their ranks, the Conservative Party, who still hold a sizeable majority in the U.K. Parliament, will elect a replacement, and that person will become the fourth prime minister in the six years since the Brexit referendum of 2016. While he did not specifically use the word ""resign,"" Johnson said, ""The process of choosing that new leader should begin now and the timetable will be announced next week."" In the election process, Conservative MPs nominate their preferred candidate. There is then a run-off with the two most popular candidates, and then Conservative Party members (of the card-carrying, fee-paying kind), vote on who they want to be the next leader. As the Conservatives have a majority in Parliament (thanks to Johnson's big election win in 2019) -- the winner of their leadership will become the next prime minister. Reported polls in the U.K. have suggested Ben Wallace, the U.K.'s current secretary of state for defense who has been widely praised for his handling of support for Ukraine, as an early favorite in the race. But the process is by no means instant. To put the transition into perspective, when Theresa May announced her resignation on the steps of Downing Street on May 24, 2019, Johnson, her successor, did not take office until July 24 -- a gap of two months. Boris Johnson has already appointed new ministers to fill some of the gaps left by the dozens of resignations from his government, in a sign that he will attempt to hold true on his promise to stay in charge until a new leader is elected. However, his resignation speech has not gone down well with embittered members of his party. He has already been accused of arrogance and blaming others for his own faults, instead of facing up to any of the mistakes that led to his departure. And such is the nature of Johnson's acrimonious departure, and his defiance in the face of so many calls to resign, that some lawmakers -- both Conservative and in the opposition Labour Party -- want him gone now. The Conservative Party may feel that they need a clean slate, and, even on his way out, Johnson may hurt their chances of re-establishing trust with the country. There are indications already that the prime minister sees himself staying in office until the fall. A former Conservative Prime Minister, John Major, has already expressed that Johnson should be removed as soon as possible. The opposition Labour Party have said they will call for a vote in Parliament to eject him from if Johnson's removal does not happen. In that event, Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, would take over as prime minister interim until they appoint a new leader. Johnson will always be known at home and on the international stage as one of the main architects of Brexit. He was the face of the campaign to leave the EU in 2016, and as prime minister, secured Britain's exit from the bloc by winning a huge majority in 2019. His election victories and unconventional style resonated with the public on the campaign trail, exemplified by the two terms he served as Mayor of London before his time in parliament, surprising in a Labour city. But controversy has always followed him. ""Partygate"" proved a further stain on his reputation, presiding, to many, over a culture of drinking and lawbreaking while the country was locked down and families were separated from their loved ones, even after he spent time in the ICU with COVID himself. When he was fined by the Metropolitan Police for attending one of those gatherings he became the only sitting British PM in history to have been censured for breaking the law while in office. Johnson also denied that he had knowledge of a lawmaker's alleged past misconduct, which he had been told about in 2019, and then promoted him anyway, only for that colleague to repeat his offence. Johnson's authority was wounded by ""Partygate,"" but the latest scandal proved to be the straw the broke the camel's back.",3
2022-07-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/brittney-griner-russian-court-pressure-mounts-white-house/story?id=86300919,Brittney Griner says she's guilty in Russian court and vape cartridges were in her luggage unintentionally,"WNBA star Brittney Griner said she ""would like to plead guilty"" Thursday morning on drug charges in a Russian court, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage unintentionally. Griner said that she was guilty when asked if she would like to give testimony. ABC News was present inside the courtroom during the hearing. Griner added that she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law, adding that she was is in a rush and did not mean to leave the cartridges in her bag. Griner is expected to appear in court on July 14 for the third day of her trial. The WNBA star's trial, which is taking place in Khimki -- a suburb of Moscow -- began last Friday, more than 4 1/2 months after Griner was detained. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was visiting Russia to play basketball in the off-season when she was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport on Feb. 17 after being accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. Her legal team told ABC News in a statement on Thursday that her ""guilty"" plea was informed by a discussion with her Russian attorneys. ""Brittney sets an example of being brave. She decided to take full responsibility for her actions as she knows that she is a role model for many people,"" they said in the statement. ""Considering the nature of her case, the insignificant amount of the substance and BG’s personality and history of positive contributions to global and Russian sport, the defense hopes that the plea will be considered by the court as a mitigating factor and there will be no severe sentence.” Griner's detention was extended repeatedly, most recently through Dec. 20, which was the expected length of her trial. If convicted, Griner, 31, faces up to 10 years in prison and also has a right to an appeal. The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained,"" meaning the U.S. will more aggressively work to negotiate her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department has said. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Thursday that Griner’s guilty plea will have “no impact” on any of the negotiations to bring her home to the U.S. “We’re going to do everything that we can to bring home Brittney Griner safely, and to also make sure that we bring Paul Whelan back home as well,"" Jean-Pierre said. Following Griner's appearance in Russian court on Thursday, the U.S.' National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson maintained in a statement that Griner is ""wrongfully detained"" and being held ""under intolerable circumstances."" ""At the President’s direction, the U.S. government continues to work aggressively, pursuing every avenue, to bring her home safely to her family, friends, and loved ones as soon as possible,"" Watson said. ""We will continue that work to secure Brittney’s release, as well as the release of Paul Whelan and other U.S. nationals who are wrongfully detained or held hostage in Russia and around the world,"" she added. Representatives of the U.S. Embassy, as well as two representatives from Russian and foreign media, were allowed into the courtroom. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a tweet on Thursday that the U.S. officials who attended the trial delivered a letter to Griner from President Joe Biden in response to a letter that the WNBA star wrote to the president earlier this week asking for his help. ""We will not relent until Brittney, Paul Whelan, and all other wrongfully detained Americans are reunited with their loved ones,"" Blinken wrote. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris called Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, to discuss efforts to release the WNBA star, according to the White House. ""The president called Cherelle to reassure her that he is working to secure Brittney's release as soon as possible, as well as the release of Paul Whelan and other U.S. nationals who are wrongfully detained or held hostage in Russia and around the world,"" the White House said in a statement released Wednesday. The call came months after Cherelle Griner publicly expressed interest in speaking with Biden about her wife's case in a May interview with ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts. ""I just keep hearing that, you know, he has the power. She's a political pawn,"" Cherelle Griner said in May. ""So if they're holding her because they want you to do something, then I want you to do it."" The first witness at Griner's trial last Friday was a customs officer who was at the airport when she was arrested. A second unidentified witness was also questioned by prosecutors behind closed doors, according to The Associated Press. Meanwhile, two others failed to appear, so the trial was adjourned for the day. Griner's attorney, Alexander Boykov, declined to comment ""on the specifics of the case and on the charges,"" telling reporters outside the courtroom last Friday that it was too early to do so, according to The AP. Russia's invasion of Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained. Some officials are concerned that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing conflict. Griner, who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, personally reached out to Biden in a handwritten letter that the White House received on Monday, urging the president to help her get out of Russia. ""As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey or any accomplishments, I'm terrified I might be here forever,"" Griner wrote to the president. ""It hurts thinking about how I usually celebrate [the Fourth of July] because freedom means something completely different to me this year,"" she added. Biden shared a draft of the letter her wrote to Birttney Griner with Cherelle Griner during their call, according to the White House. Cherelle Griner said in a message posted to her Instagram account on Wednesday that she was ""grateful"" for the call she received from Biden and Harris and vowed to keep speaking out until her wife is back home. ""While I will remain concerned and outspoken until she is back home, I am hopeful in knowing that the President read my wife’s letter and took the time to respond. I know BG will be able to find comfort in knowing she has not been forgotten. I want to thank everyone who has fought so hard for BG. It means the world to my entire family as well as my wife,"" she wrote. ""Please continue to pray for my family and all the other families of the wrongfully detained, as our pain remains active until our loved ones are brought home. Let’s continue to use our voices to speak the names of all the wrongfully detained American and support the Administration as they do what it takes to bring them home today."" Jean-Pierre told ABC’s Rachel Scott that Biden was “deeply moved” by Griner’s letter to him this week, but still wouldn’t say what the president wrote in his response letter. Calls to free Brittney Griner escalated following the release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed last month, who was freed from a Russian prison as part of a prisoner exchange. Former Marine Paul Whelan has also been detained in Russia since 2019. Reed's family met with Biden after they protested outside the White House, but Whelan's has yet to meet or speak directly with Biden despite their outreach. Jean-Pierre said just yesterday White House staff joined a special presidential envoy for hostage affairs on a call Elizabeth Whelan, who has also received calls from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan to offer support and “reaffirm the president’s commitment to bringing Paul home.” Asked by ABC News how the White House can assure Whelan's family that he is not forgotten, Jean-Pierre said, the administration wants to ""assure"" the Whelan and Griner families that Biden will use ""every means that we have"" to bring them home. ""Clearly, we cannot negotiate in public. That is not something that we’re going to do. But, we’re committed to making sure they all get home safely,"" she said.

""They do not like Americans and they don't try to hide that,"" Reed, 30, told ABC News in an interview airing Friday on ""Good Morning America."" The U.S. Marine veteran was imprisoned in Russia for nearly three years. Reed, a Texas native, was arrested in Moscow in the summer of 2019 while visiting his Russian girlfriend. Russian authorities accused him of assaulting officers while being driven to a police station after a night of heavy drinking. He was convicted by a Russian court in mid-2020 and sentenced to nine years in a prison camp. ""There's pretty horrible conditions there,"" Reed said. ""Some of those places don't have a toilet -- there's just a hole in the floor for where the toilet should be."" ""There's rats, [the] food there could be, you know, really bad,"" he added. ""In the summer, it's very hot there. There's no air conditioning obviously, or even fans inside of those cells."" Reed was ultimately freed on April 27 as part of a prisoner swap agreed between the United States and Russia. ""The real fear that you have that just kind of sits on you like this weight the whole time, is that, you know, you could be there forever,"" he said. Griner, who plays professional basketball for the Phoenix Mercury, was returning to Russia to play in the off-season when she was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport near Moscow on Feb. 17, after being accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. On Thursday, the two-time Olympic gold medalist pleaded guilty to drug possession charges on the second day of her trial in a Russian court. Griner, 31, also told the court that she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law, adding that she was in a rush when packing and did not mean to leave the cartridges in her bag. The trial was then adjourned until July 14. Her detention has been extended repeatedly, most recently through Dec. 20, which was the expected length of her trial.

Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine and Michigan-based corporate security executive, has been detained in Russia since his December 2018 arrest on espionage charges, which both he and the U.S. government claim are false. Whelan, 52, was left out of the April prisoner exchange that led to Reed's release. Reed said the Biden administration is ""not doing enough"" to free Griner and Whelan. ""I hope that President Biden and his administration will do everything possible to get both, you know, Brittney and Paul out of Russia, and that they will do that immediately,"" he told ABC News. ""Because every day that, you know, they sit here and wait to make a decision is one more day that, you know, Paul and Brittney are suffering."" Reed noted that freeing Whelan ""needs to be the no. 1 priority there, just simply based off of the fact that he's been there the longest."" He also criticized the Biden administration for contacting Griner's family but not Whelan's. ""They called Brittney's family, and I'm extremely excited that they did that. I think that's a step in the right direction,"" Reed said. ""But, at the same time, they did not contact Paul Whelan's family and he's been there for longer than I was even in Russia."" During a news briefing Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say whether Biden has plans to call Whelan's family, telling reporters that she didn't have a telephone call to ""announce or preview."" But she described regular contact between the Biden administration and the Whelans. ""The president is getting regularly updated,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters. ""This is top of mind.""

2022-07-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-braces-trumpy-moments-ahead-note/story?id=86393762,GOP braces for more Trumpy moments ahead: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Four months to the day from the midterms, close to everything is breaking Republicans' way -- from polling to the issue set, and even the infighting that leaves Democrats arguing with each other instead of with the party looking to oust them from power. Enter, again, Donald Trump. The former president is about to have another moment or three -- some in ways he is choosing, others in ways he can't control. Friday will bring the first of back-to-back days where Trump will be campaigning for favored candidates, first in Nevada and then Saturday in Alaska. Just hours earlier, Trump's former White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, will be under oath and on camera in front of the House Jan. 6 committee, ahead of the next round of public hearings next week. That plays out ahead of what might be the most consequential series of primary contests all year, where Trump is looking to stamp out embers of Republican resistance across a range of races. The stretch of races will culminate in efforts to defeat Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. -- the vice chairman of the Jan. 6 committee -- in her Aug. 16 primary. Even as new headlines call into question the electability of Trump's endorsed candidates in Georgia and Pennsylvania, he's joining new fights in Arizona that pit him against the endorsed candidate of Gov. Doug Ducey, R-Ariz. Speculation continues to run strong that the former president will announce plans to run again sooner rather than later. But whether that happens or not, the ways that Trump is running now -- in addition to what his team is running from -- linger for the Republican Party. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The influence of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on November's elections in the Sunshine State will extend beyond his name on the ballot. DeSantis, who is running for reelection, announced his pick to run his agency designed to investigate voting crimes. The agency's creation was spurred by false claims of fraud espoused by Republicans, including DeSantis, following former President Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 election. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. DeSantis has tapped former state prosecutor and Broward County elections supervisor Pete Antonacci for the job. He'll helm the Office of Election Crimes and Security, which will employ more than 30 people and have a budget of $3.5 million, despite DeSantis' previous acknowledgment that there were few instances of voter fraud in Florida in 2020. In a move some consider unorthodox, DeSantis is weighing in on school board races. In June, he rolled out a wave of school board endorsements. Those endorsements came after candidates filled out a survey about the governor's controversial agenda on education. The survey concluded with a pledge for candidates to ""stand with Ron DeSantis"" and among other things, ""keep woke gender ideology out of schools,"" ""reject the use of critical race theory"" and ""educate, not indoctrinate."" ""We need strong local school board members who are committed to advancing our agenda to put students first and protect parents' rights,"" DeSantis said on Twitter. Cementing that influence will not only be important for DeSantis through the midterms but also as he potentially charts his course toward a 2024 presidential run. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Nearly two months after Pennsylvania's high-profile primary elections, Senate candidates in one of the nation's top-billed contests have largely taken their campaigning off the trail and online. Throughout the summer political lull, Democratic candidate Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Republican candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz have navigated the initial stages of the general election by narrowing their respective policy focuses while trading jabs on social media. Although it remains unclear when Fetterman will physically return to the campaign trail after suffering a stroke in May, he's remained active on Twitter with a steady stream of memes and comebacks blasting Oz over his residency status. The latest move came on Wednesday in response to a video Oz tweeted, in which he criticized Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney for saying he will ""be happy"" when he is no longer mayor during a press conference following a shooting in the state's capital over the holiday weekend. Soon after, Kenney walked back the statement in a local news interview and attributed it to expressing frustration at the violent event. While calling for Kenney's resignation, Oz also took a swipe at his opponent, saying, ""The far-left ideology of Kenney, [District Attorney] Krasner and John Fetterman, put criminals ahead of the community, victims and all of our safety."" Oz did not mention Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro, who recently earned the backing of several Pennsylvania Republicans over GOP candidate Doug Mastriano. ""Pro tip: don't film an ad for your PA senate campaign from your mansion in New Jersey,"" Fetterman fired back in a tweet posted alongside photos from a 2020 magazine feature of the doctor's Cliffside Park, N.J., home tour. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 27. That's the percentage of Americans who have confidence in the 14 institutions that Gallup regularly asks about -- the lowest level of reported trust in institutions since Gallup began the survey in 1979. And as FiveThirtyEight's Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux and Zoha Qamar write, this could be a real problem for democracy, as a lack of trust in government institutions can breed a whole host of problems, ranging from distrust in our elections and elected officials, to violence.

2022-07-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-biden-calls-paul-whelans-sister-mounting-pressure/story?id=86491538,President Biden calls Paul Whelan's sister after mounting pressure from family,"President Joe Biden called the sister of Paul Whelan on Friday to reaffirm his commitment to bringing the former Marine home from Russia, according to a White House official, marking the first time the family has been contacted by the president. ""Today, President Biden called Elizabeth Whelan, the sister of Paul Whelan who has been wrongfully detained by Russia since 2018,"" a White House official said. The call comes two days after his sister voiced her disappointment on Twitter after learning that the president and vice president had called the wife of Brittney Griner, a WNBA star who has been detained in Russia since Feb. 17. ""Still looking for that press release saying @POTUS has spoken to anyone in OUR family about #PaulWhelan, wrongfully detained in #Russia for 3.5 years,"" Elizabeth Whelan said on Twitter on Wednesday. During their call on Friday, Biden ""reaffirmed that he is committed to bringing Paul home as soon as possible, and the U.S. government will continue its efforts to secure the release of Paul as well as Brittney Griner and all other Americans who are held hostage or wrongfully detained around the world,"" a White House official said. ""The U.S. government will continue to be in regular contact with Paul’s family, and with the families of other Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad, to provide support and assistance and keep them updated on efforts to secure the release of their loved ones,"" the official said. Paul Whelan's twin brother, David Whelan, told ABC News that the family wasn't expecting the call -- and that his sister was on a noisy New York street when it happened. He said the call is especially meaningful for their parents. On Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that White House officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken had been in contact with Elizabeth Whelan. ABC News' Rachel Scott pressed Jean-Pierre on what it takes to get a meeting or phone call from the president to try and help someone get released from Russian custody and how this administration can assure the Whelan family that their pleas are being heard and taken seriously. ""We want to assure them, the Whelans and the Griner family, and all other ... U.S. nationals who are being wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad that this president is doing everything that he can to make sure that they come home safely,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""We're going to use any – every means that we have. Clearly, we cannot negotiate in public. That is not something that we're going to do. But, we're committed to making sure they all get home safely."" Paul Whelan, 52, a corporate security executive, was arrested in December 2018 while visiting Moscow for a friend's wedding and charged with espionage by Russian intelligence officials. In June 2020, he was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian prison camp. Paul Whelan and American officials have denied the charges, and his family has continued to call for his release. In April, another former Marine -- Trevor Reed -- was freed after being imprisoned in Russia for nearly three years as part of a prisoner swap agreed upon between the U.S. and Russia. Reed, 30, was arrested in Moscow in the summer of 2019 while visiting his Russian girlfriend. Russian authorities accused him of assaulting officers while being driven to a police station after a night of heavy drinking. He was convicted by a Russian court in mid-2020 and sentenced to nine years in a prison camp. ""The real fear that you have that just kind of sits on you like this weight the whole time, is that, you know, you could be there forever,"" Reed told ""Good Morning America"" in an interview that aired Friday. Griner's trial is ongoing. The two-time Olympic gold medalist pleaded guilty this week on drug charges in a Russian court, saying that vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage unintentionally. Her legal team told ABC News in a statement on Thursday that her ""guilty"" plea was informed by a discussion with her Russian attorneys. If convicted, Griner, 31, faces up to 10 years in prison. Amid renewed attention on Whelan's case, his family remains hopeful that President Biden will be able to bring him home. ""I think he is a good and kind person, and he will make the decision to bring Paul home when there is an opportunity to do so,"" David Whelan said on Friday's episode of ABC's daily news podcast ""Start Here.""

2022-07-09,https://abcnews.go.com/International/gov-bill-richardson-travel-moscow-talks-freeing-brittney/story?id=86531091,Former Gov. Bill Richardson to travel to Moscow for talks on freeing Brittney Griner: Source,"Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson is planning to travel to Russia in the near future for talks aimed at finding a deal to free the detained WNBA star Brittney Griner, a source with knowledge of the proposed trip told ABC News. Richardson, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary in the Clinton administration, played a role in achieving a prisoner exchange in April that saw Russia release former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed after nearly two and a half years in captivity. He is expected to go to Moscow in the next couple of weeks, according to the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Russia has repeatedly suggested it's interested in trading Griner for Russians held in U.S. prisons. The new trip appears aimed at seeing if a similar deal to the one that freed Reed could be produced for Griner. Richardson’s office did not confirm the potential visit, telling ABC News “we are unable to comment on this at the moment.” “What I can say (and is publicly known) is both the Whelan and Griner families have asked us to help with the release of their loved ones,” Mickey Bergman, executive director at the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, told ABC News in an email. Richardson is currently representing the Griner family as well as the family of Paul Whelan, the other former Marine held by Russia for three and a half years. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in basketball, has been in detention in Russia since mid-February after she was stopped at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport and accused by Russian authorities of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. This week, Griner told a Moscow court she would like to plead guilty to the charges, saying she had brought the vape cartridges into Russia unintentionally, explaining she had not meant to leave them in her bag. The Biden administration has classified Griner as “wrongfully detained” and American officials believe Russia seized her, like Whelan and Reed, to use as bargaining chips with the U.S. Richardson’s possible trip comes amid speculation whether the U.S. would be willing to make another prisoner swap to free Griner. The Biden administration has said it is committed to negotiating with Russia for Griner’s release but it has refused to comment on whether it is considering any trade. Asked to comment on Richardson's potential visit, the White House National Security Council told ABC it was in contact with Richardson and valued his efforts, but declined to say more. “NSC leadership are in touch with Bill Richardson. We appreciate his commitment to getting Americans home and are pursuing the release of Brittney and Paul through government channels,” NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement. Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, said she had requested Richardson's team's help and would support a trip if it took place. “We asked the Richardson Center to help and I’m encouraged that he might be going,” Cherelle Griner said in a statement to ABC through Griner’s agent Lindsay Colas. Richardson has a long history of working to free Americans wrongfully detained overseas. Through his nonprofit, the Richardson Center, he has helped return U.S. citizens imprisoned in Iran and North Korea among others. His team represented Trevor Reed’s family and spent months engaged in shuttle diplomacy trying to outline a possible deal to free him. Richardson even flew to Moscow on the eve of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in a last ditch effort to persuade Russia to make a trade. Richardson does not represent the White House. In Reed’s case, he approached Russia’s government and the Biden administration separately to try to feel out what both sides might accept as any possible deal. He then relayed what he had heard back to both sides. In the end, the prisoner trade the White House made for Reed was the same one Richardson had been advocating for: releasing Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot serving a U.S. prison sentence for drug smuggling. Richardson has since encouraged the Biden administration to consider making similar deals for Griner and Paul Whelan. Following Griner’s court appearance on Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said it was ""going to do everything that we can to bring home Brittney Griner safely, and to also make sure that we bring Paul Whelan back home as well."" Jean-Pierre said Griner's guilty plea would have ""no impact"" on the efforts to negotiate her release. Russian state media and officials have repeatedly floated trading Griner or Whelan for Viktor Bout, the Russian arms dealer, dubbed “the Merchant of Death” in the media and who is currently serving a 25 year sentence on narco-terrorism charges. Trevor Reed and his family have called on the Biden administration to exchange Bout if it would free Whelan and Griner. Speaking to ABC News this week, Reed urged President Joe Biden to do more. ""I hope that President Biden and his administration will do everything possible to get both, you know, Brittney and Paul out of Russia, and that they will do that immediately,"" he told ABC News. ""Because every day that, you know, they sit here and wait to make a decision is one more day that, you know, Paul and Brittney are suffering.""",20
2022-07-09,https://abcnews.go.com/US/paul-whelans-brother-speaks-russian-detention-us-government/story?id=86442752,"Paul Whelan’s brother speaks on his Russian detention, US government response","The twin brother of Paul Whelan, the former U.S. Marine detained in Russia on espionage charges, said he had mixed feelings about the responses to the cases involving Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner in comparison to his brother. Reed, another former U.S. Marine who was released from a Russian prison in April after serving nearly three years, told Good Morning America that the Biden administration is ""not doing enough"" for Paul Whelan and Griner, an American WNBA player and Olympic athlete that was detained in February on drug charges. Speaking about Reed’s recent release, David Whelan described his “mixed feelings.” “You're thrilled for Trevor Reed, and I would be thrilled for Brittney Griner if she was able to go home too,” David Whelan told ABC News' podcast ""Start Here,"" and continued “separately from whether Paul gets to go home or not.” “It's a devastating call to have to make to our parents for Paul,” he added, “to tell him he was left behind once, and maybe we might have to have that conversation a second time.” David Whelan said that during the phone call, his brother was “very angry and very upset” and said “why was I left behind?” During a press briefing Thursday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre addressed Paul Whelan's detainment and that of others. . “This President is doing everything that he can to make sure that they come home safely,” said Jean-Pierre. “We’re going to use any — every means that we have.” Paul Whelan was detained in Russia in December 2018 and accused of spying. His brother said he was in Moscow for a friend's wedding and was given a USB drive. “I think one of the challenges for any wrongfully detained family is what are you going to do?” David Whelan said.. “What are you going to sacrifice?” “One of the friends that he had made in Russia visited him the night of the wedding right before the wedding happened, and gave Paul USB,” he said. “As soon as he was given the USB stick and put it in his pocket, his door was opened by the FSB. And he was arrested.” Paul Whelan pleaded not guilty, claiming it was a sting operation and that he thought the USB drive contained holiday photos. In June 2020, he was found guilty and sentenced to 16 years of “hard labor” in a Russian prison. Before the Biden administration, the response of the White House to his brothers’ detainment was “radio silence,” said David Whelan. “Since January or February 2021, we've had a huge change.” At one point, David Whelan said that somebody in the State Department asked his family to “make more noise” about Paul Whelan’s detention. “We mostly pointed back at them and say, ‘Why would you ask a family to have to take on this responsibility,’” said David Whelan. Asked by ABC News’ Brad Mielke to speak about the overlaps between the three cases, David Whelan said that “each of these cases is distinct. And each of them has different requirements. And so the resources that the U.S. government brings to bear on each case is going to be different.” Later in the interview, he added, “I would hope that the U.S. government would look deep to find out what that concession is that they could make and to make it there. There's got to be something that they can do.” President Biden called Paul and David Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth Whelan, Friday to reaffirm his commitment to bringing the former marine home. ""Today, President Biden called Elizabeth Whelan, the sister of Paul Whelan who has been wrongfully detained by Russia since 2018,"" a White House official said.",2
2022-07-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jan-dot-connecting-offers-guarantees-political-impact-note/story?id=86565493,Jan. 6 dot-connecting offers no guarantees of political impact: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Connecting dots does not necessarily mark a straight line that leads to political impact. This is a hugely consequential week for the House Jan. 6 committee, with its final series of public hearings expected to shed more light on former President Donald Trump's actions, as well as the connections Trump and his team had to extremist groups that massed in Washington, D.C. But blockbuster revelations -- even as supplemented by testimony from former White House counsel Pat Cipollone, and possible testimony from Steve Bannon -- have done practically nothing to change immediate political calculations. With a vital stretch of primaries ahead, precious few Republicans beyond Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. -- who is vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee -- are betting their futures on the proposition that voters are ready to reject Trump and what he stands for. One who did try that path, Rep. Tom Rice, R-S.C., got trounced in his primary last month. Another who chose not to risk reelection in that environment, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., is practically conceding that the time horizon of the current election cycle isn't long enough to see a real impact from demonstrating how wrong Trump's actions were. ""On the margins, yes, it is puncturing through. And I think what's most important is, again, what does history say in five or 10 years?"" Kinzinger said on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos."" Kinzinger -- who, like Cheney, serves on the Jan. 6 committee -- made a bold prediction: ""I can get about as close as I can to guaranteeing that, in about 10 years, there's not going to have been a single Trump supporter that exists anywhere in the country."" Similar claims from anti-Trump Republicans, using different metrics of time, have proven laughably incorrect. It might be more likely that, within an election cycle or two, there won't be any Republicans remaining in Congress who don't profess loyalties to Trump. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper A better-than-expected jobs report last week coupled with slowly falling gas prices signal positive economic progress for the Biden administration -- yet fears of a recession remain. Despite the job market's continued strength, inflation is still at a 40-year high and the Federal Reserve could continue hiking interest rates in an effort to cool the economy (and rising costs), which has fueled worries of a painful slowdown. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, like other members of Joe Biden's team, is trying to calm those concerns. ""I think it's normal to think that as we continue to come out of the pandemic, we will transition to a more to a robust growth but a more steady growth. So I do think at some point, you know, we will see a less rapid growth in the economy, but I don't see any reason to think that we will have a serious recession,"" Raimondo said Sunday to ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. The concerns about high prices -- particularly at the pump -- continue to be a priority for the White House. Though the cost of gas has fallen over the past month, the national average is at an expensive $4.72, according to AAA. Gas will be a topic of discussion on President Biden's trip to Saudi Arabia this week. ""Its energy resources are vital for mitigating the impact on global supplies of Russia's war in Ukraine,"" Biden wrote in a Washington Post column on Sunday. Relief for high prices across the board will be an important factor for Democrats heading into November's high-stakes midterm elections, as a host of polling has shown that the economy and inflation are still top of mind as Americans come closer to casting their ballots. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The contours of 2024's potential political battles are already taking shape four months ahead of the midterms. For months, high-profile Republicans have been making their way around perennial presidential battlegrounds and, more recently, a top Democratic governor appeared to inch closer toward raising his national profile while President Biden reiterates that he plans to run for a second term. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is the latest Republican slated to make the political pilgrimage to New Hampshire, where the nation's first presidential primaries are held. During his upcoming trip, the blue-state conservative plans to highlight his inflation relief plan. ""I'm hopeful that Donald Trump won't be running and won't be the nominee if he does run,"" Hogan said on Sunday on ""Meet the Press."" Hogan also said he believes Trump's influence in their party is waning and that he isn't dissuaded from the possibility of running in 2024 if Trump runs again. ""I'm gonna do the best job I can being governor until next January, and I don't know exactly what the future holds. I do think there are an awful lot of people that I would call the exhausted majority of Americans who are frustrated with the far left and the far right,"" he said. Hogan's comments come on the heels of California Gov. Gavin Newsom taking swipes at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, in a possible preview of what could be expected on the 2024 campaign trail should the pair both decide to run. Newsom recently ran an ad in DeSantis' home state in which the California governor told Floridians ""freedom is under attack in your state"" while listing conservative political legislation he deemed problematic. Newsom's ad aired over the Fourth of July weekend and invited frustrated Floridians to move to California, ""where we still believe in freedom."" DeSantis said at a recent press conference in response: ""I was born and raised in this state, and until the last few years I rarely, if ever, saw a California license plate in the state of Florida. You now see a lot of them. I can tell you, if you go to California, you ain't seeing very many Florida license plates."" NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 33. That’s the share of individuals charged in relation to the Jan. 6 attack who have preexisting ties to extremist groups, according to analysis from Mike Jensen at the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. And as FiveThirtyEight’s Kaleigh Rogers and Holly Fuong write, more than 74% of these individuals were connected to extremist groups like the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and QAnon.

2022-07-13,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/things-watch-bidens-trip-israel-saudi-arabia/story?id=86617752,"7 things to watch for on Biden's trip to Israel, Saudi Arabia","President Joe Biden on Wednesday touched down in the Middle East for the first time as president, for a visit to Israel, the occupied West Bank and Saudi Arabia centered on encouraging the growing ties between Israel and Arab countries, while resetting his administration's relationship with Saudi Arabia. ""The connection between the Israeli people and the American people is bone deep,"" Biden said after landing in Tel Aviv, where he greeted Israeli leaders past and present and received a briefing on missile defense systems. ""It's bone deep. Generation after generation, that connection grows."" Coming as his administration has focused on countering China's rise in Asia and uniting Europe against Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden's trip underscores the volatile region's strategic importance to U.S. foreign policy and the global economy, analysts told ABC News. From Biden's highly-anticipated meeting with Saudi Arabia's de-facto leader, to his efforts to address high gas prices at home and reaffirm the U.S. commitment to Israel's security, here are seven things to watch on the trip this week. As a presidential candidate, Biden vowed to make oil-rich Saudi Arabia a ""pariah"" state over the 2018 murder of Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi – an operation U.S. intelligence agencies later concluded was authorized by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is also known as ""MBS"" and who effectively runs the Gulf nation. Biden also pledged to ""reassess"" the traditionally close U.S.-Saudi alliance, amid calls from families of Sept. 11 attack victims to hold the kingdom ""accountable"" for links to the hijackers behind the terror attacks – and a push from within his own party to pressure Saudi Arabia to end its intervention in Yemen's civil war, which according to the United Nations has led to one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. Since taking office, Biden has spoken twice with King Salman, the crown prince's father, who officially rules the country. But he had also dispatched Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to serve as his administration's point of contact with the crown prince, in what was widely perceived as a snub to the powerful Saudi leader. Relations between the two countries reached a low point last spring when the Wall Street Journal reported that Prince Mohammed and his Emirati counterpart declined to schedule a phone call with Biden over frustrations with U.S. policy in the region. (The White House at the time told reporters there were ""no rebuffed calls."") On Saturday, Biden plans to attend a summit of Arab leaders in Jeddah, a meeting that the crown prince will also attend, though it's not yet clear how the two leaders will interact or engage. The White House has said that Prince Mohammed is expected to attend a bilateral meeting Biden will hold with King Salman and the king's ""leadership team"" on Friday. But U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday declined to say if the public would see Biden and the crown prince shake hands. Several experts told ABC News the rapprochement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia was inevitable, given the kingdom's influence in the region – and its status as one of the world's largest oil producers at a time when gas prices have skyrocketed and the West has attempted to boycott Russian oil. ""Without the Ukraine war, there would be a lot less focus [on Saudi Arabia]. There's no question about it,"" Dr. Gregory Gause, a Saudi Arabia expert and head of Department of International Affairs at The George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, told ABC News. Biden has defended his approach, writing in an op-ed for The Washington Post published Saturday that ""my aim was to reorient — but not rupture — relations with a country that's been a strategic partner for 80 years."" ""As president, it is my job to keep our country strong and secure,"" he wrote. ""We have to counter Russia's aggression, put ourselves in the best possible position to outcompete China, and work for greater stability in a consequential region of the world. ""To do these things,"" he continued, ""we have to engage directly with countries that can impact those outcomes. Saudi Arabia is one of them, and when I meet with Saudi leaders on Friday, my aim will be to strengthen a strategic partnership going forward that's based on mutual interests and responsibilities, while also holding true to fundamental American values."" Biden plans to attend a summit of leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council, a union of Arab states, who will also be joined by the leaders from Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan; the grouping is being referred to as the ""GCC+3."" Sullivan said Monday the White House believes the oil-producing Gulf states have ""a capacity for further steps that could be taken"" to increase oil output, although he would not say if Biden planned to ask Saudi Arabia and the other countries to raise production by a certain amount. Experts have told ABC News that it is not clear that Saudi Arabia could really do much to impact gas prices in the U.S., which have already started dropping in recent weeks – as demand falls off – from record $5 per gallon averages. ""There are things the Saudis can do,"" Gause, the expert on Saudi Arabia, said. ""But I don't think that even if they really opened the spigots, it would bring prices down to, you know, where they were… in the midst of COVID."" Amy Meyers Jaffe, the managing director of the Climate Policy Lab at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, said it's most important to ensure ""that the supply that's already in the market stays in the market."" ""Part of that is engaging with the producers of the Middle East, because it's not clear to me how much more they can all produce,"" she told ABC News. In fact, French President Emmanuel Macron was reportedly overheard last month telling Biden that the United Arab Emirates was already at ""maximum"" production capacity, and that the Saudis could only increase output by a relatively small 150,000 barrels per day in the short term. When Biden first visited Israel nearly 50 years ago, the country was at war with much of the Arab world. Now, following several peace agreements brokered by the Trump administration known as the Abraham Accords, Israel has diplomatic ties with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco – in addition to existing peace treaties with Jordan and Egypt. Israel, Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states share a mutual enemy in Iran: Israel considers Iran's nuclear program an existential threat, while the country's ballistic missiles and regional proxies have targeted Saudi and Emirati oil infrastructure. While a major diplomatic breakthrough isn't expected on this trip, Biden's visit could help move Saudi Arabia and Israel toward normalized relations and greater coordination on regional security – at a time when renewed negotiations to limit Iran's nuclear program have stalled. ""The region is watching to see how far the Saudis are willing to go,"" Jacob Walles, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served as U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, told ABC News. Walles said that while Saudi Arabia's crown prince has signaled support for inching closer to Israel, significant diplomatic progress could take time, given Saudi public opinion and opposition to Israel. The 86-year-old King Salman would also likely ""limit"" any breakthrough with Israel absent progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which has traditionally been a sticking point in relations between Israel and its neighbors, Walles said. In his Washington Post op-ed, Biden noted that he will be the first U.S. president to fly from Israel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, describing it as a ""small symbol"" of the deepening ties between Israel and the Arab world. ""The Israelis believe it's really important that I make the trip,"" Biden told reporters at a press conference last month. As Biden pursues rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and a strong relationship with Israel, he must balance economic and security interests with human rights concerns. The U.S. has walked a fine line in the wake of the death of Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a well known Al Jazeera correspondent killed in May while covering an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank. During her funeral, Israeli police beat mourners and pallbearers -- drawing widespread, global condemnation. The State Department said on July 4 that after reviewing U.S. and Palestinian investigations into Abu Akleh's death, it found that Israeli military gunfire likely killed her -- but that it ""found no reason to believe that this was intentional but rather the result of tragic circumstances."" Asked if Biden planned to press Israeli officials on the case during his visit, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that ""we want to see accountability."" But Abu Akleh's brother wrote in a letter to Biden late last week that ""your administration's engagement has served to whitewash Shireen's killing and perpetuate impunity,"" Reuters reported. He asked for Biden to meet with his family while in the region. Meanwhile, Khashoggi's 2018 murder was the reason Biden pledged to make Saudi Arabia a ""pariah,"" but the White House has repeatedly declined to say whether the president will even bring it up with the crown prince when he meets with him. Biden constantly argues that the world is at an inflection point between democracy and autocracy, and his trip to Saudi Arabia shows that democracies may feel forced to kowtow to autocratic nations when economic and security interests are at stake. ""For an American president to go to [Saudi Arabia] is very, very humiliating,"" Hossein Askari, an economist and Professor Emeritus of International Business and International Affairs at George Washington University, told ABC News. ""Maybe the American people don't see that,"" he continued. ""But in the eyes of dictators around the world, and in the eyes of the Middle East, people will be laughing."" The Abraham Accords between Israel and several Arab nations are one of the few foreign policies pursued by President Donald Trump that Biden has praised. But the agreements cast aside longstanding doctrine that elevated the Palestinian issue in any normalization talks with Israel, cutting the Palestinians themselves out of talks – although the Arab nations did seek concessions from Israel favorable to the Palestinians. Experts do not expect any breakthroughs in Israeli-Palestinian relations this week – nor has the Biden administration telegraphed any expected developments. There have been, though, reports of discussions over Saudi Arabia allowing Israeli planes to fly over its territory – and U.S.-backed diplomacy aimed at resolving an international dispute over islands in the Red Sea. And the Biden administration has reversed several Trump policies that downgraded the U.S. relationship with the Palestinians – such as resuming funding for a U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees – although he has not delivered on a promise to reopen an American consulate in Jerusalem for Palestinians that Trump closed. Other Palestinian desires – reopening an office in Washington and resolving other funding issues – are subject to congressional action that has not materialized, according to Michael Koplow, the chief policy officer of Israel Policy Forum. Israel's unstable political dynamics have also worked to lower expectations for the peace process on the trip, experts told ABC News – adding uncertainty and diverting attention from the U.S. commander-in-chief's trip among Israelis. The country will hold its fifth election in four years in November, following the collapse of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's fragile governing coalition – a mix of right wing, centrist, liberal and Arab parties with little in common besides a shared opposition to former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The right-wing leader, a fixture in Israeli politics for decades, could make his way back into power as prime minister this fall, despite his ongoing corruption trial. In Israel during the campaign season, Biden will meet with interim Prime Minister Yair Lapid – a moderate serving in the role through the next election – and is expected to meet with other key leaders on the trip, including Netanyahu. He will also meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and is expected to visit a hospital catering to Palestinian patients, as his administration reverses the Trump administration's decision to cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Palestinians. Yemen's civil war has paused for the last four months as the result of a negotiated truce. It's the longest ceasefire in the nearly eight-year war that caused what the United Nations has labeled the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Saudi Arabia has led a coalition that has backed Yemen's government in its fight against a rebel group called the Houthis, who are backed by Iran. The U.S. has supported Saudi Arabia's involvement, which has relied heavily on airstrikes. Biden had ended offensive weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, though, over its handling of the war, and accused the kingdom of ""murdering children"" in Yemen as a presidential candidate. While Sullivan told ABC News Monday that that ban would remain for now, the White House has in recent weeks praised Prince Mohammed's role in bringing about the ongoing ceasefire as it works to improve relations with Saudi Arabia. White House officials have said the war in Yemen will be a major focus for Biden while he visits Saudi Arabia - but human rights advocates and members of his own party have called on him to speak out more forcefully against Saudi involvement in the conflict while he's in the region.",23

Griner did not testify but several Russian individuals testified as character witnesses about their experiences with the basketball star. The first witness was Maxim Ryabkov, the director of UMMC -- the Russian basketball club in the city of Yekaterinburg for which Griner played in the WNBA offseason. The second witness was team doctor Anatoly Galabin, who said that she never tested positive for doping while playing for the team. And the third witness, Evgenia Belyakova, one of Griner's Russian teammates, said that Griner was the leader of the team. Griner pleaded guilty on drug charges in a Russian court last week, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage unintentionally. Griner, who has been detained in Russia since Feb. 17, said she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law, and was in a rush but did not mean to leave the cartridges in her bag. The WNBA star's trial, which is taking place in Khimki -- a suburb of Moscow -- began on July 1, more than 4 1/2 months after Griner was detained. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was visiting Russia to play basketball in the off-season when she was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport after being accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. Her legal team told ABC News in a statement last week that her ""guilty"" plea was informed by a discussion with her Russian attorneys. ""Brittney sets an example of being brave. She decided to take full responsibility for her actions as she knows that she is a role model for many people,"" they said in the statement. ""Considering the nature of her case, the insignificant amount of the substance and BG's personality and history of positive contributions to global and Russian sport, the defense hopes that the plea will be considered by the court as a mitigating factor and there will be no severe sentence."" Griner's detention was extended repeatedly, most recently through Dec. 20, which was the expected length of her trial. If convicted, Griner, 31, faces up to 10 years in prison and also has a right to an appeal. The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained,"" meaning the U.S. will more aggressively work to negotiate her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department has said. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters last week that Griner's guilty plea will have ""no impact"" on any of the negotiations to bring her home to the U.S. Calls to free Griner escalated following the April release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed, who was freed from a Russian prison as part of a prisoner exchange. Former Marine Paul Whelan has also been detained in Russia since late 2018. ""We're going to do everything that we can to bring home Brittney Griner safely, and to also make sure that we bring Paul Whelan back home, as well,"" Jean-Pierre said. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson is planning to travel to Russia in the near future for talks aimed at negotiating a deal to free Griner, a source with knowledge of the proposed trip told ABC News. Richardson, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary in the Clinton administration, played a role in achieving Reed's release.

2022-07-14,https://abcnews.go.com/International/end-sight-ukraine-russian-war-heads-month/story?id=86818274,No end in sight as Russia's invasion of Ukraine heads into fifth month,"As the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its fifth month, there appears to be no end in sight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he wouldn't consider signing a peace treaty with Russia due to recent attacks by Russian forces that have led to occupations of large swaths of eastern Ukraine. ABC News foreign correspondent James Longman has been on the ground in Ukraine covering the war and spent a few months in the contested regions that are at the center of the latest activity. He spoke Thursday with Brad Mielke, host of ABC News' ""Start Here,"" about the latest developments and how impactful the recent Russian attacks have been on Ukrainian forces. START HERE: James, what is the state of play right now? LONGMAN: Well Brad, I think two things really have characterized our time here. The first is that there has been a major Russian victory in this country after months of war. And you'll remember they failed to take Kiev. It's taken them a long time to basically do anything here. But after months, they've taken one of the two provinces of the Donbas, that is Luhansk. So that is significant in many ways, significant strategically. But I think psychologically, you know, symbolically for Russia, finally, they've got something in this war and now they're moving into the next phase, the second half of the Donbas. That's that Donetsk region. And they're on the march and they want to take that, too. So that's been a massive part of what we've seen. And the other huge thing we've seen a lot more of: this huge uptick in attacks on civilian targets. The Russians seem frustrated at the amount of help, perhaps that Ukraine continues to get [and] their inability to move forward more quickly, perhaps on the ground with their ground assaults. And so, we've seen these massive attacks on civilian neighborhoods. I was at the one at Kremenyuk, the mall which people may remember was set ablaze. Many dozens of people died there after an anti-ship missile hit it. [At an] apartment block in the south near Odessa, we witnessed another attack there. And only in the last three or four days, another massive attack on an apartment building in Donetsk. Over 40 people were killed in that one attack. So these are the two themes of this war so far we've seen. But a huge issue at the moment is what they're calling Russification. This is where Russia, in the areas that it's already controlling, seeks to really lay down roots, proper, deep roots that will not be pulled up any time soon. So that if and when there's some kind of negotiation, they can't be moved. So in Kherson, for instance, is a town in the south. It's been occupied since almost the beginning. We've heard that they're giving out passports, Russian passports. The ruble has been introduced there. They've changed the curriculum to try to integrate these areas into Russia. And that is why Ukraine is saying the time is now to push them out, because if we leave them there too long, they're like a cancer. They're taking over. And if and if they're allowed to stay there until the winter, those routes that they've been putting down, they'll be frozen in and they'll never get their country back. And that's the real problem for Ukraine at the moment. START HERE: U.S. officials recently announced that Russia will be getting reinforcements from Iran. How significant is that? LONGMAN: Well, I think this just goes to show how much this has become such a serious proxy war, where basically you have these great competing world orders slugging it out here in Ukraine. On the one side, you have the United States and its allies and on the other, Russia and yes, Iran, and to some extent, China, relatively kind of ambivalent about this war, but certainly not putting a stop to it. Turkey [is] somewhere in the middle, trying to play both sides. But yes, it looks like Russia is looking to its partners to help it militarily because, and there have been rumors about whether or not they're kind of running out of some of the equipment that they've needed. These huge missiles that they've been firing into Ukraine, it looks like they kind of could be running out of those. And yes, getting these drones, it just shows that Russia is looking elsewhere for some help. Drones have played a huge part in this war, by the way. The U.S. and Turkish drones have been provided to the Ukrainians have been very, very useful to them. So, I'm not sure how much these drones in particular will make a difference to Russia. But it just goes to show how much this conflict is being internationalized and how many how global the consequences of it really are. I should add yesterday, Brad, there was a bit of a breakthrough when it came to the concerns around grain in this country. Twenty million tons of grain have been stuck in Odessa. And finally, there was a negotiation in Turkey, which looks like some of this could get out. It would perhaps relieve some of the international concerns around food security, particularly for developing nations. But this just goes to show whether it's food security, [or] energy security. You've got Biden in the Middle East talking about that at the moment. This is such an enormously important war in so many respects for all of us all around the world. And I think these last few weeks have really shown that. [ ]",7
2022-07-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-inflation-anger-boils-biden-abroad-note/story?id=86747559,Democrats’ inflation anger boils over with Biden abroad: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Inflation is low-hanging political fruit for Republicans amid everyday reminders -- underscored by weekly and monthly data drops -- that show prices spiraling while policy solutions are fleeting. But what might be as telling this week, with President Joe Biden in the Middle East for a high-profile foreign trip, is what some Democrats are saying about the rising cost of goods that’s clearly not transitory and also seemingly not lifting itself from voters’ minds in time for the midterms. It’s not just Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who fired another shot across progressive bows with a new declaration -- in the context of ongoing talks with the White House -- that “no matter what spending aspirations some in Congress may have ... we cannot add any more fuel to this inflation fire.” Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio -- a member of the majority party in the House who hopes to join the Senate majority next year -- called the latest inflation numbers “awful” in a video posted from the campaign trail: “People are getting absolutely crushed. We need a tax cut now.” Pennsylvania's Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, also currently in elected office and also looking to join the Senate, said: “We need bold action NOW to make more s--- in America, fix our broken supply chains, and take on corporate greed to bring down the cost of everything, for everyone.” Those three Democrats share something of an everyman profile and also hail from states where Democrats may need to work extra hard to make working-class connections. It’s a brand of politics that isn’t all that foreign to “Scranton Joe,” though. Biden’s White House statement called the latest inflation “unacceptably high” -- but also “out-of-date,” citing gas prices and commodities that have fallen sharply in recent weeks. High prices remain an issue that’s virtually impervious to spin. More Democrats appear to be coming to that conclusion, with or without the White House. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper On his first trip to the Middle East as commander in chief, Biden is already raising eyebrows with one exchange. Due to a COVID-19 surge in Israel, the president avoided close contact with Israeli officials upon his arrival. He offered fist bumps instead of handshakes to all but one person -- Benjamin Netanyahu, former prime minister and current leader of the opposition party. The pair appeared chummy as they shared a drawn-out handshake on-camera. In an attempt to stay above the political fray, Biden is slated to meet Thursday with both current Prime Minister Yair Lapid and Netanyahu as Israelis prepare to vote come November in the fifth election since 2019. Netanyahu, despite corruption and bribery charges he denies, is aiming to return to power. Many consider “Bibi” a favorite over Lapid. A major focus of Biden's trip is strengthening ties between Israel and other nations in the region -- regardless of who holds the title of prime minister. If Netanyahu takes power, Biden would have a familiar partner in efforts to forge those connections to confront challenges like the threat of the Iran nuclear program, the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine and competing with China. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The specter of 2024 continues to loom over Florida as another high-profile Democrat finds himself in the spotlight amid the battleground state’s evolving midterm campaigns. Although Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker insists he is solely focused on his current reelection campaign, his national star is on the rise amid the fallout of the deadly Fourth of July shooting in Highland Park as well as his state grappling with an influx of abortion-seeking patients upon the repeal of Roe v. Wade. This weekend, Pritzker is slated to deliver remarks at the annual Leadership Blue Gala hosted by the Florida Democratic Party. He was invited to speak at the event in April by Florida Democratic Party Chairman Manny Diaz. In the lead-up to this weekend’s remarks, Pritzker has been stumping for pro-abortion gubernatorial candidates across the country including incumbent Democratic Govs. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Tim Walz, Gretchen Whitmer and others, as well as gubernatorial candidates Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Tom Sherman of New Hampshire. “Florida is in dire need of a pro-choice, Democratic governor, and Governor Pritzker is proud to support the Florida Democratic Party in their efforts to flip the state blue. As a lifelong Democrat, Governor Pritzker is committed to supporting his party in every corner of our country. If the governor can play even a small role in helping Florida Democrats elect a Black woman to the US Senate, flip the governor’s office, and elect pro-choice, pro-science, pro-worker candidates to the legislature––he will gladly do so,” Pritzker campaign spokesperson Natalie Edelstein told ABC News. Pritzker’s comments will come just weeks after California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom took a swipe of his own at Florida’s GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, by running an ad in Florida over the Fourth of July weekend that invited potentially frustrated voters to move to Newsom’s home state instead -- a stunt DeSantis shrugged off. During a Wednesday speech in Washington, D.C., Newsom also took aim at Florida’s Republican-backed Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed by critics as the “Don’t Say Gay"" bill, which puts limits on how classrooms can teach about sexual orientation and gender, ABC News’ Brittany Shepherd reports. In a gaggle with reporters after the remarks, Newsom said that he supports President Biden and that Biden should run for re-election in 2024. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 39.

2022-07-15,https://abcnews.go.com/International/families-saudi-mass-execution-fear-biden-visit-legitimizes/story?id=86871966,Families of Saudi mass execution fear Biden visit 'legitimizes' Saudi Crown Prince,"LONDON -- U.S. President Joe Biden has promised to bring up human rights concerns when he meets with Saudi leaders in Jeddah on Friday as part of his first Middle Eastern trip, but the visit has been surrounded by considerable intrigue and controversy. During his presidential campaign, Biden said he would make Saudi Arabia a “pariah state” over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but he has refused to answer whether he will bring up the case specifically with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the Kingdom once seen as a reformer, but who now has a reputation for targeting his critics and crushing dissent. Human rights campaigners have expressed concern that Saudi Arabia’s human rights record once again may be overlooked in favor of cheap oil, especially since the West is in need of alternative energy options following the war in Ukraine. The awkward nature of the visit is perhaps summed up by the White House’s refusal to even say whether Biden will shake the Crown Prince’s hand. But for the families of those who killed in a mass execution earlier this year, which saw 81 people executed on March 12 in what human rights groups condemned as a “massacre,” the trip is seen as nothing less than legitimizing the Kingdom’s regime. Hamza al-Shakhouri’s brother, Mohammad al-Shakhouri, was executed in March after being convicted of crimes relating to various “terrorist” activities. But in a letter in November 2021, UN special rapporteurs said that they had received evidence that al-Shakouri’s confession, relied on by state prosecutors, was based on torture, and they appealed to the Kingdom to overturn his sentence. The reported use of coerced confessions as evidence of guilt, they said, “would constitute a blatant violation of due process and of fair trial guarantees.” Saudi Arabia’s counter-terrorism laws have been criticized by the UN as being “unacceptably broad” which have been used against “human rights defenders, writers, bloggers, journalists and other peaceful critics.” The Kingdom’s secretive judicial system has long drawn condemnation from human rights campaigners for failing to meet the basic standards of due process. “President Biden has attempted to justify his visit to Saudi Arabia and pledged that his government will not tolerate authorities harassing dissidents and activists,” Hamza said in a statement shared with ABC News by the human rights charity Reprieve. “The Saudi regime doesn't just harass those who speak out against it; it murders them. My brother is just one of the many victims.” Yasser al-Khayat, the brother of Mustafa al-Khayat who was also executed in March for alleged “terrorist” activities, told ABC News that the family have still not received his body for a proper burial. According to the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights, Mustafa was also tortured into signing a confession having been held in solitary confinement for six months. ""We are still mourning,” he said in a statement shared with ABC News. “This visit legitimizes Mohammed bin Salman's actions, sending the message that my brother's life doesn't matter and that America will continue to support the regime no matter how many of us they kill."" ""Americans often describe their country as the world's greatest democracy but its president is partnering with a man who has killed countless people like my brother for daring to ask for those same democratic rights,” he said. Both men are now outside Saudi Arabia, and so were able to provide their testimony without imminent fear of reprisals. The White House did not respond to a requests for comment from ABC News on whether officials will raise concerns about Saudi Arabia’s use of the death penalty during the visit to Jeddah. Reprieve’s Director, Maya Foa, described the current climate under the rule of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin-Salman as an “execution crisis.” “The authorities are on track to execute more people this year than ever before,” Foa told ABC News. “Child defendants, pro-democracy protesters and people convicted of non-violent drug crimes are among those at risk. There are likely thousands of people on death row but the justice system is so secretive that we simply don't know how many."" ABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed to this report",23
2022-07-16,https://abcnews.go.com/International/maternity-clinic-ukraine-controlled-donbas-lifeline-war-closes/story?id=86880988,Last maternity clinic in Ukraine-controlled Donbas a lifeline as war closes in,"In the last specialist maternity ward still under Ukrainian control in the eastern Donbas region, the windows are packed with sandbags. Rooms used for births at the Perinatal Centre in the city of Pokrovsk follow the two-wall rule, which says the safest parts of a building are separated from the outside by at least two walls. ""Sometimes we've had to deliver babies during shelling,"" said Dr. Ivan Tsyganok, head of the centre. ""Labour is a process that cannot be stopped."" The centre, roughly 40 km (25 miles) from the closest front line, gives a glimpse of the suffering the war is inflicting on pregnant women - their anxiety over where they can give birth, fears of whether the hospital will come under attack, and what doctors have observed to be an increased rate of early labour. Tsyganok fears the stress of living under Russian attack has led to a spike in premature births, a fear borne out in initial data from the centre, shared with Reuters, and observed elsewhere in conflict zones. Russia denies targeting civilians but many Ukrainian cities, towns and villages have been left in ruins as Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two grinds towards the five month mark. Moscow says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and defend Russian-speakers from persecution by nationalists - an allegation dismissed by Kyiv as a baseless pretext for an imperial-style land grab. Katya Buravtsova's second child, Illiusha, was among those born early, delivered at only 28 weeks. He would have had ""zero chance"" at survival if not for the centre, Tsyganok said. But thanks to an incubator and the care he received at the clinic, he is now doing well. ""We looked after him 24 hours per day,"" Tsyganok said, wearing turquoise scrubs and Crocs. Comforting her tiny son, 35-year-old Buravtsova said she had been uncertain how she would give birth, as her village, close to the frontline city of Kurakhove, was shelled. ""You could be forced to give birth in a cellar,"" she said. In 2021, about 12% of just over 1,000 babies born at the centre were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy, according to data Tsyganok shared with Reuters. This rate – compared with a Ukraine-wide average of about 9%, according to the WHO - was typical for previous years in the centre, he said. Since the Feb. 24 invasion, 19 of the 115 babies born at the hospital were premature, a rate of about 16.5%, he said. The total number of births was low since many women had fled, he added. Tsyganok established the centre in 2015, the year after Russian proxies seized large swathes of the Donetsk and Luhansk. regions, which make up the Donbas. Nearby Donetsk, the largest city in the region and home to a large maternity hospital, had fallen under the control of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in 2014. Doctors at the new centre anecdotally observed that the smouldering conflict, which would kill more than 14,000 people between 2014 and 2022, was having an impact on pregnancies. In 2017, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the centre, Olesia Kushnarenko, set out to prove it, conducting research for a doctoral thesis on how wartime stress in expecting mothers affected the placenta. Her study followed 69 otherwise healthy women, who lived close to the fighting and were assessed to have high stress levels, through their pregnancies. More than half of the women were found to have fetoplacental dysfunction – when oxygen and nutrients are not sufficiently transferred to the foetus - Kushnarenko said, a rate four-times higher than that found among a control group of 38 women. Kushnarenko also found higher rates of complications, including premature birth, among the babies born to mothers with high levels of stress. Now in Spain with her two children, she predicts the current conflict is having an even greater impact on pregnancies. ""This war is much hotter than before. It's very dangerous all over Ukraine,"" she said. MARIUPOL HOSPITAL Tsyganok says the sandbags in the windows will not save the clinic and its patients in the event of a direct hit, like the one at a hospital in Mariupol in March. There, at least three people died when a Russian missile hit the hospital, sending expectant mothers, some with shrapnel wounds, fleeing in hospital gowns, according to Ukrainian authorities and press photos. Russia's Defence Ministry denied having bombed the hospital, and accused Ukraine of staging the incident. With the Mariupol centre gone and another in nearby Kramatorsk closed, the Pokrovsk facility now serves the remaining population of the Ukraine-controlled Donetsk region, about 340,000 people, according to the regional governor. Among those attending the centre in Pokrovsk was Viktoriya Sokolovska, 16, expecting a baby girl. ""The shooting is affecting my nerves,"" she said late last month, while 36 weeks pregnant and trying her best to remain calm. She feared ""all the nervousness will pass over to the baby."" She has since given birth to a healthy daughter, Emilia.",22
2022-07-16,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-pledges-us-walk-middle-east/story?id=86935031,Biden pledges US won't 'walk away' from Middle East,"President Joe Biden wrapped up his first trip to the Middle East on Saturday by pledging that the United States will continue to be an engaged partner in the region. Speaking at the Gulf Cooperation Council in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Biden said his administration will support relationships with nations that ""subscribe to the rules-based international order."" ""As the world grows more competitive, and the challenges we face more complex, it is only becoming clearer to me how closely interwoven our interests are with the successes of the Middle East,"" Biden said. ""We will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia or Iran."" The U.S., he said, ""is not going anywhere."" Biden on Saturday announced $1 billion to fight food insecurity in the region and said the nations present at the summit were collectively contributing billions of dollars on clean energy initiatives. Biden's four-day international trip came as the U.S. remains focused on countering China's rise in the region and uniting global partners against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It also occurred as Biden seeks to lower sky-high gas prices at home. Biden said Saturday the leaders agreed on the need to ensure ""adequate supplies"" to meet global demand. After meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Friday, Biden said the Saudis ""share that urgency"" and that he expects to see further action in the coming weeks. But when asked when Americans can see the impacts of that visit, he acknowledged it wouldn't be immediate. ""I suspect you won't see that for another couple of weeks,"" he said. Biden faced some criticism for his meeting with Mohammed bin Salman -- the man the U.S. believes is responsible for the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy. Biden and Mohammed bin Salman were photographed fist-bumping each other outside the Al-Salam Royal Palace, three years after Biden vowed as a presidential candidate to make the nation a ""pariah"" over Khashoggi's murder. Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fiancee, said Khashoggi would have responded to the fist bump by asking the president ""is this the accountability you promised for my murder? The blood of MBS's next victim is on your hands."" Biden told reporters he raised Khashoggi at the top of their meeting, and continued to condemn his killing as ""outrageous."" Sitting next to Mohammed bin Salman at Saturday's summit, Biden also touched on the issue of human rights as he laid out his five-point vision for U.S. policy for the region. ""Foundational freedoms are foundational to who we are as Americans,"" he said. ""It's in our DNA. But it's also because we know that the future will be won by the countries that unleash the full potential of their populations, where women can exercise equal rights and contribute to building stronger economies, resilient societies, and more modern and capable militaries; where citizens can question and criticize their leaders without fear of reprisal."" - ABC News' Molly Nagle and Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.",23
2022-07-17,https://abcnews.go.com/International/gang-violence-inflation-food-insecurity-deepen-haiti-crisis/story?id=86941317,"Gang violence, inflation, food insecurity deepen Haiti crisis","July marked one year since Haiti's president was assassinated and it appears the country's crisis has only deepened as gang activity has surged over the past months in and around the nation's capital city. Haiti is no stranger to political turmoil, and on July 7, 2021, a dark history reemerged when the country's president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated by a group of gunmen at his home. The killing brought a country already experiencing violent gang violence and protests of authoritarian rule cascading further into chaos. A little more than a month later, Haiti would be rocked by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake - killing more than 2,000 people and leaving thousands more injured. The earthquake caused devastating damage to buildings, homes, and schools particularly in rural areas where approximately 80% of the affected populations live. According to a recent United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) report dated June 2, at least 188 people have been killed in Port-au-Prince, including 96 suspected gang members due to gang violence and nearly 17,000 people have been displaced since late April. “We have encountered corpses that are decomposing or being burned,” said Medecins Sans (MSF), Doctors Without Border, in a statement this week. “They could be people killed during the clashes or people trying to leave who were shot - it is a real battlefield."" The United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution Friday on a 15-0 vote that calls on all countries to stop the transfer of small arms, light weapons and ammunition to any party in crisis-torn Haiti supporting gang violence and criminal activity, the Associated Press reported. The resolution drafted by the United States and Mexico expresses “grave concern about the extremely high levels of gang violence and other criminal activities, including kidnappings and homicides, and sexual and gender-based violence, as well as ongoing impunity for perpetrators, and the implications of Haiti’s situation in the region,” according to the Associated Press report. It also extended the ""BINUH"" mission in Haiti until July 15, 2023. The immediate impact of the resolution however remains unclear. Heavily armed gangs have blocked roads throughout the north and south, stifling humanitarian assistance from reaching the most vulnerable. In the Cité Soleil neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, malnutrition rates have increased with 20% of children under five suffering from acute malnutrition, the OCHA reported. According to a statement this week from The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) , ""Insecurity in and around Port-au-Prince has been drastically worsening since early May, disrupting nation-wide supply chains, access to basic services like markets, schools and hospitals and livelihoods of Haitians across the country. The violence is causing a serious protection crisis and making it harder for people to access and afford food."" ""This comes against the backdrop of the global food crisis where rising costs linked to the conflict in Ukraine are compounding woes. Haiti is already seeing staggering inflation to the tune of 26 percent. The island nation is particularly vulnerable to shocks in the global food and fuel markets as it imports 70 percent of its cereals. On top of these challenges, the ongoing Atlantic Hurricane season is expected to be more active than normal putting at risk lives and livelihoods of vulnerable Haitians,"" the WFP continued. The road blockades have created serious security concerns for humanitarian operations. “The only safe option for humanitarians to move is by air, and without adequate funding, UNHAS [United Nations Humanitarian Air Service],faces imminent closure by the end of July 2022. Ultimately, this puts not only WFP’s assistance but humanitarian operations across the country at risk,” said Jean-Martin Bauer, WFP Country Director in Haiti. And as Haiti battles multiple crisis at home, it also faces potential impacts from an ongoing Atlantic Hurricane Season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecasted an above-normal 2022 hurricane season, which runs from June through November, with three to six storms that may reach category 3, 4 or 5. Haiti seems to be facing an uncertain future ahead.",25
2022-07-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-infighting-threatens-overshadow-remaining-agenda-note/story?id=86965966,Democrats' infighting threatens to overshadow remaining agenda: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It's harder to focus on what you've done as a party so long as attention falls on what you aren't able to do. As for what might still get done, that's more difficult to know as well in the context of uncommon division over who's to blame about a Democratic Party agenda that's mostly -- though not entirely -- stalled ahead of the midterms. Climate change, gun violence, inflation, basic affordability, democracy itself -- all leave Democrats blaming fellow Democrats in addition to Republicans for the lack of policy solutions ahead of an election they agree figures to be brutal. The move by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., to torpedo Democrats' climate-change efforts, citing fears of runaway inflation, brought a total rebuke on Sunday from perhaps the highest-profile progressive in Congress. ""He has sabotaged the president's agenda,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told Martha Raddatz on ABC's ""This Week."" ""The problem was that we continue to talk to Manchin like he was serious. He was not."" Democrats, of course, still need Manchin's vote on key health care measures he might yet support, including Affordable Care Act subsidies and drug-pricing reform. The White House hopes climate measures can stay in the mix as well, with executive actions and -- assuming inflation eases in the next round of reports -- even pre-midterm bills in Congress. This summer has brought an unusual dynamic where Democrats' hopes in Congress, specifically their bid to keep control of the Senate, look a bit brighter even as President Joe Biden's political prospects look dimmer. But they need each other to make what policy progress they can in the coming weeks. That will mean having to find another dose of party unity, despite reasons that might be lacking. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper President Biden returned to Washington on Saturday without any clear payoffs from his first Middle East trip as commander-in-chief. Among Biden's most pressing goals for the trip was encouraging countries in the region to increase oil production in hopes of driving down gas prices -- including in the U.S. -- but there were no new commitments on that front. If anything, Biden's fist-bump seen around the world with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman overshadowed much of the trip, drawing backlash from both the fiancée and the former employer of slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post writer whom the U.S. believes bin Salman had killed. (The crown prince denies this.) Washington Post publisher and CEO Fred Ryan issued a statement calling the greeting between Biden and bin Salman ""shameful."" Hatice Cengiz, who intended to marry Khashoggi before his 2018 murder, tweeted that ""the blood of MBS's next victim is on [Biden's] hands."" ""I'm sorry she feels that way,"" Biden said when asked Friday about Cengiz's tweet. The administration maintains that, despite any major disagreements the White House may have with the Middle East's leaders, meetings with Saudis and others are important to U.S. efforts on numerous issues, including confronting the threat of Iran's emerging nuclear program, combating the fallout from the war in Ukraine and competing with China. ""There is a huge agenda of U.S. national security interests at play in the Middle East and you're not going to advance those interests if you just stay at home and try to phone it in,"" White House spokesman John Kirby told ABC News. ""You have to actually go and speak to leaders and be on the ground to try to make a difference."" The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The tensions in Arizona's Republican gubernatorial primary rose to new heights over the weekend as term-limited GOP Gov. Doug Ducey blasted Donald Trump-backed candidate Kari Lake over her false election denial claims. With just two weeks left until the state's Aug. 2 nominating contests, the divide further exposes the trending political chasm between Trump and several battleground state Republican governors who appear to be attempting to push the discourse away from 2020 election lies. ""Kari Lake is misleading voters with no evidence. She's been tagged by her opponents with a nickname, 'Fake Lake,' which seems to be sticking and actually doing some damage,"" Ducey said on Sunday during a CNN interview, in reference to Lake's focus on challenging the outcome of the last presidential election. The Arizona governor praised his chosen primary candidate, Karrin Taylor Robson, for her ""pro-wall, pro-gun, pro-life"" policy stances and called her ""the real conservative"" in the race. But Ducey, who serves as chair of the Republican Governors Association, also sidestepped answering whether the RGA would support election-denying gubernatorial candidates in general elections, saying the organization is ""on offense, but we don't support lost causes."" Ducey pushed back on CNN when pressed about whether Pennsylvania's election-denying gubernatorial Republican nominee, Doug Mastriano, could be considered a ""lost cause."" ""No, I didn't say 'lost cause' in any category yet [...] Nov. 8 is a long way off,"" he said. Although Ducey went on to say the RGA would be examining its resources on the gubernatorial electoral map, he also added that he believes ""the people of any state would be better served by a governor who believes in the people."" ""I also think this election should be about the future. I don't think we should think for one more moment about 2020,"" he said. Lake, responding to Ducey's comments, tweeted that his CNN interview was ""so sad."" NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 120. That's the number of Republican candidates running for the U.S. House, U.S. Senate, governor, secretary of state and attorney general who have denied the 2020 election was legitimate and will be on the ballot this fall. An additional 48 nominees have expressed doubts about the election. Just 75 nominees have fully accepted or partially accepted the 2020 election results so far. Read more from FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich and Kaleigh Rogers on how the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election has continued to be questioned in Republican primaries so far. ONE MORE THING Steve Bannon's trial on federal contempt-of-Congress charges begins Monday in Washington, with jury selection. Bannon, who previously served as Trump's White House chief strategist but departed in August 2017, was first subpoenaed by the House's Jan. 6 committee for records and testimony in September -- but he defied that order. Bannon's attorneys have repeatedly claimed that Trump had invoked executive privilege over Bannon's testimony, which prevented him from cooperating -- despite Trump's status as a former president and the fact that Bannon was not a White House adviser at the time. But the Justice Department revealed last week that in a recent interview with federal investigators, Trump's current lawyer, Justin Clark, said that at no point did Trump actually invoke executive. https://abcn.ws/3osYt7v THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-07-18,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainians-forcibly-deported-russian-filtration-camps/story?id=86898080,Ukrainians are being forcibly deported to Russian 'filtration camps',"Eduard Mkrtchian, injured during Russian shelling of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, said he was forced to evacuate and, at a Russian-controlled checkpoint, said he was given false information and forced to travel into Russia. He told officials he wanted to go to western Ukraine, to a city called Zaporizhzhia, but was told “there's no Zaporizhzhia anymore,” he said in an interview with ABC News’ Ines de La Cuetara. Instead, he was brought to a so-called “filtration camp,” a checkpoint in Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine where reports have emerged of people being interrogated for hours, their biometric data being recorded and their photos on their phones wiped. He said he was repeatedly misled, and brought deeper and deeper into Russia. “I was deceivingly taken to Russia,” he told ABC News. The U.S. Department of State estimates that between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens, including 260,000 children, have been “interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported” to Russia, adding that “the unlawful transfer and deportation of protected persons is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and is a war crime.” There are at least 18 “filtration camps” that have been set-up along the Russia-Ukraine border, according to Michael Carpenter, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. During his interrogation, Mkrtchian says, “they asked me to undress. They asked me the meaning of every tattoo on my body. They deliberated a long time whether or not to let me go. I realized that they could kill me here,” he said. “You have to fill out a form. There are different questions. For example - do you have relatives in the armed forces of Ukraine, do you know about the location of Ukrainian military bases, and so on,” said Mariupol resident Ruslan Bojko, who says he spent four days at a “filtration camp.” ABC News spoke with Bojko on a reappropriated cruise ship in Tallinn, Estonia, that now houses more 1,800 Ukrainian refugees. “These people don’t have a choice, they have to comply,” Tanya Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director for Human Rights Watch, told ABC News. “The de facto choice, the only option that they have, is to remain in the streets and die under shelling."" According to a statement released on Wednesday by the U.S. Department of State, “evidence is mounting that Russian authorities are also reportedly detaining or disappearing thousands of Ukrainian civilians who do not pass ‘filtration.’” ""There are very strong grounds to believe that those individuals detained by them experience ill treatment and even torture,"" said Lokshina. ""The woman who was sitting next to me in the filtration camp, her husband had been gone for two weeks. He was taken away for filtration and not returned. There were at least 10 women I spoke with who had similar stories,” said Mkrtchian. Russia has acknowledged that it is resettling Ukrainian refugees, yet claims it is for ""humanitarian"" reasons. After spending time in a refugee camp in Russia, Mkrtchian eventually traveled across Russia to Estonia where he now lives, awaiting the opportunity to return to Ukraine. “How can I stay in a country that destroyed my life?” he said.",27
2022-07-19,https://abcnews.go.com/International/millions-die-urgent-funding-catastrophic-famine-looms-east/story?id=87050102,"Millions could die without 'urgent' funding as 'catastrophic famine' looms in East Africa, IRC says","LONDON -- The International Rescue Committee for the first time on Tuesday issued a ""Crisis Alert"" update to its annual ""Emergency Watchlist"" report, warning that millions of people across East Africa could die from ""catastrophic famine"" without ""urgent"" international funding and action. The global humanitarian aid organization releases its ""Emergency Watchlist"" at the end of each year, identifying the countries it believes are most at risk of the worst humanitarian crises over the course of the coming year. But since early 2022, Russia has been waging a war against Ukraine that has disproportionally affected food security in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, which were reliant on Russia and Ukraine for about 90% of their wheat imports and are now in the midst of their longest, most severe drought in decades. The IRC said its first-ever ""Crisis Alert"" update was issued in light of this fallout from the war in Ukraine, which -- combined with the increasingly detrimental impact of climate change, conflict and COVID-19 -- has driven those three East African nations into a ""predictable crisis dangerously neglected by the international community."" ""There is nothing natural about famines in the 21st century. While a complex set of factors are driving extreme hunger, the slide into famine and mass death is man-made, driven by international inaction,"" IRC CEO David Miliband said in a statement Tuesday. ""This crisis was predictable and preventable. It has been unfolding over two years of repeated warnings and worsening hunger. What we are witnessing is an unnatural disaster of catastrophic proportions."" The war in Ukraine would not have had such a significant impact on East Africa if drought had not already devastated agriculture, IRC said. After a record four consecutive failed rainy seasons, the number of people going hungry across Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia is set to surpass 20 million by September -- nearly a doubling compared to late 2021. Over three million of them are already experiencing the most extreme levels of hunger, increasing their risk of death, according to the IRC. The IRC's ""Crisis Alert"" update noted ""specific concern"" for Somalia, which it said is the worst affected and is entering a famine that is expected to be even more severe than the 2011 one that killed an estimated 260,000 people. In one IRC's nutrition clinic in Mogadishu, from April to May, the organization has seen a 265% increase in admissions for children under the age of 5 suffering from severe malnutrition. IRC teams on the ground report that people are already dying from starvation. ""There is no time to wait for data collection to confirm what the IRC is already seeing on the ground: a country hurtling towards a catastrophic famine,"" the organization said in the update. ""A famine declaration will tell us when it is too late -- that people are already dying en masse, not how many lives we can still save. Waiting to respond based on retrospective data will condemn hundreds of thousands to an unnecessary death. Instead the international community needs to look forward, applying a no-regrets approach."" The warning came a day after the U.S. Agency for International Development announced nearly $1.3 billion in additional humanitarian and developmental assistance to the Horn of Africa region. The IRC said the humanitarian-response plan for the region would be funded at only 40%, even accounting for the new funding. ""Severe underfunding of humanitarian responses is depriving millions of the assistance they need to survive,"" said Miliband, the IRC's CEO. ""The new U.S. funding announced this week must be a first step, not a last one.""",25
2022-07-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-sign-executive-order-americans-held-hostage-wrongfully/story?id=87050103,Biden signs executive order on Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad,"President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Tuesday that codifies a 2020 law dealing with Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. Drawing on the 2020 Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, the new executive order will reinforce the U.S. government's efforts to support families of Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage overseas, according to the White House. The order will authorize the federal government to impose financial sanctions on those who are involved -- directly or indirectly -- in wrongful detaining Americans abroad, the White House said. Moreover, government agencies will be directed to improve engagement with those Americans' families, including sharing intelligence information about their loved ones and the government’s efforts to free them. The order will also charge experts across agencies with developing ""options and strategies to deter future hostage-takings,"" the White House said. A senior Biden administration official told reporters that new sanctions will not be announced on Tuesday. In addition to the executive order, Biden will introduce a new ""risk indicator"" -- ""the 'D' indicator"" -- to the U.S. Department of State's travel advisories for particular countries to alert Americans of the risk of wrongful detention by a foreign government, according to the White House. Starting Tuesday, the first countries to receive this additional risk indicator will be China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela, another senior administration official told reporters. The ""D"" indicator joins the existing ""K"" indicator that covers the risk of kidnapping and hostage-taking by non-state actors, as well as a range of other existing risk indicators. China's ""D"" risk designation may spark ire in Beijing, where Chinese officials have largely tried to avoid the subject of wrongful detentions and where Western sanctions are a constant trigger. Experts estimate that roughly 200 Americans are arbitrarily jailed in China, and that even more are subject to unlawful ""exit bans,"" barring them from leaving the country. Some advocates have pushed for the Biden administration to take a more vocal approach to secure their freedom, rather than the standard behind-the-scenes diplomacy. But the State Department has recently tried a similar strategy -- updating their official advisory to American and instructing them to reconsider travel plans to China due to ""arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" Syria, with which the United States does not currently have formal diplomatic relations, will be notably excluded from the ""D"" risk designation on Tuesday. U.S. officials believe that while the Syrian government may not be currently holding American journalist Austin Tice in its custody, it could have valuable information on his whereabouts and perhaps those of other missing Americans. Tice, 40, was abducted in Syria nearly 10 years ago. The White House recently held a telephone call for the relatives of detained Americans to share information with them about these new announcements. Some of them are in Washington, D.C., this week for the unveiling of a public mural depicting their loved ones, according to Jonathan Franks, a spokesperson for many of the families. The mural in Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood will depict the faces of 18 American hostages and wrongful detainees, according to Franks, who represents a group called the Bring Our Families Home Campaign. Among those featured will be American basketball star Brittney Griner, 31, and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, 52, both of whom remain detained in Russia, as well as U.S. permanent resident Paul Rusesabagina, 68, who inspired the acclaimed 2004 film ""Hotel Rwanda"" and was sentenced last September to 25 years in Rwandan prison over terrorism charges. Franks accused U.S. officials of ignoring these relatives' requests to meet with Biden, and said the phone call the White House held with the relatives was a ""one-way conversation with families."" He said the Biden administration was rolling out these new steps in order to ""pre-manage the press attention from many hostage families being in D.C. this week to unveil their mural,"" saying the White House was ""taking executive action to direct itself to follow existing law."" A spokesperson for the White House told ABC News that it had invited the families to learn about the new announcements before they were announced publicly. ""As part of our regular communication with families of those who are held hostage or wrongfully detained, we invited them to hear about new policy efforts we are launching to help bring their loved ones home,"" the spokesperson said. ""We wanted to share information with the families first before we announce them publicly, which the families deserve."" The spokesperson added that the Biden administration would ""continue to be in regular touch with these families through the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, and the president’s national security team as we do everything we can to support them during these difficult times.” Whelan's brother, David Whelan, told ABC News the executive order was ""a good next step and shows a long-term commitment by the Biden administration, both in the amount of time it must have taken to craft the framework ... and the focus on continued deterrence."" He said the White House holding the call with families in advance of the public announcement ""was exactly what families had been asking for: communication in advance of new announcements that would impact our families."" According to the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, there are actually 64 publicly known cases of Americans being held hostage or wrongfully detained around the world.

2022-07-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ag-garland-reiterates-person-trump-law-jan/story?id=87140695,AG Garland reiterates 'no person' -- not even Trump -- is above the law over Jan. 6,"Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday reiterated that ""no person,"" not even a former president, was above the law amid calls from some congressional Democrats to charge Donald Trump after last year's Capitol riot. During a press conference, a visibly animated Garland twice said that ""no person"" was above the law when pressed specifically about Trump, whom Democrats say incited the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection over his unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud in 2020. Democrats also cite Trump's larger, months-long campaign to try and reverse his election loss. (Trump insists he did nothing wrong.) The Department of Justice has been prosecuting various cases related to the rioting last January. ""There is a lot of speculation about what the Justice Department is doing, what's it not doing, what our theories are and what our theories aren't, and there will continue to be that speculation,"" the attorney general said Wednesday. ""That's because a central tenant of the way in which the Justice Department investigates and a central tenant of the rule of law is that we do not do our investigations in the public."" ""We have to hold accountable every person who is criminally responsible for trying to overturn a legitimate election, and we must do it in a way filled with integrity and professionalism,"" Garland added. In the 18 months since the attack on the Capitol, the DOJ has charged 855 defendants from all 50 states. Among those, 263 defendants have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or employees, including approximately 90 individuals who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer, according to prosecutors. There have been more than 325 guilty pleas in Jan. 6 cases so far; slightly less than 100 defendants have been sentenced to federal prison. Former Trump campaign and White House official Steve Bannon is currently on trial over contempt of Congress charges, pleading not guilty to allegations that he willfully did not comply with a House Jan. 6 committee subpoena. However, as the panel investigating the insurrection has ramped up its public hearings in June and July, Democrats have increasingly called for the DOJ to charge the former president himself -- an unprecedented though not impossible move. By contrast, the government's position has long been that sitting presidents cannot be charged with federal crimes, only impeached by Congress. And as a matter of policy, federal prosecutors take precautions when investigating candidates for office, as they do not want their work to influence elections -- though there are exceptions, including with Hillary Clinton, who in turn criticized the choice for the DOJ to speak publicly amid her 2016 campaign since she was never accused of a crime. Calls to charge Trump have only increased among Democrats, including after testimony before the Jan. 6 committee that he was aware some in the crowd during his speech at the Ellipse on Jan. 6 were armed even as he urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. According to testimony at the hearings, Trump also tried to go to the Capitol himself during the rioting but was refused by his Secret Service agents. ""Trump was told the mob was armed. He sent them to the Capitol to kill us. He wanted to go into the House Chamber to overturn the election. He assaulted a Secret Service agent who told him no. He must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the…law,"" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., tweeted last month. Separately, according to the House committee, the DOJ said it is interested in learning more about the pro-Trump scheme to submit fake electors to the Electoral College to keep him in power. Trump, who is a possible 2024 presidential contender, has said the committee's work is nakedly partisan and one-sided. Committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., previously said on ABC's ""This Week"" that he wanted more than charges. ""I'm principally interested in telling the American people the truth so we can fortify our institution against coups and insurrections going forward,"" he said. ""But I know that there's a great public hunger for individual criminal accountability, and I've got confidence in the Department of Justice, in Attorney General Merrick Garland, to do the right thing in terms of making all the difficult decisions about particular cases,"" he continued then. The committee's vice chair, Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, told ABC News' Jonathan Karl on ""This Week"" earlier this month that she believed the DOJ should not avoid prosecuting Trump. She acknowledged that indicting Trump would be ""difficult"" for the country but said that not doing so would support a ""much graver constitutional threat."" The issue of charging Trump is not a new one, though it is now an option for federal prosecutors since he left the White House. Former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016 said it could not definitively clear the then-president of accusations he obstructed justice.",11
2022-07-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mural-calls-attention-americans-held-abroad-loved/story?id=87135301,"New mural calls attention to Americans held abroad as loved ones say, 'This doesn't go away'","Families of several Americans who are detained abroad arrived in Washington on Wednesday morning to unveil a mural depicting them in an effort, their relatives say, to increase public awareness and pressure the Biden administration to do more to bring them home. The mural features 18 Americans held in other countries. There are currently 64 known citizens being detained outside the U.S., according to the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation. The mural includes WNBA superstar Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan, who have become faces of the issue because of their ongoing detentions in Russia. (Griner was arrested and later pleaded guilty to illegally bringing hashish oil into the country, though she said it was ""inadvertent"" and was part of her vape cartridge. Whelan was charged with espionage, which he and the U.S. government deny.) The 15-foot-tall installation aims to bring attention to Griner, Whelan and to a series of under-recognized Americans being held around the world, sometimes for political leverage. Many of the images used for the mural are of the last pictures taken of the detainees. While Matthew Heath's portrait depicts him with a soft smile in his crisp Marine uniform from when he served, his mother, Connie Haynes, said he is currently being tortured in Venezuela after more than two years in detention. She claims Heath has been repeatedly beaten and left with both hands broken and his retina detached and has at random intervals been fed carbon monoxide while locked in a 2 square-foot box. Heath tried to kill himself this year but was still being abused and chained to his bed in the medical facility where he was being watched, according to his mom. ""My son is not going to survive if our government does not get him home,"" she said Wednesday. ""I don't know how much more he can endure."" During the unveiling, Haynes was interrupted with a call and rushed to end of the alley next to the mural. Her son was trying to reach her. ""We were able to tell him what we're doing, for him, for the other families -- how hard we're working to try to get him home,"" Heath's uncle, Everrett Rutherford, said afterward. They were also able to connect Heath with the Biden administration's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens, who spoke Wednesday. During the rare opportunity to talk with Heath, Rutherford said he and Heath's mom were able to ""give [Heath] a bit of courage and hope."" State Department spokesman Ned Price on Wednesday called the mural ""a powerful symbol of those who have been deprived and taken from their loved ones"" and said Carstens' presence at the unveiling was an important way ""to continue to show our support for these families who are enduring an ordeal that to anyone but them is unimaginable."" ""These efforts are -- by necessity -- quiet,"" Price said when asked about the frustration of some of the detainees' families about the future. ""We have found that these cases often are best worked behind the scenes. Even though we don't speak of it, it doesn't mean that we aren't working around the clock to see the successful resolution and outcome."" The mural's artist says it was designed to be impermanent. ​​The Americans' faces, plastered using flour, water, sugar and paper, will ""fade, tear and eventually disappear over time,"" Isaac Campbell explained in a press release. That fleeting quality is meant to add a sense of urgency for the government to ""use the tools available to bring these Americans home -- before their faces fade away and disappear from this wall,"" Campbell wrote. ""This doesn't go away,"" said Neda Sharghi, the only sister of Emad Shargi, a dual citizen who has been detained in Iran since 2018 on claims he is a spy. The siblings' father, who ""felt like there was hope to bring his son home"" while watching the unveiling, fainted and was taken away in an ambulance out of the event, Neda Shargi said. ""This is our world,"" she added. ""Any second my father could pass and not see his son anymore,"" she said. ""But I don't want to cry,"" she continued, calling on anyone struck by the new mural to call their representatives to ""let President [Joe] Biden know that you will all stand with him if he can bring Americans home."" Wednesday's ceremony comes one day after Biden signed an executive order that declared hostage-taking and the wrongful detention of U.S. citizens a national emergency. The order is meant to leverage more financial sanctions against those who are directly or indirectly involved in such detentions. Additionally, the State Department added new warnings on its travel advisories to help citizens avoid locations overseas where they risk wrongful arrest. The White House informed relatives of American detainees of the executive order before its signing in a Monday call that was characterized as a ""one-way conversation"" by Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for a network of families and the Bring Our Families Home Campaign. He claimed the White House's latest actions were ""an effort to pre-manage the press attention"" around relatives of those detained arriving in Washington this week. While some families have commended the move to improve transparency and intelligence-sharing between the federal government and concerned relatives of those held overseas, others have expressed vexation with their lack of communication with the president. ""We are definitely grateful,"" Hannah Shargi, the daughter of Emad Shargi, told ABC News of Biden's recent actions. But she said she wants to see, at minimum, meetings between families and Biden organized by the country where their relative is detained. ""We know that they're suffering. We know they're scared. And we know they're anxious,"" White House spokesman John Kirby said at a briefing on Tuesday. ""We know they want their loved ones back home, and the president wants that, too."" Meanwhile, they work and they wait. ""I used to walk these streets with him,"" Hannah Shargi said Wednesday next to the mural that features her father. ""It gives me some hope that he is larger than life here. And he is larger than life in real life -- so I'm glad people are seeing him how I see him.""",2
2022-07-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-biden-tests-positive-covid-19/story?id=87184049,President Biden tests positive for COVID-19,"President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19 for the first time Thursday morning, the White House said. Biden, 79, has ""very mild symptoms"" and is taking Paxlovid, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Biden is experiencing a runny nose, dry cough and fatigue, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said. The president felt ""totally normal"" during the day Wednesday, Jha said. Biden’s symptoms started Wednesday evening, according to the physician to the president, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, and he then tested positive in the morning as a part of routine testing, Jha said. Biden tweeted that he's ""doing great"" and ""keeping busy!"" Jean-Pierre said an update will be provided every day as Biden ""continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation"" at the White House. Close contacts, ""including any Members of Congress and any members of the press who interacted with the President during yesterday’s travel,"" will be informed on Thursday, Jean-Pierre said. Biden traveled to Somerset, Massachusetts, on Wednesday where he announced executive actions to address climate change. Biden delivered his speech outside and met with local officials. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who was with Biden at his event Wednesday, tested negative on Thursday, a spokesperson said. The president greeted Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska at the White House on Tuesday. Vice President Kamala Harris, who was with the president on Tuesday, tested negative Thursday morning. Her office said she'll remain masked and continue her schedule as planned. Zelenska said she doesn't have any symptoms. She said a negative test was required ahead of Tuesday's meeting, adding that she plans on re-testing. The president will work in isolation until he tests negative, Jean-Pierre said. ""He has been in contact with members of the White House staff by phone this morning, and will participate in his planned meetings at the White House this morning via phone and Zoom from the residence,"" Jean-Pierre said. Biden is fully vaccinated and received two boosters; his second booster shot was March 30. Biden was last tested for COVID-19 on Tuesday, when he tested negative, she added. White House chief of staff Ron Klain said in an email to staff, ""We have said for some time that there was a substantial possibility that the president -- like anyone else -- could get COVID, and we have prepared for this possibility."" First lady Jill Biden tested negative Thursday morning in Detroit and will keep her full schedule in Michigan and Georgia through the day, her office said. She will continue following CDC guidance with masking and distancing, her office said. Jill Biden said she spoke with the president Thursday morning and said ""he’s doing fine"" and ""feeling good."" Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., tweeted that he spoke with Biden on the phone and that he ""sounded great and is in good spirits."" Because Biden is vaccinated and double boosted, his ""risk of serious illness is dramatically lower,"" Jha said at a Thursday press briefing. ""He is also getting treated with a very powerful antiviral that further reduces his risk of serious illness."" The virus has been sent for sequencing to determine the COVID-19 variant the president has, Jha said. ABC News Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton said the biggest factor in treatment will be the president's age. ""That is why,"" she said, it's ""no surprise that he's being treated with the antiviral pill Paxlovid. It's been shown in clinical trials to be 89% effective in reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 illness, meaning hospitalization or death."" Ashton stressed, ""He is going to be closely monitored at the White House by the personal physician of the president, and if anything looks like it is going in the wrong direction, I absolutely expect that he would be hospitalized, if nothing else than for more close observation. But remember, the White House is not like your home or my home -- they can do a lot of medical monitoring and observation and testing right there."" Former President Donald Trump was briefly hospitalized at Walter Reed Medical Center in October 2020 after he tested positive for COVID-19. Paxlovid, an antiviral pill developed by Pfizer, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for those aged 12 and older in December 2021. Patients take three pills twice daily over the course of five days. The pill was hailed as a game-changer because it was the first COVID-19 treatment that did not require an infusion, making it more convenient to give to patients. Paxlovid is made up of two medications: ritonavir, commonly used to treat HIV and AIDS, and nirmatrelvir, an antiviral that Pfizer developed to boost the strength of the first drug. Together, they prevent an enzyme the virus uses to make copies of itself inside human cells and spread throughout the body. Although there have been increasing reports of a rebounding phenomenon after taking Paxlovid, Ashton said the benefits still outweigh any of the risks. ""What would be the worst-case scenario if President Biden took Paxlovid and got this so-called rebound phenomenon? Just more time being in isolation. The benefits are clear based on the clinical trials of what this drug can do in terms of reducing the risk of hospitalization and death, and that's why it is a straightforward and easy clinical decision to make to give him that medication,"" she said. The vice president tested positive for COVID-19 in April. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a senior adviser to the president on the pandemic, tested positive last month.

2022-07-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-shows-split-past-future-note/story?id=87322926,GOP shows three-way split over past and future: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The focus on the Trump and never-Trump binary choice misses the mark when it comes to describing the state of the Republican Party -- both in describing its recent past and predicting its medium-term future. The summer burst of Jan. 6 hearings in the House, coupled with a developing series of speeches by ambitious Republicans -- including what's expected at competing events in Washington this week -- reveal at least three discrete segments of the GOP. Start with the large portion of the party that remains effectively under the control of Donald Trump. They are voters and candidates for whom clinging to falsehoods about the 2020 election remains a mantra and for whom perceived disloyalty to the former president is disqualifying, while Trump himself prepares for another possible run. Then there's the much smaller and probably still shrinking ranks of never-Trump Republicans. The Jan. 6 hearings have given them recent prominence, but the ranks of those who have taken a firm stance against Trump and his lies are likely to be thinning with forced retirements, including of Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, and the possible primary defeat of Rep. Liz Cheney in Wyoming. The part of the party that could matter the most, however, is firmly in neither camp. Former Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis might be the two highest-profile Republicans to try to place themselves elsewhere in the GOP -- loyal to Trumpism and its main goals, yet trying to steer away from the most egregious Trump falsehoods about 2020. Dueling conservative conferences will bring different wings of the Republican Party to Washington this week. Pence is the featured speaker at a Heritage Foundation event Monday and a Young America's Foundation gathering Tuesday; Trump will give his first post-presidential speech in Washington at the America First Agenda Summit on Tuesday. The never-Trump cohort will likely get less visibility for now, at least until Jan. 6 hearings resume in the fall. Kinzinger on Sunday offered a tempered assessment of where the party is heading, with a sentiment more Republicans probably agree with than may say publicly. ""Trumpism isn't dying, even though Trump is becoming irrelevant,"" Kinzinger told ABC's Jonathan Karl on ""This Week."" The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema David Jakubonis -- the armed man accused of trying to attack New York Rep. Lee Zeldin last week -- made his initial appearance before a magistrate on Saturday after being arrested on a federal charge of assaulting a member of Congress. Jakubonis was previously charged with a state crime of attempted assault after he allegedly said ""you're done"" and came at Zeldin -- a Republican gubernatorial candidate -- during a campaign speech near Rochester, ABC News' Aaron Katersky reported. Following the incident, which was captured on camera, the Army veteran was initially arraigned on the state charge and released on his own recognizance, though federal prosecutors said he should be detained pending a hearing Wednesday as to whether he is a dangerous flight risk, according to The Associated Press. (His attorney told The AP he should be freed.) The situation offered Zeldin the opportunity to take a personal victory lap over New York's crime rates, which has become one of his foremost campaign priorities. ""The [U.S. attorney] arrested the person who tried stabbing me at our campaign rally. Grateful they came in to do what NY's broken pro-criminal justice system could not - uphold the rule of law. Cashless bail must be repealed & judges need discretion to set cash bail on far more crimes,"" Zeldin tweeted on Saturday. The incident also appeared to spotlight a growing concern over violence aimed at lawmakers and other high-profile figures in the political sphere at home and abroad. Last month, Congress expanded the security given to Supreme Court justices and their families after an armed man was arrested near Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home with an alleged plan to kill him. More recently, former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated while giving a campaign speech -- a shocking attack in a country with little gun violence and a global reputation as one of the world's safest nations. At home, the attack on Zeldin could breed more partisan resentment. On the heels of the event, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, blamed it on ""the left encouraging mob violence."" ""This is the result of years of demonizing cops ... And then, of course, the guy who attempts to murder the Republican candidate for governor in New York. Gets let out of jail hours later. This is nuts. This is insane,"" Cruz said before an audience at the Turning Point USA Summit on Friday. Per The AP, citing court records, the suspect in Zeldin's case told authorities that he has struggled with alcoholism and anxiety, consumed whiskey and ""must have checked out"" during the altercation and ""did not know who the speaker was."" The TIP with Libby Cathey With former President Trump and former Vice President Pence stumping for competing candidates in the Arizona governor's race over the weekend, the state's voters appeared to be caught in a proxy-battle between the two Republican heavyweights amid ongoing fallout over the 2020 election. At a banquet-style event in Peoria with roughly 350 guests, Pence joined Gov. Doug Ducey to support Karrin Taylor Robson, a wealthy donor and former member of the Arizona Board of Regents who is widely seen as the establishment candidate. In the wake of last week's prime-time Jan. 6 hearing, Pence only mentioned Trump to tout their accomplishments together while also taking a swipe at Trump's chosen candidate in the Arizona's governor's race, Kari Lake, saying ""There are those who want to make this election about the past."" Meanwhile, Trump continued to lament the 2020 election at a large rally in Prescott Valley alongside Lake, a former local news anchor turned ""Ultra-MAGA mom."" Lake called President Joe Biden ""illegitimate"" and Trump ""Superman"" to an energized crowd that shouted ""I love yous"" back to her. The Aug. 2 primary presents a test of whether Republicans want to move forward with Trump or move on from him -- with one undecided voter telling ABC News that she wasn't swayed by Trump's endorsement but was, potentially, repelled by it. ""There's too many people that don't like him, so whoever he is sponsoring is going to have a hard time in the primary and in the general election,"" said Anastasia Keller, a lifelong Republican and Arizonian who supported Trump in 2020 but had relatives break off from him. ""They really liked Trump and what he stood for, some of the things that he accomplished, but the mean tweets and the overall attitude -- I just don't think that he can bring the country together."" At a town hall for Lake on Saturday, it was Pence that had voters' ire for siding with Robson. ""To me, it just reiterated my disappointment in Pence,"" said LeAnna Perez. ""I'm done with Mike Pence. He's proving who he truly is."" NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 4th.

""Good luck on the bar exam,"" Griner said. Griner briefly spoke to ABC News during a break in Tuesday's proceedings at a courthouse in the Moscow suburb of Khimki. When asked whether she has any complaints, she said: ""No, no complaints. Just waiting patiently."" She arrived in court that morning holding up two photographs in a clear, plastic sleeve. When asked during the break who was in the photos, she told ABC News: ""My wife. My two best friends, my teammates."" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday afternoon that officials were with Griner in court on Tuesday, and confirmed that she was ""doing OK,"" and the department has ""routinely conveyed those discussions"" to Griner's wife. ""I would say that we have made the case of Brittney Griner, we have made the case of Paul Whelan, an absolute priority and we are working actively, quietly, behind the scenes to do everything we can to see that their wrongful detentions come to an end as quickly as possible,"" Price said. Price added that the department won't be satisfied until Griner is back with her family. ""We don't look at this in terms of satisfaction. We look at this through the lens of doing everything we possibly can to see to it that these individuals are reunited with their families as quickly as we can,"" Price said. Griner's legal team continued to present evidence and called another witness to testify on Tuesday as pressure mounts on the United States to secure her release. Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native who plays professional basketball for the Phoenix Mercury, was returning to Russia to play in the WNBA's offseason when she was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki on Feb. 17, after being accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. Cherelle Griner has told ABC News that she has communicated with Brittney Griner ""sporadically"" through letters but hasn't spoken to her via telephone since she was arrested. The U.S. government had arranged for the couple to connect on the phone last month, during their fourth anniversary, but that had to be rescheduled date due to a ""logistical error,"" according to U.S. Department of State spokesperson Ned Price. The two-time Olympic gold medalist was expected to testify last week, but her testimony was delayed until Wednesday at the request of her legal team so she could have more time to prepare. If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison and also has a right to an appeal. Griner pleaded guilty on drug charges in court last week, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage mistakenly. She said she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law and did not mean to leave the cartridges in her bag. Her legal team told ABC News in a statement last week that her ""guilty"" plea was recommended by her Russian attorneys. ""Brittney sets an example of being brave. She decided to take full responsibility for her actions as she knows that she is a role model for many people,"" the lawyers said in the statement. ""Considering the nature of her case, the insignificant amount of the substance and BG's personality and history of positive contributions to global and Russian sport, the defense hopes that the plea will be considered by the court as a mitigating factor and there will be no severe sentence."" Since Griner's trial began on July 1, several Russian individuals have testified in court as character witnesses about their experience with the Phoenix Mercury center, who also played in the WNBA offseason for UMMC, a Russian basketball club in the city of Yekaterinburg. The first witness was Maxim Ryabkov, the director of UMMC. The second witness was team doctor Anatoly Galabin, who said that Griner never tested positive for doping while playing for the team. A third witness, Evgenia Belyakova, one of Griner's Russian teammates, said that Griner was the leader of the team. One of Griner's attorney also presented a letter from an American doctor in court earlier this month, giving Griner permission to use cannabis to reduce chronic pain. On Tuesday, a Russian narcologist, Dr. Mikhail Tetyushkin, testified that cannabis is often used by professional athletes to treat sports injuries because of its therapeutic properties, including analgesic and anti-inflammatory. However, with constant use, it may impair motor coordination and reaction time, which is why athletes should not take it permanently, according to Tetyushkin. He also noted that there are no international standards to differentiate medical cannabis from a drug. The U.S. Department of State classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained."" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters earlier this month that Griner's guilty plea will have ""no impact"" on any of the negotiations to bring her home. Calls to free Griner escalated following the April release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed, who was freed from a Russian prison as part of a prisoner exchange. Former Marine Paul Whelan has also been detained in Russia since late 2018. ""This is something that is, as you've heard from us consistently, is an absolute priority for Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken,"" Price, the State Department spokesperson, told reporters during Monday's press briefing in Washington, D.C. ""We are working around the clock, behind the scenes, quietly, to do everything we possibly can to see to it that Brittany Griner's ordeal, just as Paul Whelan's ordeal, is put to an end just as soon as can be possibly managed."" Price added that Chargé d'Affaires Elizabeth Rood, from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, was expected to be at Griner's hearings this week.

Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native who plays professional basketball for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained on Feb. 17 at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki as she returned to Russia to play during the WNBA's offseason after she was accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison and also has a right to an appeal. Griner said she did not mean to leave the cartridges in her bag, but that she was in a hurry and was stressed after recovering from COVID-19 that month. The WNBA star said she was aware that the U.S. had warned Americans about traveling to Russia, but she didn't want to let her team down in the playoffs. She testified that she has permission to use medical cannabis and used a certificate to buy it in the U.S. Earlier this month, one of Griner's attorneys presented a letter from an American doctor in court, giving her permission to use cannabis to reduce chronic pain. The American basketball star said she was pulled aside after inspectors at the airport found the vape cartridges in her luggage and that when she was detained, she was not offered an explanation of her rights or access to an attorney. Griner said that while there was a translator present, she was not offered a complete translation and even tried to use her phone to translate. After a brief cross-examination by the prosecution Wednesday, the case wrapped up for the day. The trial will resume on Aug. 2. In a sharp reversal, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced later on Wednesday that he will hold a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""in the coming days"" to discuss securing the freedom of Griner and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since late 2018. ""[They] have been wrongly detained and must be allowed to come home,"" Blinken told reporters. ""We put a substantial proposal on the table weeks ago to facilitate their release. Our governments have communicated repeatedly and directly on that proposal, and I'll use the conversation to follow up personally and I hope [to] move us toward a resolution."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained, and some officials have expressed concern that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing conflict. The U.S. Department of State classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained.""

2022-07-27,https://abcnews.go.com/International/viktor-bout-convicted-arms-dealer-held-us-prison/story?id=86543907,"Who is Viktor Bout, the convicted arms dealer held in a US prison?","Shortly after U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officers finally arrested him in a hotel in Thailand in 2008, Viktor Bout turned to one of the agents escorting him and said, “I guess the game is over.” Bout was arguably the world’s best-known illegal arms trafficker and his capture was the end of a nearly decade-long hunt by the U.S. to stop him. Now, 14 years since his arrest and jailing, Bout is back in play. Three sources confirmed to ABC News on Wednesday that the U.S. has proposed exchanging him for two Americans held captive by Moscow: the WNBA star Brittney Griner and the former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan. (CNN was first to report this plan.) Bout, 55, emerged as a kingpin in the global illegal arms trade during the 1990s, accused of fueling some of the world’s bloodiest conflicts, particularly in Africa. Sourcing weapons from the huge stockpiles of the collapsed Soviet Union, the Russian used a fleet of Soviet-built transport aircraft to supply vast quantities of arm, often circumventing international embargoes. “There's a lot of armed traffickers out there,” said Rob Zachariasiewicz, a now retired DEA agent who helped lead the team that arrested Bout in Thailand. “The difference with Mr. Bout was he owned his own fleet of private aircraft. People can argue: Was he the biggest arms trafficker? I look at him as one of the biggest arms transporters.” Bout eventually came to be seen as the world’s biggest weapons smuggler. The media dubbed him the “Merchant of Death” and in 2006, he inspired the movie ""Lord of War,"" which starred Nicholas Cage. The U.S. government began trying to disrupt Bout’s operations at the end of the1990s by sanctioning his companies. He was finally captured in a DEA sting. Bout agreed to supply anti-aircraft missiles to undercover DEA operatives posing as members of the Columbian militant group, the FARC, that they claimed would be used against American forces. The DEA seized Bout during a meeting to discuss the phony deal in a hotel in Thailand. Bout was extradited to the U.S. on narco-terrorism charges and in 2011 was convicted of conspiring to kill Americans, to supply anti-aircraft missiles and of aiding a terrorist organization. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. From the moment of Bout’s arrest, Russia began substantial efforts to free him, first trying to block his extradition and later campaigning for his release. “He clearly was very important. And it's my understanding that President [Vladimir] Putin himself was involved in trying to get him home,” said Zachariasiewicz, the former DEA agent. U.S. officials feared Moscow tried to corrupt Thai authorities to prevent Bout's extradition -- at one point, Zachariasiewicz learned that a Thai court had even mysteriously issued an arrest warrant for him, preventing him from traveling to the country. Zachariasiewicz said Bout later told him the warrant was “just business."" Russia’s determination to free Bout has raised questions. Both U.S. officials involved in Bout’s capture and independent researchers have long believed Bout has links to the Russian security services. Some point to his education at the Military Institute of Foreign Languages, in Moscow, reputed as a training ground for spies. Bout himself denies the claims as a smear tactic. He also rejects the charges against him, saying he is the victim of a DEA entrapment plot. But Russia previously made clear it was interested in an exchange for Bout. Zachariasiewicz said he believes Russia now wants Bout back mainly to make a political statement, given his intelligence value is likely long since exhausted. But he opposes trading the man he helped arrest, saying it risks encouraging hostile governments to take more Americans hostage. But Trevor Reed, the former U.S. Marine who was freed from Russian detention in a prisoner swap in May, has called for the Biden administration to make the trade. ""Viktor Bout has already been in prison for 15 years,” Reed told ABC in May after his release. “He's no longer a threat.” Reed said he disagreed that freeing Bout would encourage more hostage-takings, saying governments like Russia are seizing Americans regardless. Supporters of trading Bout have pointed out the judge who jailed Bout has said she believes the sentence, which was dictated by mandatory sentencing rules, was excessive. Reed notes Bout could potentially be up for release in five years anyway. “To leave Americans there and say, 'Well, we're not gonna negotiate. We’re not gonna do exchanges with this government,' that's just completely pointless because you change nothing there. They're still gonna kidnap Americans,” said Reed. “I don't care if it's 100 Victor Bouts. They have to get our guys out,” he said.",2
2022-07-27,https://abcnews.go.com/International/survived-russian-invasion-afghan-refugee-now-fights-ukrainian/story?id=87420885,"Having survived a Russian invasion once, an Afghan refugee now fights for Ukrainian freedom","KYIV -- Jalal Noory, an Afghan refugee in Ukraine who serves in the Ukrainian armed forces, defended the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv from being captured by Russian troops at the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. Noory and his fellow soldiers succeeded, repelling all Russian attacks on the capital. A Ukrainian citizen since 2005, Noory first went to the frontline in 2014 as a volunteer following Russia's invasion of Crimea and the Donbas region. Noory said he was called to the front by a sense of patriotism. ""I simply could not stay away,"" he added. ""I wanted to share my combat experience with my Ukrainian comrades,"" Noory said, adding that ""war is part of every Afghan's nature."" Noory was born in Afghanistan in the mid 1970s. He still recalls the Soviet invasion of his native country in 1979. “I remember the Soviet army crossing through my city when I was a child. We bought cigarettes and gave them to the Soviet soldiers. They gave us bullets in return to play with,"" Noory said. The conflict morphed into a full-scale war that lasted 10 years and cost the Soviets around 15,000 troops, according to official estimates. More than 3,000 men lost in the war were from Ukraine. Up to two million Afghan civilians died in the fighting -- or about 10% of Afghanistan's population in 1979. Millions of others became refugees, including Noory. Russian military tactics witnessed today in Ukraine are identical to those used in Afghanistan, Noory said. ""At the time, the Russians claimed their Afghan friends were calling for help. Just like now in Ukraine."" Russia invaded Ukraine in February this year under the pretext of protecting the Russian speaking population in the country, among other justifications proclaimed by Russian officials as the invasion unfolded. “But it's a lie. I've lived in Ukraine for 23 years and I've only spoken Russian. I never had a problem with the language”, Noory said. Frightening and terrorizing the civilian population is another staple of Russian warfare that stood the test of time, according to Noory. “Absolutely nothing has changed. They are hiding behind women, children, houses, and villages. They destroy them by rockets, bombs and tanks,” he said. Noory, having grown up in the middle of a war, absorbed military knowledge from his early childhood. But after fleeing to Ukraine in 1999, he led a peaceful life. Noory became a successful athlete, winning several titles in martial arts competitions. He also got married and had children. Yet he did not hesitate for a second when Russia invaded Ukraine both in 2014 and this year. “Someone must stop the Russians. Now it is the Ukrainians, but Poland or Lithuania could be next,” Noory said. Noory said he did not only fight for his life, family, friends, or Ukraine. He's protecting something much bigger, he added. “I fight for every human. Not just an Afghan, Ukrainian or American, but for every human."" The most important thing in life is freedom, Noory said. ""If you don't have freedom, you have nothing. So I must be free and my children have to be free.”",22
2022-07-28,https://abcnews.go.com/International/families-us-citizens-held-abroad-call-biden-administration/story?id=87452688,Americans detained abroad as families plead for Biden to help,"In September 2016, Kai Li stepped off a plane from the United States to his native China to visit relatives and attend a memorial for his late mother. He never returned. The Chinese government had imprisoned the 59-year-old Li, an act the United Nations has condemned, and which his family says is based on bogus charges of espionage. A U.S. citizen who lived in Long Island, New York, since 1989, Li is only allowed to call his wife and son once a month for conversations that last just minutes. His six-year absence has been ""devastating,"" said Harrison Li, his son. Not only did it throw his family into debt, but it also forced them to shutter two gas stations Li owned and operated as a way to make his family prosper in his adopted country, he said. ""Our government has failed us by allowing this to continue for so long,"" he said. ""They need to find the will and motivation to get him released."" Li joins the chorus of dozens of families who say the Biden administration is failing to adequately confront a crisis that experts say is only getting worse. According to the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, a Washington organization that advocates for hostages and journalist safety, at least 67 U.S. citizens are currently being held overseas; 90% of those are wrongly detained by foreign governments hostile to the U.S. Cynthia Loertscher, director of research, hostage advocacy and legislative affairs for the Foley foundation, says there is a greater interest among countries like Venezuela, Russia and China to use U.S. citizens as ""geopolitical pawns"" whose imprisonments can be leveraged to demand change in U.S. policy or to force concessions like a prisoner exchange. ""They become human collateral to try to get the United States to budge on its policies on a very large scale which is why these cases are so difficult to solve,"" Loertscher said. The problem, she said, ""is absolutely"" worsening as an increasing number of countries are testing the waters for potential gain. Last week, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that allows federal agencies to impose financial sanctions and other consequences on parties involved in hostage-taking or wrongful detentions. It also creates a new State Department indicator to alert Americans where there’s a risk of being wrongfully detained by a foreign government. Loertscher said the new tools show the administration is taking the issue seriously, but it is too soon to tell of its lasting effect considering the order did not name specific countries or cases like Li's. For Neda Sharghi, whose brother Emad has been wrongfully detained in Iran since 2018, she says nothing short of meeting with Biden directly will be satisfactory. Emad Sharghi, an American-Iranian dual citizen based in Washington, is one of at least four Americans wrongfully detained in Iran currently. Months after his capture more than four years ago, he was released, but not allowed to leave the country. Two months before Biden took office, Emad Sharghi was rearrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for charges that remain unclear to his family. Neda Sharghi said her family has written to Biden but have not received a response. She said the issue ""transcends politics"" and should be one that both political parties could work on together. Holding people captive fraudulently ""cuts against every principle we as Americans hold onto,"" Sharghi said. ""It’s baffling to me why it’s so difficult to get them released and why it isn’t a more focused priority for our administration,"" she said. A senior State Department official would not discuss specific cases with ABC News, but said that the new executive order is an example of the administration being ""willing to make tough but important decisions"" on the issue. ""Anyone who has worked on these issues for any period of time knows that strategies need to be case specific. They have to be informed by the intelligence and information about a particular case. They need to take into account country-specific facts, regional facts and anything we can bring to bear to get what we all ultimately want, which is an American home with his or her loved ones,"" the official said. Biden recently met with the families of Austin Tice, detained in Syria since 2012, and Trevor Reed, who was recently released from Russia in a prisoner exchange. Families say the media attention thrust on both cases, along with that of basketball star Brittney Griner, detained in Russia on drug charges, are bringing public awareness to an issue that for so many years has been lost in the news cycle. For Alexandra Forseth, the ""biggest obstacles"" for families like her own ""is not the government holding our own people -- it’s our own government."" Her father, Alirio Zambrano, and uncle, Jose Luis Zambrano, are members of the so-called ""Citgo 6,"" a group of Houston-based Citgo oil executives imprisoned in Venezuela since 2017 on corruption charges. Last year, the men were released under house arrest but in November were suddenly sent back to prison where conditions are so poor their families say they must purchase their clothes and food and ferry them in through intermediaries. The arrests came around the same time the U.S. extradited a Colombian financier with close ties to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. In February, a Venezuelan court upheld the executives' prison sentences. In March, the Biden administration announced the release of one member of the Citgo 6, Gustavo Cardenas, along with another American held in the country, Jorge Fernandez. “We did get a couple of Americans out and that was a great thing,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters this month regarding the release of the men. “But it was bittersweet because there's a lot of Americans still there, and we've got to get them home.” Forseth said her family has been working closely with Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs (SPEHA), a special State Department position created during the Obama years. While Carstens has ""unanimous support"" by the families, she said he and others working on their behalf are ultimately hindered by bureaucracy. The characterization is supported by Loertscher who said these efforts ultimately need the full support of the administration to be fully effective. ""There are some people absolutely working their tails off for us. They are going way above what to do, but there are some people who are full-on obstacles to making creative solutions because don’t want to bring up these men as priorities to the president,"" Forseth said. ""The short answer is, I’m mad at the people who won’t allow the negotiating process to be dynamic and swift,"" she said. Families banded by Bring Our Family Home, an organization tasked to raise the profile of the missing, unveiled a block-long mural in Washington last week that features the portraits of 18 loved ones being detained by foreign governments, including Griner and the Citgo 6. ""We would love it if President Biden came to look at it and hopefully inspire him to reach out and want to meet with us,"" said Sharghi. The project is also a catalyst for hope, something Li said, for him, is in short commodity over the years. ""There’s always hope and hope always gets dashed,"" he said. ""My father is still suffering behind bars."" Shannon Crawford contributed to this story.",2
2022-07-28,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-put-substantial-offer-table-griner-whelan-russia/story?id=87502276,US proposes releasing Russian arms dealer to free Griner and Whelan: Sources,"In a sharp reversal, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday that he will hold a call with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""in the coming days,"" which will mark the first time the two have spoken since the war in Ukraine began and will be a meaningful step toward reopening high-level diplomatic channels between the two countries. Blinken told reporters during a press briefing that a critical topic of discussion will be securing the freedom of WNBA superstar Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan, both of whom are held in Russia. The secretary revealed that the U.S. has already put forward a plan to accomplish that and is hopeful for a breakthrough on their cases. Three sources familiar with the offer confirmed to ABC News that the U.S. had proposed exchanging convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout in order to secure Griner and Whelan's release from Russia. (CNN was first to report this plan.) At a press conference in Moscow on Thursday, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova confirmed that ""the issue of mutual exchange of Russian and American citizens, staying in places of detention on the territory of the two countries, was discussed at one time by the presidents of Russia and the United States,"" but ""a concrete result has not yet been achieved."" Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday that ""there are no agreements in this area yet."" During an interview Thursday with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America,"" White House spokesman John Kirby said: ""We're still hoping that this proposal will be accepted by the Russians and that we can move forward and bring Brittney and Paul home to their families where they belong."" ""We're not going to get too much into the details here of the negotiation and the proposal that we set forth. We want to make sure that we can preserve a little bit on that so that we can actually have useful, productive discussions with the Russians in private on this,"" he continued. ""Whenever you try to arrange for the return of an American citizen that's unjustly detained, each case is so specific and unique in terms of where they are, how they're being detained, under what justification they're being detained and how you're going to negotiate for their departure. So every case is different, and the president has to balance both our national security and our values as a country as well as our obligation and his serious responsibilities to get unjustly detained Americans home. There's never a perfect solution on these things and there's a lot of factors that go into it."" Kirby noted that the proposal was ""set forth many weeks ago"" and the decision to publicize the efforts was made ""seriously."" ""There was an awful lot of discussion about whether we should even acknowledge that there was a proposal,"" he said. ""But ultimately we came down on the side that it was important to put this out there, that the American people know how seriously President [Joe] Biden takes his responsibilities to bring American citizens home when they've been unjustly detained. But we also thought it was important for the world to know how seriously America takes that responsibility."" Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, neither Blinken nor Kirby would not confirm details -- only reiterating that such cases were delicate, requiring the balance of national security interests with the importance of protecting Americans abroad. ""[They] have been wrongly detained and must be allowed to come home,"" Blinken said. ""We put a substantial proposal on the table weeks ago to facilitate their release. Our governments have communicated repeatedly and directly on that proposal, and I'll use the conversation to follow up personally and I hope move us toward a resolution."" Asked repeatedly about the specifics of the proposal, Blinken declined to shed much more light. ""You'll understand that I can't and won't get into any of the details of what we've proposed to the Russians over the course of some many weeks now,"" Blinken said. ""Here's what I can say: First, as I mentioned, we've conveyed this on a number of occasions and directly to Russian officials. And my hope would be that in speaking to Foreign Minister Lavrov, I can advance the efforts to bring them home."" ""My interest and my focus is making sure that, to the best of our ability, we get to yes,"" he said. A potentially key figure in this is Bout -- the former Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence, dubbed the ""Merchant of Death"" by the media, whom the U.S. offered to swap for both Griner and Whelan. Before Wednesday's proposal was announced, officials had indicated to ABC News that a Bout trade was one potential option. Bout's former attorney Albert Dayan told ABC News that he welcomed a deal: ""I encourage both of the governments, United Sates and Russia, in these particular cases to agree to the exchange. Especially since Mr. Bout has already served more than the majority of his sentence."" Dayan said his ex-client had spent ""much time in solitary confinement."" Blinken on Wednesday acknowledged there was precedent for prisoner trades. ""We demonstrated with Trevor Reed, who came home some months ago, that the president is prepared to make tough decisions if it means the safe return of Americans,"" Blinken told reporters, referring to the former Marine jailed in Russia before he was exchanged for Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was serving a 20-year sentence in the U.S. for drug smuggling. Blinken said that Biden played an active role in crafting the proposal for Griner and Whelan. ""He was not only directly involved -- he signs off on any proposal that we make,"" Blinken said. ""Certainly when it comes to Americans who are detained abroad, including in this case."" There were no immediate indications that Russia was ready to agree to a proposal over its detainees and the Kremlin continues to suggest it first wants to see Griner's trial play out in full. Many experts estimate there is at least a month to go. While Griner pleaded guilty earlier this month, the case against her proceeds. In separate statements on Wednesday afternoon, both Griner's lawyers and Whelan's family said they were somewhat surprised to learn of the U.S. plan. ""Like you, we are learning more today about the U.S. government's attempts to secure Paul, and Brittney Griner's, release from wrongful detention by the Russian government. Our family appreciates the Biden administration seeking Paul's release using the resources it has available. We hope the Russian government responds to the U.S. government and accepts this or some other concession that enables Paul to come home to his family,"" Whelan's twin brother, David Whelan, said in a statement. ""Hopefully no other American will be wrongfully held by the Russian government in the future. The sooner the better,"" David Whelan said. An attorney for Griner, Maria Blagovolina, said the ""defense team learned about [the] U.S. offer from the news"" and ""is not participating in the swap discussions. From the legal perspective, the swap is possible only after the court reaches a verdict. In any case, we would be really happy if Brittney will be able to come home and hope it will be soon."" Whelan, who worked in corporate security after being discharged from the Marines, was convicted in Russia of espionage -- which he and the U.S. deny. Griner was arrested and later pleaded to illegally bringing hashish oil into the country, though she said it was ""inadvertent"" and was part of her vape cartridge. Kirby, like Blinken, was tight-lipped about Griner and Whelan during a separate press briefing Wednesday. ""In order to decrease the chances for success here, we're obviously not going to be able to share more publicly about the deal,"" the White House spokesman told reporters. ""I'm sure you all have questions about what this looks like. And I'm sure you can all understand that it's not going to help us get them home if we're negotiating in public."" He took great pains to distance himself from any specifics -- pushing back on the characterization of a ""swap"" when one reporter raised it -- and wouldn't engage when asked specifically if it would be ""smart"" to include Bout in such a deal. While the focus is to get those detained freed, Kirby underscored that the balance has to include a consideration that ""our own national security is preserved and that we're not encouraging hostage taking in the future."" Blinken, for his part, has not spoken to Lavrov -- or indeed, any top Russia officials -- since January, when they were locked in a flurry of talks as the U.S. tried to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The men were in the same room during the Group of 20 summit in Indonesia earlier this month but had no direct contact. Blinken was asked at the time if there was a cost to pay for the Americans wrongfully detained in Russia by freezing out Lavrov. ""The problem is this: We see no signs whatsoever that Russia is prepared to engage in meaningful diplomacy,"" he responded, adding that the U.S. would seize the opportunity should it detect a shift from the Kremlin. On Wednesday, however, he expressed some optimism that his forthcoming call with Lavrov would be productive. ""There is in my mind, utility in conveying clear, direct messages to the Russians on key priorities for us,"" he said. ""We make a judgment in every instance,"" he said. ""I thought it was important to make clear that on these issues -- the detention of our American citizens, the food crisis the world is facing because of Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the plans that Russia now has to pursue the annexation of Ukrainian territory -- that our Russian counterparts hear directly from me."" Still, he said, ""My call with Foreign Minister Lavrov will not be a negotiation about Ukraine. Any negotiation regarding Ukraine is for its government and people to determine. As we've said from the beginning, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine."" Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Viktor Bout’s former lawyer Albert Dayan only as his attorney. Dayan represented Bout in his criminal case in the U.S. but no longer represents him. The text has been updated.

""The offer that the U.S. government has made -- and extraordinarily made public -- is super. Hopefully the Russian government will take the concessions that have been made and allow Paul to come home,"" Whelan's twin brother, David Whelan, told ABC News' Robin Roberts during an interview Thursday on ""Good Morning America.""

I think we were all taken by surprise yesterday when the announcement was made,"" David Whelan told ABC News. ""And it's nice also to know that the offers are being made -- that perhaps this is the only one that's been made public, but there may have been other offers made in the past by the U.S. government."" At a press conference in Moscow on Thursday, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova confirmed that ""the issue of mutual exchange of Russian and American citizens, staying in places of detention on the territory of the two countries, was discussed at one time by the presidents of Russia and the United States,"" but ""a concrete result has not yet been achieved."" Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that ""there are no agreements in this area yet."" When asked whether Washington was going public with the proposal now to put pressure on Moscow, a senior White House official told ABC News on Thursday that they would not push back on that characterization. The official would not comment on whether the White House is concerned Moscow will demand two for two, that Bout may not be enough to secure Whelan and Griner's freedom. Paul Whelan, a 52-year-old former Marine and Michigan-based corporate security executive, has been held in Russia since he was arrested there in December 2018 on espionage charges, which both he and the U.S. government claim are false. In June 2020, he was found guilty and sentenced to 16 years of ""hard labor"" in a Russian prison. ""We do worry about his condition,"" David Whelan told ABC News. ""He's in a labor colony in Russia -- the food's not great, the environment's not great. He's lost about 20% of his weight since he was arrested. We know that he is not being given proper nutrition because that's the normal diet in a Russian prison and we have to supplement that with quarterly packages of dried fruits, nuts, things like that to make sure he stays healthy."" Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native and star center for the Phoenix Mercury, was returning to Russia to play in the WNBA's offseason when she was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport in the Moscow suburb of Khimki on Feb. 17, after being accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. The two-time Olympic gold medalist has been held in Russia ever since and is currently on trial for drug charges. Griner pleaded guilty in a Khimki court last week, saying that she mistakenly left the cartridges in her luggage and had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law. If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison and also has a right to an appeal. The U.S. Department of State has classified both Whelan and Griner as ""wrongfully detained."" Griner remains classified as such even though she has pleaded guilty, a senior White House official confirmed to ABC News on Thursday. David Whelan thanked Griner and her supporters for being ""very gracious in including Paul's case"" in their calls for her release. ""It's been a huge help for someone like Paul, who doesn't have the same celebrity,"" he told ABC News. ""Really, there are so many Americans who are in wrongful detention around the world. Anything that raises awareness about those cases -- and Paul's, in particular for our family -- is hugely appreciated."" Although David Whelan said he hasn't spoken to his brother since October 2018, their parents are able to speak to him on a pretty regular basis,"" as recently as ""a few days ago."" ""When they speak to him again, they're going to be able to tell him about Secretary Blinken's statement,"" he added. He said their family is not discouraged by the fact that the U.S. made the offer to Russia weeks ago. ""We have been working on this for over three and a half years, Paul's been detained for 1,300 days, and so a couple of weeks really don't seem that long in that perspective,"" he noted. ""It obviously must have taken them quite a while to even make the offer in June, so that means they've been working on these sorts of issues for many months -- both the offer that was made in June and then the executive order that is a deterrent against wrongful detentions the president signed in early July."" Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order that codifies a 2020 law dealing with Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. The directive authorizes the federal government to impose financial sanctions on those who are involved -- directly or indirectly -- in wrongfully detaining U.S. citizens abroad and reinforces efforts to support the families of these Americans, according to the White House. David Whelan described his twin brother as a ""kind"" person with a ""very large sense of humor"" and a ""loud laugh."" ""I think he got into trouble for his kindness,"" he told ABC News. ""He went to Russia to help a fellow Marine who was getting married there and then was entrapped by another friend. So unfortunately, his friendships and his kindness have in some way contributed to this problem.""

White House spokesman John Kirby said on ""Good Morning America"" that the deal the U.S. proposed for Griner and Whelan had been ""set forth many weeks ago"" and that the administration decided to publicize it to show Americans what President Joe Biden was doing to try to free them amid months-long scrutiny. ""This isn't something that just happened ... This has been going on for a while, and we just haven't been able to come to fruition on it,"" Kirby said. ""There was a lot"" that went into the U.S. decision to reveal the proposed deal, he said, ""both in terms of what was happening, what wasn't happening and certainly in the context of Mrs. Griner having to testify yesterday."" Kirby attested to the administration's investment, amid criticism from some quarters that they weren't more engaged. Highlighting the offer to Russia now was valuable even if it hadn't been accepted, Kirby insisted. ""It was important to put this out there, that the American people know how seriously President Biden takes his responsibilities to bring American citizens home when they've been unjustly detained, but we also thought it was important for the world to know how seriously America takes that responsibility,"" he said.

Sources confirmed to ABC News on Wednesday that the possible deal, which the State Department described to reporters as a ""substantial proposal,"" included exchanging convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout for Griner and Whelan. Bout, dubbed the ""Merchant of Death"" by the media, was an internationally infamous weapons trafficker before his 2008 arrest in Thailand. He is serving a 25-year sentence. State Department spokesman Ned Price declined on Wednesday to shed much light on the government's offer to Russia but he acknowledged there was precedent for prisoner trades. Often, however, such deals only become public once they are confirmed and in motion.

""I hope that President Biden and his administration will do everything possible to get both, you know, Brittney and Paul out of Russia, and that they will do that immediately,"" Reed said then. ""Because every day that, you know, they sit here and wait to make a decision is one more day that, you know, Paul and Brittney are suffering.""

2022-07-28,https://abcnews.go.com/International/trevor-reed-cautiously-optimistic-proposal-free-griner-whelan/story?id=87554655,Trevor Reed 'cautiously optimistic' about proposal to free Griner and Whelan from Russia,"Trevor Reed, a former Marine from Texas who served nearly three years in a Russian prison before he was freed in a prison swap this spring, said he is ""cautiously optimistic"" that a similar deal can be worked out in the high-profile cases of two other Americans currently detained in Russia. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced this week that the U.S. has offered Russia a proposal to bring WNBA star Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan home. The White House wouldn't confirm details of the proposal, but three sources familiar with the offer confirmed to ABC News that the U.S. had proposed exchanging convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout in order to secure Griner and Whelan's release from Russia. In an interview with ABC News on Thursday, a day after news of the possible deal broke, Reed said he was ""extremely excited"" when he heard the latest development. ""I'm cautiously optimistic that that trade is going to work out, and I hope it does,"" he said. ""I'm watching along with the rest of America to see if that happens."" Reed, 30, was arrested in Moscow in the summer of 2019 while visiting his Russian girlfriend. Russian authorities accused him of assaulting officers while being driven to a police station after a night of heavy drinking. He was convicted by a Russian court in 2020 and sentenced to nine years in a prison camp. As his family grew increasingly worried about his health in the dire prison conditions, Reed was released in April as part of a prisoner exchange between the Biden administration and the Kremlin. Reed was freed in exchange for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot from Russia who was sentenced in 2011 to 20 years in prison for conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. Reed told ABC News he did not want to hear any news of a possible release while he was in prison. ""I didn't hope for anything, I didn't expect anything,"" he said. ""I asked my parents not to tell me about any news that was positive regarding my situation there because I didn't want to have that hope. And I didn't want to have the possibility of me losing that hope. That was my strategy."" For Griner and Whelan, though, he said he would want them to have hope and ""hang on to that."" The experience of finally coming home was ""surreal,"" he said. ""In these situations, you never know if that's going to work out until your feet are on U.S. soil,"" he said. He said he was surprised by the announcement of the proposal, but sees it as a good sign for Griner and Whelan. ""They may be doing that to show the Russians that they're serious about this exchange, that they want to get this done, that they're willing to get that done,"" he said. ""It may represent a change in policy with the administration,"" he continued. ""Maybe the administration now is going to be more open to prisoner swaps for all Americans who are wrongfully detained."" Reed sees a swap with Bout as a ""win-win"" for the U.S. and Russia. ""If the Russians are not idiots, then I think that they will accept that deal,"" he said. Since coming home, Reed has been vocal about the plight of Griner and Whelan and has called on the U.S. government to negotiate a prisoner swap like the one that freed him. He previously has argued that the U.S. should trade Bout, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2012 on federal narco-terrorism charges, for the two Americans' release. Bout has repeatedly been suggested by Russian state media as a possible trade as well. Blinken said Wednesday that he will hold a call with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""in the coming days"" to discuss securing the freedom of Griner and Whelan. He revealed the U.S. government had already ""put a substantial proposal on the table weeks ago to facilitate their release"" and remains hopeful for a breakthrough in their cases. At a press conference in Moscow on Thursday, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova confirmed that ""the issue of mutual exchange of Russian and American citizens, staying in places of detention on the territory of the two countries, was discussed at one time by the presidents of Russia and the United States,"" but ""a concrete result has not yet been achieved."" Griner, 31, has been detained in Russia since Feb. 17 and is currently on trial for drug charges. She was arrested at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki after she was accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. Griner, a Phoenix Mercury player who had been returning to Russia to play during the WNBA's offseason, testified this week that she did not mean to violate Russian law when bringing vape cartridges into the country and that she was in a hurry and stressed after recovering from COVID-19 that month. Griner has reached out to President Joe Biden, urging him in a letter earlier this month to help get her out of Russia. ""As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey, or any accomplishments, I'm terrified I might be here forever,"" Griner wrote to the president in the handwritten letter, portions of which were made public by her representatives. A verdict in the case is expected early next month. If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison. She does have the right to an appeal. Whelan, 52, a Michigan-based corporate security executive, was arrested in December 2018 on espionage charges while visiting Moscow for a friend's wedding. In June 2020, he was found guilty and sentenced to 16 years of ""hard labor"" in a Russian prison. Both he and the U.S. government have said the claims are false. ""We do worry about his condition,"" his twin brother, David Whelan, told ABC News' Robin Roberts during an interview Thursday on ""Good Morning America."" ""He's in a labor colony in Russia -- the food's not great, the environment's not great. He's lost about 20% of his weight since he was arrested.

David Whelan expressed optimism following news of the U.S. government's proposal. ""The offer that the U.S. government has made -- and extraordinarily made public -- is super. Hopefully, the Russian government will take the concessions that have been made and allow Paul to come home,"" he said. Calls to free both Americans have escalated in the months since Reed's release, and the State Department has said their cases are an ""absolute priority."" ""We're still hoping that this proposal will be accepted by the Russians and that we can move forward and bring Brittney and Paul home to their families where they belong,"" White House spokesperson John Kirby told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos during an interview Thursday on ""Good Morning America."" ABC News has learned that the proposed swap does not include American Marc Fogel, a 60-year-old teacher who was recently sentenced to 14 years in a Russian penal colony on drug charges. His attorney, Thomas Firestone, told ABC News on Thursday that he hopes the U.S. government will designate Fogel as wrongfully detained and ""use all of its efforts to try to get him out."" Firestone said Fogel's spirits are ""not good."" ""We're very concerned about him,"" Firestone said.",20
2022-07-29,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/justice-alito-mocks-prince-harry-foreign-critics-abortion/story?id=87564162,Justice Alito mocks Prince Harry and other foreign critics of abortion decision,"Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito for the first time publicly addressed critics of his landmark opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, using a speech in Italy to make light of Britain's Prince Harry and other foreign figures who have lamented the rollback of U.S. protections for abortion. ""What really wounded me, what really wounded me, was when the Duke of Sussex addressed the United Nations and seemed to compare the decision -- whose name may not be spoken -- with the Russian attack on Ukraine,"" Alito said in a sarcastic tone. The decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, was released last month. Prince Harry had referenced ""the rolling back of constitutional rights here in the U.S."" as well as war in Ukraine as examples of why 2022 is ""a painful year in a painful decade,"" during a speech July 18 in New York. Alito also made light of commentary from outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""I had the honor this term of writing I think the only Supreme Court decision in the history of that institution that has been lambasted by a whole string of foreign leaders who felt perfectly fine commenting on American law,"" he said. ""One of these was former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, but he paid the price."" Alito appeared to reference Johnson's recent resignation after a series of scandals in office. The justice's comments came during a speech July 21 in Rome at a conference on religious liberty hosted by the University of Notre Dame Law School. The appearance was not previously announced by the Court; video of the speech was posted online Thursday. “It is hard to convince people that religious liberty is worth defending if they don’t think that religion is a good thing that deserves protection,” Alito told the audience. “The challenge for those who want to protect religious liberty in the United States, Europe, and other similar places is to convince people who are not religious that religious liberty is worth special protection. That will not be easy to do.” The Court's conservative majority delivered significant victories for religious liberty in the most recent term, affirming the right of a public school football coach to pray among students at the 50-yard line; allow a civic group to raise a Christian flag on Boston City Hall flag pole; and, permit Maine families to utilize taxpayer-funded tuition credits for religious schools. Those decisions, along with major rulings on gun rights, climate policy and immigration, thrust the justices to the center of a divisive and highly-partisan public debate. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the most senior liberal and third woman justice, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the most junior conservative and 5th woman justice, held a rare public conversation Thursday night in what appeared to be at least partly a bid toward lowering the temperature of debate. ""We like each other. We really do,"" Barrett said of her relationship with Sotomayor and her other colleagues. ""As is often joked, this is like a marriage. We have life tenure and we get along."" ""Fundamentally, they are good people,"" Sotomayor said of her colleagues. The pair, appearing together for the first time, spoke as part of the Reagan Institute's Summit on Education in a session moderated by Yale Law professor Akhil Reed Amar. The theme of the event was ""An Educated Citizenry."" ""To the extent we can maintain a tone,"" Barrett said, ""I think that in itself has an educative function on civics."" Neither addressed any of the decisions of the past term, even obliquely; but they did lament public misunderstanding of the court and demonization of its members. ""For me, democracy means an informed group of people,"" Sotomayor said, ""because without being informed, you really can't know how to shape, how to live with others."" Organizers of the event said the conversation was pre-taped several weeks ago but aired Thursday for the first time.",3
2022-07-31,https://abcnews.go.com/International/proposed-prisoner-swap-quickly-free-detainees-russia-analysis/story?id=87373310,Why the proposed prisoner swap may not quickly free detainees in Russia: Analysis,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken's announcement that the U.S. had put a ""substantial offer"" on the table for Russia aimed at bringing home two Americans imprisoned in Russia -- WNBA star Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan -- was an exceedingly rare disclosure in the world of hostage diplomacy, where almost nothing is revealed until a deal is done. The revelation that convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout had been offered up as part of a prisoner swap only intensified speculation that the detainees might soon be on their way home. But despite these developments, and Blinken restarting direct discussions with his Russian counterpart on Friday -- their first interaction since the outbreak of war in Ukraine -- experts caution there is still likely a long way to go before Griner and Whelan are released. Trial delay While Griner has been in Russian detention since February on drug charges and pleaded guilty, she has yet to be convicted of a crime. Although a guilty verdict is all but assured, Russia has consistently signaled that it wants to see its legal process play out before brokering any kind of agreement. ""That's what is required under Russian law,"" said William Pomeranz, the director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute for advanced research on Russia and Eurasia. ""It's required that there has to be a final judgement."" Pomeranz cautions that there are ""always loopholes"" in the country's legal system, but says that Moscow wants to appear to have held out until after her sentencing before making a determination on a prisoner exchange or similar agreement. Griner's trial began in early July, and Russian court watchers have predicted it could conclude before the end of summer. But there is no clearly set timeline and her preliminary detention has already been authorized through Dec. 20. That's not the kind of control you want your adversary to have if you're a negotiator. ""If the Russians want to delay, they can do so. It will be up to the Russian court as to how fast and expedited a decision is made,"" Pomeranz said. A numbers game This spring, the Biden administration conducted its first prisoner swap, exchanging Russian citizen and convicted drug trafficker Konstantin Yaroshenko for another former U.S. Marine, Trevor Reed. While Reed's return home was welcomed, he and many others questioned why Whelan -- who has already been locked away in Russia for over three years on espionage charges the U.S. government has called ""trumped up"" -- was left behind. On Thursday, State Department Spokesperson Ned Price declined to say whether the U.S would take part in a deal that saw only Whelan or Griner freed, but it comes as no surprise that the offer put forward by the administration seeks a package deal. However, even though the allegations against Griner wouldn't even amount to a misdemeanor in the U.S. and the government says the case against Whelan is fabricated, Russia will likely expect more than Bout -- or any individual prisoner -- in return. ""The Russians will want to have equivalency,"" said Pomeranz. ""So if there are two Americans who are being proposed for a swap, the Russians will insist on two Russians in American custody."" This means the Biden administration would have to sweeten the deal -- and open itself up to more criticism for letting Russian criminals walk free. And while Moscow might say Bout is a high priority, former Defense and State Department official and ABC News contributor Col. Steve Ganyard says in reality, he isn't. ""He is not a spy who caused major damage to U.S. national security,"" Ganyard said. ""They get more mileage out of poking a finger in the United States' eye, and more importantly, making the White House look desperate."" Publicity push? The very revelation that the administration offered Moscow a deal may speak best to that desperation. ""A sensitive negotiation isn't made public before it's done if it's going well,"" said Ganyard. ""Publicizing the offer is a way of deflecting U.S. domestic pressure, but it's actually hurting the White House negotiating position by admitting frustration and a weak hand."" Price admitted on Thursday it was evident that the deal had not been received as U.S. diplomats had hoped given the amount of time that had passed since the offer was first made. ""We believe that now that this message, this substantial proposal, has been conveyed directly and repeatedly through appropriate channels in recent weeks -- of course without resolution,"" he said. ""The fact that now, several weeks later, we are where we are, I think you can read into that as being a reflection of the fact that this has not moved to the extent we would like,"" Price added. So far, the Russians have given no public indication that they are ready to seriously engage. ""Unless there is some behind-the-scenes movement we don't know about, Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan will continue to be pawns in a drawn-out negotiation,"" said Ganyard.",20
2022-08-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/international-tiger-day-tiger-populations-increase-conflicts-humans/story?id=87501064,"International Tiger Day: As tiger populations increase, so do conflicts with humans","Global conservation efforts to save tigers have far exceeded expectations, according to experts. There have, however, also been unintended consequences. Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba announced Friday, on International Tiger Day, that the number of tigers in the country has increased 290% since 2009. The revelation surpasses the joint target set by the government and conservationists, Narendra Pradhan, the Nepal program coordinator for the International Union for Conservation of Nature, told ABC News. Nepal, a landlocked Asian country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains, is one of 13 countries that committed to doubling its tiger population during a 2010 international tiger summit in Saint Petersburg, Russia. But as the number of tigers in Nepal continues to grow, so does the conflict between tigers and their human neighbors. In the last year, tigers have killed three people every month on average, according to Nepalese officials. Very few of these attacks involve ""problem tigers"" that venture from the forests and national parks to attack humans and livestock, Mayukh Chatterjee, field program manager for the Chester Zoo in the U.K. and a member of the IUCN's Human-Wildlife Conflict & Coexistence Specialist Group, told ABC News. Many Nepalese live in subsistence farming communities and the majority of the attacks occur when they are foraging, Smriti Dahal, program coordinator for the World Wildlife Fund's Tigers Alive Initiative and a native of Nepal, told ABC News. Sometimes the attacks occur when the farmers bring their livestock, such as goats and cows, to the forest because they are unable to collect enough fodder, Dahal said. Tigers are elusive and shy, Pradhan said, adding that the attacks likely occur when they feel startled or threatened. Part of the reason why tigers have flourished in countries like Nepal, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka is because these cultures revere big cats, experts said. Other Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, have continued to see a decline or even total extinction of tigers. India is also seeing an increase of human-tiger conflict as a result of the soaring numbers, Chatterjee said. In his address on Friday, Deuba stressed the necessity for more strategic methods of tiger habitat management due to the conflict, which he said is taking place in the absence of adequate food and water. Communities in tiger countries are rapidly changing as development continues and people move around geographically, Dahal said. As humans produce more food to fulfill growing populations, tigers and humans will begin to share more space. While conservationists are pleased with their efforts, the focus is now on educating locals on safety and getting them involved in conservation efforts, Chatterjee said. In addition, partners in the tiger initiative will need to monitor and perhaps slow the growth in some populations. Tigers are ""very prolific breeders"" and not much thought was given a decade ago to how tigers would peacefully coexist with an ever-growing human population, Chatterjee said. Further growth in tiger populations will only lead to more human-tiger conflicts as the number of individual tigers move out of the secure conservation lands, Chatterjee said. Communities are aware and support the tiger conservation work, Pradhan said. But partners in the tiger initiative will need to be mindful of the conflict, because as humans continue to lose their livestock and even their lives, resentment toward the big cats could begin, Chatterjee said. ""We don't want that social tolerance to go down one day and people start killing because they've reached a limit where they cannot live with tigers,"" Dahal said.

Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native who plays professional basketball for the Phoenix Mercury, was returning to Russia for the WNBA's offseason when she was detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport in the Moscow suburb of Khimki on Feb. 17, after being accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. She pleaded guilty to drug charges in court last month, saying the cartridges were in her luggage by mistake and that she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law. If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison and also has a right to an appeal. Griner, who had last appeared in court on July 27, again held up photographs of her loved ones as she was escorted into the defendant's cage where she remained behind bars for Tuesday's proceedings at a Khimki courthouse. An employee who works at the Russian state lab where Griner's vape cartridges were tested took the stand, while defense attorneys called into question the testing methods and the competency of the staff conducting the tests. Last week, in a sharp reversal, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that he will hold a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""in the coming days"" to discuss securing the freedom of Griner and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since late 2018. ""[They] have been wrongly detained and must be allowed to come home,"" Blinken told reporters in Washington, D.C, on July 27. ""We put a substantial proposal on the table weeks ago to facilitate their release. Our governments have communicated repeatedly and directly on that proposal, and I'll use the conversation to follow up personally and I hope [to] move us toward a resolution."" Two days later, Blinken told reporters that he had a ""frank and direct conversation"" with Lavrov about a U.S. proposal to exchange convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout in return for Griner and Whelan's freedom. ""I pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner,"" Blinken said. ""I'm not going to characterize his responses and I can't give you an assessment of whether I think things are more or less likely, but it was important that [he] hear directly from me on that."" During a press conference in Moscow on July 28, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Vladimirovna Zakharova confirmed that ""the issue of mutual exchange of Russian and American citizens, staying in places of detention on the territory of the two countries, was discussed at one time by the presidents of Russia and the United States,"" but ""a concrete result has not yet been achieved."" Calls to free Griner and Whelan escalated following the release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed, who was imprisoned in Russia for nearly three years and was freed was freed on April 27 as part of a prisoner swap. The U.S. Department of State has classified both Whelan and Griner as ""wrongfully detained."" Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained, and some officials have expressed concern that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing war. Last month, Griner's legal team told ABC News in a statement last that her guilty plea was recommended by her Russian attorneys. Griner took the stand on July 27, telling the court she did not mean to violate Russian law when bringing vape cartridges into the country. She testified that she has permission to use medical cannabis and used a certificate to buy it in the U.S. Two weeks earlier, one of Griner's attorneys presented a letter from an American doctor in court, giving her permission to use cannabis to reduce chronic pain. Griner also said she did not mean to leave the cartridges in her bag, but that she was in a hurry and was stressed after recovering from COVID-19 that month. The WNBA star said she was aware that the U.S. had warned Americans about traveling to Russia, but she didn't want to let her team down in the playoffs.

2022-08-03,https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-man-detained-russia-months-due-political-purposes/story?id=87831281,Texas man detained in Russia for months due to 'political purposes': Congressman,"More than six months after Texas father David Barnes was arrested by Russian authorities, his family is calling on officials in Washington to do more to try to facilitate his release. ""David's a very caring and empathetic person,"" his sister, Carol Barnes, told ABC News. ""Every minute of every day, my mind is on what he's going through, the hell that he's living in, and how unjust it is."" David Barnes has been held since January in a Moscow jail. He is one of several Americans being detained in Russia, but unlike Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan or Marc Fogel, law enforcement in Moscow has alleged that he engaged in criminal activity in the United States -- an accusation that has bewildered members of his family, American prosecutors and now, his local congressman. ""Mr. Barnes has been arrested and detained for political purposes, and my office is working with the State Department to bring him back to Texas as soon as possible,"" Rep. Kevin Brady told ABC News in a statement. ""We continue to urge the Biden administration to do all it can to resolve this situation and free Mr. Barnes."" David Barnes traveled from suburban Houston to Moscow in December 2021 in an effort to gain legal clearance to either see his children or bring them home, after his Russian ex-wife allegedly violated a court custody order and fled the United States with them, according to his family. In August 2020, a judge in Montgomery County signed an order designating David Barnes as the sole managing conservator of his children, which gave him rights to decide the primary home for his children, make decisions regarding their education, represent them in legal actions, and possess their passports. Barnes' ex-wife is herself now wanted in the U.S. on a felony charge of interference with child custody, after she fled with the children in 2019. ""David Barnes traveled to Russia in an honest attempt to reunite with his children, who had been kidnapped by their mother and taken to Russia illegally,"" Brady said. ""This is a child custody dispute, not a criminal matter."" On Jan. 13, Russian investigators apprehended Barnes in Moscow, accusing him of abusing his two children years earlier in Texas, according to translations of court documents. Similar allegations against Barnes were brought to authorities in Texas by his now-ex-wife Svetlana Koptyaeva during their long and acrimonious divorce proceedings. The allegations were investigated in 2018 by the Department of Family and Protective Services, which found insufficient evidence to support them and closed the case without any findings of abuse or any charges against Barnes. ""At this time, there are no accusations out of Montgomery County that we are aware of that would allow Mr. Barnes to be held in custody,"" Kelly Blackburn of the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office told ABC News in May. A spokesperson for the Harris County District Attorney's Office said in May that David Barnes had not been charged in any child abuse cases there either. Representatives from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow have met with David Barnes in the time since his arrest, according to emails between his family and the State Department. However, Brady's comments mark the first time that an elected official has stated publicly that David Barnes' detention in Russia is due to ""political purposes."" Carol Barnes is hoping the increased attention on her brother's situation will motivate other officials to classify him as being wrongfully detained, push for his release or add him to a proposed prisoner exchange between Russia and the U.S. ""Washington should be able to get their own American citizens back home without so much red tape and us having to contact hundreds of people and getting 1% response,"" Carol Barnes said. ""I mean, somebody pay attention."" In July, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a proposal that called on Russia to exchange Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan for Viktor Bout, a Russian citizen who was convicted of charges related to illegal arms trafficking. Carol Barnes said she has not heard anything about her brother being part of any potential prisoner exchange. ABC News asked the White House in July whether it considers David Barnes to be wrongfully detained and if efforts have been made to secure his release, but it referred all questions to the State Department. ""It's just so frustrating,"" Carol Barnes said. ""I realize we're dealing with Russians and it's not that easy, but I don't think they're paying enough attention to it."" A spokesperson for the State Department wrote in a statement on July 26 that they are continuing to urge the Russian government to allow for regular consular access and services to be provided to Americans who remain detained in Russia. ""We take seriously our responsibility to assist U.S. citizens abroad and are monitoring Mr. Barnes' situation closely,"" the spokesperson said, in part. ""The department routinely monitors cases of all U.S. nationals detained abroad for indications that it should be designated as a wrongful detention. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment at this time."" David Barnes celebrated his 65th birthday in his Moscow detention center in July. His family does not know when they will get to see him again. ""I want him back. I love him. I miss him,"" Carol Barnes said. ""There's no joy in my life right now at all.""

She was then sentenced to nine years in prison. The judge found that Griner had criminal intent and said she was guilty of smuggling and storing illegal drugs. Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native who plays professional basketball for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained on Feb. 17 at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki as she returned to Russia to play during the WNBA's offseason after she was accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. The two-time Olympic gold medalist, who appeared in court Thursday for the final hearing in her trial, was facing up to 10 years in prison although 9 1/2 years was the maximum sentence with time served. Griner has a right to appeal. Griner's attorneys, Marina Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, told reporters outside of the courthouse in Moscow on Thursday that they plan to file an appeal. ""She's very upset. Very upset, very stressed,” Blagovolina said of Griner. “She can hardly talk, honestly, so it's difficult time for her."" U.S. President Joe Biden slammed Russia in a statement on Thursday morning following Griner's sentencing and called on Russia to ""release her immediately."" ""Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney,"" Biden said. Calls to free Griner escalated following the release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed in April, who was freed from a Russian prison as part of a prisoner exchange. Former Marine Paul Whelan has also been detained in Russia since 2019. ""It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates,"" Biden wrote in the statement. ""My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible."" Griner shared an emotional statement in court ahead of the verdict on Thursday morning. She apologized to her loved ones for the hurt that her detention has caused and said that her parents instilled hard work in her and this value is what brought her to Russia. Griner’s trip to Russia to play in the offseason has underscored the issue of pay inequality in professional basketball Many WNBA players have traveled around the world to play in the offseason because they don’t make enough money during the season -- an issue that is not as prevalent for NBA players. The top WNBA salary is $228,000 per season, whereas star NBA players make over $20 million a year. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a joint statement, ""Today's sentencing is unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected and Brittney Griner remains wrongfully detained. The WNBA and NBA's commitment to her safe return has not wavered and it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States."" The Phoenix Mercury star held up a photo of her Russian teammates on Thursday and said that she made ""an honest mistake"" by packing the vape cartridges in her bag. The prosecutor argued that Griner's guilt has been proven and also asked that Griner pay a $16,500 fine, which is about 1 million Russian roubles. ""This is a miscarriage of justice,"" Elizabeth Rood, Charge d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Russia, who has attended each hearing, told reporters outside the court. ""The U.S. Department of State has determined that Ms. Griner was wrongfully detained. Nothing in today's decision changes that determination."" Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges in court last month, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage mistakenly and that she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law. Her legal team told ABC News in a statement last month that her ""guilty"" plea was recommended by her Russian attorneys. ""Brittney sets an example of being brave. She decided to take full responsibility for her actions as she knows that she is a role model for many people,"" the lawyers said in the statement. ""Considering the nature of her case, the insignificant amount of the substance and BG's personality and history of positive contributions to global and Russian sport, the defense hopes that the plea will be considered by the court as a mitigating factor and there will be no severe sentence."" Griner testified last week that she did not mean to leave the cartridges in her bag, but that she was in a hurry and was stressed after recovering from COVID-19 that month. The WNBA star said she was aware that the U.S. had warned Americans about traveling to Russia, but she didn't want to let her team down in the playoffs. She also testified that she has permission to use medical cannabis and used a certificate to buy it in the U.S. Earlier this month, one of Griner's attorneys presented a letter from an American doctor in court, giving her permission to use cannabis to reduce chronic pain. The American basketball star said she was pulled aside after inspectors at the airport found the vape cartridges in her luggage and that when she was detained, she was not offered an explanation of her rights or access to an attorney. Griner said that while there was a translator present, she was not offered a complete translation and even tried to use her phone to translate.

The Senate voted 95-1, with Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley voting no and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voting ""present."" The vote comes several weeks after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved admitting Finland and Sweden into NATO. Lawmakers were working to approve the matter before their August break. Finland and Sweden announced their decision to formally join NATO within days of each other in May, ending long-held positions of neutrality in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They simultaneously submitted their applications on May 18. All 30 NATO members must ratify the accession of the two countries. Seven countries remain. During Wednesday's vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took a veiled swipe at Paul and Hawley in a floor speech, saying, ""Their accession will make NATO stronger and America more secure. If any senator is looking for a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish them good luck."" Hawley aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, saying the U.S. could devote more funds and firepower to NATO ""or do what we need to do to deter Asia and China. We cannot do both."" Paul has always worked to keep the U.S. out of foreign conflicts. He offered an amendment that most rejected seeking to ensure that Congress' role in authorizing military force would not be usurped by the NATO pact's common defense commitment, known as Article 5. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., applauded the Senate's vote, saying on Twitter that it is ""all the more urgent given [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's barbaric, immoral and unjustified war in Ukraine."" President Joe Biden thanked a number of senators, including Schumer and McConnell, for moving the ratification process along quickly.

2022-08-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-members-congress-urge-blinken-demand-hotel-rwanda/story?id=87949842,Exclusive: Members of Congress urge Blinken to demand 'Hotel Rwanda' hero's release,"While WNBA star Brittney Griner's sentencing in Russia dominates headlines, members of Congress are urging the White House to do more to free yet another prominent figure -- Paul Rusesabagina, who inspired the acclaimed 2004 film ""Hotel Rwanda."" In a letter shared exclusively with ABC News on Thursday, Reps. Joaquin Castro and Young Kim asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken to ""use all the diplomatic means at your disposal to ensure Mr. Rusesabagina's safe return to the United States."" They implored the secretary to push Rwanda's president for Rusesabagina's ""immediate release"" during Blinken's visit next week to the East African nation, where Rusesabagina has been held for nearly two years. Rusesabagina, a lawful U.S. permanent resident, was the manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali during the Rwandan genocide of 1994, when divisions between Rwanda's two main ethnic groups came to a head. The Rwandan government, controlled by extremist members of the Hutu ethnic majority, launched a systemic campaign with its allied Hutu militias to wipe out the Tutsi ethnic minority, slaughtering over the course of 100 days more than 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis and the moderate Hutus who tried to protect them, according to estimates from the United Nations. More than 1,200 people took shelter in the Hotel des Mille Collines during what is often described as the darkest chapter of Rwanda's history. Rusesabagina, who is of both Hutu and Tutsi descent, said he used his job and connections with the Hutu elite to protect the hotel's guests from massacre. The events were later immortalized in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" with American actor Don Cheadle's portrayal of Rusesabagina earning an Academy Award nomination for best actor in 2005. Rusesabagina, who fled Rwanda with his family in 1996 and later settled in San Antonio, Texas, rose to fame and was lauded as a hero after the movie's release. In 2005, he was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor given by the American president. He also wrote a book, gave paid speeches, and became an outspoken critic of Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who has been in office for the last two decades. In August 2020, Rusesabagina traveled to Dubai to meet up with a Burundi-born pastor who Rusesabagina alleges had invited him to speak at churches in Burundi about his experience during the Rwandan genocide. The pair hopped on a private jet that Rusesabagina believed would take them to Burundi's capital, according to Rusesabagina's international legal team. Rusesabagina did not know that the pastor was working as an informant for the Rwanda Investigation Bureau and had tricked him into boarding a chartered flight to Kigali. He was subsequently arrested and tried on a slew of terrorism-related charges, with Rwandan prosecutors alleging that Rusesabagina wanted to go to Burundi to coordinate with rebel groups based there and in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last September, Rusesabagina, who has maintained his innocence, was convicted on eight of nine terrorism-related charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison. In May, the U.S. Department of State determined that Rusesabagina has been ""wrongfully detained."" In June, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan resolution calling on the Biden administration to demand Rusesabagina's release on humanitarian grounds. In their letter to Blinken, Castro and Kim warned that if the U.S. does not take a firm stance on Rusesabagina's detention, others may be at risk. ""Failure to address the actions of the Rwandan government will only embolden it to continue to target U.S. citizens and U.S. residents,"" they wrote. According to the State Department, Blinken intends to discuss Rusesabagina's case during his upcoming visit to Rwanda. Speaking to ABC News on Thursday, a senior U.S. official declined to say whether Blinken would communicate any consequences for the Rwandan government if it fails to release Rusesabagina, but insisted that the Biden administration has been ""very clear with the government of Rwanda about our concerns about his case, his trial, and his conviction, particularly the lack of fair trial guarantees."" Castro and Kim said the Biden administration must move as a quickly as possible to secure Rusesabagina's freedom due to his age and failing health. ""We also ask that you visit Mr. Rusesabagina, who is imprisoned under unsafe conditions and suffering from health issues that jeopardize his life,"" they wrote in their letter. ""Paul Rusesabagina is a 68-year-old cancer and stroke survivor who remains in poor health. He has been imprisoned for over 700 days without proper medical care."" In a statement to ABC News on Thursday, Rusesabagina's family expressed their gratitude that his case ""is receiving attention from senior levels within the [Biden] administration and across Capitol Hill."" ""We appreciate in particular Secretary Blinken's dedicated visit and hope his direct engagement will help bring our family nightmare to an end,"" said Rusesabagina's daughter, Anaise Kanimba. ""Rwanda is not an adversary country like Russia, China or Iran; it is a country that significantly benefits from U.S. taxpayer money and judicial cooperation,"" she added. ""If the administration can bring back other wrongfully detained [citizens] from Russia, it can certainly leverage its relationship with Rwanda.""",2
2022-08-05,https://abcnews.go.com/International/expert-explains-russian-law-brittney-griner-sentencing/story?id=88000975,Expert explains Russian law behind Brittney Griner sentencing,"Brittney Griner is known for her game on the basketball court, but she's now become embroiled in a much more dangerous game -- a political gambit between Russia and the U.S. William Pomeranz, the director of the Wilson Center Kennan Institute, is an expert on Russian law and the political developments within the country. He spoke to ABC News Live about the message behind Russia's sentencing of Griner and what may come next. He said that Griner's conviction and nine-year sentence for drug charges Thursday ""did not come as a surprise."" ""Russian criminal law treats drug offenses very harshly and I was not surprised that she got basically the maximum sentence,"" Pomeranz said. Griner has been detained in Russia for over five months after she was stopped at an airport for possessing vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. She faced a maximum of 10 years in prison, though she will be credited with five months time served. Calls to free the WNBA star have escalated in the months since her detainment and put a considerable amount of pressure on the Biden administration to act. Last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced discussions of a potential prisoner exchange. He said the proposal includes exchanging Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since 2019, for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. President Joe Biden said in a brief comment on Friday that he was ""hopeful"" and his administration was ""working hard"" to bring Griner home. Pomeranz said that whether Griner is a ""political hostage"" is ""up for interpretation,"" but the only way to get Griner out of Russia is through diplomacy. ""Diplomatic negotiations are ongoing, but, clearly, because the Biden administration has made the most overtures, the Russians are in the driver seat of when and how Brittney Griner gets home,"" said Pomeranz. Pomeranz added that Griner's guilty conviction under Russian law may help. ""I think the Russians will be more inclined to negotiate. But how fast? I just don't know,"" said Pomeranz.",20
2022-08-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/desantis-opens-front-abortion-wars-note/story?id=87942231,DeSantis opens new front in abortion wars: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein If conservatives were going to retrench after this week's vote in Kansas, the governor of Florida did not get the memo. And if Republicans were supposed to wait on former President Donald Trump to signal any 2024 intentions, that same man is writing a different ticket on that, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is taking the fight over abortion rights to a provocative and newly aggressive front with his move to suspend an elected prosecutor even before he does or doesn't prosecute individuals accused of violating the state's new abortion ban. ""You have neglected your duty and you are displaying a lack of competence to be able to perform those duties,"" DeSantis, R-Fla., said during a Thursday news conference called to suspend Andrew Warren, the Hillsborough County state attorney. Warren has been elected twice in the Tampa-based county and also emerged as a high-profile critic of DeSantis over COVID restrictions, as well as prosecutions of protests. In case the politics of the moment might be lost, the announcement was previewed the night before by DeSantis' spokeswoman, who Wednesday night promised a development that would provoke a ""liberal media meltdown."" Warren tweeted that the ""political stunt is an illegal overreach that continues a dangerous pattern by Ron DeSantis of using his office to further his own political ambition."" Media reaction notwithstanding, DeSantis' likely Democratic opponent this fall, Rep. Charlie Crist, called it the move of a ""wannabe dictator."" The Democratic National Committee called it ""fundamentally un-American"" to ""overturn the will of Florida voters."" His announcement came as a range of nationally prominent conservative voices -- though not DeSantis himself -- convened in Dallas for the Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump is scheduled to deliver the closing address there on Saturday, after a campaign rally Friday in Wisconsin. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Negotiating the release of basketball star Brittney Griner could be treacherous territory for the Biden administration. A Russian judge on Thursday sentenced the athlete to nine years in a penal colony after she was convicted of smuggling and storing illegal drugs. Only minutes afterward, the president issued a statement condemning the ruling and the detention of both Griner and Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine charged with espionage by Russian authorities. ""It's unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends and teammates,"" Biden wrote. ""My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible."" A call last week between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, about a potential prisoner swap didn't yield a resolution. In a Russian readout of the call, officials called for negotiations to take place behind closed doors. The demands of Russian officials could be steep. They could attempt to use Griner's imprisonment as a bargaining chip on issues beyond a prisoner swap, such as sanctions or policy pertaining to the war in Ukraine. In the shadow of a foreign policy win for the Biden administration (the killing of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri), Griner's sentence presents an enormous challenge on the world stage without any clear solutions. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema In less than two weeks, Wyoming voters will conclude their referendum on Republican Rep. Liz Cheney's future in the House as she digs in on her anti-Trump stance in the lead-up to primary day. The latest example of Cheney's ""no regrets"" approach to her political moves came in the form of a one-minute ad featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served in the George W. Bush administration. ""In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump. He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He is a coward. A real man wouldn't lie to his supporters,"" the former vice president says in the ad. It remains to be seen whether the resoluteness of the Cheney legacy falls on deaf ears -- already, a majority of pro-impeachment Republicans have either lost their primaries or chosen to retire. In Wyoming, Trump won by a landslide in 2020, earning 70% of the vote. The Aug. 16 primary is sure to be an uphill battle for Cheney, but it may not signal the end of her political career. ""Liz is fearless. She never backs down from a fight. There is nothing more important she will ever do than lead the effort to make sure Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office. And she will succeed,"" the elder Cheney says in the ad. According to Cheney's campaign, the ad will run ""statewide and across all online and streaming platforms on Friday."" NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 11. That's the percentage of Americans who said they were following updates regarding monkeypox very closely, per a May survey from YouGov/The Economist. Thirty-three percent said they were paying some attention, but the majority of Americans (56%) said they weren't following it closely. On Thursday, U.S. health officials declared monkeypox a public health emergency, freeing up additional resources for vaccines and other treatments to help control the virus' outbreak, so it's possible Americans will start paying more attention.

2022-08-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-prisoner-swap-griner-whelan-russia-ambassador/story?id=88039193,"US may do '2-for-2' prisoner swap to get Griner, Whelan out of Russia: Ex-ambassador","Basketball star Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan should hopefully be released from Russia as part of a ""two-for-two"" prisoner swap, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson said Sunday. ""My view is optimistic, I think she's gonna be free. There's gonna be a prisoner swap -- I think it's gonna be two-for-two. Can't forget about Paul Whelan,"" Richardson, who is an outside adviser involved in Griner's case, said in an exclusive interview with ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. Griner has been detained since February and was sentenced last week to nine years in prison after she was found guilty of drug charges in a Moscow-area court; she has said she accidentally traveled with vape cartridges containing hashish oil. Whelan, who worked in corporate security after the Marines, was convicted of espionage -- which he and the U.S. deny. Late last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken revealed the administration had made a ""substantial proposal"" to release Griner and Whelan, which sources told ABC News included freeing notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence in the U.S. Richardson said Sunday that he didn't fully agree with the Biden administration's messaging strategy. ""I wouldn't have gone public as much as they did,"" he said. But, he said, sometimes comments about prisoner negotiations are made strategically when talks stall: ""You want to throw a little bit of a bomb, and I think that's what they did."" Richardson described himself as a ""catalyst"" working on Griner's case, along with other detainees. ""I've been talking to the Russians. I talked to the White House,"" he said, though he would not detail specifics of his communications. The founder of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement -- which ""promotes global peace and dialogue,"" according to the center's website -- Richardson recently helped free U.S. journalist Danny Fenster in Myanmar, he said. He was also involved in helping free ex-Marine Trevor Reed, who was released by Russia in April in another prisoner exchange. Stephanopoulos questioned Richardson about why, in its comments on Griner and Whelan, the White House has publicly omitted Marc Fogel, an American educator held in Russia since August 2021. ""He's facing a prison sentence right now. His infraction was similar to Brittney Griner's. Shouldn't he be included in this?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""All of these that are wrongfully detained need to come home. And our objective should be, despite prisoner exchanges that are not popular, to bring American hostages home,"" Richardson said. ""Some of these prisoner exchanges are not good. They don't -- the optics are not good. But we have to do it sometimes."" Stephanopoulos followed up to ask if such trades ""will encourage America's adversaries to actually detain more Americans""? ""There's no data that supports that,"" Richardson said. He cited the case of Fenster: ""All they wanted was a photo-op. So data doesn't support that prisoner exchanges are always the case. Yes, they're increasing, especially with countries like Iran, Venezuela, Russia. But as unpleasant as they are, we have to bring American hostages home."" Blinken said in late July he had spoken with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, to try and push forward on negotiations. Richardson on Sunday complimented Lavrov's role in the issue. ""Lavrov, he and I were U.N. ambassadors together at the same time,"" Richardson said. ""And I'm pleased that he's pragmatic, that he's sort of in charge and sent a good signal. I think the negotiations are going to be undertaken.""",20
2022-08-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/coons-confident-dems-tax-health-climate-bill-pass/story?id=88038939,"Coons confident Dems' tax, health and climate bill will pass but admits delayed impact on inflation","Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, one of President Joe Biden's closest allies, said Sunday he was confident the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) would pass -- but conceded that any impact the legislation has on inflation would not be immediate. ""I have no doubts at all,"" Coons told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos when asked if he thought the party-line tax, climate and health care package would be approved amid a marathon series of amendment votes that was still ongoing as of late Sunday morning. ""The Democrats in our Senate caucus have stayed unified throughout the night,"" Coons said. ""Every single amendment vote of the dozens we've taken so far -- we've defeated Republican efforts to knock down this important, even landmark, piece of legislation that will reduce prescription drug prices, reduce health care costs, reduce the deficit and make a big down payment on combating climate change."" Stephanopoulos pressed Coons on the Democratic argument about deflation, which is key to how the package is branded. The Congressional Budget Office has said it would have a “negligible impact” on inflation in the short term. ""Is it really fair to call it the Inflation Reduction Act?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""This is going to reduce the costs that hit American families in their pocketbook ... It’s going to make for a more secure and stable and cleaner and more affordable future for American families,"" Coons argued. Still, on the timeline for inflation to be reduced, he admitted that ""it may take a year or more"" and said, ""We may not see huge impacts on inflation in the first or second year."" ""Yes, inflation is higher than it should be. But we just got a robust jobs number of more than 500,000 jobs created this past month,"" Coons said. ""Unemployment, the lowest it's been in my lifetime. And I think we've got a strong recovery underway."" Stephanopoulos noted criticism even among some Democratic allies over the IRA, which was the product of a deal between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and moderate Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took to the Senate floor twice last week to criticize the bill, saying in one speech that the legislation ""does virtually nothing to address the enormous crises facing the working families of our country."" ""I understand that Sen. Sanders has a different view than virtually everyone else in our caucus, but I am confident in the end he will vote for it,"" Coons said on ""This Week."" Stephanopoulos asked if Coons had concerns that the IRA would be used in Republican campaigns, given their criticism of Biden's handling of the economy, which has been a key part of voters' disapproval of the president. ""Republicans attack it as a big spending bill, and it appears their midterm strategy is to focus on inflation,"" Stephanopoulos said. Coons defended the Democrats' record, highlighting ""a whole string of significant accomplishments in recent weeks"": not just the IRA but billions in funding for domestic manufacturing of computer chips and new health care support for veterans, both of which were bipartisan measures, and the successful drone strike on an al-Qaeda leader. In light of that, though, Stephanopoulos followed up to ask Coons about the small but increasingly loud chorus of Democratic voices who say Biden should not run for reelection in 2024, when he would be in his 80s. Coons, who holds Biden's old Senate seat, said he was ""encouraging [Biden] to focus on what’s right in front of us."" ""I think he’s got a strong record of accomplishment to run on. All the different initiatives I just talked about here at home, but also real leadership on the world stage,"" said Coons, pointing to efforts in Europe, during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific. ""So, frankly, I'm hopeful that President Biden will run again,"" he added. ""If he does, I’ll certainly support him.""",26
2022-08-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-wait-biden-bounce-string-good-news-note/story?id=88065531,Democrats wait on Biden bounce after string of good news: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein In an era where major events are happening virtually all the time, sometimes the headline comes out of what doesn't change. The latest ABC News/Ipsos poll shows President Joe Biden stuck in a rut carved by perceptions of the economy. His approval ratings across a range of issues -- handling of inflation and taxes and even climate change and gun violence -- are all underwater and virtually unchanged since June or, in the case of inflation (29% approval), since the beginning of the year. That's despite easing gas prices, encouraging jobs numbers and -- as of Sunday -- congressional action on a major health care, tax and environmental package cobbled together under the promise of addressing inflation. The latest numbers come at a strange moment for Biden. Some Democrats are openly questioning whether he should or will run for reelection in 2024, even as the consensus on the president's accomplishments is likely to change with the surprise passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Maureen Dowd's latest New York Times op-ed arguing that Biden would be stronger as a lame duck -- ""he and his team could do what they thought was right rather than what was politically expedient"" -- adds to an awkward intra-party conversation. On ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, close Biden ally Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., brushed aside Dowd's column and predicted that ""a whole string of wins"" would start to change the midterm outlook. But even he wouldn't directly say whether he was urging Biden to run again, confirming only that he wants Biden to focus on more immediate challenges facing American families. Democrats have all but resigned themselves to a midterm cycle where Biden is deeply unpopular. But in an election year where every point matters, just how stuck he is could mean seats in the House and Senate. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper With less than 100 days until general election votes are tallied, former President Donald Trump's continued hints at a 2024 bid stand to energize Democratic voters in key elections. Trump remains a powerful force within right-wing circles, as evidenced by the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll that showed Trump as the clearly favored candidate for 2024. When Trump spoke to the crowd at CPAC, he indicated that he ""may have to do it again"" and told reporters the ""time is coming"" for a formal campaign announcement. ""I think people are going to be very happy,"" Trump told Fox News Digital at CPAC. It comes as the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll shows a shrinking enthusiasm gap between Democrat and Republican voters. When asked how enthusiastic they were about voting in November, the poll found that 75% of Republicans are either very or somewhat enthusiastic about voting, compared to 68% of Democrats. In ABC News/Ipsos polls conducted in April and June this year, Republicans were likelier to report that they were very enthusiastic about voting than Democrats. That gap has narrowed to five points in this August poll. An announcement could fuel voters who oppose Trump to cast midterm ballots in swing states where control of Congress is at stake. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Nearly a week after voters cast ballots in a slate of high-profile August primary races, the contours of Republican intraparty divisions ahead of November are coming into view. In Washington state, Rep. Dan Newhouse -- one of 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of the impeachment of former President Donald Trump -- advanced to the general election over the weekend alongside Democrat Doug White. The development is likely to put Newhouse on track to retain his seat in Congress, as two of his fellow pro-impeachment colleagues have already lost to Trump-backed challengers this primary season. But Newhouse could be one of just two Republicans to come out on top -- four other GOP lawmakers who backed impeachment chose to resign rather than face voters this year, and the fates of Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Liz Cheney are still unknown. Meanwhile, Arizona saw a Trump-endorsement sweep in statewide races. Former TV news anchor Kari Lake beat her Republican opponent, Karrin Taylor Robson, despite Robson having the backing of term-limited Gov. Doug Ducey and former Vice President Mike Pence. Far-right Arizona House legislator Mark Finchem also topped Ducey's pick in the race for secretary of state. The outcome puts Finchem -- who denies the outcome of the 2020 election and attended the Jan. 6 rally preceding the Capitol riot -- on track to potentially become the state's top-ranking election official. ""We may have won this battle -- and I won an epic battle in Arizona. We drove a stake through the heart of the McCain machine,"" Lake said to applause during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 4. That's the number of GOP primaries and elections we're watching on Tuesday in Minnesota and Wisconsin. And as FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich writes, Minnesota's special election in the 1st Congressional District could be especially important as its margins will help us better understand whether Democrats -- or Republicans -- have an advantage headed into the 2022 midterms.

2022-08-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-colin-allred-details-climate-tax-health-care/story?id=88099978,"Rep. Colin Allred details how climate, tax, health care bill will lower everyday costs","As the United States faces decades-high inflation, people across the country are looking to lawmakers for respite. Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas joined ABC News on GMA3 to discuss the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping climate, tax and health care package that the Senate passed over the weekend. The bill is now set for a vote in the House this week. ALLRED: Well, it's going to help you lower the cost of your health care. For the first time in so long, that we've been pushing for this, Medicare is going to have the ability to negotiate to lower the cost of prescription drugs. And it will be the drugs that we don't have the market mechanisms to hold down the costs… So those are the ones that are really hitting families the hardest. It's also going to make sure that, if you're using the individual market, that your rates stay low. That's something we started in the American Rescue Plan. It's extended those benefits. But also for your homes, it's going to encourage you -- to give you tax credits toward getting more efficient energy use in your home, but also more efficient energy grids. So it should lower your costs overall in terms of what you'll be paying to keep the lights on and the AC on, which we're needing a lot of here in Texas right now. ALLRED: Well, it lowers costs. And that's also a way of combating inflation, because when you have to spend more in some areas, if you can lower costs in other areas, that's basically the same thing in terms of balancing out your budget and trying to help working families get by. I was raised by a single mother who was a public school teacher here in Dallas. I know what it's like to go to the store and wonder, are you going to be able to get all the things you need for the week? And so this is what we're trying to do, is find areas that we can control, where we can lower your costs. So much of what we're dealing with in terms of inflation is a global issue that's happening around the world caused by the pandemic and also the war that Russia [caused by] invading Ukraine. So there's some things that we can't control. The areas where we can, that's what we should target. And that's all we're trying to do here. ALLRED: Well, now that it's gotten through the Senate, we have to get it through the House. And there's always going to be some back and forth with my colleagues. That's just the way that the House works. But I do think that we'll pass it this week and send it to the president's desk. This is a huge win for President Biden but, more importantly, for the American people. This is the biggest investment that we've ever made in combating climate change. [The bill is] going to allow us to do so many things that we need to do to try and really head off what we know is a coming climate disaster for us down the road. ALLRED: Yeah, well, listen, I've known of Brittney since she was in high school when I was playing football at Baylor University. And she was a standout basketball player in Houston. And we were going to try and recruit her to come to Baylor to be part of our incredible women's basketball team, which she eventually did. And she's one of the best basketball players in the world. She's a Texan, and she's somebody who we're working extremely hard to get home. Everybody should just know that the trial, so to speak, that you just saw was a sham. In Russia, if you reach that point, you have about a 98% chance that you're going to be convicted. So it's not really a trial. And also that she was held, and is still being held, basically to exert pressure on the United States. And so we are doing everything we can to get her and Paul Whelan home. But I actually do think that it's a positive that we're through the trial and sentencing phase, because we've known from the beginning that the Russians weren't going to seriously discuss a swap with us until that happens. So as sad as it's been to see her receive a nine-year sentence and all of those things and to see the stress that she's been under, it also means that we are closer to getting her home.",7
2022-08-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/connecticut-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=88109286,Connecticut 2022 primary election results,"On Tuesday Connecticut voters cast primary ballots for the Senate, House, governor, state executive offices, a proposal on early voting and more. Polls closed at 8 p.m. ET. Absentee ballots were mailed out beginning 21 days before the primary elections and must have been received by Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET as well. State Significance In the Connecticut Senate race, former President Donald Trump has been backing Leora Levy, a former state GOP official who was unsuccessfully nominated by Trump to an ambassadorship. Levy is an abortion rights opponent and has raised questions about election security. However, she was not always a Trump advocate -- in 2016, she was critical of him and backed Jeb Bush's presidential bid. ""Trump has turned the Republican primary process into a circus for his own purposes and his own aggrandizement,"" she argued then in The Greenwich Time. ""He is vulgar, ill-mannered and disparages those whom he cannot intimidate."" Trump has long been critical of Democratic incumbent Sen. Richard Blumenthal over Blumenthal's past claims of service during the Vietnam War. Blumenthal apologized at a news conference in 2010 for having ""misspoken about [his] service."" As reported by ABC News, Trump and Blumenthal also clashed during the confirmation process for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. And they were at odds again when Blumenthal co-sponsored legislation that made it harder if Trump had tried to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Connecticut is a longtime Democratic stronghold, voting for Biden in 2020 by some 20 points.",14
2022-08-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-pass-health-climate-tax-bill-party-lines/story?id=88314105,"Democrats pass major health, climate and tax bill along party lines; Biden signing next week","Every House Democrat on Friday voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) over uniform Republican opposition, sending the multibillion-dollar climate, health and tax bill to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law. The package, which similarly passed the Senate on Sunday along party lines, was approved around 6 p.m. by a vote of 220-207. Democrats in the chamber were seen celebrating what they are sure to champion as a legislative achievement -- which aims to make prescription drugs and health insurance cheaper while raising taxes on the wealthy, cutting the deficit, investing in clean energy and curbing climate change -- ahead of a contentious midterm cycle, when they will be up against the president's low approval ratings and other headwinds. Biden soon tweeted his reaction to the House passage: ""Today, the American people won. Special interests lost.” “With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in the House, families will see lower prescription drug prices, lower health care costs, and lower energy costs,"" he wrote, and said he planned to sign the bill next week. Total party unity in both chambers is a major feat for Democratic leadership, which has struggled for months to unite the caucus around one cohesive strategy. The party has been attempting since Biden took office in January 2021 to pass a social spending bill, which eventually became the IRA, a much slimmed-down version of the multitrillion-dollar plan Biden first backed. The more than $700 billion package includes the nation’s most extensive investments ever in new climate initiatives; allows Medicare to negotiate some drug prices; and extends Affordable Care Act subsidies while reducing the federal deficit with a 15% corporate minimum tax and with an excise tax on corporate stock buybacks. Despite the legislation's name, Republicans have pointed out, it will have only a negligible effect on inflation in the short term, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found. But the CBO said it would reduce federal budget deficits by $102 billion over 10 years. At a press conference ahead of the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was questioned on whether the bill could actually tame high -- but slightly cooling -- inflation in the next months. “Well, you have to get started,” Pelosi said, noting that inflation is caused by many factors, like the COVID-19 supply chain crunch and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The House GOP leader, Kevin McCarthy, on Friday called the bill “misguided"" and “tone deaf."" He spoke on the House floor for about 50 minutes ahead of the vote, mostly blasting the widespread use of proxy-voting for the bill’s passage and the IRA’s boosted IRS tax enforcement measures, which supporters say will actually target the wealthy who shuck their tax bills. “Democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people’s money,” McCarthy said. Over half of the House voted by-proxy, which prolonged the bill’s passage by designating a certain member to cast in-person votes on behalf of absent lawmakers. The IRA passed the Senate on Sunday without a single Republican supporter. Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie breaking vote after a 16-hour ""vote-a-rama"" that saw a slew of proposed amendments by both parties -- and saw Senate Democrats forced to make last-minute adjustments to the bill's tax provisions. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the IRA ""one of the most comprehensive significant pieces of legislation that has passed the Senate and the Congress in decades."" “While much of D.C. was focused on the Senate vote earlier this week, the White House was just as focused on the House at the same time,” a White House official told ABC News, noting that the administration had been in contact with House leadership throughout the week. Staff was also talking with individual members about the legislation, answering any questions and sending materials every day, the official said. ​​ From his summer vacation on Kiawah Island, South Carolina, Biden twice video-conferenced with his staff who worked on the IRA, according to the White House. “The president called House members throughout the week; we had members at the CHIP signing and PACT Act signing which was another opportunity for POTUS to touch base with members on IRA,"" the official said. ""White House staff also worked hard to refute Republican attacks on the bill and go on offense because of what Republicans were opposing.” ABC News’ Justin Gomez, Molly Nagle and Trish Turner contributed to this report.",26
2022-08-15,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/year-republicans-biden-white-house-argue-afghanistan-withdrawal/story?id=88401631,"1 year later, Republicans, Biden White House argue over Afghanistan withdrawal","On the one-year anniversary Monday of the Taliban's takeover of Kabul, House Republicans and the Biden administration quarreled over who is to blame for the series of events that led to the Taliban victory and the handling of the chaotic withdrawal of 120,000 Afghans. A 121-page report by Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee that investigated the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan blames the Biden administration for failing to plan accordingly for what would happen once all U.S. troops left the country. The report, in which committee Democrats did not participate, was made available to ABC News and other news outlets ahead of its public release. Ahead of that release, the White House issued a memo denouncing the Republican investigation as a ""partisan report"" that ""is riddled with inaccurate characterizations, cherry-picked information, and false claims."" ""It advocates for endless war and for sending even more American troops to Afghanistan,"" Adrienne Watson, the National Security Council's top spokeswoman, said in the memo. ""And it ignores the impacts of the flawed deal that former President Trump struck with the Taliban."" Citing a lack of cooperation from the Biden administration, the report relied on open source reporting, independent interviews with former officials, and interviews with U.S. military commanders included in U.S. Central Command's investigation of the Abbey Gate suicide bomb attack at Kabul's airport that killed 13 American service members and more than 170 Afghan civilians. ""The choices made in the corridors of power in D.C. led to tragic yet avoidable outcomes: 13 dead service members, American lives still at great risk, increased threats to our homeland security, tarnished standing abroad for years to come, and emboldened enemies across the globe,"" said the Republican report. In its response, the NSC said Biden's decision reflected the tough choice he had to make to either ""ramp up the war and put even more American troops at risk, or finally end the United States' longest war after two decades of American presidents sending U.S. troops to fight and die in Afghanistan."" The Republican report claims President Biden was ""likely aware"" that his stated reasons for withdrawing from Afghanistan were ""inaccurate"" when he announced the withdrawal in April 2021 and that he ignored recommendations by U.S. military commanders that it would be prudent to keep a small U.S. military presence of at least 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. ""The decision to withdraw U.S. military forces was made by President Biden, despite advice from his military commanders that such a move could lead to Taliban battlefield gains,"" said the report. Watson also pushed back on that claim, citing congressional testimony last fall by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley that leaving a force of 2,500 would have likely led to a troop increase if the Taliban targeted U.S. forces. The Republican report criticizes the Biden administration for not having prepared for the quick Taliban takeover of Kabul saying President Biden ""was warned repeatedly that the return of the Taliban was a question of when, not if."" Meanwhile, the White House response shifted blame to the Doha agreement negotiated by the Trump administration said ""empowered the Taliban and weakened our partners in the Afghan government."" In the two weeks after the fall of Kabul, 120,000 Afghan civilians were evacuated as part of a hastily-planned U.S. military airlift, but those that left were the lucky ones who were able to clear Taliban checkpoints and U.S. military entrances to Kabul's airport. The chaotic images of thousands of Afghan civilians attempting to be allowed into the airport became the signature image of that withdrawal. The Republican report blamed the State Department for not planning accordingly earlier in the year and noted that at the peak of the withdrawal there were only 36 U.S. consular officers at the airport to process the claims of the tens of thousands ultimately evacuated. Only a small number of those who were evacuated had received for applied for the Special Immigrant Visas (SIV's) offered to Afghans who served as interpreters or contractors working for the United States. More than 77,000 Afghans who applied for those visas remain inside Afghanistan and the report criticizes the Biden administration for not developing a plan for how to get them out of Afghanistan. The report also disclosed the previously undisclosed figure that more than 800 Americans have been evacuated from Afghanistan since last year, a much larger number than the 100 to 200 Americans that the administration had claimed were still in the country at the end of the chaotic withdrawal. Republicans also disclosed that a ""significant"" number of highly trained Afghan commandos crossed into Iran seeking refuge after the Taliban takeover and expresses concerns that they ""could be recruited or coerced into working for one of America's adversaries that maintains a presence in Afghanistan, including Russia, China, or Iran."" The report described last week's CIA drone strike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri as proof that Afghanistan has once again become a safe haven for terrorists. But the White House responded that the Zawahiri strike showed that the U.S. did not need a troop presence to go after the top terrorist leader and cited a U.S. intelligence assessments that al Qaeda has not reconstituted itself in Afghanistan. According to that assessment, there are only 12 al Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan and only Zawahiri has attempted to restart operations in Afghanistan.",23
2022-08-16,https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-ambassador-optimistic-griner-whelan-prisoner-exchange/story?id=88398298,"Former U.S. ambassador is 'optimistic' on Griner, Whelan prisoner exchange","The saga of WNBA star Brittney Griner continued Monday after her attorneys filed an appeal over her conviction and nine-year Russian prison sentence for drug possession. The move comes as U.S. officials continue to seek a prisoner transfer for her and fellow captive American Paul Whelan. ABC News Live spoke with Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., who has been a frequent emissary in hostage negotiations through the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, about the latest developments. ABC NEWS LIVE: Let's start with the news of Griner's team filing an appeal. I'm curious, does that have any impact, you think, on diplomatic talks for a prisoner exchange to bring Griner and fellow detained American Paul Whelan home? RICHARDSON: Well, indirectly, it basically says the legal process is over except for the appeal, and it's reasonable to have this appeal [for a] nine-year sentence in a penal conflict. Now, there can be negotiations between the United States and Russia. Both seem disposed. There's been a prisoner exchange about two months ago, Trevor Reed, that I was indirectly involved in. I think the legal team of Brittney Griner has been effective [in] showing contrition, acknowledgment of the mistake and now the appeal. And I think…this potential return date from the American side is very important to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. So I think both sides are moving in the right direction and I'm optimistic. ABC NEWS LIVE: All right. You've just described yourself as a catalyst in these talks that are taking place at a government-to-government level between the U.S. and Russia. We know you traveled to Russia ahead of the release, as you mentioned, of American Trevor Reed earlier this spring. Have you or can you say or will you be traveling to Russia ahead of any release, potential release of Griner and Whelan? RICHARDSON: Well, no, I can't get into that information. But what I can tell you is that I talked to both sides. I talked to the White House. I talked to the Russians. I have contacts in the Russian government. When I was U.N. ambassador, for instance, the foreign minister [Sergey] Lavrov was my counterpart. I have others that I dealt with as secretary of energy. So I'm not a replacement for the negotiations, [or] some kind of an interlocutor indirectly. So I don't want to get into too many of these facets, but I've had experience. And I think…both sides are moving in the right direction because they've done it before, despite the fact that the relationship between the United States and Russia is toxic. Totally toxic. ABC NEWS LIVE: Yeah, we understand that, and of course, appreciate it and would not want to jeopardize any future release. But I am curious about this. Russian officials have criticized the U.S. for openly discussing the offers on the table, but they did confirm this weekend that detained Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout is the name at the center of negotiations. You spoke to our George Stephanopoulos about this a little bit -- a week or so ago. [Is there] any concern here that these talks could break down for any reason, including the U.S. being too public with that information? In other words, would you [have] preferred that America didn't throw his name out there? RICHARDSON: Well, I question that because I think private diplomacy is a lot better, but obviously the negotiations weren't going too well. So what the U.S. did was when things aren't going well, you kind of throw a little bit of a bomb. And so far, I think it's moved in the right direction. Now, eventually, I think it's not going to be a two-for-one deal. I think it's going to be a two-for-two. The Russians obviously probably will want more, but you never know. Again, humanitarian issues like prisoner exchanges, like this agreement on grain and fertilizer that the U.N. broke…are steps in the right direction on the humanitarian front that eventually might help in a very toxic relationship between us and the Russians. ABC NEWS LIVE: So you just used the word optimistic. I'm going to see if I can push a little bit further. Are you confident that a deal can get done here? And if so, any idea about a timeline without giving anything away? Or are we talking weeks, months, [a] year? RICHARDSON: Well, you don't want to get into a timeline. I know the families are suffering. I think it was a great effort to combine them. An American Marine, a basketball star. We want both, but I think the Russians will want parity. So I'm optimistic because it was done before. And I think Brittney Griner's attorneys have handled this well. And lastly, I think both sides want it. Obviously, the president wants to get his prisoners back and Putin wants to get his prisoner back, especially Bout, who was politically very important. So there's [a] political reality here. So I'm optimistic. ABC NEWS LIVE: You mentioned the families. Let's touch on that a little bit. I think when people talk about situations like this, they want to know what each government is doing. But I think sometimes lost in the translation are the families that have been dealing with this for however long they have been in each individual case. You've written books on it. Obviously, there's an empathy there that you have. How do you tell the families to have patience in any kind of meaningful way during these negotiations? RICHARDSON: Well, first, Mickey Bergman, who specializes in dealing with the families, handles that for our foundation. We worked for the families, my foundation. We don't work for the government. We don't take orders from the government, either. The families work closely with us. We help them. We advise them. We don't try to lift their spirits when there's little, but then we move in directly into negotiation. So that's different from other groups that do very excellent in hostage diplomacy. But we get right in there and try to make things happen. We're not replacing the government. Eventually, the U.S. government has to make the decision. The president, who I think [is] handling this well for a prisoner exchange. And as you know, prisoner exchanges have been criticized in the media and in the public. ABC NEWS LIVE: You mentioned this a little earlier on that, of course, this is happening with the backdrop of this Russia-Ukraine war. How does that complicate negotiations? You've done this time and time again, but now there's a war involved in this one, [and] Russia is not happy with America for supplying aid and weapons to Ukraine. So how does that complicate this? RICHARDSON: Well, it complicates things a lot because the relationship between our leaders or secretary of states or presidents is almost nonexistent. But there are channels like our private channels, like our embassy in Moscow. So there are ways that we talk, but it complicates things. But usually, governments before, they better the relationship. In this case [it's] a very toxic relationship. Sometimes humanitarian efforts like a prisoner exchange, like the release of human rights prisoners, like the spring deal, the fertilizer deal between Russia [and] Ukraine brokered by the U.N., are steps that might lessen the tension and improve a very bad relationship.",7
2022-08-17,https://abcnews.go.com/US/weeks-mar-lago-search-trump-dod-official-vowed/story?id=88461618,"Weeks before Mar-a-Lago search, ex-Trump DOD official vowed to publish classified documents from National Archives","In June of this year, seven weeks before the FBI raided former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in search of classified materials, former Defense Department appointee and outspoken Trump loyalist Kash Patel vowed to retrieve classified documents from the National Archives and publish them on his website. Trump had just issued a letter instructing the National Archives to grant Patel and conservative journalist John Solomon access to nonpublic administration records, according to reporting at the time. Patel, who under Trump had been the chief of staff for the acting defense secretary, claimed in a string of interviews that Trump had declassified a trove of ""Russiagate documents"" in the final days of his administration. But Patel claimed Trump's White House counsel had blocked the release of those documents, and instead had them delivered to the National Archives. ""I've never told anyone this because it just happened,"" Patel said in an interview on a pro-Trump podcast on June 22. ""I'm going to identify every single document that they blocked from being declassified at the National Archives, and we're going to start putting that information out next week."" Patel did not provide a clear explanation of how he would legally or practically obtain the documents. ""White House counsel and company disobeyed a presidential order and implemented federal governmental bureaucracy on the way out to basically send the stash to the National Archives, and now that's where it's at,"" Patel said in a subsequent interview on June 23 on a different pro-Trump internet show. Trump and his allies have for years pushed aggressively to declassify materials related to the FBI's ""Crossfire Hurricane"" investigation that examined alleged ties between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia -- a probe that was later put under the control of Robert Mueller following his appointment as special counsel. Patel, who previously served under then-Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) during Nunes' time as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has claimed that nonpublic information provided to Congress undercut the Russia probe and helped support Trump's claim that the investigation lacked merit. The day before he left office, Trump authorized the declassification of a set of documents related to the Russia probe. The memorandum, released in January 2021, acknowledged that ""portions of the documents in the binder have remained classified and have not been released to the Congress or the public."" So according to Patel, Trump asked him to work on retrieving the classified documents from the National Archives and then release them to the public. ""President Trump was like, 'Who knows those documents better than anyone?' And I was like, 'If you want me to go, I'll go,'"" Patel said. ""I know what's there"" in the Archives, said Patel. ""I can't still talk about them, but the whole process is going to be: Identify the documents, whether it's Russiagate, Hunter Biden, impeachment, Jan 6th -- and put them out."" Erica Knight, a spokesperson for Patel, told ABC News that Patel was acting as ""a representative on behalf of President Trump to work with the National Archives to get them to disclose information."" ""The GSA has their own policies and procedures for how presidential records must be handled, which Patel is in full cooperation with,"" Knight said of the federal government's General Services Administration. Patel's comments claiming that Trump had directed him to retrieve classified documents came in the middle of the former president's growing dispute with National Archives officials. By June, the National Archives had asked the Justice Department to investigate the former president's handling of White House records, after National Archives officials had in January retrieved 15 boxes of records that had been improperly taken to Trump's home in violation of the Presidential Records Act. And while Patel has said the former president said to declassify ""a mountain of documents,"" experts say there are protocols in place to ensure that national security is not harmed when information is declassified -- even by the president. ""[Patel] is lashing out at the bureaucracy, but it's that bureaucracy and those protocols that are in place to prevent damage to our national security by an inappropriate disclosure of national security information,"" said John Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security official who is now an ABC News contributor. ""I can't stress how important those protocols are,"" Cohen said. ""For everyone who has a clearance, it is ingrained in your brain that even an inadvertent disclosure of top secret information could cause great harm to national security."" According to Patel, the plan in June was to retrieve the documents from the National Archives and publish them on his website ""for free,"" then ""make a big announcement every time"" a new document was published. Patel, a former GOP congressional aide who worked on Trump's National Security Council before joining the Pentagon, was also involved in security preparations for the Jan. 6 counting of the electoral vote on Capitol Hill, according to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, citing records obtained from the Defense Department. Last September, the Jan. 6 committee issued subpoenas to four former senior Trump administration officials, including Patel, who appeared before the committee for several hours in December. This past April, Patel was brought on as a member of the board of directors for the former president's media company, Trump Media & Technology Group, which launched the ""Truth Social"" platform in February. Patel also published a pro-Trump children's book titled ""The Plot Against the King."" As of last month, Patel was still pursuing his plan to publish documents currently in the National Archives. ""Now we're in this fight,"" Petal told conservative commentator Benny Johnson in a July 4 interview. ""I'm working on it. And of course, the bureaucracy is getting in the way, but that's not going to stop us."" ""I will be going to the National Archives in the coming weeks, I will be identifying those documents,"" he said.",11
2022-08-17,https://abcnews.go.com/International/worker-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-warns-potential-catastrophe/story?id=88482895,Worker at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant warns of potential catastrophe,"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine -- As Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over attacks on Europe's largest nuclear power plant, a worker there told ABC News he fears not only for the safety of his family but also the world. ""If something happens to the spent fuel storage, the consequences could be the same as Chernobyl,"" the worker, who spoke to ABC News on condition of anonymity, warned during an interview in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia on Tuesday. The Ukrainian man, who is an engineer at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant near the town of Enerhodar, said he plans to return to work soon out of a sense of duty to his country, despite his wife urging him to quit. He described how the Russian soldiers at the plant ""are always armed and wear balaclavas."" ""If they don't like the look of you, they can yell at you,"" he said. ""I've heard that some people were beaten."" Shortly after invading neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russian troops stormed the Zaporizhzhia plant, on the banks of the Dnipro River in the country's southeast. The Ukrainian workers have been left in place to keep the plant operating, as it supplies electricity across the war-torn nation. ""If everyone leaves the station, who will work there? We need to help Ukraine,"" the engineer told ABC News. However, heavy fighting around the site has fueled fears of a catastrophe, like what happened at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine over 36 years ago. On April 26, 1986, a reactor at the Chernobyl plant, about 65 miles north of Kyiv, exploded and spewed enormous amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere, forcing more than 100,000 people within a 1,000-square-mile radius to evacuate. It remains the world's worst nuclear accident. Russian forces seized the now-defunct Chernobyl plant and the vast, surrounding radioactive area soon after launching the invasion but ceded control of the facility to Ukrainian troops when they withdrew from the area at the end of March. Meanwhile, skirmishes between Russian and Ukrainian forces near the Zaporizhzhia plant caused a fire to break out at a training complex there in early March. On Aug. 5, shelling at the site resulted in several explosions near the electrical switchboard, causing a power shutdown, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations. Last week, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned that the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant has deteriorated rapidly to the point of becoming ""very alarming"" and the agency's technical experts must be allowed to visit the area to address mounting safety concerns. On Wednesday, in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian troops must ""immediately"" withdraw from the Zaporizhzhia plant and nearby areas ""without any conditions."" ""Any radiation incident at the Zaporizhzhia NPP can affect the countries of the European Union, Turkey, Georgia and countries from more distant regions. Everything depends solely on the direction and speed of the wind,"" Zelenskyy warned. ""If Russia's actions cause a catastrophe, the consequences may also hit those who remain silent so far."" The Ukrainian president also accused Russia of using ""the cover of the plant"" to launch strikes on nearby Ukrainian-controlled territories and storing troops, weapons and equipment in its facilities. Russia has denied the allegations and accused Ukrainian forces of repeatedly firing on the site. If shelling hits the spent fuel storage at the Zaporizhzhia plant, the engineer told ABC News ""it might be like another Chernobyl,"" as radioactive material will leak and contaminate the environment. ""Every day, the Russians come closer and closer to the unit, shellings are closer and closer,"" he said. ""There is no order or stability."" ABC News' Morgan Winsor contributed to this report.",10
2022-08-17,https://abcnews.go.com/International/forest-fires-destroyed-23-million-acres-land-2021/story?id=88400813,"Forest fires destroyed nearly 23 million acres of land in 2021, and it's expected to get worse, experts say","The planet continues to experience a massive loss in forest land as the world warms and allows severe wildfires to run rampant in regions spanning the globe. Overall, forest fires are getting worse worldwide, according to a new report released Wednesday by Global Forest Watch, a forest monitoring platform led by the World Resources Institute. The data captures stand-replacing fires, which kill all or most of the living overstory trees in a forest, and includes wildfires, escaped fires from human activities such as agriculture and hunting and intentionally set fires that result in tree cover loss. Tree cover loss due to fires is now twice as high as it was in 2001, with forest fires destroying about 7.4 million more acres of land -- an area roughly the size of Belgium -- last year compared to the turn of the century, according to the researchers, who analyzed two decades of fire data from the Global Land Analysis and Discovery Lab at the University of Maryland. Forest fires also accounted for more than 25% of all tree cover loss in that past 20 years, with 2021 ranking as the second-worst fire season on record due to unprecedented damage to boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere, according to the report. About 70% of all fire-related tree cover loss over the past 20 years has occurred in those boreal forests, likely due to warming temperatures in northern, high-latitude regions, the researchers said. Nearly 23 million acres of land -- an area the size of Thailand or roughly 16 soccer pitches per minute -- were scorched globally last year, according to the report. The rate of tree cover loss due to fire is increasing by about 568,000 acres -- roughly 4% -- every year. In tropical forests, which are moist and wet environments, stand-replacing fires were historically rare events. However, fire loss in the tropics is increasing about 5% per year, which is an annual increase of about 89,000 acres, the experts said. Almost all fires that occur in the tropics are started by people, such as escaped fires from agriculture and land cleaning. The top five countries that experienced tree cover loss over the past 20 years were Russia, at 131 million acres; Canada, at 66.7 million acres; the U.S., at 29.7 million acres; Brazil, at 23.5 million acres; and Australia, at 15.6 million acres. Extreme weather caused a significant spike in bush fire activity in Australia from 2019 to 2020. Climate change is likely the major driver of increasing fire activity, the researchers said. A ""climate feedback loop"" has occurred in which rising temperatures create drier conditions, causing more forest area to burn, which then release even more carbon into the atmosphere. The obliteration of forests could further hinder efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate global warming. Forests are critical to Earth's ecology for their ability to capture and store carbon out of the atmosphere, alter the air quality and quantity of drinking water and provide habitat for the world's land species. But longer fire seasons and an increase in fire frequency could turn some forests into a net source of carbon emissions, releasing more carbon than they are absorbing, which poses a long-term threat to countries' ability to uphold commitments under the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. The cause of increasing forest fires are complex and vary significantly by geography, the researchers said, adding that there is no ""silver bullet"" to reversing the trend of increasing tree cover loss due to fires. In addition, there is no solution to bring fire activity back down from historic levels without drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and breaking the fire-climate feedback loop, according to the analysis. Human activity in and around forests is also making them more susceptible to wildfires, especially in the tropics. ABC News' Tracy Wholf contributed to this report.",25
2022-08-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-childrens-book-author-imagines-war-eyes/story?id=88509898,Ukrainian children's book author imagines the war through their eyes,"Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and children's book author Kateryna Yehorushkina decided that she would write a book to help the country's children cope with the trauma of the war that will hit its six-month mark on Wednesday. ""I feel that it's very important to talk about this war,"" she told ABC News reporter Britt Clennett. ""I feel like I'm doing my part."" The goal of this book is to tell a story about the Russian war in Ukraine for children in a way that is ""not traumatic for them,"" she said. Yehorushkina is the author of 15 other children's books including a book called ""The Chest,"" about the 1932-22 famine in Ukraine imposed by the Soviet dictator ​​Joseph Stalin. She is also trained in philology and psychology. ""I felt I could join and mix this knowledge to help kids to overcome this trauma,"" she said. ""To know [about the war], to have memories, but not to be traumatized a lot."" The war has dramatically impacted more than 5 million Ukrainian children, with UNICEF estimating that more than 3 million children living inside the country and more than 2 million living as refugees need humanitarian assistance. The story is told through the perspective of 10-year-old Vera, who lives in an unidentified part of Ukraine near Kyiv that has just been invaded by the Russian army. Vera is keeping a diary to describe how her family is responding to the invasion. Yehorushkina placed events in her book that will be recognizable for children who have gone through the experience of invasion and occupation, such as putting tape over windows, which is said to protect a window from shattering during a blast, putting pillows in the bathroom, to hold over their heads in the case of bombardment, and eventually taking refuge in a basement. Vera and her family live in the basement of their home for two weeks and Vera's father works as a volunteer, delivering supplies such as groceries and pet food across the city. Yehorushkina has also placed objects like a doll of the Disney character Elsa from the film ""Frozen"" in her illustrations, she said, so that children can see themselves in the narrative. The illustrations purposefully have no dark colors and have been kept very light and bright, she said. The process of writing the book is ""not easy,"" she said, adding that she has to be in a ""very calm psychological state"" while writing. Yehorushkina lives in Vyshhorod, Ukraine, and is currently separated from her two young children, who helped provide some of the inspiration for writing this book. Her daughter and her friends would recreate their homes and cities using the video game Minecraft, she said, which inspired a scene in this book. Yehorushkina is also a licensed art therapist, working with Ukrainian children in different settings. One of the activities she does with children is to draw angels, which they imagine are defending their cities and loved ones. ""Their mental health is a very high priority for me,"" she said. As a mother of two children, she has seen first-hand the devastating psychological impacts of living through a war. ""I said to [my daughter], 'all your emotions are normal,'"" she recounted. ""It's very important to say what we feel.""",22

The back-and-forth stems from Rodman, a five-time NBA champion, initially announcing last weekend that he planned to travel to Russia according to comments he made to NBC News while dining at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. ""I got permission to go to Russia to help that girl,"" Rodman told NBC News on Saturday. ""I'm trying to go this week."" Griner, who has been detained in Russia since Feb. 17, was found guilty on drug charges earlier this month and was sentenced to nine years in prison after vape cartridges containing hashish oil -- an illegal substance in Russia -- were discovered in her luggage at the airport. A State Department spokesperson, Ned Price, told ABC News during a press briefing on Monday that if Rodman did travel to Russia, ""He would not be traveling on behalf of the U.S. government."" ""We believe that anything other than negotiating further through the established channel is likely to complicate and hinder those release efforts,"" Price added. Amid the scrutiny over his comments, Rodman told ABC News on Monday that he doesn’t currently have plans to travel to Russia. Rodman previously sought to make an impact on U.S. foreign policy as an informal diplomat of sorts amid heated U.S. relations with North Korea. Rodman traveled to Singapore in June 2018 ahead of then-President Donald Trump's historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who is a big Chicago Bulls fan. Although Rodman did not meet with the dictator, whom he said he considers a ""friend,"" he was one of a few westerners who had met with him in Pyongyang in the past. Rodman doesn't need permission from the U.S. to travel to Russia but requires a visa from Moscow to travel to the country. However, the State Department is strongly discouraging American citizens from traveling to Russia amid the war in Ukraine, issuing a ""Level 4-Do Not Travel"" advisory that was most recently updated on Aug. 15. ""We've also provided very clear guidance to American citizens -- owing to a number of threats, not the least of which is the threat of wrongful detention -- that Americans should not travel to Russia,"" Price said on Monday. ""That has been our message to private Americans across the board."" Price's warning came after a senior Biden administration official discouraged Rodman from traveling to Russia in a statement provided to ABC News on Sunday, referencing the U.S. travel advisory. At her trial, which began in July, Griner said she was guilty of drug charges and said that she didn't intend to break Russian law, but that the cartridges were left in her bag by accident. The U.S. classified Griner's case as ""wrongfully detained"" in Russia on May and the Biden administration has been working to negotiate the WNBA star's release, as well as the release of U.S. citizen Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since 2019. On July 29, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that he had a ""frank and direct conversation"" with ​​Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about a U.S. proposal to exchange convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout in return for Griner and Whelan. Earlier this month, Russian officials confirmed that those talks have taken place. Asked about the status of the negotiations, Price said that U.S. interests are ""best served if these discussions take place in private,"" but stressed that this ""something we continue to work with the utmost urgency."" ""I said last week that we had engaged in discussions with Russian counterparts on this. Those discussions are ongoing,"" Price added. ""We've made very clear, as we have publicly, that we proposed a substantial proposal, we called it, for the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.""

2022-08-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-legal-battles-establish-lanes-2024-note/story?id=88658827,Trump legal battles help establish lanes for 2024: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The two weeks since the FBI's Mar-a-Lago search haven't clarified much when it comes to the potential legal jeopardy former President Donald Trump finds himself in. But that event, combined with growing pressure on other fronts from Georgia and New York to Washington, has helped establish lanes in a 2024 field that Trump most definitely will not own by himself. Trump-loyal lawmakers including Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley have backed the former president with fresh attacks on the FBI. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis -- who finds out on Tuesday who he faces in his re-election bid -- has chosen a similar path, wrapping talk of what he calls a ""weaponized"" Department of Justice into his broader campaign messaging. Trump's Vice President Mike Pence is hedging on the Mar-a-Lago raid, however, telling ABC News in Iowa on Friday that while he's ""deeply troubled"" by the federal operation at Trump's home, ""The calls to defund the FBI are just as wrong as calls to defund the police."" Then there's Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, fresh off her primary loss but making clear her work against those who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election will carry through 2022 and, of course, 2024. In an interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl on ""This Week,"" she labeled Cruz and Hawley as ""unfit for future office"" and called out DeSantis for ""right now campaigning for election-deniers."" Cheney declined to say whether a potential presidential run would take her through the Republican primaries or a campaign as an independent, though she said she realizes why the Republican National Committee would work to keep her off a debate stage that includes Trump. Both options are on the table for Cheney. It's become clear that, whenever he might announce and however various legal cases unfold, Trump won't have an unobstructed path to the 2024 GOP nomination -- and that intraparty efforts to stop him will not end if he becomes the nominee. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Though midterm elections are fast approaching, potential 2024 candidates are already making appearances in battleground states across the country. Even though his name is on the ballot in his home state of Florida, Gov. DeSantis has been hitting the campaign trail elsewhere. He has stumped for Trump-backed election deniers -- like Senate candidate J.D. Vance in Ohio and gubernatorial hopeful Doug Mastriano on Pennsylvania -- in an effort to raise his national profile, and underline his conservative credentials, ahead of a possible presidential run. ""We can't just stand idly by while woke ideology ravages every institution in our society,"" DeSantis said at his Pennsylvania event on Friday, sticking to a message about cultural issues which he's made a focus of his gubernatorial term and reelection effort. Former Vice President Pence campaigned last week at the Iowa State Fair with GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley -- though his appearance was shadowed, yet again, by his former running mate. While Trump faces mounting legal problems, Pence blasted those critics -- many of them Republicans -- of the FBI in the wake of the Mar-a-Lago raid. He also said he didn't take classified information from office, the very thing the Department of Justice is investigating in relation to its search of Trump's home. Pence did all of this while avoiding giving definitive answers on whether he'll make a run for the White House. ""After the first of the year, my family and I'll do as we've always done, and that is reflect and pray on where we might next serve, where we might next contribute,"" he said. The challenge, should either he or DeSantis launch a GOP primary bid, is garnering significant support in a party that is still very much aligned with Trump, who has repeatedly hinted at a run of his own. ""If it were between Pence and Trump, I would vote for Trump,"" Iowa fairgoer Deb Taylor said in a recent interview with ABC News. That sentiment is a demonstration of how arduous a path Pence or DeSantis could have to a GOP presidential nomination with Trump still in the picture. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema New York's primary season comes to a close this week with dual Democratic pileups in some of the most reliably blue areas in the country. One of the most heated contests is happening in New York's 12th Congressional District, where veteran Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler are pitted against one another following this year's redistricting changes. Both lawmakers won their seats in 1992 and currently chair powerful House committees. While both tout their decades of experience, a third primary challenger, Suraj Patel -- a young attorney who worked on former President Barack Obama's campaigns -- has carefully tied the age gap between him and the incumbent lawmakers to political stagnancy, saying in his campaign ads that ""it's time for the Obama generation."" With few ideological differences separating Maloney and Nadler, their campaigns have shifted to highlighting identity politics. Nadler has said that if he were to lose his seat, New York City -- which has one of the highest Jewish populations in the world -- would lose its only Jewish representative in the House. Meanwhile, Maloney points out that if she were to lose, Manhattan would not have a woman in its congressional delegation in an environment where women's rights have been pushed to the forefront of politics. The lead-up to Tuesday's contest also featured backhanded declarations of support from an unwelcome interloper: Trump. He said he had ""endorsed"" Maloney and attorney Dan Goldman, who is running in New York's 10th District Democratic primary, even though both candidates were actively involved in Trump's first impeachment -- Maloney as the chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee and Goldman as the lead counsel for Democrats in the trial. Although both Maloney and Goldman waved off Trump's statements as trolling, some of their primary opponents jumped on the former president's comments to highlight their own attacks. ""I'm proud that Donald Trump has nothing positive to say about me because he knows how much more effective a new generation of diverse, energetic Democrats will be in stopping his agenda,"" Patel tweeted. In the 10th, incumbent Rep. Mondaire Jones took a swipe at Goldman, saying, ""Trump says he's backing Goldman because he wants progressives to lose and because Goldman failed to hold him accountable the first time. New York should not send this man to Congress."" NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 13. That's the number of primaries we'll be watching closely on Tuesday night in New York. (We'll also be back Tuesday with our preview of the key primaries to watch in Florida and Oklahoma.) New York's statewide races were already decided in June. But because the state's first congressional map was ruled an illegal Democratic gerrymander by the New York Court of Appeals, the congressional primaries are now on Tuesday under a far less advantageous map for sitting Democrats. In fact, at least one incumbent -- and possibly as many as five -- will lose their primaries now. Read more from FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich on what to expect in New York.

2022-08-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/putin-revives-soviet-era-title-mothers-heroine/story?id=88691265,Putin revives Soviet-era title of 'Mothers Heroine',"Russian President Vladimir Putin recently reinstated a Soviet-era award, giving women who have ten or more children a single payment of a million rubles (worth $16,747 USD, as of publishing). The honorary title and certification of ""Mother Heroine"" are given to the mother once their tenth living child turns 1 year old. According to Putin's decree, mothers will still be eligible for the award if their child dies as a result of war or from an act of terrorism, or in an emergency situation. The Mother Heroine award was initially established by Josef Stalin in 1944 to encourage repopulation in wake of the country's high casualty count from World War II. At the time, the award was described as a ""badge of special distinction"" but was stopped in 1991 alongside the fall of the Soviet Union. With an average household size of 3.2 people, Russia's population has been declining at a rapid rate over the past 30 years, as reported by Statistica. Recent estimates state that between January and May of 2022, the population of the Russian Federation fell by over 430,000 people, 20% being those who have left the country, according to the Russian statistics agency Rosstat. Though Russian authorities do not provide an official toll for the number of citizens who have been killed in the war in Ukraine, 5,256 deaths are estimated, according to independent news outlet, istories. According to the data department of the Russian Database on Fertility and Mortality, the death rate of young people in Russia has increased by 18% due to war.

2022-08-23,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-teen-recalls-horror-shot-russian-soldiers-playing/story?id=88740506,"Ukrainian teen recalls horror of being shot by Russian soldiers, playing dead","In some ways, 14-year-old Dasha Pivtoratska is like other children her age. She wants to become a choreographer, she shares videos via TikTok and she lights up when she talks about her pets. But having encountered the Russian invasion of her hometown in Ukraine, a village near Kiev named Katyuzhanka, Dasha has suffered loss and experienced trauma that sets her apart from other children her age. The war in Ukraine has affected children in profound and incalculable ways. Three million children inside the country and more than 2 million children living as refugees are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to UNICEF. The agency has also reported that nearly 1,000 children have been killed or injured during the course of the war, which will reach its six-month mark on Wednesday. Dasha was traveling in the car with her father, driving home, when Russian soldiers opened fire on their vehicle. “The first shots hit the gas tank, then the windshield,” Dasha told ABC News reporter Britt Clennett. “My dad started to pull back, we went back to the road, and [from] there they started shooting from everywhere.” Dasha described watching the tanks approach, like a “column,” and how her dad tried to escape the Russian forces by driving in reverse down the street. The car caught on fire, and Dasha described being told to leave the car. She ran to another car and that’s when she was shot, she said. She was hit by bullets in her arm and her thigh, and tried to crawl away, apparently making noise that alerted Russian soldiers to her presence. “About ten minutes later they walked over to me,” she said. “They kicked me in the leg and apparently [thought] that I was already dead. And then they left.” “I understood almost nothing. It was a shock,” she said. “There was no feeling of pain. Everything was numb.” She was eventually rescued by her grandfather, and at some point realized that her father had been killed. “I loved him very, very much,” she said, adding that she had recently been growing closer to him. “I spent a lot of time with him,” she said. “We talked on different topics. He was the only one with whom I could talk. Only he could support me that much.” Dasha would eventually have surgery on her bullet wounds, and is currently undergoing rehabilitation for her hip. Sometimes the leg hurts, she said, and it impacts her movement. Regardless, she continues to dream of working as a choreographer, studying choreography in school after ninth grade and then teaching it. The pain from the bullet wounds is minor compared to the anguish of losing a family member. “It’s hard of course,” she said during the interview. “But you can’t do anything.”",22
2022-08-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/12-democrats-vie-yorks-10th-progressives-pit-anti/story?id=88696192,"12 Democrats vie for New York's 10th, with progressives pit against anti-Trump prosecutor","A rare open House seat in a newly redrawn New York district attracted a dozen candidates for the Democratic primary on Tuesday, but simmering tension and similar agendas have since allied leading progressive hopefuls against the moderate front-runner -- a strategy that some experts predict could backfire on their own electoral chances because of possible vote-splitting. Following the post-census redistricting process -- and the state courts rejecting initial Democratic maps as unacceptable gerrymandering -- the new 10th Congressional District is a cross-section of neighborhoods across two boroughs, spanning south Manhattan over the East River into Brooklyn's Borough Park, Dumbo and Park Slope and including sizable Asian and Latino communities, Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods and stretches of tony brownstones. The redrawing drama set off a chain reaction of incumbents shifting seats, hoping not to lose office: The 10th's incumbent, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, opted to run in the 12th against longtime ally Rep. Carolyn Maloney. His departure invited many other candidates, including freshman Rep. Mondaire Jones, who bounced from his current district (the 17th) because fellow incumbent Sean Patrick Maloney -- head of the House Democrats' campaign arm -- moved from his seat, the 18th, drawing the ire of some rank-and-file members of Congress. It's against that complicated backdrop that Tuesday's Democratic primary in the 10th will play out. Among the contenders, the biggest emerging differences are less policy-driven than identity-driven, campaign strategists say. The leading candidates are Dan Goldman, a former prosecutor; Rep. Jones; New York City Council Member Carlina Rivera; and state Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou. (Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also tossed his hat in the ring as the 13th candidate but later withdrew.) The field is generally all in agreement on prominent policy issues such as environmental reform, the codification of abortion rights and assault-style weapon bans -- which is why, operatives say, the contest has focused on differences elsewhere. Front-runner Goldman, who won an influential endorsement from The New York Times' editorial board, is the wealthiest and most moderate and has the least amount of experience in elected office. He most prominently served as counsel to House Democrats during then-President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial, in 2019 -- and has cited that work to describe himself as ""the only candidate in the race who has been in the trenches standing up to Trump,"" he told ABC News. Goldman is no stranger to the district's well-heeled enclaves, which serve as home to celebrities, millionaire mega-donors and influential political pollsters. A Levi Strauss heir, he invested some $4 million of his own money into broadcast ads and cable spots, outspending every other candidate in the race. The more progressive hopefuls have targeted that wealth, arguing that Goldman's millionaire status estranges him from an economically and racially diverse electorate. Local strategist Hank Sheinkopf told ABC News that the progressive alliance was the ""only strategy,"" given Goldman's stature in the race so far. ""By joining forces, [progressives] can hope different voter demographics will respond individually,"" Sheinkopf said. ""Gay people will side with Jones, and the Latino vote that might have gone to Goldman can go to Rivera. It's the only strategy they have to try to break apart the coalition Goldman assembled based on his anti-Trump record."" Council Member Rivera told The New York Daily News that Goldman was a ""one-note Daddy Warbucks."" Rep. Jones and Assemblywoman Niou also joined forces in a joint news conference on Aug. 15, telling supporters -- whose signs read ""Anyone But Goldman"" -- that ""Dan Goldman cannot buy the city of New York."" They contended he is a ""conservative"" who opposes an expansion of the Supreme Court and holds an unclear position on Medicare for All, two policies supported by the party's left flank. Goldman has shrugged off his opponents' comments, explaining that they ""have different approaches for our shared goals."" ""I don't oppose 'Medicare for All,' but I think we are much more likely to help people by reforming the current system,"" he told ABC News. ""As for the Supreme Court, I support term limits, a judicial code of ethics and an investigative body that can look into whether Supreme Court justices lied under oath before the Senate. Adding more justices is just anti-democratic."" Goldman's opponents in the primary have also seized on an unlikely ""endorsement"" he received -- from Trump himself, via a statement on Trump's social media platform. Jones tweeted that ""New York should not send this man to Congress,"" and Niou said Trump's post was a ""reminder of what the stakes are"" in the election. Goldman quickly rejected the former president's backhanded comment: ""Trump fears me because of my work to successfully impeach him after his Ukraine call, and fears the possibility that I enter Congress."" When asked about the progressive backlash, Goldman told ABC News: ""Any candidate who takes his remarks toward me at face value is not fit to represent Congress."" A temporary collective front against Goldman, political experts say, has challenges of its own. Jones, Rivera and Niou have divided endorsements among themselves, just as they may divide up voters. Rivera is backed by New York Rep. Nydia Velázquez and 11199SEIU, a prominent health care union; while Jones has the support of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Niou earned the approval of the Working Families Party, the environmental group Sunrise Movement and the Jewish Vote, a local organization. ""There's nothing wrong with the team-up if this were a ranked-choice election. The issue is that it's not,"" said Chris Coffey, CEO of Tusk Strategies. ""If some progressives drop out and endorse a non-Goldman front-runner, one might defeat Goldman. But it's possible that the progressives together get 50% of the vote, but Goldman ultimately wins with, say, only 28% of the vote because voters are already stretched thin."" (Coffey, though not affiliated with any candidate, has donated to Rivera's campaigns and that of another candidate, state Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon.) The progressive candidates in the 10th have, of course, campaigned beyond criticizing Goldman. Jones, Niou and Rivera have all tapped into their experience as elected officials. Niou told ABC News that her identity as a woman of color with autism motivates her to center her candidacy on disability and reproductive rights. ""It goes beyond Roe [v. Wade] for disabled folks in New York,"" she said, referring to the reversal of the Supreme Court's decision guaranteeing abortion access. ""I support universal health care. We can help low-income mothers of color get formula for disabled babies who can't latch, or gender-affirming help to folks who want to transition but struggle with medication. Every issue is a disability issue."" Tuesday, though, may test whether Democratic voters in the area have only one thing at the top of their minds. ""Trump dominated the discussion yet again. If Goldman wins, it will be because of one reason,"" said Sheinkopf, the strategist. ""And that's because he is the best-known man among Brooklyn elites who hates Donald Trump.""",14
2022-08-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-releases-memo-ag-barrs-decision-prosecute-trump/story?id=88808145,DOJ releases memo behind Barr's decision not to prosecute Trump for obstruction,"Under order from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Department of Justice on Wednesday released a 2019 memo used by former Attorney General William Barr to justify his decision not to prosecute then-President Donald Trump for obstruction of justice related to Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The department initially released a redacted version of the memo in May 2021, stemming from a Freedom of Information Act suit brought by the watchdog group the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). That version fully redacted more than six out of the memo's 10 pages. On Friday, however, a panel of judges in the D.C. Circuit ordered the release of the full memo, affirming a district court decision that had found Barr and other DOJ officials were not candid in their statements about the role the memo played in their decision to not charge Trump. DOJ officials previously told the court that the memo should be kept from the public because it involved internal department deliberations and the advice given to Barr about whether Trump should face prosecution. But a district judge ruled that Barr was never engaged in such a process and had already made up his mind to not charge Trump. The full memo released Wednesday outlines the rationale given to Barr from Steven Engel, the former head of DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, and Ed O'Callaghan, the then-principal associate deputy attorney general. Both attorneys wrote that former special counsel Mueller's report on his investigation of Trump and Russia ""identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constituted obstructive acts, done with a nexus to a pending proceeding, with the corrupt intent necessary to warrant prosecution under obstruction-of-justice statutes."" Engel and O'Callaghan wrote that their determination was reached separate from considering whether Trump was already immune from prosecution because of his status as a sitting president. While Mueller's report meticulously documented potential obstructive acts taken by Trump before and after his appointment as special counsel, Mueller has said he declined to make a determination on whether Trump committed a crime based on DOJ policies and ""principles of fairness."" Both in a public statement and hours of testimony before Congress in 2019, Mueller also directly refuted claims by Trump that his report ""exonerated"" Trump. ""That is not what the report said,"" Mueller said in his testimony. In their memo, Engel and O'Callaghan detailed multiple justifications for declining a prosecution of Trump for actions stemming from the Mueller report, which laid out 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice investigated by the special counsel's team. They wrote that the instances in Mueller's report were not similar to ""any reported case"" DOJ had previously charged under obstruction-of-justice statutes and described Mueller's obstruction theory as ""novel"" and ""unusual"" because of the conclusion he reached in the first volume of his report -- that evidence developed ""was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with representative of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election."" ""It would be rare for federal prosecutors to bring an obstruction prosecution that did not itself arise out of a proceeding related to a separate crime,"" the memo states. Engel and O'Callaghan wrote that ""much of"" Trump's conduct in the report instead ""amounted to attempts to modify the process under which the Special Counsel investigation progressed, rather than efforts to impair or intentionally alter evidence ... that would negatively impact the special counsel's ability to obtain and develop evidence."" Their memo goes into some detail to refute certain lines of inquiry that Mueller's team pursued when investigating Trump's potentially obstructive actions. Engel and O'Callaghan wrote that they didn't believe Trump's actions surrounding his firing FBI Director James Comey amounted to obstruction because his behavior could ""readibly be explained by his desire to have the FBI Director or others in the Administration inform the public that he was not under investigation."" They wrote that they believed Trump's alleged efforts to have charges dropped against his former national security adviser Mike Flynn didn't amount to criminal obstruction. In their view, Trump's alleged statement to Comey that he would let it go ""did not clearly direct a particular action in the Flynn investigation, and Comey did not react at the time as though he had received a direct order from the President."" The memo analyzed Trump's actions after learning of Mueller's appointment and when he learned that his investigators had opened a separate line of inquiry into potential obstruction of justice. ""Most of the conduct identified consists of facially lawful actions that are part of the President's constitutional responsibility to supervise the Executive Branch,"" Engel and O'Callaghan wrote. ""And there is considerable evidence that the President took these official actions not for an illegal purpose, but rather because he believed the investigation was politically motivated and undermined his Administration's efforts to govern."" They also noted that despite Trump's actions in directing his White House counsel to fire Mueller at one juncture or asking a top aide to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- Barr's predecessor -- to narrow Mueller's investigation, ""none of his requests to change the supervision of the investigation were actually carried out."" ""In each instance, if the President truly wanted to cause those actions, he could have done it himself,"" Engel and O'Callaghan wrote. ""Of course, it is true that an act may constitute an attempt or endeavor, even if unsuccessful. But the facts that the President could have given these directions himself, and did not remove any subordinate for failing to convey his directions, weigh against finding an intent to obstruct justice."" Engel and O'Callaghan did write however, that other acts taken by Trump, such as his comments related to witnesses for Mueller's investigation -- condemning those who cooperated while praising those who stayed quiet -- ""more directly implicate the concerns of the obstruction statute."" Still, they wrote, none of the instances ""indicate that the President sought to conceal evidence of criminal conduct nor is there sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he sought to provide false evidence to investigators.""",11
2022-08-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-airstrikes-target-iran-backed-militias-eastern-syria/story?id=88780957,US airstrikes target Iran-backed militias in eastern Syria,"The U.S. military said it carried out airstrikes on Tuesday targeting areas of eastern Syria controlled by Iran-backed militias. The ""precision strikes"" in the oil-rich Deir ez-Zor province, near Syria's border with Iraq, ""targeted infrastructure facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,"" according to Col. Joe Buccino, spokesman for the U.S. Central Command. ""Today's strikes were necessary to protect and defend U.S. personnel,"" Buccino said in a statement. ""The United States took proportionate, deliberate action intended to limit the risk of escalation and minimize the risk of casualties."" Buccino did not offer any casualty numbers from the strikes. Neither Syria nor Iran immediately acknowledged the attack. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitoring group, said the U.S. strikes targeted the Ayash Camp run by the Fatemiyoun Brigade, a militia made up of Afghan Shiite refugees sent by Iran to fight in the ongoing Syrian Civil War alongside Syrian government troops. At least six Syrian and foreign militants were reportedly killed in the strikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. According to Buccino, the strikes came at the orders of U.S. President Joe Biden in response to an attack on Aug. 15, when Iran-backed militias allegedly launched drones targeting the al-Tanf Garrison used by U.S. forces in the energy-rich Homs province in central Syria. At that time, U.S. Central Command described the attack as causing “zero casualties and no damage."" ""The United States does not seek conflict, but will continue to take necessary measures to protect and defend our people,"" Buccino added. ""U.S. forces remain in Syria to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS."" The strikes came as Biden seeks to revive a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that his predecessor abandoned. Since 2014, the U.S. has led a coalition of countries conducting strikes targeting the Islamic State group in Syria. U.S. ground forces entered Syria in 2015. In more recent years, the American-led coalition has also launched strikes targeting the Syrian government's forces and allies, mainly in defense of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias that was formed as part of the campaign against ISIS. What started as a local protest movement in Syria's southern city of Dara'a expanded into a full-fledged civil war by 2012. ISIS, which grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq, took root in northern and eastern Syria in 2013 after seizing swaths of territory in neighboring Iraq. The jihadist group is fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime and establish a caliphate. The Syrian Civil War has pulled in the United States, Russia, Iran and almost all of Syria's neighbors. It has become the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II, according to the United Nations.",23
2022-08-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/months-fighting-war-ukraine/story?id=88700360,"After 6 months of fighting, what's next in the war in Ukraine?","When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the conventional wisdom among many U.S. national security officials and analysts was that Ukraine's military would be able to resist only for a few days, possibly a week. But six months later, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has stalled as Russia's military capabilities have fallen far short of what they seemed on paper, and Ukraine's military, buttressed by a constant supply of weapons from the U.S. and the rest of the international community, has demonstrated it will fight hard in every part of the country. ABC News asked national security analysts and a senior British military officer to discuss how the battle in Ukraine has evolved over the last six months and what could come next. In February, when Russian troops invaded Ukraine simultaneously along multiple fronts, it appeared to be an effort to overwhelm Ukraine's military in quick order. But six weeks later the combined effects of Russia's poor military decisions and planning led to the tactical withdrawal of its forces stalled north of the capital Kyiv and a shift towards the Donbass region in the east. Since then, months of intensive artillery barrages and rising casualties have resulted in only small territorial gains for Russian troops and as Ukraine has prepared for a counteroffensive in southern Ukraine, the fight has already begun to shift to that region. And it has been a costly one for both Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. believes Russia has suffered between 70,000 and 80,000 killed and wounded among its military forces and in June Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged between 60 to 100 military fatalities a day among his forces. ""I am guessing that some kind of a stalemate will develop in the course of the next few weeks or certainly by the cold weather,"" Michael O'Hanlon with the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. ""And then the question will be do the two sides decide it's time for diplomacy and maybe have some creative notions of shared sovereignty or putting off certain territorial issues for a longer term referendum?"" O'Hanlon speculates there could be a lull in the fighting in Ukraine this winter as both sides rebuild their forces for a fight next year, much as was seen during World War I. Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, an adviser with Human Rights First, told ABC News that Russia has moved into a war of attrition that it may not win. As the top Army officer in Europe, Hodges developed the U.S. military training program for Ukraine's security forces following Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea. ""If you're going to do attrition, you have to have three things: You have to have a lot of people, you have to have a lot of resources, and you have to have a lot of time. And the Russians don't have any of those three,"" said Hodges. ""So, they've chosen, unfortunately for them, the wrong strategy to defeat Ukraine."" Hodges believes Russia's logistical supply network has been stretched to its limits and will be unable to continue to resource Russian troops over the long term and he is not convinced that the Russian people will continue to support the invasion as time goes by. ""There are a lot of things working against Russia in terms of time, and so this is why I believe that Ukraine is going to win, that they're going to they're going to be able to push Russia back at least to the 23 February line by the end of this year,"" Hodges predicted. Air Vice Marshal Mick Smeath, the defense attaché at the United Kingdom's embassy in Washington, is more circumspect about what lies ahead. ""I think Putin is probably shocked"" at the Russian military's performance on the battlefields of Ukraine, said Smeath, who releases a daily intelligence update consisting of unclassified details from the U.K.'s Ministry of Defence Defence Intelligence. ""I'm not in his mind, but I'm sure he is looking at even now his narrow objectives, because his military campaign is failing,"" said Smeath. ""And he is getting to a point where his troops are stagnating and he is making very, very insignificant gains whereas the Ukrainians are defending strong."" Smeath is confident that one thing that will continue for the foreseeable future is the flow of western military aid to Ukraine. ""All I can say is that as in the UK, I can certainly say the same for our American friends and all of our our partner nations, we will keep supporting Ukraine to ensure that Russia does not get any any further gains and Ukrainian protects her people,"" said Smeath. Russia's military was expected to quickly overwhelm Ukraine in short order given their vast inventory of weapons, a recent modernization effort, and a switch towards a more professional force instead of just relying on conscripts. But the last six months of war in Ukraine have exposed Russia's military capabilities and left them in a far weakened state as its battalion tactical groups consistently suffered heavy casualties ""I think I'm certainly in the crowd of people that overestimated Russian capabilities and also somewhat surprised at how poorly they have performed,"" said Hodges who attributes some of Russia's poor performance to corruption within Russia's military ""in the form of false reporting about numbers, shoddy equipment, zero quality control over things over how ammunition is stored, all the stuff, which are ways where you can make money if you're in in the system."" Russia's recent military modernization effort focused on the integration of its warfighting capability in land, sea, and cyberspace. ""In reality, that is not the case, they have not been able to do that,"" according to Smeath. ""They've been pretty incompetent and quite ineffective."" ""The Russians made some big mistakes"" that O'Hanlon said outweighed their numerical advantage in the number of troops and technology. To that point, O'Hanlon highlighted Russian plans to drive heavy military vehicles over fields that were not as frozen as expected that led to bottlenecks on roads that exposed them to attacks by Ukrainian fighters. While Russia's poor performance on the battlefield may have been unexpected, O'Hanlon pointed out that there were indicators given that were indications it could happen given that ""we haven't seen the Russians fight well on a large scale in a very long time."" And that includes fighting against a determined military force and population. ""I never doubted that Ukrainians would fight very well,"" said Hodges. ""We have been working with them since 2015. So I was sure that the soldiers would do well."" But Hodges acknowledges not anticipating ""the resilience of the Ukrainian population. ""I didn't anticipate how strong they would be in how they would deal with this,"" he said. ""I think Russia completely underestimated the fact that they are a sovereign nation and they were not going to be invaded by a nation that they do not want to be part of,"" said AVM Smeath. ""I think Russia completely got that wrong."" ""Russia has been I think pretty desperate and pretty ineffective with their campaign,"" said Smeath. ""They haven't achieved anywhere near what they wanted to achieve. "" And that is also due in large measure to the constant flow of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine being provided by the United States and other countries. Early in the war American Javelin and British NLAW anti-tank missiles had an immediate impact against Russian tanks as did subsequent aid packages of Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles. O'Hanlon acknowledges that the emergence of American-made HIMARS rockets systems used by Ukraine to strike at Russian headquarters and ammunition dumps as much as 50 miles away has had a significant impact on the fight in the Donbass but he is not sold on the idea that they are a complete game changer. ""I think we should watch very carefully what's going to happen in these next few weeks because my guess is that we'll already start to see some limitations of what the new technologies are able to achieve for Ukraine and yes, some kind of stalemate, perhaps on better terms than exists today,"" said O'Hanlon. And Hodges believes that even more sophisticated weapons will be needed if the goal is for Ukraine to defeat Russia. ""I think if if we were serious about Ukraine winning, not just avoiding defeat, but winning then we would be pushing a significant amount of weapons, long range fires, they can accomplish what we're seeing now in bits and pieces,"" said Hodges. ""That's what would become decisive. That's what would help set the conditions for Ukraine to launch a successful counter attack",7
2022-08-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-sends-message-iran-counterattacks-syria/story?id=88834931,US sends message to Iran with counterattacks in Syria,"The United States said Wednesday that although it ""does not seek conflict with Iran,"" it will continue to ""defend"" its troops against Tehran-backed militias in Syria. Three U.S. service members were injured in separate rocket attacks on two facilities housing American troops in northeastern Syria on Wednesday, prompting U.S. forces to respond, according to a statement from the U.S. military's Central Command. Beginning at approximately 7:20 p.m. local time, several rockets landed inside the perimeter of Mission Support Site Conoco. Shortly after, more rockets landed in the vicinity of Mission Support Site Green Village. Both sites are located near large oil and gas fields in northeastern Syria. One service member at Mission Support Site Conoco was treated for a minor injury and returned to duty, while two others were under evaluation for minor injuries, CENTCOM said. Speaking with ABC News, a U.S. official characterized the injuries as ""very minor."" CENTCOM said U.S. forces responded over the last 24 hours with Apache attack helicopters, AC-130 gunships, and 155mm artillery, ""resulting in four enemy fighters killed and seven enemy rocket launchers destroyed."" ""We will respond appropriately and proportionally to attacks on our servicemembers,"" Gen. Michael ""Erik"" Kurilla, commander of CENTCOM, said in a statement on Thursday. ""No group will strike at our troops with impunity. We will take all necessary measures to defend our people."" Colin Kahl, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, was asked about the latest exchange in Syria during a press briefing on Wednesday afternoon in Washington, D.C. Kahl told reporters he did not have any details to share at the time but noted: ""As a general matter, we're not going to hesitate to defend ourselves."" Militias allegedly backed by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, have targeted American troops in Syria this month and several other times over the past year, since establishing a foothold in the region while fighting in support of the Syrian government amid the country's ongoing civil war. Iran routinely denies arming, funding and training militias that target U.S. forces in Syria, despite weapons and equipment linking back to them, officials said. On Aug. 15, Iran-backed militias allegedly launched drones targeting the al-Tanf Garrison used by U.S. forces in the energy-rich Homs province in central Syria. At that time, CENTCOM described the attack as causing “zero casualties and no damage."" In response, on Tuesday, U.S. forces carried out airstrikes targeting infrastructure facilities used by Iran-backed militias in eastern Syria's oil-rich Deir ez-Zor province, near the country's border with Iraq. CENTCOM said the strikes came at the orders of President Joe Biden and were ""proportionate, deliberate action intended to limit the risk of escalation and minimize the risk of casualties."" CENTCOM did not identify the specific targets or offer any casualty figures from Tuesday's strikes. However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitoring group, said the U.S. strikes targeted the Ayash Camp run by the Fatemiyoun Brigade, a militia made up of Afghan Shiite refugees sent by Iran to fight in the Syrian Civil War alongside Syrian government troops. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that at least six Syrian and foreign militants were killed in the strikes. Nasser Kanaani, spokesman for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement condemning the U.S. strikes ""against the people and infrastructure of Syria"" on Tuesday. He denied that Tehran had any connections to the targets. There was no immediate acknowledgment by Syria of Tuesday's strikes. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Kahl said the Aug. 15 attack fueled concerns that ""Iran intends to do more of this and we wanted to disabuse them of any sense that that was a good idea."" Unlike Wednesday's counterattack, the U.S. strikes on Tuesday were ""carefully calibrated"" to avoid killing any civilians or militants, according to Kahl. He said there were originally 11 intended targets but only nine were struck due to evidence that people may be near two of the locations. The counterattacks and strikes came as Biden seeks to revive a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that his predecessor abandoned. Kahl said the negotiations with Tehran to resume its compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal ""has nothing to do with our willingness and resolve to defend ourselves."" ""The threats that they engage in against our people in the region or elsewhere, are not linked to wherever we end up on the nuclear deal,"" he told reporters. ""And I think the strike last night was a pretty clear communication to the Iranians that these things are all on different tracks."" Since 2014, the U.S. has led a coalition of countries conducting strikes targeting the Islamic State group in Syria. U.S. ground forces entered Syria in 2015. In more recent years, the American-led coalition has also launched strikes targeting the Syrian government's forces and allies, mainly in defense of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias that was formed as part of the campaign against ISIS. What started as a local protest movement in Syria's southern city of Dara'a expanded into a full-fledged civil war by 2012. ISIS, which grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq, took root in northern and eastern Syria in 2013 after seizing swaths of territory in neighboring Iraq. The jihadist group is fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime and establish a caliphate. The Syrian Civil War has pulled in the United States, Russia, Iran and almost all of Syria's neighbors. It has become the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II, according to the United Nations. ABC's Ines De La Cuetara reports:",23
2022-08-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-siblings-recall-long-journey-war-zone-refugee/story?id=88839920,Ukrainian siblings recall long journey from war zone to refugee camp,"At a camp in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, for people displaced by the war, two siblings recounted the harrowing journey they'd made from their village, which was being bombed by Russian forces. Maria Zalata, 14, and her brother Dymtro Zalata, 17, traveled for two days from their village of Vesele to reach the Ukrainian-controlled area of Zaporizhzhia. The trip was ""terrifying,"" Dymtro told ABC News reporter Britt Clennett. Their father stayed behind to guard the family's home, pets and garden against the Russian soldiers. The war in Ukraine, which hit its six-month mark on Wednesday, has devastated the lives and aspirations of millions of young people like Maria and Dymtro. UNICEF estimates that 5 million Ukrainian children both inside the country and living as refugees abroad are in need of humanitarian aid. In order to reach Zaporizhzhia, Maria and Dymtro slept in a car and had to be very careful about their movements. They bought groceries at a store that sold Russian products, they said. They went through a checkpoint where their phones were examined, and they had to erase all photos that had Ukrainian symbols. When they finally arrived in Zaporizhzhia and saw the Ukrainian flag, they cheered. ""I am so happy to be here with our soldiers,"" Maria said. ""I am crying now."" She said her mother, and another woman they were with, also broke down in tears. ""It's such a big happiness that we can be in Ukrainian free territory."" ""I feel like I found my home,"" she said. Being in her village was very uncomfortable, she said, because of the constant presence of Russian soldiers. ""We are so upset,"" she said, about the occupation. She wishes her village can be liberated soon, so that her family can return. She told ABC News she wants to see the colors of the Ukrainian flag, yellow and blue, and their symbols, returned to the village. The future is still uncertain. They dream of freedom, and of reuniting with their father. ""We hope all people can stay strong, and that we will defeat Russia,"" she said. They plan to go to Kiev and then move to the western part of Ukraine, where they have family. Maria plans to start school in September, as her school in Vesele has been occupied by the Russians. But first, they will stay at the volunteer-run camp for another couple days. ""We are so, so happy people are helping us. We are so grateful,"" Maria said.",22
2022-08-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-response-suggests-progress-renewing-iran-nuclear-deal/story?id=88810432,US response suggests progress in renewing Iran nuclear deal,"After studying Iran's comments on the European Union's proposal to renew a 2015 nuclear deal, the State Department announced Wednesday it had submitted a formal reply to the plan, bringing a potential breakthrough within reach. ""We received Iran's comments on the EU's proposed final text through the EU. Our review of those comments has now concluded. We have responded to the E.U. today,"" spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. While the E.U.'s top diplomat described the text put forth earlier this month as ""final,"" sources told ABC News the U.S. answer is expected to fall short of total acceptance but move negotiations forward. Iran's response, which was submitted last week, has been described in similar terms. A spokesperson for Iran's Foreign Ministry said the E.U. had shared the U.S. response, and that Tehran would review the comments. After more than 16 months of start-and-stop negotiations through intermediaries, this progress is noteworthy, as both sides appear to be on the precipice of an agreement for the first time since the early months of 2022. Western officials expressed renewed optimism after Tehran dropped demands that a branch of its armed forces, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, be removed from the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations -- a move American officials hardened against in recent months. Price acknowledged that Tehran withdrew the stipulation from its latest proposal on Monday, saying ""that's part of the reason why a deal is closer now than it was two weeks ago. But the outcome of these ongoing discussions still remains uncertain as gaps do remain."" One of those gaps is Iran's desire to ensure any rekindled deal will last beyond the current administration, an impossible promise for the White House to make. Former President Donald Trump withdrew from the original 2015 agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, in 2018, and Iranian hardliners -- who hold total control over Tehran -- fear appearing to be slighted by the West twice. Another sticking point is an ongoing probe by the United Nation's atomic energy watchdog into enriched uranium discovered at an undeclared nuclear research site in Iran. While Tehran wants to see the investigation closed, the U.S. insists it must run its course. ""There are no shortcuts to this,"" Price said on Monday, adding that Iran needs to answer investigators' questions. ""The issues that are outstanding are issues that have been outstanding for some time,"" said Naysan Rafati, the senior analyst on Iran at the Crisis Group, an independent think tank aimed at preventing global conflict. ""They've been the hardest to resolve for a reason."" Even if an accord can be reached between the U.S. and Iran, there are still other hurdles to surmount--both among the international community and in Washington. China and Russia, frequent adversaries of the U.S. on the world stage, have signaled support for a renewed JCPOA, but Israel--one of America's closest allies--is a vocal opponent of the pact and has ramped up its criticism in recent days. Israel's Prime Minister Yair Lapid told reporters on Wednesday that a return to the JCPOA would not accomplish President Biden's goal of ensuring Iran never procures a nuclear weapon but would instead give the country billions of dollars to ""undermine stability in the Middle East and spread terror around the globe"" by relaxing sanctions. ""The political line from Jerusalem is pretty clear. They don't view the agreement as satisfactory,"" said Rafati. ""There's also some thinking within the Israeli national security establishment that it's not necessarily a matter of liking the deal, but at this point, seeing that the alternatives to the deal have been even worse."" Still, similar qualms have been expressed by conservatives in Washington. Dozens of Republican senators have vowed to block any attempt to return to the JCPOA, which would require approval from Congress. As talks have worn on, even some Democrats have expressed apprehension, questioning whether reentering the pact--which includes fixed ""sunset"" provisions, or end dates for key nuclear restrictions--would still be in the best interest of national security. Although the Biden administration entered office promising to cut a ""longer and stronger"" deal with Iran, that ambition has since diminished. Still, U.S. officials maintain a return to the JCPOA remains the best way to restrain Iran's nuclear program and have expressed confidence that a mutual return to compliance would ultimately win the support of lawmakers and foreign powers. Though the outcome remains unclear, the final chapter of the winding negotiations appears to be nearing its conclusion. Analysts say the time Iran would need to amass enough fissile material to produce a nuclear weapon has dwindled to mere days or even less, and that for the JCPOA to be restored, an agreement in principle needs to be reached in the coming weeks--not months. ""Everyone at this point should have a reasonably clear sense of what's possible and what isn't possible,"" Rafati said. ABC News' Somayeh Malekian contributed to this report.",23

The Montgomery County Police Department confirmed Sarah Joan Langenkamp, 42, was struck by a flatbed truck on the afternoon of Aug. 25 while riding a bicycle at the 5200 block of River Road in Bethesda. Langenkamp was a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine. Numerous offices have cited her as the head of the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Section at the embassy. ""We can confirm the death of Foreign Service Officer Sarah J. Langenkamp,"" a State Department spokesperson told ABC News on Saturday. ""The Department of State extends its deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Ms. Langenkamp."" ""We cannot provide further comments due to privacy and law enforcement sensitivity considerations,"" the spokesperson said. The State Department had no additional information to share as of Saturday afternoon. Langenkamp's husband Daniel served at the Kyiv embassy as spokesperson. A CBS News report published earlier this year documented how the Langenkamp's sons were able to reconnect with them after the family was separated due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Police say they were called to the scene of the accident just after 4 p.m. on Thursday. A preliminary investigation by the Collision Reconstruction Unit found the driver of the vehicle, which was a red 2014 Volvo flatbed truck, and Lagenkamp were both traveling in the same direction when the collision occurred. The driver, who remains unidentified, was heading east and was turning right into a parking lot at 5244 River Road when they struck Langenkamp, authorities said. Langenkamp was run over by the truck and was pronounced dead at the scene. River Road was closed as law enforcement, including Montgomery Fire Rescue, responded to the crash. The investigation remains ongoing, according to the Montgomery County Police Department. The department had no additional information to share as of Saturday afternoon. Langenkamp is the second State Department employee to be killed in a biking accident this year. Shawn O'Donnell, a 40-year-old foreign service worker for the agency, was killed after being struck by a Mack cement truck on July 20 in the neighborhood of Foggy Bottom in Washington, D.C. O'Donnell was one of three people killed in bike crashes in the city in July. Community members gathered outside city hall to demand change, calling on Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser to make her plan for zero traffic deaths by 2024 a reality, ABC News affiliate WJLA reported.",27
2022-08-30,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-trumps-pennsylvania-events-frame-midterms-parties-note/story?id=89007507,Biden and Trump's Pennsylvania events frame midterms for both parties: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It's getting increasingly difficult to envision either a Democratic or a Republican Senate majority that doesn't include the open seat in Pennsylvania in November. Races up and down the ballot in the state are likely to render judgment on the political calculations driving leaders in both parties -- and major figures are acting like they know it. President Joe Biden will be just outside his native Scranton on Tuesday, in a visit to Wilkes-Barre designed to highlight police funding and anti-crime efforts, ahead of a Thursday primetime speech in Philadelphia on what the White House is billing as the ""continued battle for the soul of the nation."" The president will be back in the state for the third time in a six-day span when he spends part of Labor Day in Pittsburgh -- marking the unofficial kickoff of fall campaigning in the same city he launched his presidential campaign in three years ago. In between Biden's visits, former President Donald Trump will also be in Wilkes-Barre Saturday night for his first rally since the FBI search warrant was executed at his Florida home. Among the candidates slated to attend: GOP Senate nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz and gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano. Oz has been a central figure in the recent GOP debate over ""candidate quality,"" though Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that he has ""great confidence"" in Oz's ability to win the race. With Oz's campaign against Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman having recently turned nasty over issues related to Fetterman's health, Fetterman is still easing back into campaign-trail mode after suffering a stroke right before his primary victory in May. His campaign says he will see Biden in Pittsburgh -- though specifically indicating that it will be to press Biden on marijuana legalization. While the Senate race might be overshadowing the governor's race, state Sen. Mastriano is a Trump-loyal election denier who helped lead efforts to overturn the 2020 race and protest its results. He also favors a ban on abortion -- a fact that Democratic challenger Josh Shapiro, the state attorney general, is highlighting in his campaign. Candidates are generally fond of saying they are running their own races and are not reliant on surrogates. But in Pennsylvania, at least, they will be getting plenty of company and attention over the next week -- and the nine that follow. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper California Gov. Gavin Newsom has made recent high-profile moves that have arguably fueled speculation he could run for president in 2024. Those same choices, however, could damage his credibility in some circles -- with labor and progressives -- that have supported him. After hundreds of farmworkers marched this week more than 300 miles to the statehouse, Newsom said he couldn’t support legislation that would give them more options to vote in union elections. “We cannot support an untested mail-in election process that lacks critical provisions to protect the integrity of the election, and is predicated on an assumption that government cannot effectively enforce laws,” a spokesperson said in a statement, in part. The legislation, advocates argue, is important to a worker’s right to organize because current votes to unionize must take place in person, leaving employees subject to intimidation. ""He once asked us for our vote,"" a farmworker named Lourdes Cardenas told The Sacramento Bee. ""We are asking him right now. We are parents and families as well as him and we deserve respect, equality and benefits."" Newsom also recently vetoed legislation that would green light so-called safe-injection sites for drug users in the state's largest cities. He'd previously signaled openness to a piloting program for sites that allow supervised drug injection but said in his veto letter that he was ""acutely concerned about the operations of safe injection sites without strong, engaged local leadership and well-documented, vetted, and thoughtful operational and sustainability plans."" Some have interpreted that veto as politically motivated, but Newsom has indicated he'd be open to a more limited program. He has also said that he isn't interested in running for president, but that hasn't stopped him from further building his national profile by using political capital to weigh in on this year's midterm elections. He pledged $100,000 to Florida Democratic nominee Charlie Crist, who is challenging Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. The TIP with Abby Cruz Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Beto O'Rourke said Sunday he was taking a break from the campaign trail after being diagnosed with a bacterial infection over the weekend. ""After feeling ill on Friday, I went to Methodist Hospital in San Antonio where I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection. The extraordinary team there — from custodians to nurses and doctors — gave me excellent care and attention, including IV antibiotics and rest,"" O'Rourke said in a statement sent by his campaign. The former Texas lawmaker had been on a 49-day campaign tour of the state, where he is holding 70 public events in more than 65 counties in the lead up to November's election between him and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. ""While my symptoms have improved, I will be resting at home in El Paso in accordance with the doctors' recommendations,"" O'Rourke said in his Sunday statement. ""I am sorry to have had to postpone events because of this, but promise to be back on the road as soon as I am able. I cannot thank the amazing women and men at Methodist enough for the treatment I received."" The day after announcing his illness, O’Rourke spoke at back-to-back virtual events, giving a lengthy talk at both. He also addressed his current health when asked on the “Black Texans for Beto” call. ""Thank you for asking about my health,"" he said. ""You know, I took a turn for the worse on Friday and got pretty sick with an infection -- bacterial infection -- and luckily, thanks to the great team I work with, got to a hospital in San Antonio, Methodist Hospital, got some great care there for a couple of days. And I'm back here in El Paso recuperating on antibiotics and getting some rest, so thank you for asking. I hope to be back on the trail again very soon.""

2022-08-31,https://abcnews.go.com/International/iaea-experts-heading-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant/story?id=89102221,Why IAEA experts are heading to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,"Inspectors from the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency are heading to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine that has been shelled in the ongoing fight between Russian and Ukrainian forces, threatening a nuclear catastrophe in the region. According to the IAEA, experts plan to ""assess the physical damage to the ZNPP's facilities, determine whether the main and back-up safety and security systems were functional and evaluate the staff's working conditions, in addition to performing urgent safeguards activities on the site."" The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe. ""We must protect the safety and security of #Ukraine's and Europe's biggest nuclear facility,"" Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a Twitter post this week. Grossi, who is leading the mission, has long sought access to the nuclear power plant. Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations of shelling at or near the site in recent weeks, fueling fears that the fighting could cause a nuclear disaster. The nuclear power plant has been occupied by Russian forces while still being operated by Ukrainian engineers since early May, according to the IAEA. The nuclear power plant completely lost power on Thursday due to damage from nearby shelling, according to the IAEA. Two of the six reactors at the plant are currently operating from a single remaining power line. A secure off-site power supply from the electric grid and back-up power supply systems have kept the nuclear power plant running since the shut-off on Aug. 25, the IAEA said. A lack of power poses a risk to the operation of the plant's cooling systems, which are needed for the nuclear reactor and spent fuel ponds in the facility, Scott Roecker, nuclear materials security vice president at Nuclear Threat Initiative, told ABC News last week. ""And if there's not active cooling of both of those facilities, it could lead to a reactor meltdown and a significant release of radiation,"" Roecker said. Amid the threat, officials in the region began distributing iodine tablets, which help block the absorption of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland in a nuclear accident, to nearby residents, the Associated Press reported. On Aug. 28, Ukrainian officials informed the IAEA of renewed shelling in recent days at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, but said all safety systems remained operational and there had been no increase in radiation levels, according to Grossi. Continued shelling raises the risk for a potential nuclear accident, experts say. Shelling over the weekend hit two so-called ""special buildings,"" both located about 300 feet from a reactor. According to the IAEA, those buildings house facilities including water treatment plants, equipment repair shops or waste management facilities. Grossi and his team arrived in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Wednesday and are expected to visit the nuclear power plant on Thursday for the first time. He told reporters during a press briefing that the IAEA mission aims to establish a permanent presence at the plant and that the initial phase would take days. When asked if it was possible to demilitarize the site, Grossi told reporters that was ""a matter of political will"" and that his mission is to preserve Europe's biggest nuclear power plant. He admitted it was ""not a risk-free mission"" and underlined that his team would be operating in Ukrainian sovereign territory but in cooperation with Russian forces. Asked if he thought Russian troops would give his team full access, Grossi told reporters the IAEA was on a ""technical mission"" and that he was confident his team could work ""on both sides."" The IAEA said it seeks to bring clarity to the crisis with the mission, helping to address contradictory information about the status of the facility, its operation and the damage sustained. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's representative to the international organizations in Vienna, said on Wednesday that Russia welcomes the idea that IAEA experts could stay at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on a permanent basis. Shortly after invading neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russian troops stormed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant near the town of Enerhodar, on the banks of the Dnipro River. Ukrainian workers have been left in place to keep the plant operating, as it supplies electricity across the war-torn nation.",10

The Taliban came knocking on his door, he said, and he and his wife decided the only way they would see a future with their three young daughters -- Susan, Hosai, and Uswa – was to escape. ""That was horrible when we were coming to [the] airport,"" Hosai, 10, added as she said she remembered the gunfire and the harrowing journey to safety. ""That was very horrible."" The family made it to the Kabul airport. And with the help of Abdul's American friends, in addition to ABC News, his family was able to make it out. First to Qatar, then to New Jersey, and finally to Northern Virginia, where his family is rebuilding their lives from scratch. But Abdul and his family are the lucky ones -- they're the ones who got out, and have resettled successfully. Some 3.5 million Afghans are still displaced within Afghanistan, according to a United Nations Refugee Agency report from December. And while over 100,000 Afghans were airlifted out by the United States that August, many Afghans who have resettled in the United States are struggling. Many Afghans have found their arrival riddled with red tape – from having difficulty receiving a Social Security number to finding affordable housing to remaining in constant limbo over their immigration status. Many Afghans came to the United States under so-called humanitarian parole, which lasts two years, and they now need to apply for asylum. But a Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University report found that asylum status is denied in 70% of cases. Abdul and his family are the lucky ones. After attending a job fair, Abdul got hired by the Hilton Hotels chain to become a safety and security manager. He says he loves his job. ""I love the environment of my job especially,"" Abdul said. ""And I am sure I will get more opportunities because this is a land of opportunities."" Abdul and his family have slowly been able to make their new home feel like the one they had to escape, decorating their living room floor with a bright red Afghan rug and having piping hot tea always ready to serve any guests. Abdul's three daughters have started the new school year -- entering 8th grade, 5th grade, and 2nd grade. ""When we came here, it was like -- [at] first, I didn't feel like it was home, but after a month I [felt] like in my -- I'm in my home,"" Susan, 13, said. ""So, it feels so good. I'm comfortable here. We are happy to be here in the United States."" ""Yeah,"" Uswa, 6, added. ""And I -- and I feel safe here because there are no Taliban here."" Abdul and Lima recognize that they are the lucky ones, especially since women in Afghanistan have lost many freedoms since the Taliban took over. They know escaping is the right decision. ""This is the place that they will have a great future,"" Abdul said of his three girls. ""And I'm happy. Everybody's happy here right now. These five people are very happy and enjoying life in America.""",22
2022-08-31,https://abcnews.go.com/International/mikhail-gorbachev-soviet-president-dies-91/story?id=89067527,"Mikhail Gorbachev, final leader of Soviet Union, dies at 91","Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has died ""after a serious and long illness,"" the Central Clinical Hospital reported on Tuesday. He was 91 years old. A more specific cause of death was not immediately clear. Gorbachev will be buried at Moscow's Novo-Dyevitchiye cemetery, next to his wife, Raisa, Russia's state-run news agency Tass reported. Gorbachev was the last leader of the Soviet Union before it dissolved. He ruled as general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991 and was the country's only president, a title he took in the waning months of his time in office. Young and energetic, his rise in the '80s signaled a new spring for what was then one of the world's two superpowers. A political insider with a view to the outside, Gorbachev set into motion radical reforms -- that led to a series of unintended events. Gorbachev was born in 1931, in the village of Privolnoye in southern Russia, to a peasant family living in a house with dirt floors. His family was directly affected by Josef Stalin's ""Terror,"" with two of Gorbachev's grandfathers arrested and exiled. During World War II, their village was overrun by Nazi troops. Gorbachev worked the land as a teenager, and was awarded with his father the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, one of the USSR's highest honors, for gathering a record harvest. After university in Moscow, Gorbachev quickly became a young regional party boss. His energy attracted the attention of Yury Andropov, the powerful head of the KGB, who brought him back to Moscow as a protégé. By then, the Soviet superpower was in trouble: the centrally planned economy was rotting and its lag behind Western countries was increasingly obvious. The Soviet Union's gerontic leadership symbolized its decrepit condition. Appointed to the Politburo at 47, Gorbachev was almost two decades younger than his colleagues. In 1985, Konstantin Chernenko died -- the third elderly leader to die in office in as many years -- and Gorbachev became general secretary, brushing aside a succession challenge. ""We cannot keep living like this,"" Gorbachev is said to have told his wife the night before his appointment. He tore through the Iron Curtain between the USSR and the West by opening relations with the U.S., agreeing to a series of crucial summits soon after taking power. ""We have become closer, and we have come to know each other better,"" Gorbachev said in 1989, his -- and U.S. President Ronald Reagan -- New Years' address decorated with hopes of international cooperation and understanding. ""Americans seem to be rediscovering the Soviet Union, and we are rediscovering America."" Gorbachev signed treaties to reduce the size of his country's nuclear arsenal and, in a well-received reversal in military policy, he withdrew troops from a nine-year war in Afghanistan. In a meeting with Regan in 1988, Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty eliminating both countries' stock of intermediate and short-range land-based missiles that could carry nuclear warheads. It was the first treaty that abolished an entire class of weapons systems and established unprecedented protocols for observers from both nations to verify the destruction of its missiles. Underscoring the invention of nuclear weapons as a ""material symbol and expression of absolute military power,"" Gorbachev also underscored that mankind's survival and self-preservation came to the floor. Domestically, Gorbachev had two trademarks: more transparency and freedom -- a policy known as glasnost -- and bold economic reform, or perestroika. It was not, ultimately, a winning combination. Glasnost brought a feeling of liberation and empowerment to the Soviet people and when his economic policies didn't work, they weren't afraid to express their disillusionment. Gorbachev's vision was to legitimize communism by putting a democratic face on it. What he didn't seem to realize was that his people would start demanding the real thing. Discontent spread like wildfire to the countries of the East bloc. And Gorbachev allowed the peaceful revolutions to happen. In 1989, the Berlin Wall came down. Gorbachev was revered in the West for ending the Cold War. He was ridiculed and ultimately reviled by many at home for the collapse of the country and the bleak years that followed, in the '90s. As the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time at the Kremlin in Moscow, Gorbachev had no choice but to resign. ""We live in a new world,"" he said in his farewell address. ""The Cold War has ended, the arms race has stopped, as has the insane militarization which mutilated our economy, public psyche and morals. The threat of a world war has been removed. Once again, I want to stress that on my part everything was done during the transition period to preserve reliable control of the nuclear weapons."" ""[Russia] has been freed politically and spiritually, and this is the most important decision that we yet to fully come to grips with,"" Gorbachev said as he resigned, ""and we haven't because we haven't learned to use freedom yet."" Others benefitted far more from his changes than he did. His political rival, Boris Yeltsin, rose out of the post-Soviet chaos. When Gorbachev ran against Yeltsin, he received less than 1% of the vote, a humiliating end to his political career. But the Nobel Peace Prize winner -- so honored, the Nobel organization said, ""for the leading role he played in the radical changes in East-West relations"" -- remained a man of influence. After his closest ally, wife Raisa, died in 1999, Gorbachev devoted himself to campaigning for environmental causes. And he continually called for a nuclear disarmament, warning in 2019 that renewed tension between Russia and the West was putting the world at ""colossal"" risk. ""As long as weapons of mass destruction exist, primarily nuclear weapons, the danger is colossal, irrespective of any political decisions that may be made,"" he told the BBC. Five years after his resignation, Gorbachev published the book ""Memoirs"" -- which recounted his childhood, political rise and his fall as the Soviet Union's last leader. ""I am the principle witness and the principal person who bears responsibility for what happened,"" Gorbachev said of his decision to write, ""and I believed it was important for me to explain my position about why I started reforms, why I came around to the view that reforms were necessary ... and how difficult the process was."" For his 85th birthday, in 2016, Gorbachev released a 700-page collection of memoirs, interviews and other documents about his life. ""The more I think about my life, the more I see that the biggest and most important events took place unexpectedly. Absolutely,"" he said at the time. Tributes poured in Tuesday from world leaders after news of Gorbachev's death. President Joe Biden issued a statement that said, in part, ""Mikhail Gorbachev was a man of remarkable vision. When he came to power, the Cold War had gone on for nearly 40 years and communism for even longer, with devastating consequences. Few high-level Soviet officials had the courage to admit that things needed to change. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I saw him do that and more."" ""These were the acts of a rare leader -- one with the imagination to see that a different future was possible and the courage to risk his entire career to achieve it,"" Biden said. ""The result was a safer world and greater freedom for millions of people."" ""I'm saddened to hear of the death of Gorbachev,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted. ""I always admired the courage & integrity he showed in bringing the Cold War to a peaceful conclusion. In a time of Putin's aggression in Ukraine, his tireless commitment to opening up Soviet society remains an example to us all."" Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Gorbachev a ""man who tried to deliver a better life for his people."" ABC News' Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.",17
2022-09-01,https://abcnews.go.com/US/heres-learned-dojs-photo-classified-documents-mar-lago/story?id=89161286,Here's what we've learned from the DOJ's photo of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago,"The Justice Department's Tuesday night court filing in its ongoing investigation into classified documents stored at former President Donald Trump's Florida estate included previously unreleased details about the probe -- but perhaps none were as revealing as an FBI photograph of documents recovered from Trump's personal office during the bureau's August 8 raid. Since the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago, some members of Trump's team have downplayed the documents he kept at the resort as keepsakes that contained little sensitive information. But the photo released by Justice Department appears to refute those claims, showing document after document clearly labeled Secret and Top Secret. In a court filing Wednesday evening, attorneys for Trump criticized the photo and its inclusion in the brief the government filed opposing Trump's request for a special master to review the retrieved documents. ""The Government’s Response gratuitously included a photograph of allegedly classified materials, pulled from a container and spread across the floor for dramatic effect,"" the filing said. ""The Government pretends these are not historically important moments, telling this Court that not only does it object to a Special Master, but that the Movant should have no opportunity to challenge any aspect of this behavior and decision-making."" While portions of the FBI photo are redacted, a close review of the image reveals new clues about the kind of classified materials the former president was continuing to hang onto even after the Justice Department had issued a subpoena for their return. The photo shows numerous documents on the floor of Trump's personal office, including colored-coded cover sheets baring classification markings in big, bold lettering. ""An examination of these cover sheets alone tells you a lot,"" Douglas London, a 34-year CIA veteran, told ABC News regarding the DOJ photo. ""As the most important intelligence customer, it should be no surprise that the president receives the most sensitive information -- and that's reflected in these documents."" The markings on the cover sheets include ""TOP SECRET/SCI,"" which refers to Sensitive Compartmented Information classified as national intelligence ""concerning or derived from intelligence sources,"" according to a separate document from the Director of National Intelligence reviewed by ABC News. This material may come from allies or informants, or from spying or eavesdropping. A cover sheet near the bottom center of the photo also appears to show a ""HCS-P/SI/TK"" classification marking. HCS-P refers to HUMINT Control System, which is ""designed to protect intelligence information derived from clandestine human sources, commonly referred to as ""human intelligence."" SI, or Special Intelligence, refers to a Sensitive Compartmented Information control system ""designed to protect technical and intelligence information derived from the monitoring of foreign communications signals by other than the intended recipients,"" according to the FBI. London, who is also the author of ""The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence,"" said, ""If HCS is on the cover sheet, it means at least some of that information was drawn from human sources. And HCS-P is sensitive even by human source standards."" ""Without being melodramatic, anything that helps an adversary identify a human source means life and death,"" he said. ""People's lives are truly at stake."" There is also a handwritten marker next to the document that reads ""2A,"" which appears to refer to ""Item 2A"" on the property receipt that was given to Trump's lawyers following the search. On the receipt, ""Item 2A"" is described as ""Various classified/TS/SCI documents."" Even though the contents of the documents can't been seen in the photo, the dates on some documents are visible. While it's not clear how or if the dates correlate to the classified information, they could provide potential clues regarding what Trump was publicly dealing with at the time. Two documents with a ""limited access"" marker appear to be dated Aug. 26, 2018. While little else about those documents is visible, it's known that in August 2018, Trump was in the thick of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into contacts between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. The day before Aug. 26, Trump, posting on Twitter, unloaded on Muller and then-attorney general Jeff Sessions, who had by then recused himself from the Russia probe, according to records maintained by The American Presidency Project by UC Santa Barbara. One month prior to that, Mueller had indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers for hacking and releasing Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign. In addition, days before Aug. 26, 2018, Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on eight counts of tax fraud. Aug. 26, 2018, was also the day after Sen. John McCain died. A separate document shown in the photo bears the date May 9, 2018, which is the same day Trump gave a speech announcing he was withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. On that same day, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang, which led to Trump announcing that Pompeo would be returning to the U.S. with three Americans who had been released from prison in North Korea. ""I'm very honored to have helped these great folks, but the true honor is going to be if we have a victory in getting rid of nuclear weapons,"" Trump said standing on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews. ""We have a meeting scheduled in a very short period of time. We have the location set. We'll see if we can do something that people did not think was going to happen for many, many years."" Trump ended up meeting with Kim the following month at a summit in Singapore, after which Trump announced that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat to America. However North Korea resumed constructing new missiles the following month.",11
2022-09-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/iaea-mission-arrives-zaporzhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-amid/story?id=89155495,IAEA mission arrives at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid 'increased military activity',"A high-stakes mission from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog reached a Russian-controlled power plant in Ukraine on Thursday afternoon amid reports of heavy fighting there. The International Atomic Energy Agency has long sought access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, since invading Russian troops overran the site and the surrounding town of Enerhodar in southeastern Ukraine in early March. The Ukrainian workers have been left in place to keep the plant operating, as it supplies electricity across the war-torn country, but the site is now on the frontline between Russian-occupied and Ukrainian-controlled territory. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations of shelling at or near the plant in recent days and weeks, fueling fears that the conflict could spark a radiation disaster. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, who is leading a team of over a dozen experts sent to inspect the besieged plant, said earlier Thursday that they were ""aware"" of the high risk posed by the ""increased military activity in the area"" between Russian and Ukrainian forces. ""There has been increased military activity, including this morning, until very recently, a few minutes ago. I have been briefed by the Ukrainian regional military commander here about that and the inherent risks,"" Grossi told reporters as he and his team left their hotel in the city of Zaporizhzhia, north of Enerhodar, across the Dnipro River. ""But, weighing the pros and cons, and having come so far, we are not stopping,"" he added. ""We are moving now."" While acknowledging the risks, Grossi said his team had the ""minimum conditions"" to forge on with the final and dangerous leg of their journey. He told reporters to ""wish us luck."" ""We know that there is an area, as you know, the so-called grey zone, where the last line of the Ukrainian defense comes, and before the first line of the Russian occupying forces begins, where the risks are significant,"" he said. ""At the same time, we consider that we have the minimum conditions to move, accepting that the risks are very, very high. Still, myself and the team, we believe that we can proceed with this. We have a very important mission to accomplish."" Upon arrival, the team plans to immediately start ""an assessment of the security and the safety situation at the plant, as it is right now,"" according to Grossi. ""We are going to be liaising and consulting with the staff at the facility. And I am going to consider the possibility of establishing a continued presence of the IAEA at the plant, which we believe is indispensable to stabilize the situation and to get regular, reliable, impartial, neutral updates of what the situation is there,"" he added. ""It's very important that the world knows what's happening here."" A few hours later, the IAEA announced via Twitter that its ""Support and Assistance Mission ... has just arrived at Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant to conduct indispensable nuclear safety and security and safeguards activities."" Grossi and his team landed in Kyiv earlier this week, where they met with with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, before making their way to the Zaporizhzhia region in a convoy of U.N.-marked vehicles. When asked by reporters on Wednesday if it was possible to demilitarize the plant, Grossi said it was ""a matter of political will"" and that his mission is to preserve the biggest nuclear power station in both Ukraine and Europe. He emphasized that his team would be operating in Ukrainian sovereign territory but in cooperation with Russian forces. Asked if he thought Russian troops would really give his team full access, Grossi told reporters the IAEA was on a ""technical mission"" and that he was confident they could work ""on both sides.""

2022-09-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-asks-congress-47-billion-covid-ukraine/story?id=89229560,"White House asks Congress for $47 billion for COVID, Ukraine, monkeypox, natural disasters","The White House is seeking $47 billion from Congress to secure COVID and monkeypox vaccines, to bolster Ukraine’s defenses and to respond to natural disasters at home. ""All of the requests in here meet urgent funding needs,"" an administration official told reporters Friday. ""It is our responsibility to tell Congress what we need in order to meet these critical needs. These have had bipartisan support in the past, and we fully expect Congress to work with us to reach a resolution on all of them."" The funding would be tied to a constituting resolution to keep the government running past Sept. 30. Biden officials said the requests are for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, which would span from October to December of this year. But their request is likely to be met with resistance on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are generally opposed to any additional emergency and Democrats for months have pushed to no avail for supplemental COVID funding that they say is necessary to combatting the virus. Most of the money would go toward combating the COVID pandemic, with the White House asking lawmakers for $22.4 billion for vaccines, treatments and personal protective equipment (PPE). That sum would also fund ""next-generation"" research, the administration said, and provide services like treatments for ""long COVID."" On Friday, the federal government’s free program for Americans to order at-home COVID tests was suspended due to a lack of funding. More than 600 millions tests have been sent to families free of charge since the program began in January. To tackle the monkeypox crisis, the administration is requesting $4.5 billion to expand domestic manufacturing of vaccines, to develop rapid tests, support health activities and more. The administration has faced criticism for its response to the monkeypox outbreak, with public experts saying the U.S. should have moved faster to distribute tests and vaccines. As of Sept. 1, there were 19,465 total confirmed monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""This funding will also help ensure the United States is at the front of the line for the best tools to fight any possible future outbreak,"" the administration said. Beyond the administration’s public health efforts, the second largest chunk of the money the White House is requesting would go toward Ukraine. The administration is seeking $13.7 billion to provide Ukraine with military equipment and intelligence gathering, as well as direct budget assistance to the nation’s government. That funding also includes $2 million for energy-related issues stemming from the conflict. ""We have rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and we cannot allow that support to Ukraine to run dry,"" the administration said. ""The people of Ukraine have inspired the world, and the Administration remains committed to supporting the Ukrainian people as they continue to stand resolute and display extraordinary courage in the face of Russia’s full-scale invasion."" To combat natural disasters in the U.S., which faces record heat and devastating flooding, the White House is asking for $6.5 billion to go toward the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund; direct payments for farmers; to local governments to strengthen their eclectic grids and more.",26
2022-09-03,https://abcnews.go.com/International/17-year-ukrainian-describes-experience-prisoner-war/story?id=89166583,17-year-old Ukrainian describes his experience as a prisoner of war,"Vlad Buryak, 17, was traveling in a car on the morning of April 8 and stopped at a Russian checkpoint. Within hours, he would end up in a Russian prison. Russian soldiers had seen his cellphone and accused him of filming them, he told ABC News' Britt Clennett during an interview held over Zoom. They took his phone and while checking his photos and social media, they found a pro-Ukrainian Telegram group. The soldiers were furious, he said, and threatened to kill him on the spot. Instead, he was taken to a filtration camp and then to a prison where he would spend 48 days before eventually being released. Thousands of Ukrainians have reportedly been held as prisoners of war and hundreds of thousands have been forcibly deported from the country through so-called filtration camps. The experience of children during the war, which has stretched over six months, has been uniquely traumatic and provides a chilling portrait into the painful reality on the ground in Ukraine. The U.N. estimates that nearly 1,000 children have been killed or injured during the conflict and more than 5 million Ukrainian children, both inside the country and living as refugees, are in need of humanitarian aid. The prison he was put into ""so awful and so difficult,"" he said, adding that hearing constant cries of ""help me"" and ""don't beat me"" breaks you inside. His job was to wash floors, cleaning rooms that had been used for torture ""three or four days a week,"" he said. He helped pass information between prisoners, written on small bits of paper which they would try to smuggle outside the prison walls to family members. He wasn't beaten, but watched other gets beaten and tortured. Although he noticed everything going on around him, he tried to be invisible he said, focusing on his work. He didn't want the Russian soldiers to know how much he was seeing. During the interview with ABC News, he admitted that he had probably blocked out many aspects of his time in prison. ""If you see awful things, your brain forgets it."" If he dwells on the past too much, ""I can have problem in my head,"" he said, ""and I don't want to have [that]."" So, he said, ""I prefer to not think about this."" It was very difficult to maintain his psychological health in prison, he said. If you show emotion, there was the fear of being beaten and tortured, and of never being released, he said. ""If you begin crying, if you begin to be angry with these Russian soldiers, these Russian soldiers can kill you or torture you."" To keep himself mentally sane, he would talk to himself. ""I think about what I do when I have freedom. What I do after prison, what I do with my family, how I visit my friends, how I go to the café, how I go to McDonald's,"" he said. After 48 days, he was finally reunited with his father. ""You can't explain this emotion,"" he said, displaying maturity beyond his years. ""This emotion you can only feel.""",7

""You see, they occupied our nuclear station, six blocks. The biggest in Europe. It means six Chernobyls; it means the biggest danger in Europe. So, they occupied it. So that is-- means that they use nuclear weapon. That is [a] nuclear weapon,"" Zelenskyy told Muir from the presidential office. ""There shouldn't be any military personnel. There shouldn't be any military equipment on the territory. And there shouldn't be the workers of nuclear power plant who are-- surrounded by people with firearms,"" Zelenskyy added. You can watch more of David Muir's full interview with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on ABC's ""World News Tonight"" and ""Good Morning America."" The nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine -- the largest in all of Europe -- has seen intense shelling in recent weeks as Russia's invasion morphs into a grinding artillery battle with neither side winning much new territory. The attacks around the site have sparked international concerns over a nuclear incident, with inspectors from the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency on the scene to assess any damage, its security systems and working conditions. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations over who is responsible for the shelling at and around the plant. Russian forces are currently occupying the site, though Ukrainian workers are still operating it. Power to the plant has at times gone out due to the shelling, and two of its six reactors are operating from just one remaining power line. Power outages threaten the plant's cooling systems, which are key to preventing a meltdown. International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Grossi said in a statement Saturday the plant was cut off from its last external power line, but is still able to lean on a reserve line to receive electricity during the ongoing shelling. ""We already have a better understanding of the functionality of the reserve power line in connecting the facility to the grid,"" Grossi said. ""This is crucial information in assessing the overall situation there."" Zelenskyy told Muir he would not consider a controlled shutdown of the plant to prevent any radiation leaks given that the site provides energy to two regions of Ukraine as winter approaches. ""I know that the Russians would like-- the reactors to-- to be disconnected from Ukrainian grid and-- connected to the Russian grid. No, we-- we do not agree to those messages,"" Zelenskyy said.",10
2022-09-06,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dual-referendum-election-brings-diverging-midterm-paths-note/story?id=89369008,Dual-referendum election brings diverging midterm paths: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It might be that this year's midterms are neither a choice nor a referendum so much as they are a choice between referendums. To the extent that there's agreement surrounding the stakes of 2022, it coalesces around the notion that the other party represents a wrong and even dangerous path for the nation. That leaves the putative party standard-bearers in the odd situation of making cases that many who are running in congressional or statewide races -- those who need crossover voters -- might frame another way. President Joe Biden's stark attack on ""MAGA Republicans"" last week and people he called ""Trumpies"" on Monday was met primarily by silence from Democrats in battleground states who will need at least some Trump voters to win. As his Labor Day appearances in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania made clear, Biden is not being avoided, but neither is he being embraced by Democrats across the board. Former President Donald Trump's latest attack on Biden as an ""enemy of the state"" marks a typically aggressive attempt to channel GOP anger at Democrats. But his focus on personal grievances -- up to and including those stemming from the FBI search warrant carried out at Mar-a-Lago -- threatens to obscure the forward-looking messages even some of his endorsed candidates would rather run on. A case in point comes in Pennsylvania, where both Biden and Trump have spent time over the past week. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz appeared at Trump's Saturday rally in Wilkes-Barre but is not playing up his connections to Trump nearly as much as gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano and others who embrace the ""MAGA"" label. Oz would rather a race about Biden and his leadership, just as Democrat John Fetterman would prefer a race about Trump and his followers. The Fetterman campaign called Oz and Trump ""two desperate and sad dudes"" after the former president attacked Fetterman with baseless and personal allegations Saturday night. As USA Today's Susan Page put it on ABC News' ""This Week"" Sunday, ""The two parties want this to be a referendum -- but on the other guy's president."" The RUNDOWN with Brittany Shepherd With 64 days to go until the midterms, Vice President Kamala Harris offered a preview of the punchiness of her political messaging at a Labor Council Breakfast in Boston yesterday. During her marks, Harris echoed warnings senior White House officials -- and President Biden -- have outlined over the past several weeks: Democrats' grip on majority power in Washington is in danger of loosening, thanks to ""extremist, so-called leaders"" who are ""fighting to turn back the clock."" After touting administrative wins on infrastructure, Harris painted Republican policies regarding gun ownership, health care, and education as ""extremist"" and dangerous for growth, a conclusion shy of the controversial line between Trump-aligned policies and fascism President Biden drew last week, but not completely without bite. ""But instead of standing with working people to lower the price of healthcare, education, and childcare. These extremist, so-called leaders prioritize breaks for big corporations and the wealthiest one percent. But together, we are fighting back,"" Harris told the group. Her less-aggressive but still pointed shots at ""extremist, so-called leaders"" could serve as a preview on how the vice president hopes to compliment Biden's message on the campaign trail – a softer warning focusing on White House policy wins and potentially GOP rollbacks as Biden rails against MAGA-ism in the abstract, and the dangers of Trump in particular. The TIP with Hannah Demissie The Massachusetts gubernatorial race is the best chance for Democrats to pick up a governor seat this election cycle. All eyes will be on the state's GOP gubernatorial primary as former state Rep. Geoff Diehl faces off against political newcomer Chris Doughty. Diehl is supported by former President Donald Trump and the state's GOP. In recent gubernatorial primaries such as Maryland and Illinois, the Massachusetts governor's race is the latest example of a Trump-like candidate seeking the GOP nomination in a deeply blue state. Doughty has positioned himself as the moderate in the race, focusing on lowering taxes, keeping the statehouse balanced, and making Massachusetts affordable for people. During his campaign run, Diehl has focused on upgrading Massachusetts infrastructure, supporting law enforcement and expanding housing. Even though Massachusetts is considered a Democratic stronghold, the state has a long history of electing moderate Republican governors. The current governor, Republican Charlie Baker, popular in the state, decided not to seek a third term and has not endorsed either candidate in the race. Whoever is victorious in the primary will face off against the state's Attorney General Maura Healey, who cleared the Democratic field. If Healey wins in November, she would be Massachusetts first elected female governor and openly gay governor. NUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight 1 in 2.

2022-09-06,https://abcnews.go.com/International/uk-announce-prime-minister-boris-johnsons-resignation/story?id=89309348,Liz Truss becomes UK prime minister after Boris Johnson's resignation,"LONDON -- Liz Truss became the prime minister of the United Kingdom on Tuesday, shortly after Boris Johnson formally resigned. Johnson, who had announced his intention to resign two months ago, formally stepped down during an audience with Britain's Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle in Scotland on Tuesday morning. A short time later, Truss had her own audience with the 96-year-old queen and was formally asked to form a new government, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace. It was the first time in the queen’s 70-year reign that the ceremonial transfer of power was held at Balmoral, where she is vacationing, rather than at Buckingham Palace in London. Truss, 47, took office a day after the ruling Conservative Party selected her as its new leader, putting her in line to be confirmed as the U.K. prime minister without the need for a general election because the Conservatives wield a majority in the House of Commons. In a speech following her victory on Monday, Truss said it was an ""honor"" to be chosen and paid tribute to Johnson, her ""friend."" She is the U.K.'s fourth prime minister since 2016 and the country's third female premier ever. In her first speech from the steps of 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's official residence, Truss once again praised her predecessor as a ""hugely consequential prime minister."" ""I'm honored to take on this responsibility at a vital time for our country,"" she said, adding that she was ""determined to deliver."" Truss said her three priorities were economic growth, tackling the energy crisis ""caused by Putin's war,"" and improving the National Health Service. Truss previously served in Johnson's cabinet as the foreign secretary along with Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor of the exchequer whose resignation helped bring about Johnson's downfall earlier this year. She ran against Rishi Sunak in the Conservative Party's leadership election, in which only the 172,000 dues-paying members were allowed to vote. The party's members cast their votes after eight weeks of campaigning, with Truss -- a supporter of Johnson who said she did not back his resignation -- emerging as the overwhelming favorite. The campaign was dominated by questions about what either candidate would do to tackle a looming economic crisis, with household energy bills set to skyrocket this winter and inflation -- already reaching a four-decade high at 10.1% -- expected to rise even further, according to the Bank of England. Truss and Sunak clashed most fiercely on the issue of tax, with Truss saying she would not raise taxes while Sunak has supported a windfall tax on energy companies' profits to help ease the burden on households. Truss has promised action on the energy crisis within a week of taking office, though she has not spelled out her plans in any detail and refused to elaborate when questioned by BBC News on Sunday. She is expected to unveil her plan on Thursday. Truss will also have the task of uniting a divided Conservative Party. Johnson's tenure in office was dogged by scandal, most notably with the issue of ""Partygate,"" or the illegal gatherings held at government residences while the U.K. was under a strict lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic. While Johnson's supporters will remember him for securing a huge election victory, Brexit and support for Ukraine, Johnson's detractors say his conduct and flexible relationship with the truth damaged the Conservative Party's brand. In an op-ed published by The Sunday Telegraph over the weekend, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer, said that the appointment of a fourth Conservative prime minister in recent years did not mark a ""new dawn"" for Britain. ""As summer turns to autumn, the shadows of crisis are lengthening, looming over the whole country,"" Starmer wrote. ""There is no sign that either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss have grasped the scale of what is facing us, let alone possesses the answers to it."" In July, Johnson announced that he had agreed to resign as leader of the Conservative Party, which resulted in his departure as prime minister once the party selected a successor through the leadership election. ""It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore a new prime minister,"" Johnson said in a July 7 statement delivered outside his office at no. 10 Downing Street in London. ""I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world,"" he added. ""But them's the breaks.""",3
2022-09-06,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/congress-returns-facing-pass-funding-bill-midterms-loom/story?id=89237926,Congress returns facing must-pass funding bill as midterms loom,"When Democrats left Washington in August, they did so on the wings of a series of policy wins, leaving town after pushing through many of President Joe Biden's key climate and health care proposals on party-line votes. But now, with midterms in November looming, the 50-50 Senate returns to Washington Tuesday with must-pass legislation on its plate, requiring bipartisan cooperation just as political tensions hit their peak. It's been over a month since lawmakers were last in the nation's capital. Much awaits them. Lawmakers may be returning to the Capitol in person, but their minds will likely be far away on their home states and election battleground states. This month marks the last work period for the House before the midterm election on Nov. 8. The Senate is scheduled to return for two weeks in October, but lawmakers in both chambers will no doubt use their remaining days in Washington seeking political wins to tout on the trail. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy are expected to spend the weeks leading up to the election traveling the country, holding official events with incumbent lawmakers while also rallying supporters and fundraising for key races and candidates. Chief among the priorities for Congress this month will be funding the government to avert a shutdown when current funds runs out on Sept. 30. With bipartisan agreement on an omnibus spending bill still seemingly far off, lawmakers are expected to spend September focused on passing a stopgap funding bill that will likely kick the concerns about long-term funding to the end of the year. Passing the bill is required to keep the government open, but don't mistake necessity with ease. The Biden White House and Senate Democrats will try to use the short term funding bill to secure resources for a few outstanding priorities, knowing full well it could be their last opportunity before the election potentially shifts control of either chamber of Congress. Administration officials are requesting about $47 billion in emergency aid to be tacked on to the funding bill to pay for additional Ukraine aid, COVID aid, and monkeypox and disaster relief. Expect many of those items to get Republican pushback. The administration wants Congress to approve, as part of the stopgap funding bill, $22 billion for COVID relief. That thinking is in line with key Democratic appropriators who introduced a similar $21 billion supplemental to address COVID and other health concerns in late July. But this is just the latest in a string of failed attempts by Democrats to approve COVID funding that they say is necessary to continue research and development of new vaccines and to provide free tests and vaccines. Republicans have resisted the funding, arguing that some previously approved COVID funding has yet to be spent, and calling on Democrats to find ways to pay for the additional COVID relief. Attaching the aid to the larger stopgap bill could prove perilous for the entire bill. Demands from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that his party included in the stopgap funding bill permitting reform legislation to expedite development of some energy projects, could also complicate matters. Manchin, whose vote in favor for the Democrat's Inflation Reduction Act was the lynchpin in the bill's final passage last month, conditioned his support on a promise that his permitting reform proposals would make it onto the stopgap funding bill. The deal, brokered largely between Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, has sent progressives reeling, urging leadership not to attach legislation that could expedite oil and gas projects onto the funding bill. ""I am not going to be steamrolled into a bunch of fossil fuel give aways just because Manchin cut a deal in a closed room with Chuck Schumer,"" said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said in a statement. ""He doesn't get to run the show on something like this, and many of us will have a say on what that deal looks like if it even happens."" Republicans are also threatening to withhold support for a funding bill that includes Manchin's proposed measures. ""I will not vote for a continuing resolution that is part of a political payback scheme,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said last month. By the time FBI agents executed their August 8 search on former President Donald Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago, lawmakers were already far from Washington D.C. Many, including leaders of both parties, have chosen to keep quiet as the early stages of the legal battle surrounding the FBI's actions unfold. But when they return this week, members on both sides of the aisle will be peppered with questions, and some of key committees will likely ramp up already growing calls for additional information to be provided to Congress. Sens. Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to National Intelligence Director Avril Hanes and Attorney General Merrick Garland requesting a damage assessment of any national security threat posed by the mishandling of information. And Sen. Rob Portman, the top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, has also called on the FBI and Justice Department to provide Senators with a classified briefing on the raid. ""It's unprecedented to have a raid like this on a former president's residence, and that's why I think the transparency should be unprecedented also,"" Portman said on MSNBC on Thursday. ""Obviously, we need to be careful that sources and methods are not being revealed through classified documents. They should never be taken from the White House in the first place, but we just don't know the details yet. So yeah, I think it's important we have that briefing."" Meanwhile, the Jan. 6 select committee is expected to continue its work after a quiet August. The committee hasn't held public public hearing since mid-July, but it's expected to host additional hearings in September and to issue an interim report. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, who serves on the panel, lost her primary race handedly during the August recess. Her defeat, paired with GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger's retirement, means both Republicans on the committee will leave Washington come January. The committee is expected to issue its final report before they do. Separately, the House Oversight Committee said it could release some of the former president's highly-sought after financial records as early as this month after striking a deal with the administration. With the Inflation Reduction Act now signed, any remaining legislative objectives will have to pass muster of at least 10 Republicans at a time when the GOP will be more reluctant than ever to hand Democrats a victory. Still, there may be a few bipartisan victories to eke out before the 117th Congress ends. After Democrats fell short on their efforts to enact major election reform earlier this year, a bipartisan coalition formed to consider narrow changes to the Electoral Count Act. The group announced an agreement to clarify the ceremonial role of the Vice President in certifying the results of a Presidential Election in late July. A vote on the reform could come before the year is out. Republican Sen. Susan Collins is also leading efforts to find 10 Republicans to support a bill that would codify the right to same sex marriage into law. She's been optimistic she can find support within her conference. But Democrats are also only guaranteed a few more months in the majority. Expect them to use that time to highlight party priorities. Schumer has vowed that Democrats will force Republicans to take another vote on lowering the cost of insulin, a provision ruled out of the Inflation Reduction Act. Democrats have also vowed to make abortion rights a key issue on the campaign, and will likely force additional show votes on protecting abortion access on the floor, encouraged by Kansas voters' decision to uphold the state's constitutional right to an abortion in early August.",26
2022-09-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/exclusive-zelenskyy-muir-regrets-warning-ukrainian-people-invasion/story?id=89461251,EXCLUSIVE: Zelenskyy to Muir on whether he regrets not warning Ukrainians earlier about US intelligence,"In an exclusive interview with ABC ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said officials weren't certain about the scale of a potential Russian invasion before Moscow launched its war on Ukraine. Zelenskyy, when pressed by Muir if he had had ""any regret that you didn't tell the Ukrainian people earlier about what could be coming,"" said that the world was ""disunited"" over whether Russia would actually launch at attack. ""The European leaders were saying, 'Putin gave us his word that he's not going to invade.' Nobody knew for sure, for sure, 100% what scale of invasion was there to be expected,"" Zelenskyy told Muir. ""No one knew that those Russian troops will kill, maim, rape people and just erase our cities from the ground, to the ground,"" he said. ""I asked all the intelligence, 'Show us what concrete directions, 'Give us more weapons.' But then, they said, 'If they begin invasion, we give you more weapons.'"" Zelenskyy's remarks come as Russia's invasion, launched in February, morphs into a grinding exchange of artillery fire, largely in southern and eastern Ukraine. Kyiv has launched a counteroffensive in both regions, and officials claim to have made modest gains. Ukraine was able to repel Russia's initial attempt to capture Kyiv, but evidence later surfaced of alleged civilian killings, rapes and what officials said were other possible war crimes during the Russian military's retreat from the areas around the capital -- including the horror in the city of Bucha, where authorities have found more than 400 bodies, many buried in mass graves. Zelenskyy said early uncertainty over Russia's invasion hindered delivery of military aid even as Ukraine was pressing for assistance from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""We cannot only put any blame on the United States, that United States should have provided us with everything; the whole world wasn't 100% sure that they will start this invasion,"" he said. ""If you have any additional information, why don't you provide us with this information, or why don't you give us more potent arms and weapons?"" he added. ""You don't need these weapons yourselves, but we need it here now. Now -- now, they are saying, 'Yes, we warned you,' but we, we wanted not extra words and warnings; we wanted extra weapons.""",7

2022-09-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sanders-leads-progressive-revolt-manchin-backed-side-deal/story?id=89560074,Sanders leads progressive revolt over Manchin-backed 'side deal' for government funding bill,"Democratic congressional leaders are facing a progressive revolt -- that could potentially risk a government shutdown -- in the wake of the closed-door deal between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin that won the latter's crucial support for the Inflation Reduction Act. After repeatedly slamming that ""disastrous side deal"" that would streamline the permitting process for energy projects across the U.S. -- which Schumer agreed to include with a must-pass spending bill to fund the federal government -- Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., promptly announced Thursday that he intends to oppose the funding resolution as a result. ""If the United States Congress goes on record and says, 'Yes we are going to support more fossil fuel reduction, more carbon emissions,' the signal we are sending to our own people and the planet is a terrible, terrible signal,"" Sanders said in a floor speech. He did not mince words with reporters afterward. Asked if he would vote no on funding the government if the Schumer-Manchin permitting deal is attached, he replied: ""Yes. You're talking about the future for the planet."" Sanders' opposition adds to the growing progressive pressure in the House, where some left-wing lawmakers have likewise threatened to block the government funding bill if it includes Manchin's desired changes to energy permitting. Sanders on Thursday read from a soon-to-be-released letter -- obtained by ABC News Wednesday -- that he said had been signed by ""at least 59"" House progressives opposing the Schumer-Manchin agreement. That deal, Sanders said, quoting from the letter, ""would silence the voices of environmental communities by insulating them from scrutiny. This would cause members to choose between protecting environmental justice communities from further pollution or funding the government. We urge you to ensure these provisions are kept out of a continuing resolution or any other must-pass legislation this year."" Manchin has argued that permitting reform will also help speed projects related to wind, solar and other environmentally friendly sources of energy. He's adamant that permitting reform must stay in the funding bill and, so far, he seems to have Schumer's backing. Despite the progressive rhetorical thunder, it is possible that the bill to fund the government -- which will also include popular aid for Ukraine and disaster relief -- will garner enough GOP support to render the threatened liberal blockade moot. ""It was a rank political deal,"" Sen. Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the appropriations committee, told reporters Thursday of Manchin and Schumer's agreement. But he stopped short of saying it would put government funding in jeopardy. Still, some other Republicans are vowing to oppose the funding resolution because they oppose Schumer and Manchin's dealmaking. Many conservatives have said they took umbrage at the last-minute nature of the deal among Democrats on the sweeping climate and health care reform legislation known as the IRA. It passed without a single GOP vote -- not long after some Republicans had voted with Democrats on computer chip funding, thinking that the Democrats' social spending bill was dead. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told ABC that ""I would vote against it,"" referring to government funding, and he said he was urging his Republican colleagues to do the same. It's not yet clear whether Republicans will unite behind Graham's effort, but most GOP aides familiar with the matter say they do not expect that.

2022-09-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-americans-updated-covid-vaccine-year/story?id=89533791,White House urges Americans to get updated COVID-19 vaccine shots this fall,"The White House is urging Americans to get updated COVID-19 vaccine shots this fall specifically targeting prevalent omicron variants. The Biden administration on Thursday released more details on its plan to make the newly approved shots -- the first of annual shots it says Americans should get -- easily available and free for the public. The White House is also again calling on Congress to provide additional funding for the nation's response to the health crisis. President Joe Biden, who canceled his planned remarks on the updated vaccines after news broke of the death of Queen Elizabeth II, previously said the shots represent a ""new phase"" in the government's response to the virus. ""As the virus continues to change, we will now be able to update our vaccines annually to target the dominant variant,"" he said in a statement earlier this week. ""Just like your annual flu shot, you should get it sometime between Labor Day and Halloween. It's safe, it's easy to get, and it's free."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on the shots, one by Moderna and one by Pfizer-BioNtech, earlier this month after the Food and Drug Administration authorized their emergency use. The current omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, make up the bulk of new virus cases in the U.S. The booster shots contain protein components of the subvariants to the current vaccine composition, the CDC said, helping to restore protection that's waned since previous vaccinations. The CDC recommends people ages 12 and older receive the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, and those 18 years or older to get the shot offered by Moderna. The shots have been authorized for use at least two months after an individual's primary vaccine series or their most recent booster. ""For most Americans who are fully vaccinated, our nation's health experts are recommending that you get the updated COVID vaccine once a year,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. The administration has secured over 170 million doses of the updated COVID-19 vaccines, and plans to ship them to tens of thousands of pharmacies, health centers and other convenient locations nationwide. According to the White House, after this first round of doses are delivered, over 90% of Americans will have a location with free shots within five miles of where they live. To encourage those at highest risk of severe illness or disease, such as older or immunocompromised individuals, to get the new vaccines, the administration will be reaching out directly to the 16 million people subscribed for Medicare emails to share information on the newest COVID shots. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will also be providing resources to nursing homes and long-term care facilities to ensure residents and staff can get the new shots. The White House said Thursday it will also continue to increase testing capacity and access to treatments but Jean-Pierre said that the administration is ""constrained"" on what it can do because of limiting funding. The administration is seeking $22.4 billion from Congress they say is necessary to combat COVID. That funding would go toward ""next-generation"" research, providing treatments and boosting vaccine supply. The request is likely to face an uphill battle on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are generally opposed to any additional emergency funding. The White House said it will be able to stay on track with its COVID response through the fall, but will be forced to transition the procurement and distribution of vaccines, treatments and more to the commercial market if lawmakers don't make more funding available. ""The timeline of this transition should be dictated by the state of the pandemic and by the need to ensure an orderly transition, not by the lack of funding,"" the White House said.",25
2022-09-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-queen-elizabeth-ii-defined-era/story?id=89529317,Biden says Queen Elizabeth II 'defined an era',"President Joe Biden said in a statement on Queen Elizabeth II's death that ""the thoughts and prayers of people all across the United States are with the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth in their grief."" ""Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was more than a monarch,"" Biden and first lady Jill Biden said Thursday in a written statement, shortly after the queen's death was announced. ""She defined an era."" ""In a world of constant change,"" they continued, ""she was a steadying presence and a source of comfort and pride for generations of Britons, including many who have never known their country without her."" The Bidens said the late queen helped make the U.S.-U.K. relationship ""special."" ""Queen Elizabeth II was a stateswoman of unmatched dignity and constancy who deepened the bedrock alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States,"" they wrote. Senior advisers informed Biden of the queen's death during a meeting in the Oval Office, according to a White House official. He ordered flags flown at half-staff at the White House and on all public U.S. buildings around the world until sundown on the day her body is laid to rest. After her funeral, her body is expected to be buried at Windsor Castle outside London. The Bidens said they looked forward ""to continuing a close friendship"" with her son, now King Charles III, and his wife, Camilla, the queen consort, ""in the years ahead."" ""We send our deepest condolences to the Royal Family, who are not only mourning their Queen, but their dear mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother,"" they said. ""Her legacy will loom large in the pages of British history, and in the story of our world."" The Bidens subsequently stopped at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., to offer their condolences to British Ambassador Karen Pierce and the staff there, signing a book and making some brief comments. ""I mourn for all of you,"" President Biden said as he stood up from signing the condolence book. ""She was a great lady. We're so delighted we got meet her."" At one point, the president noted the queen was very interested in American domestic politics and said, ""She was quite a lady."" ""We admired her so much,"" Jill Biden said. ""It's amazing the impact she had not just to the Commonwealth, but around the world. Around the world,"" the president added. When the first couple entered embassy late Thursday afternoon, the first lady was clutching a bouquet. Ambassador Pierce greeted them near the door. Pierce invited President Biden to sign the condolence book and he replied, ""Am I able to write a message?"" He proceeded to write at length in the book including that the queen ""led with enduring strength and dignity, devoting her whole life to serving her people. Jill and I will never forget meeting her."" The first lady added her own brief message in the book as well. The news of the death of the queen, who was 96, broke earlier Thursday as White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was holding a regular news briefing. Jean-Pierre learned of Buckingham Palace's announcement from reporters. ""Our hearts go to the people of the United Kingdom, to the queen and to her family,"" Jean-Pierre said. At the Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also ordered flags lowered to half-staff. ""Today, Americans join the people of the United Kingdom in mourning the sad passing of Queen Elizabeth II,"" Pelosi tweeted. ""Over her seven decades on the throne, Her Majesty was a pillar of leadership in the global arena and a devoted friend of freedom."" Earlier Thursday, Biden spoke with British Prime Minister Liz Truss about the queen and told Truss he was ""thinking very much"" about the ailing monarch, the White House said. On a pre-scheduled call with European leaders about Ukraine, which White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters was ongoing early Thursday afternoon, the president said he and first lady Jill Biden were ""thinking"" of the British royal family. ""He did convey to Prime Minister Truss, who is on the video teleconference, that he and Dr. Biden are thinking very much of the queen and the family and the people of the United Kingdom,"" Kirby said. Biden has been briefed on developments and ""will be updated throughout the day concerning news out of the United Kingdom,"" Kirby said. ""His and the first lady's thoughts are solidly and squarely with the queen today, and her family,"" Kirby said. Buckingham Palace has said earlier Thursday that Queen Elizabeth's doctors were ""concerned for"" her health, and had ""recommended she remain under medical supervision."" Queen Elizabeth met 13 sitting U.S. presidents in her lifetime, and met every U.S. president since World War II, with the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson. Biden met with the queen last year during a trip to the United Kingdom -- his first travel abroad as president. He had previously met the queen in 1982 as a U.S. senator, during another trip to the U.K. ABC News' Sarah Kolinovsky and Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.",15

Trump had argued that the Russia probe was ""prolonged and exacerbated by the presence of a small faction of Clinton loyalists who were well-positioned within the Department of Justice,"" a group that included defendants James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Kevin Clinesmith, and Bruce Ohr. The judge said the lawsuit was rife with ""glaring problems,"" claims that were ""not warranted under existing law,"" and legal theories that lacked factual support. ""At its core, the problem with Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is that Plaintiff is not attempting to seek redress for any legal harm; instead, he is seeking to flaunt a two-hundred-page political manifesto outlining his grievances against those that have opposed him, and this Court is not the appropriate forum,"" the order said. ""We vehemently disagree with the opinion issued by the Court today,"" Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, said in a statement following the dismissal. ""Not only is it rife with erroneous applications of the law, it disregards the numerous independent governmental investigations which substantiate our claim that the defendants conspired to falsely implicate our client and undermine the 2016 Presidential election."" Habba said Trump's legal team would immediately move to appeal the decision. Trump earlier tried to move the lawsuit to a different judge in the Southern District of Florida, but was unsuccessful. That judge, Aileen Cannon, is the same Trump-appointed judge who this week granted Trump's motion for a special master to review the Justice Department's seizure of documents from his Mar-a-Lago estate. Special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, completed in 2019, concluded that Russian interference in the 2016 election was ""sweeping and systematic,"" and the investigation led to seven guilty pleas and five jail sentences, mostly on charges of lying to investigators -- but no charges were ever brought against Trump himself.",11
2022-09-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/king-charles-iii-bridge-future-us-ambassador-uk/story?id=89647253,King Charles III will be 'bridge to the future' and may shaky up monarchy: US ambassador to UK,"Jane Hartley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, said she believes the newly crowned King Charles will be a ""bridge to the future."" ""I think that he is both a link to the past and a bridge to the future. I think if you watched his speech, his inaugural speech is what we would call it, he touched everything perfectly. He touched his love for his mother, but also his love for the country and his sense of duty to the country. And I think she instilled him in that. And then I think he has been preparing for this role for many, many years,"" Hartley told ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz, who anchored from London Sunday. ""So, I think it will be interesting what he does, because I think he will be a bridge to the future."" During his first speech Friday after the death of Queen Elizabeth, Charles praised his mother while also noting her death marked ""time of change"" for the royal family. “As every member of my family can testify, she combined these qualities with warmth, humor, and an unerring ability always to see the best in people,” Charles said in his first speech as king. ""In the course of the last 70 years, we have seen our society become one of many cultures and many faiths. The institutions of the state have changed in turn,"" he added. ""Our values have remained, and must remain, constant."" Raddatz pressed Hartley on whether Charles' ascension to the throne after the death of his mother would cause turmoil in a country already getting used to a new prime minister. ""I have no concerns about the U.K. Our special relationship is truly special. They're our most important ally in the world. And as we see, in particular what we're doing on Ukraine together, and there's a seamless sharing of information, our military, our security...we work really, really well together,"" Hartley said. While Queen Elizabeth was famously tight-lipped about politics, never divulging her views publicly, Hartley said that when she met her earlier this year, the Queen was not only ""interested in foreign policy,"" but ""asked a lot of questions about our domestic politics."" ""She was unbelievably informed,"" Hartley said. Raddatz asked if Charles, who, as prince, waded into politics at times, would follow the tradition his mother set of not speaking about politics in public. ""At least initially, he will follow his mother's example. But he does care deeply about a lot of issues, especially young people, which I have the deepest respect for him for doing,"" Hartley said.",7
2022-09-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-struck-major-blow-russian-forces/story?id=89748763,How Ukraine struck a major blow to Russian forces,"Ukrainian troops made good on President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's call to take back lands claimed by Russian forces with an aggressive counteroffensive this weekend in the country's northeast region. Ukrainian officials said they drove out Russian forces in two key areas in the Kharkiv region. And Ukrainian officials said they are not going to let up. ABC News' Tom Soufi Burridge, who is in Kiev, spoke with ""Start Here"" about this major turning point in the war with Russia and how it came about. TOM SOUFI BURRIDGE: This is a breathtaking move by the Ukrainians. So, people might have heard about the counteroffensive in recent days. We've been talking about it a lot in relation to the south of Ukraine. In the early days of the war, Russia occupied a large amount of territory down in the South, north of the Crimean Peninsula. Now, the Ukrainians started pushing a few weeks ago. So, they were taking a few villages, nothing much. It was moving slowly. There was a bit of a media blackout. And then suddenly, in the middle of this week, we got a huge breakthrough from the Ukrainians and actually it was in the northeast. It seems that they were kind of distracting the Russians in the south, pulling their attention there, and then they hit the Russians hard in the northeast and really seemed to have caught them completely off guard. I mean, we're seeing videos online of abandoned Russian tanks in these cities and villages that the Ukrainians have taken as if the Russians have basically fled in a hurry. And the Ukrainians, it's really got to be stated that up in the northeast, not far from the second largest city called Kharkiv. The Ukrainians have smashed through and taken massive amounts of territory, dozens of villages, [and] at least three cities, a key strategic city among them. And the Ukrainians [are] saying it's tantamount to about a thousand square miles of territory. Unbelievable. START HERE: The first question that comes to mind is how is that possible? TOM SOUFI BURRIDGE: Well, one of the, one of the reasons is the U.S. supplied weapons and weapons from other allied nations. That's definitely turned the tide in this war. For weeks, if not months, you know, those weapons -- and we're talking about the heavy weaponry, rocket systems -- to hit targets behind the Russian lines, ammunition depots, command and control centers that are used to run the Russian war machine. That's been happening for a while now. We've seen the evidence. We've seen the Ukrainians hitting all those targets and key infrastructure to block off the Russian supply lines so they can't get supplies so easily into their troops in certain areas, particularly around rivers. And that's been done very effectively by the Ukrainians. Exactly how they sort of punch through the lines in this particular area, we just don't know at this stage. The Ukrainians have put out a sort of quite effective media. Blackouts may be the wrong word, but it's a kind of shutdown on any access to the front lines. They really haven't been letting journalists in. The amount of information we've been getting out is sort of slow and therefore we're sort of still trying to build a picture of exactly how they did this. But it's remarkable. I think it speaks of the confidence of the Ukrainians, [and] the morale of the Ukrainians. I think it also speaks of how Russian forces are overstretched. U.S. intelligence has been telling us that for a while now. This is evidence of that, but I think it really shows how the Ukrainians seem to have the momentum clearly, and they're going forward now. START HERE: Because there's not a great way to verify a lot of this, Russia has actually said not all these are hasty retreats. They have admitted they're retreating from some of these positions, but some, they say, are sort of planned consolidations the way they said with their original retreats. Overall, though, Tom, can you just help me get a sense, then, of where the Ukrainian military is going from here? What will their endgame be? Because Zelenskyy says he wants it all back. BURRIDGE: Right now, the Ukrainians are pushing to retake the whole of the Kharkiv region in the northeast. That'll be hugely significant. Again, a massive blow to Putin and the Kremlin. Beyond that, politically, they want to recapture all of their land. They're way off doing that. So we can't get carried away with ourselves. This is Russia. We're talking about -- a massive military machine. But we're already seeing the Russian response: retaliation hitting power lines, hitting power stations, causing massive blackouts across the country. It's worth just sort of adding in here that Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, we've all heard about it, the concerns there. Again, [there were] alarming developments over the weekend, more shelling in the area. So, basically, the plant lost all of its external power supply and momentarily they had to shut the last remaining reactor down. Since then, they have actually regained the external power line. But the UN's nuclear watchdog warning this weekend quite clearly that if the shelling doesn't stop the possibility of a nuclear accident there is very real. Going forward, it remains to be seen whether Ukrainians can consolidate these gains, take even more territory or whether Russia is going to find a way to hit back. [ ]",7
2022-09-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-throws-minute-roadblocks-hard-line-senate-candidate/story?id=89410477,GOP throws up last-minute roadblocks to hard-line Senate candidate in New Hampshire,"Republicans are cobbling together an 11th-hour effort to blunt the rise of a controversial candidate in New Hampshire's GOP Senate primary Tuesday, fearing his nomination could take a marquee race off the table, hurting the party's chances of taking back control of the U.S. Senate. After months of handwringing over Don Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general and 2020 Senate candidate, Republicans are trying to throw roadblocks in his way just before the Sept. 13 primary. If fruitful, the efforts would likely help state Senate President Chuck Morse, the only other primary candidate notching notable polling support, though it's unclear if there's enough time to close what some Republicans say is an uncomfortably large polling gap. And Democrats, meanwhile, are intervening to surreptitiously boost Bolduc, a sign the party views him as the weakest candidate to run against Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. ""We're seeing right now a break-glass moment from both sides. We're seeing national Republicans put an urgent focus on promoting what they view as the most electable candidate in a general election. National Democrats have also come in trying to put their finger on the scale,"" said Jeff Grappone, a GOP strategist with extensive experience in New Hampshire who isn't working with any candidate in the race. ""Essentially, we're seeing both national parties to come in and try to shape the race on the terms that they want. Clearly, Republicans are concerned about Gen. Bolduc's appeal in the general election,"" he said. Some Republicans have voiced concerns for months over Bolduc, warning that he could morph a top Senate race into one virtually out of reach. Bolduc has made headlines for years with outlandish remarks, including calling Republican Gov. Chris Sununu a ""Chinese Communist sympathizer,"" saying U.S. forces should ""get in there on the ground"" in Ukraine, pushing for the repeal of the 17th Amendment codifying direct popular election of U.S. senators and accusing then-President Donald Trump of rigging the 2020 Senate primary he lost by endorsing an opponent. On top of that, Bolduc has proved to be an anemic fundraiser, hauling in under $600,000 by Aug. 24. Hassan, meanwhile, raised $4.3 million just from July 1 to Aug. 24, an impressive fundraising advantage in an expensive cycle that could ease Hassan's path to reelection. ""We've heard several national strategists say that if Don Bolduc wins the nomination, then every dime that has been reserved in advertising will be pulled on September 14,"" said Mike Dennehy, a New Hampshire GOP strategist advising Kevin Smith, another primary candidate with low poll numbers. ""It's very difficult for it to be competitive with Don Bolduc as the Republican nominee."" Still, polling has shown Bolduc as the primary frontrunner, with a University of New Hampshire poll showing him up 21 points over Morse. Those figures have lit a fire under Republicans in Washington and Concord who are mobilizing to boost Morse at Bolduc's expense. White Mountain PAC, a super PAC that was created only last month, dumped millions of dollars into an ad reservation heading into the primary, a buy that Grappone said ""puts [Morse] in the game"" and includes including at least one ad slamming Bolduc's ""crazy ideas."" Sununu, who remains overwhelmingly popular in New Hampshire, also made a late endorsement for Morse, praising him in a news conference as the ""best candidate"" to defeat Hassan and saying he's ""calling all Republicans to join me."" Republicans are also trying to lure Trump to get involved in the race -- so long as it's not for Bolduc. A Trump endorsement for Bolduc would go a long way to locking up the primary for him, and he voiced openness to such an imprimatur last month, telling a radio host Bolduc is a ""strong guy."" Sununu spoke with Trump to encourage him to play a role in the primary, a Sununu spokesperson told a local newspaper. Morse also met with Trump at the former president's golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, last week, according to Dave Carney, a consultant for Morse, and a separate source familiar with the matter. ""Yes, there is a move to stop a Bolduc endorsement,"" the source familiar with the matter said. ""Bolduc is a loser and can't win the general."" Nevertheless, Bolduc is plowing ahead, insisting that he's the outsider GOP primary voters are seeking. ""We need an outsider in DC to clean up their mess and that race starts on September 14th,"" his campaign said in a statement, referencing Hassan and President Joe Biden. Yet, Democrats are saying with their wallets that they agree with Republicans that Bolduc is the easiest candidate for Hassan to beat in purple New Hampshire. Senate Majority PAC, Senate Democrats' main outside group with ties to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released a late ad tying Morse to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a famous Trump target, in an apparent effort to put more distance between him and a GOP primary electorate that largely remains in thrall with the former president. ""Why would Republicans go with something that is uncertain rather than go with something that is certain?"" Carney said in an interview Wednesday. ""One thing is for certain: Democrats and Republicans outside of New Hampshire agree…that Chuck Morse is the guy, the guy to stop and the guy to help."" ""Of course, it's urgent, because the election is next week, and it's 140 hours away,"" he added when asked about the flurry of activity around the primary. ""There's only so much time left."" The late jockeying is also taking place over the context of the overall fight for the Senate, which is currently split 50-50 -- meaning any one race can decide party control. ""It's the 51st vote in the Senate,"" Carney said. ""So, I think it is important to the whole country, not just New Hampshire."" Yet, even if Bolduc's detractors are successful in dragging an alternative over the finish line, the GOP nominee could face headwinds trying to unite a divided Republican Party. While the candidates' stances do not fit into neat ideological lines, the brutal campaign and its related coverage have often cast Bolduc as aligned with Trump's flank of the GOP and Morse as more of a moderate. Bridging that gap would be crucial for either candidate, though they only have a short runway to do so between the primary and Election Day in November. ""Whoever the Republican nominee is, they've got their work cut out for them because they only have a month and a couple of weeks…before the general election. So, they've got to sprint between the 13th and the general election, to pivot the campaign,"" said Andrew Smith, the director of the University of New Hampshire's Survey Center. ""Trump and his supporters, as we've seen in other places, are more than willing to cut off their nose to spite their face if they don't get their particular candidate nominated,"" he said. ""And I think there may be moderate Republicans that are willing to do the same thing in the case of Don Bolduc.""",16
2022-09-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-pushes-efforts-end-cancer-60th-anniversary-jfks/story?id=89755264,Biden pushes efforts to end cancer on 60th anniversary of JFK's 'moonshot' speech,"On the 60th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's famous moonshot speech, President Joe Biden on Monday outlined a new ""American Moonshot"" aimed at eradicating cancer ""as we know it."" ""President Kennedy set a goal to win the space race against Russia and advance science and technology for all humanity,"" Biden said during a speech at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston. ""And when he said that goal, he established a national purpose that could rally the American people and the common cause, and he succeeded. Now in our time, on the 60th anniversary of his clarion call, we face another inflection point."" After being introduced by Kennedy's daughter, U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy, Biden pointed to the parallels between his efforts and those of JFK, who, at the time, declared the America's objective to put a man on the moon -- noting that both plans were unprecedented for their times. ""I believe ... the same national purpose will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills to end cancer as we know it. And even cure cancers once and for all,"" he said. The cause is a personal one for Biden, who launched the moonshot originally as vice president just months after his son, Beau, died from glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer, in 2015. Biden reiterated the importance of this cancer moonshot to him, saying it was one of the reasons he ran for president in 2020. ""As president of the United States Senate, I presided over the overwhelming bipartisan vote and watched my friend Mitch McConnell name the cancer provisions in that bill after my son Beau who had lost his life to that disease just months earlier. And when we left office, Jill and I knew we had to keep going through, keep it up. So, we initiated the Biden cancer initiative. We focused on turning the moonshot into a movement, not just a shot, a movement,"" Biden said. In the years since President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act in 1971, ""enormous progress"" has been made in the nation's fight against cancer, Biden said, adding that progress has increased at a faster pace in recent years, with the death rate due to cancer falling more than 25% over the last 25 years. Cancer, however, remains the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. after heart disease. Earlier this year, Biden relaunched the cancer moonshot initiative, unveiling his goals of cutting cancer deaths in half in the next 25 years, and on Monday he pointed to how technology can be used to further efforts to find a cure. ""Today, I'm setting a long term goal for the cancer moonshot to rally America, an ingenuity that we can engage like we did to reach the moon that actually cures cancers -- not all cancer -- cancer -- cures cancer once and for all. "" Biden said. Biden also introduced Dr. Renee Wegrzyn -- his pick for the first Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), a program Biden campaigned on creating to help drive research to cure diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's and Diabetes, and one he views as critical to the success of the moonshot. ""Scientists are exploring whether mRNA vaccine technology that brought us safe and effective COVID 19 vaccines could be used to stop cancer cells when they first arrive to target the right treatments,"" Biden said. Looking ahead, Biden asked the audience to imagine what was possible. ""Imagine the possibilities. Vaccines that could prevent cancer, like there is for HPV. Imagine molecular zip codes that could deliver drugs and gene therapy precisely to the right tissues. Imagine simple blood test during an annual physical that can detect cancer early with a chance of cure best. Imagine getting a simple shot instead of grueling chemo, or getting a pill follicle pharmacy instead of invasive treatments and long hospital stays,"" he said. But Biden warned that the federal effort and investments would not be enough to cure cancer. ""We need everyone to get the game. That's why I'm also calling on the science and medical communities to bring the boldest thinking to this fight. I'm calling on the private sector to develop and test new treatments. Make drugs more affordable, share more data, and knowledge that can inform the public and benefit every company's research,"" he said. ""And I'm respectfully calling on people living with cancer and caregivers and families to keep sharing their experience and pushing for progress,"" Biden said, urging them to share their ideas with the administration as well."" Earlier, the White House said Biden would not be seeking additional funding from Congress for what is bound to be an costly effort.

2022-09-13,https://abcnews.go.com/US/hero-county-worker-journalist-allegedly-killed-boss/story?id=89807706,"'He was our hero,' county worker says of journalist her former boss allegedly killed","A co-worker of the Nevada county official charged with murder in the stabbing death of a journalist investigating turmoil in his office called the reporter a ""hero"" to her and her colleagues. Rita Reid spoke out in an interview aired Tuesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" praising slain journalist Jeff German of the Las Vegas Review-Journal for exposing the hostile work environment she said she and her colleagues endured under the leadership of Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles, who is now charged with murder in German's death. ""His death was absolutely devastating to myself and my coworkers, the people that he advocated for,"" Reid said of German. ""He was our hero."" German, 69, was found fatally stabbed outside his home Sept. 3, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Telles blamed German's reporting for ruining his career in politics and his marriage, prosecutors said. Reid said that when she learned that German had been killed, ""My first thought was Robert Telles."" She alleged that Telles was responsible for the hostile work environment in her office that German exposed. ""He came into my office several times in a rage,"" Reid alleged of Telles. ""You saw stress every day in multiple employees and it just became worse and worse."" She said she eventually became so appalled by Telles' alleged behavior, that she and her co-workers approached German and blew the whistle on Telles. “So, we decided that we would go public. We would try to talk to a journalist here in our community and see if somebody felt it was worthy of reporting,"" Reid said. ""I guess maybe I felt there might be an encounter one day or an altercation, a verbal altercation. But I could never have imagined this."" Reid worked under Telles as an assistant public administrator and ran against him in the June Democratic primary, beating the embattled incumbent. Telles' defeat followed an investigation by German in the Review-Journal that exposed turmoil in his office and accusations of bullying, retaliation and an ""inappropriate relationship"" between Telles and a staffer. Telles denied fostering a toxic work environment and claimed allegations that he was having an inappropriate relationship with an employee were not true. ""He (German) lost his life to make our office, our department, our government agency a better place and to provide better service for our community,"" Reid said on ""GMA."" ""So, I mean we can never thank him enough."" The 45-year-old Telles, who had been the Clark County Public Administrator since 2018, was formally charged on Monday with murder with a deadly weapon where the victim is 60 years of age or older. Telles made a brief appearance in court Tuesday morning handcuffed and wearing jail-issued clothes. Judge William Jansen granted a motion filed by Telles' attorney, Travis Shetler, to postpone the arraignment until Sept. 20. Telles has yet to enter a plea to the charges. His attorney did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. In a criminal complaint, prosecutors alleged German's killing was ""wilful, deliberate and premeditated."" Telles was arrested Wednesday following a SWAT operation at his home, officials said, after DNA evidence was found under German's fingernails that linked him to the homicide, prosecutors said. A judge ordered that Telles be held without bail in Clark County Jail after noting the steps Telles allegedly took to cover up his crimes, including casing German's neighborhood for more than an hour, leaving his cellphone at home and dressing in disguise. Police said the day before German's death, Telles was seen approaching German's home, where he allegedly had an altercation with him. On the day of the slaying, Telles was dressed in disguise, which police described him as wearing a straw hat and reflective vest. Telles allegedly stabbed the reporter seven times before fleeing, prosecutors said. Police focused on Telles because of his anger over stories written by German, officials said during a press conference Thursday. Then they found a vehicle outside Telles' home that matched the suspect's vehicle. In an article published in May in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, German wrote: ""The Clark County Public Administrator’s office has been mired in turmoil and internal dissension over the past two years, with allegations of emotional stress, bullying and favoritism leading to secret videotaping of the boss and a co-worker outside the office."" He reported that ""a half-dozen current and former employees interviewed by the Review-Journal are alleging the hostile work environment was fueled by the elected administrator of the office, Robert Telles, carrying on an 'inappropriate relationship' with a staffer that has harmed the office’s ability to deal with the public in overseeing the estates of those who have died.""

2022-09-14,https://abcnews.go.com/US/potential-rail-strike-ripple-us-economy-supply-chain/story?id=89887466,"Potential rail strike could have 'significant detrimental effects,' supply chain expert says","As freight railroads and their unions continue to feel pressure from the White House, businesses and other stakeholders to reach an agreement before a potential strike, economic experts say the possible work stoppage will wreak havoc on businesses and consumers. Two labor unions representing 57,000 engineers and conductors, who make up roughly half of all rail workers, are seeking a better time-off policy and contend that rail companies are trying to force a deal without meeting their requests. The National Carriers’ Conference Committee, which represents the nation’s freight railroads in national collective bargaining, said the rail companies offered a fair contract that includes a significant wage increase. ABC News Live spoke with Abe Eshkenazi, the CEO of the Association for Supply Chain Management, or ASCM, about the potential ramifications of a strike on all aspects of the economy. ABC NEWS LIVE: How vital are our railroad tracks to our supply chain? ABE ESHKENAZI: Well, you're talking about the most vital activities within logistics and transportation. By any measure, 30 to 40% of our goods are moved by rail. So we're talking about a significant amount of movement of goods and services from raw materials to finished goods. In almost every aspect, the supply chain relies on the rails from the ports to our consumers, and the warehouses. This is a vital link in our logistics and warehousing system. ABC NEWS LIVE: President Biden was briefed on the situation this morning. What do the railroad workers want in this case and can this strike be averted? ESHKENAZI: I think the hope from every perspective is that we are able to reach an agreement. I think there has been some discussion about some legislative action, if it is not if we don't see an agreement. I think the impact that it's having [is] on the workers. There are significant issues that they have not only in terms of their hours of work, [and] away from all of their work conditions. There obviously are a number of issues that need to be addressed, but the criticality of the logistics and the rail system can't be underestimated if we do have a work stoppage or any disruption. ABC NEWS LIVE: Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh cut his Europe trip short to try and stave off this strike. What's the worst-case scenario for our supply chain if this does go forward? ESHKENAZI: Well, you're talking significant detrimental effects. We're already facing a number of shortages. We've got congestion at the ports. You've got trucking issues. We have warehouse capacity issues. Our demand and our supply are not balanced right now. So having a rail disruption is going to impact everything from the raw materials to the manufacturing and obviously to the consumer and the availability of goods down the stream here. This is a global supply chain. Any disruption, as we've seen in the past, is going to have a collateral effect. Whether we're talking about weather-related issues or the conflict in Ukraine. We're seeing collateral impact from these disruptions on almost every aspect of the supply chain. We're seeing it in inflationary cost as well as labor issues, trying to find workers as well. ABC NEWS LIVE: Amtrak has already canceled some long distance routes and companies have moved to suspend hazardous shipments in case they get stranded mid-route. Is our supply chain going to take a hit now regardless of whether or not there's actually a strike? ESHKENAZI: Well, we're already seeing companies take some action and mitigate risk. There is a challenge that supply chain professionals need to address. And that's a force coming, disruption from the rails so that, unfortunately, there are very few alternatives to the rail volume and the costs that are associated with it. So there really aren't a whole lot of alternative transportation modes that we can rely on. That disruption on the rails is going to have a dramatic effect on almost every aspect of our economy. ABC NEWS LIVE: And I understand that Congress has the ability to step in if a strike does happen. Do you think that the government ultimately will have to get involved? ESHKENAZI: I don't see how it doesn't happen for a variety of reasons. No. 1, our economy depends on efficient rail and logistics. Secondly, we're coming into the November elections. I don't think that anybody in the legislature wants to address a rail stoppage or a work stoppage right now if we can avert it. Obviously, we're already dealing with a lot of impact from the pandemic and a lot of the disruptions in our supply chain, whether from [the] China shutdown or weather-related issues. I'm not sure that we're prepared for a significant disruption in our rail systems. Supply chain professionals need and work with accurate data and reliable systems. Removing this mode or modality of transportation would have significant and detrimental effects to almost every aspect of our supply chain.",7
2022-09-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/don-bolduc-projected-win-hampshire-gop-senate-primary/story?id=89857821,Don Bolduc projected to win New Hampshire GOP Senate primary,"ABC News reports that retired Army Brigadier Gen. Don Bolduc is projected to win the Republican nomination in New Hampshire's Senate race, handing a victory to a controversial candidate in one the nation's marquee midterm contests. Bolduc defeated a field including state Senate President Chuck Morse. With 87% of the vote in, Bolduc led the field with 37% of the vote, compared with 36% for Morse. Bolduc hailed his win, saying his victory helped put Republicans ""one step closer towards defeating"" first-term Democrat Maggie Hassan, one of the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents. Morse, meanwhile, tweeted overnight that ""It’s been a long night & we’ve come up short"" and said he ""called and wished all the best"" to Bolduc. Bolduc's primary win marks a defeat for establishment Republicans in New Hampshire and Washington, D.C., seeking to elevate Morse, whom they viewed as a more electable candidate to put up against Hassan. Morse boasted that he'd look to work across the aisle while Bolduc sparked worries over a years-long reputation of courting controversy. Among other things, Bolduc called popular Republican Gov. Chris Sununu a ""Chinese Communist sympathizer,"" said U.S. forces should ""get in there on the ground"" in Ukraine, advocated for the repeal of the 17th Amendment codifying direct popular election of U.S. senators and accused then-President Donald Trump of rigging the 2020 Senate primary that Bolduc lost by endorsing an opponent. Neither Bolduc nor Morse has as beefy a war chest as Hassan, though Bolduc's fundraising has been particularly anemic. Amid rising concern over Bolduc's polling lead late into the primary race, Republicans in Washington and Concord mobilized to blunt his momentum. White Mountain PAC, a political group with reported ties to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., dumped millions into an ad buy highlighting Bolduc's ""crazy ideas."" Sununu, who routinely wins reelection by yawning margins, also endorsed Morse, blasting Bolduc as a ""conspiracy-theory type"" candidate who would struggle to unseat Hassan. Some Democrats, meanwhile, sought to undercut Morse, seemingly in the belief that elevating Bolduc would net them a more beatable foe.

But after his high-profile trip to Russia amid efforts to secure the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan, members of the Biden administration are now urging Richardson to take a back seat. ""Our message is that private citizens should not be in Moscow at all right now and that private citizens cannot negotiate on behalf of the United States government,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday. But Richardson, a former New Mexico governor and energy secretary who now heads up an organization aimed at freeing Americans considered to be wrongfully held abroad, is not exactly an average citizen. When his plans to travel to Russia were first reported in July, Kirby said U.S. officials were in ""constant communication"" with him. Richardson, for his part, told ABC News in August that he was ""optimistic"" about both Griner and Whelan, calling himself a ""catalyst"": ""I've been talking to the Russians. I talked to the White House."" But the State Department's receptiveness to help from outside the administration has chilled in recent weeks. Spokesperson Ned Price said Wednesday that anything other than government-to-government communication could be counterproductive. ""Our concern is that anything other than negotiating further through the established channel is likely to hinder the efforts that we have undertaken to see the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner,"" he said. However, when Richardson first became involved in Griner's case at the behest of her family in May, Price struck a different chord. ""We welcome all of those efforts that are coordinated closely with us that might help to seek the safe release of any American who's unjustly detained around the world,"" he said then. Asked about the apparent shift, Price denied there had been a change in the government's approach, saying the channel through which the Kremlin and Washington are currently communicating was established back in 2021 when President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Geneva. It's unclear if the State Department was informed of Richardson's latest travel plans in advance, but Price said the trip was not coordinated through the U.S. embassy in Moscow. ABC News independently confirmed Richardson's visit to Russia and reached out to the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, but a spokesperson declined to comment or answer questions. ""Of course, families are perfectly free to engage in to consult with outside voices, with outside entities,"" Price said Wednesday. ""But again, we want to make sure that any outside effort is fully and transparently coordinated with us and, in this case, we believe that any efforts that fall outside of that officially designated channel have the potential to complicate what is already an extraordinarily complicated challenge."" The shifting tone from members of the administration comes as its push to free Griner and Whelan plods along at a slow -- but not atypical -- pace. In late July, Secretary of State Antony Blinken took the rare step of announcing that the U.S. had put forth what he called a ""substantial proposal"" aimed at securing the release of both prisoners. Sources later confirmed it was a proposal for a prisoner swap involving so-called ""merchant of death"" Viktor Bout, a convicted arms trafficker who is currently serving out a 25-year sentence in an Illinois penitentiary. Although officials within the department say direct engagement between the U.S. and Russia has continued on a regular basis since then, there is scant evidence that an agreement is any closer. Some, including Richardson, say they believe Moscow will require parity for an exchange, giving the White House the difficult task of identifying another prisoner that is tolerable to release but still a valuable enough asset for Moscow to go through with the trade. Still, other sources have expressed doubt that Moscow is approaching the talks in good faith and question whether the Kremlin is truly willing to cut a deal in the near-term. Richardson, who has carried out diplomatic missions in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and North Korea, played a role in freeing another former U.S. Marine detained in Russia: Trevor Reed. He was released as part of a prisoner exchange in April. The administration's position against outside help has sparked backlash from some advocates, who believe other avenues may yield results. Griner, who pleaded guilty to drug charges in early July -- though she said she had only inadvertently brought illegal hashish oil into Russia -- has been detained since Feb. 17. She was sentenced to nine years behind bars but is currently appealing the ruling. The Phoenix Mercury center and Olympic gold medalist's wife, Cherelle Griner, said in July that she would ""not be quiet anymore"" and publicly urged the government to do everything in its power to help Griner. Whelan has been detained in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that U.S. officials have called ""trumped up."" His brother told ABC News the Whelan family is supportive of Richardson's involvement in the case. ABC News' Patrick Reevell and Cindy Smith contributed to this report.",20
2022-09-16,https://abcnews.go.com/International/top-putin-ally-appears-recruit-russian-prisoners-fight/story?id=89983114,Top Putin ally appears to recruit Russian prisoners to fight in Ukraine,"A video has emerged appearing to show a top ally of Vladimir Putin personally recruiting alleged Russian prisoners to fight in Ukraine and offering them pardons to do so. Yevgeny Prigozhin, who runs Wagner, a private military company heavily engaged in Ukraine, is purportedly seen speaking to a group of men at a Russian prison about joining its forces in Ukraine. A company owned by Prigozhin issued a sarcastic message appearing to confirm it is him in the footage. In the video circulating online, a man who appears to closely resemble Prigozhin is seen addressing a crowd of dozens of inmates in the yard of a prison camp. The man in the video promises the prisoners will receive a pardon of their sentences in return for joining Wagner and fighting in Ukraine for six months. ""Who do we need? We only need assault infantry, 60% of my guys are that,"" the man seen in the video tells the inmates. ""After half a year, you go home, having got a pardon."" Prigozhin, often nicknamed ""Putin's Chef"" because of a catering company he operates, appears to warn the group that if they sign up and refuse to fight, they would be seen as a deserter and be killed. ""The first sin is desertion. No one falls back, no one surrenders as a prisoner,"" the man seen in the video says. ""Those who arrive and on the first day say, 'I shouldn't be here,' we mark as a deserter and next, it's the firing squad."" In addition to being heavily involved in the fighting in Ukraine, Wagner also ran the Internet Research Agency that conducted a disinformation campaign aimed at interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Department of Justice charged Prigozhin over the agency's campaign to meddle in the election with propaganda and disinformation. In March, the U.S. also sanctioned Prigozhin in response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. In the video, the man tells the group he is mainly looking for men between the ages of 22 and 50, but that the key criteria is physical strength. They look closely at those with drug and sexual violence convictions, warning that there is no tolerance for looting or sex with local people, ""women, local flora, fauna, men,"" the man in the video says. The man seen in the video also tells the prisoners he will personally interview those wanting to sign up for five minutes before they undergo 2-3 hours of more questioning to see if they are suitable. The press service for Prigozhin's catering company, Concord, appeared to confirm it was him in the video. In a written response posted on its VKontakte, or VK -- Russian social media service -- page, it wrote: ""We really can confirm that the person in the video is miraculously similar to Evgeny Viktorovich [Prigozhin]. Judging by his rhetoric, he is in someway dealing with questions of the realisation of the Special Operation and, it looks like, it's going successfully for him,"" it wrote, referring to the term the Kremlin uses for the invasion. There have been widespread reports of Russia recruiting prisoners to fill a worsening manpower shortage for its forces following severe losses since the country invaded Ukraine in February. Just this week, Ukrainian forces made a major breakthrough in the Kharkiv region, capturing strategically important cities, according to Ukrainian officials and military sources. Ukrainian troops advanced 70 kilometers (43 miles) in less than a week, resulting in part of Russia's front-line collapse in Ukraine's northeast, with large numbers of Russian troops forced to retreat. Russia is running short on troops because Putin has refused to call a general mobilization or put the country on a war footing, worried about possible domestic unrest. Wagner has previously been used in global conflicts, including in Ukraine, when the Kremlin has sought a veneer of deniability. Wagner troops have been documented fighting in Syria, as well as several African countries, including Libya and the Central African Republic, and have been accused on numerous occasions of committing war crimes. In the current Ukraine war, they have become crucial shock troops, according to Western and Ukrainian officials, as well as Russian military journalists on the ground, that have been used to try to take ground in Donbas. The man seen in the video -- purportedly Prigozhin -- tells the prisoners it's a ""hard war"" in Ukraine, worse than in Chechnya or Afghanistan, claiming that he is using more than twice the amount of ammunition fired in the battle of Stalingrad in World War II. He claims to have large amounts of military hardware, including ""aircraft"" and artillery.",27
2022-09-17,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/raymond-dearie-special-master-reviewing-mar-lago-documents/story?id=90059554,"What to know about Raymond Dearie, the special master reviewing Mar-a-Lago documents","Judge Aileen Cannon has appointed an independent arbiter to review documents seized from former President Donald Trump's Florida residence. Raymond Dearie, a senior district judge for the Eastern District of New York, has been named the ""special master"" in the case to sift through all of the materials taken by federal agents during the Aug. 8 raid at Mar-a-Lago, including the roughly 100 documents bearing classification markings. Dearie was one of the two candidates Trump's legal team proposed to serve as special master. The Department of Justice, which also submitted two names for consideration to Judge Cannon, had deemed Dearie was an adequate choice, writing he and their picks all had ""substantial judicial experience."" But the DOJ has said overall that a special master appointment to review executive privilege claims was unnecessary and would delay the government's review, potentially causing ""irreparable harm to our national security and intelligence interests."" The DOJ on Friday appealed to the 11th Circuit for a partial stay on Cannon's order, which halted the government's ability to use the classified documents and other materials seized in its ongoing criminal investigation. The DOJ is asking the appeals court to permit it to continue working with the classified records and not disclose them for review by the special master. Here's what to know about Dearie and the role he'll be playing in the high-profile Trump investigation. Dearie, 78, started his career in private practice after graduating from St. John's University School of Law in 1969. He then served in the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York for six years as chief of the appeals division. He was also the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York before being tapped by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 to serve on the federal bench. He was the chief judge of the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of New York for four years before assuming senior status in 2011. Dearie also served on the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA court, which considers applications from the government for the collection of electronic surveillance or physical searches. During his time on the FISA court, Dearie approved of a warrant for the DOJ and FBI to surveil Carter Page -- a former campaign aide for Trump -- during special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation after the 2016 election. The FBI and DOJ's actions to obtain the warrants were heavily criticized by Trump and his Republican allies. Dearie will be reviewing the seized materials from Mar-a-Lago for any personal items and will examine documents for certain types of privileges, namely attorney-client and executive privilege, that Trump's team claims should not be used in the DOJ probe. Trump's legal team has never asserted executive privilege over any specific documents in any of the court proceedings since the search. Judge Cannon said the special master will prioritize reviewing the classified documents, and requested they submit interim reports and recommendations ""as appropriate."" Dearie also had 10 days after the Sept. 15 order to consult with lawyers for both the DOJ and Trump's team and then provide Judge Cannon with a timeline for the review. The DOJ argued in court the special master wasn't needed because a ""filter team"" has already completed its review of material possibly covered by attorney-client privilege. The federal agency also rejected Trump's claims of executive privilege -- a tool presidents possess to shield communications from courts or Congress -- given he's no longer in office and said President Joe Biden's decision not to invoke executive privilege supersedes Trump's as a former president. The judge has urged Dearie to complete his work by Nov. 30 to finish his work, a timeline several weeks longer than the DOJ wanted. Trump is 100% responsible for ""the professional fees and expenses of the Special Master and any professionals, support staff, and expert consultants engaged at the Special Master's request,"" Cannon ruled.",11
2022-09-17,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-meet-griner-whelan-families/story?id=89968771,"President Biden meets with Griner, Whelan families","President Joe Biden met Friday at the White House with the families of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, two American citizens who remain detained in Russia. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre offered a readout of President Biden's meeting with Cherelle Griner and Elizabeth Whelan, saying Biden ""appreciated the opportunity to learn more about Brittney and Paul from those who love them most, and acknowledged that every minute they are being held is a minute too long."" ""The President held the meetings to reiterate his continued commitment to working through all available avenues to bring Brittney and Paul home safely. He asked after the wellbeing of Elizabeth and Cherelle and their respective families during this painful time,"" Jean-Pierre said in the statement. ""We all admire the courage of the Whelan and Griner families in the face of these unimaginable circumstances, and we remain committed to reuniting them with their loved ones,"" she added. The Biden administration said in July that it had made a ""substantial proposal"" to Russia to have Griner and Whelan returned to the U.S. but Jean-Pierre said no breakthroughs were expected at Biden's meeting. ""So, while I would love to say that the purpose of this meeting is to inform the families that the Russians have accepted our offer, and we are bringing their loved ones home, that is not what we're seeing in these negotiations at this time,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""Look, as we have said, the Russians should accept our offer. They should accept our offer today. We will keep working diligently until the day we get to share that good news,"" she added. Still Jean-Pierre said Biden wanted to let the families know they remain ""front of mind"" for the administration. ""So one of the things that the president wanted to -- to make clear is and one of the reasons he's -- he is meeting with families is that he wanted to let them know that they remain front of mind and that his team is working on this every day on making sure that Brittney and Paul return home safely. One family member was already scheduled to be in town and the president wanted to meet with both of the families on the same day,"" Jean-Pierre said. Griner, the famous WNBA player, was arrested in February on drug charges and sentences to nine years in prison. Whelan, a corporate security executive, is currently serving a 16-year sentence for espionage charges that his family says are trumped up. The U.S. declared both to be wrongfully detained, a legal clarification that mobilizes federal resources to free Americans imprisoned abroad. The talks between Washington and Moscow have been complicated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There have been few public signs of progress since Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a rare announcement in late July, revealed the U.S. had made the ""substantial proposal"" to secure the release of both Americans. Sources told ABC News that offer included a prisoner swap that would exchange Viktor Bout -- a convicted Russian arms dealer currently serving a 25-year sentence in a federal penitentiary in Illinois -- for Griner and Whelan. While U.S. officials say direct communication with the Kremlin continues at a regular clip, they acknowledge the slow pace is frustrating. ""Why this process has taken so long is a better question for Moscow,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday. ""I wouldn't characterize the process as stalled, he said. ""It certainly hasn't moved with the speed we would like."" Some observers speculate Russia will demand parity, demanding two prisoners for the American detainees. Others within the State Department have questioned whether the Kremlin is negotiating in good faith and genuinely interested in reaching an agreement. As talks continue behind the scenes, the Biden administration has bristled at any outside influence. After former New Mexico governor and hostage negotiator Bill Richardson traveled to Moscow this week, officials warned such interference could jeopardize the delicate diplomacy underway. ""Our message is that private citizens should not be in Moscow at all right now and that private citizens cannot negotiate on behalf of the United States government,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday. Richardson became involved in Griner's case at her family's request back in May and over many years has been involved in multiple successful efforts to free detained Americans. ""Of course, families are perfectly free to engage in to consult with outside voices, with outside entities,"" Price said Wednesday. ""But again, we want to make sure that any outside effort is fully and transparently coordinated with us."" Price said the U.S. embassy is Moscow had not been involved in Richardson's trip.

""It's tortures, rapes, killings. War crimes of a massive proportions,"" Markarova claimed in an interview with ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. ""That's why we need to liberate the whole territory of Ukraine as soon as possible because clearly Russians are targeting all Ukrainians. Whole families. Children. So, there is no war logic in all of this. It's simply terrorizing and committing genocide against Ukrainians."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address on Thursday that a mass grave was found in the recently recaptured territory of Izyum. Over 400 bodies could be buried in the site, according to Ukrainian officials. (Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, despite evidence otherwise.) ""Do you have a handle in terms of those mass graves of who the victims are?"" Karl asked Markarova on Sunday. ""We already have teams of investigators there,"" she replied, adding that the country has been preparing national and international criminal cases against Russia -- an effort the U.S. is assisting with, Markarova said. ""The majority of [the victims], of course, Ukrainians,"" Markarova told Karl, calling the mass grave's discovery ""horrifying."" ""Some of them are families, like everyone in the family is killed for no reason,"" she said, noting that ""the majority of them ... [showed] clear signs of torture."" This month, Ukraine launched a rapidly successful counteroffensive to recapture territories occupied by Russia. During an address Wednesday evening, Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces advanced 110 kilometers in five days of combat, taking back large swaths of the east. Karl noted the operation was undertaken ""with a relatively small number of armed forces."" ""Do you have the manpower to hold this territory and to continue to push the Russians back?"" he asked. Markarova acknowledged her country's military weaknesses but said their resistance extended beyond troops alone. ""In general, our force is much slower than Russian force. But the reason why they can't hold the ground and we can retake it, and we will retake it, is because they are not only fighting with our brave president and our armed forces, they are fighting with all Ukrainians,"" she said. ""So all 40 million of Ukrainians are fighting for our loved ones and homes."" ""All of them were waiting for liberation,"" she said. The U.S. this week provided another $675 million in aid to Ukraine for ammunition, missiles and training. Since January, the U.S. has given some $13.5 billion in aid. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, says his army is regrouping in a war he has described as preserving his country's security. The White House has publicly warned him against certain kinds of retaliation. In an interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" President Joe Biden said that if Putin were to use chemical weapons against Ukraine, ""You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II."" Citing that ""stern warning"" from Biden, Karl asked Markarova about the Ukrainian military push, saying, ""What do you worry that Russia will do in response?"" ""For all years that Putin is in power, they tried to scare the world and they tried to get all of us thinking what he will do next,"" Markarova said. ""We just have to continue on pushing, liberating Ukraine. We just have to clearly and all together say to Putin, and to all Russians who support this, that it's not OK in the 21st century to attack a peaceful neighboring country."" ""Let's not worry about what Putin thinks he should do,"" she added. ""Let's all stay the course, provide more support to Ukraine because it's going to be much cheaper and better for the democratic world to win this war while it's still in Ukraine.""",7
2022-09-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/voters-abortion-inflation-key-issues-swing-state-residents/story?id=89827073,"Voters say abortion, inflation among their key issues: Swing-state residents speak out on their views","This is part of an ongoing series from ABC News reporting in battleground states across the country, as voters share their personal views on major issues. Voters have said they have some key topics on their minds in the months before November's midterms -- issues like the economy and high inflation, gun violence and abortion access after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. ABC News recently spoke with some voters in various battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Texas, for their personal views. The voters' perspectives are not conclusive but do offer a window into individual opinions on subjects that ABC News/Ipsos polling shows is of importance ahead of the election. Republicans hope to seize on President Joe Biden's general unpopularity and low marks on the economy. Democrats -- especially after Roe and a string of economic and social spending wins in Congress -- have focused on the GOP's position on banning abortion while defending their record while in power. An inflation report released last week sent stocks tumbling as it showed still-high prices -- more than 8% growth year-over-year -- and all but ensured the Federal Reserve would consider again hiking the interest rate to cool demand, which has been a months-long problem that the White House insists is a major priority. Voters said that they have felt the effects of inflation on their wallets. ""A loaf of bread is like $1.50 more. I'm definitely noticing prices at the gas, but it's not only the gas -- it's the food. And we need food. We need gas, and we are wondering when is this going to let up?"" said Arizona resident Karla Terry. Terry said that she blames Congress for the high prices. ""It's coming from the top and trickling down to the bottom,"" she said. ""But what can we do but go to the pump and pay for gas, go to the store and pay for bread? We don't have a choice. We're rolling with the punches."" Miami resident Daniel Demillais said that he blames President Biden and Democratic leadership. ""We moved from the incredibly high cost, incredibly badly run state of California to the great state of Florida where we can at least still live decently thanks to the great [Gov.] Ron DeSantis and the Republican party,"" said Demillais. Stock trader Jorge Martinez lives with his fiancé in Miami and said that inflation is affecting what he buys, but his biggest problem is with rent. ""I think it's gone up like $1,000 in one year,"" he said. ""I normally buy like thin sliced chicken breast, but now I'm buying like straight-up whole chickens and just kind of spending an hour at home just cutting them on my own cause I'm not gonna pay an extra $15,"" Martinez said. Across the Gulf in Texas, one couple said that they were shopping with their parents at different stores to keep costs low. ""We are still backed up from all of the things that we've seen from all the delays in 2020. That didn't just fix magically because we are two years out,"" Katy Forbes said, referring to the COVID-19 pandemic that experts say has been one major factor in inflation, along with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other developments. ""We stopped house-hunting,"" said Forbes' partner, Chris Wyant. That puts them in something of a bind. ""We just continue to rent while our rent just increases,"" Forbes said. Echoing what ABC News/Ipsos polling has showed, some voters said that the reversal of Roe by the Supreme Court, allowing individual states to ban abortion, impacted their choices. Gwenda Gorman, a Diné woman who works for the intertribal council of Arizona, said she had a difficult time putting her feelings about abortion into words. ""[Navajo Nation citizens] consider all our children as a gift from a creator,"" said Gorman. ""It's really hard to say how people feel about that, especially depending on who you talk to you."" Others did not share Gorman's struggle on the topic. ""How can somebody be 100% pro-life?"" said Ohio farm owner Deb Boyer. ""They don't care if a child is raped."" ""Democrats are on the right side of the issue this year. I think the proposals coming out of the other side are a lot more extreme -- and I think that our state is a lot more moderate,"" said Phoenix resident Ginger Sykes-Torres. Some voters wanted to talk less about the 2022 candidates than about 2024 -- and a potential presidential candidate: Donald Trump. ""I don't think that any presidential election has ever been fair,"" said 19-year-old Ohio State University student Kendall Mungo. ""The Electoral College is bull----."" Mungo said that she feels like the nation is more divided than ever before. One of the reasons some feel that division is the FBI raid of Trump's residence at Mar-A-Lago over what the government says were highly classified and sensitive documents that were improperly stored. Trump supporter Jennifer Sledge, from Queens, insisted that she became a supporter even though she did not vote for him in the last election because she ""saw the tactics that the left would use."" Other voters like Susan Connors, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, said that she does not know why Trump is not behind bars. (He denies wrongdoing.) ""My husband used to be the mayor of Scranton,"" Connors told ABC. ""I said, 'If you ever did that, you've probably already been in jail.'""

2022-09-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-comments-american-hostage-afghanistan-released-prisoner-swap/story?id=90152878,Biden comments on American hostage in Afghanistan released in prisoner swap,"Mark Frerichs -- the last-known American hostage being held by the Taliban -- has been released in a prisoner exchange, President Joe Biden confirmed in a statement on Monday. ""His release is the culmination of years of tireless work by dedicated public servants across our government and other partner governments, and I want to thank them for all that effort,"" Biden said. Frerichs was in Doha, Qatar, and in the care of the U.S. government, according to senior administration officials, who noted that that after an initial assessment he appeared to be in ""stable health"" and would be offered a ""range of support"" to acclimate back to regular life. The Taliban first confirmed at a press conference in Kabul on Monday that Frerichs, from Lombard, Illinois, was released in a prisoner swap for a senior Taliban detainee and notorious drug lord, Bashir Noorzai. The senior administration officials said Noorzai had been held in a federal prison in the United States but not at Guantanamo Bay as had been reported. Despite Noorzai's history as a prolific drug trafficker, the officials said they had consulted experts who assured them his return to Afghanistan would not pose an increased threat to Americans or significantly impact the country's drug trade. Still, Biden acknowledged, ""Bringing the negotiations that led to Mark's freedom to a successful resolution required difficult decisions, which I did not take lightly."" The officials confirmed Frerichs' freedom was the result of ""months of tough negotiations"" with the Taliban, during which it became apparent that the release of Noorzai was ""the key"" to securing his safe return. The decision was made to authorize Noorzai's release in June, they said, but it took time to work out the details of the exchange and once they were confident they had found a narrow window where they could carry out the swap, they moved ""extraordinarily quickly."" Frerichs, a 60-year-old U.S. Navy veteran and contractor who had been ""in Afghanistan for over a decade working on a variety of civil engineering projects,"" was abducted in Kabul in January 2020 after being lured to what he thought was a new business meeting -- but which turned out to be a horrific ruse, family members and officials have said. He's been held in Afghanistan for 31 months. ""I spoke with Mark's sister today to share the good news and express how happy I am for Mark's family,"" Biden said. Charlene Cakora, Frerichs' sister, has long made desperate pleas to Biden on behalf of her brother's release. ""I don't think anybody can come home with their head held high until every stone has been turned,"" she told ABC in an exclusive interview in June 2021, when the U.S. military completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan and Frerichs was the man left behind. On Monday, Cakora said that despite ""some folks arguing against the deal that brought Mark home,"" her brother was back alive because ""President Biden took action."" She also credited Illinois Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin for his successful return. ""We are grateful to President Biden, Secretary Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Senators Duckworth and Durbin for their efforts to free Mark. Senator Duckworth got personally involved -- advocating tirelessly within our government to get him home,"" Cakora said. ""President Biden did what was right. He saved the life of an innocent American veteran."" ""I'm thrilled that his family, who have long been Mark's champions, will get to reunite with him. I applaud President Biden, who I spoke with personally about the need to get Mark home, for taking the steps necessary to prove that we do not leave Americans behind,"" Duckworth said in a statement on Monday. Durbin also thanked Biden and expressed relief over the fact that ""the tragic and cruel use of [Frerichs] as a hostage has finally come to an end."" During a United Nations General Assembly event on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed Frerichs' freedom, extending gratitude to the department's Special Presidental Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Roger Carstens, whom he said he was now with Frerichs in Doha. ""I want the families of Americans who are being arbitrarily detained and held hostage anywhere in the world to know that our commitment to them, bringing their loved ones home is resolute and we will relentlessly continue to focus on doing just that,"" said Blinken. ""We'll bring the same determination and focus to those efforts as we brought the efforts to bring Mark Frerichs out of captivity and home to his loved ones."" Frerichs' release comes on the heels of Biden's meetings Friday with family members of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan -- Americans detained in Russia. In his statement, Biden pledged his administration would continue to ""prioritize the safe return of all Americans who are held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad."" ""We will not stop until they are reunited with their families,"" Biden said in his statement. ""We have much more work to do in many other cases, but Mark's release demonstrates our enduring commitment. Like our work to free Americans held in Burma, Haiti, Russia, Venezuela, and elsewhere, it is our duty to do all we can to bring our people home."" Asked whether these kinds of exchanges could encourage foreign governments to hold Americans as leverage, the senior Biden officials pointed to the executive order President Biden signed in July aimed at deterring the practice and said the administration would continue to stress to the Taliban that they could not wrongfully detain Americans. For the families of those still considered wrongfully detained, the officials said Frerichs' release should be a hopeful sign: ""A very good day like today proves that success is possible.""

This diagnosis means they could die without immediate treatment. Malaika’s arm was as thick as a man’s thumb, and she weighed little more than an infant. Her body was shutting down and if left untreated she would likely die. Somalia, like Ethiopia and Kenya, is suffering a record drought which, coupled with soaring food prices and plummeting donor funding to humanitarian groups, has left more than 22 million people starving, according to the U.N.’s World Food Programme. A 2011 famine in Somalia killed nearly 260,000 people, half of them children. More than half of the country’s children face acute malnutrition, Save the Children revealed in a report released on Monday. The hunger has dislocated over a million Somalis, like Garan Hassan and her family, many of them seeking food and support in the once-small town of Baidoa. It is now a massive sprawl of thousands of tattered tents and home to 600,000 internally displaced people. Many of them, like Hassan, had to travel through territory controlled by the Islamic fundamentalist group al-Shabab to get there. Hassan told ABC News her husband died from starvation “at the beginning of the famine.” He was just 32. She is now the sole provider for little Malaika and her six siblings, which is why she told Save the Children staff she could not take Malaika to the hospital — she had to ensure that her other children were cared for. “For me the declaration of famine is irrelevant. Look around you,” Ebrima Saidy, Chief Impact Officer at Save the Children, told ABC News at the nutrition center where over 200 women with acutely malnourished children hoped to get support, “what is this if this is not famine?” A famine has not been officially declared in Somalia since 2011. Aid groups say that after the 2011 famine they had built up the infrastructure to help, but now with donor attention on the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, they lacked the funds. Famine prevention efforts by the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization go to a million Somalis, but the agency tells ABC News its projects here are only 24% funded. The next day Save the Children staff visited Garan Hassan and Malaika. They found that another of her siblings had severe acute malnutrition and both children, Malaika and her 3-year-old brother Nadifa, had multiple complications. They had suffered fevers, but were now disturbingly cold to the touch. The staff warned Hassan they could die if they didn’t get treatment. After a terrifying night, Hassan quickly agreed to go to the hospital. The children were whisked through the camp to a van that took them along streets broken by neglect and war to the Save the Children stabilization center– basically a hospital for the acutely malnourished. Hospital staff determined the children suffered from malaria, whooping cough and measles – a result of their immune systems cratering from malnutrition. During the admission process, as the two children were weighed, and measured and prodded with needles, Nadifa whimpered that he was thirsty. A few minutes later he was propped up on a nurse’s knee and given nutritional formula. Nadifa drank one cup, then two. A milk mustache formed on his face, and on his mother’s face, for the first time in a long time, a smile. HOW YOU CAN HELP Save the Children UNICEF UNICEF USA UN World Food Programme",22
2022-09-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chief-warns-colossal-global-dysfunction-urges-world-unite/story?id=90215597,UN chief warns of 'colossal global dysfunction' but urges world to unite on sweeping solutions,"As global leaders descend on New York City for the annual U.N. General Assembly, the body's Secretary-General António Guterres issued a dire warning in an opening speech on Tuesday: ""Our world is in big trouble."" ""Divides are growing deeper. Inequalities are growing wider,"" he said. ""And challenges are spreading farther."" The annual gathering of high-level diplomats in the General Assembly is the first to happen in a fully in-person format since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it's the first to take place since Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- an international conflict that has drawn deep divides between the organization's most powerful members, sparking calls for the U.N. to be reformed and prompting questions about whether it can still serve its stated purpose ""to maintain international peace and security."" Guterres alluded to these fractures in his address Tuesday, arguing they undercut the organization's work. ""We are gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction,"" he said. ""The international community is not ready or willing to tackle the big dramatic challenges of our age. These crises threaten the very future of humanity and the fate of our planet. Our world is in peril -- and paralyzed."" Overcoming those major challenges, he said, depended on cooperation. ""Let's work as one, as a coalition of the world, as united nations,"" he urged. While much of Guterres' speech was devoted to outlining the problems facing the planet, he sought to remind the audience that the U.N. was still capable of finding solutions. Large projectors in the room displayed a picture of a ship called Brave Commander that Guterres called ""an image of promise and hope."" Laden with grain and flying the blue-and-white flag of the U.N., the vessel was the first to leave Ukrainian ports since the outbreak of Russia's invasion, navigating Black Sea trade routes to bring its badly needed cargo to the Horn of Africa thanks to an agreement Guterres played a pivotal part in brokering. ""Some might call it a miracle at sea. In truth, it is multilateral diplomacy in action,"" he said, calling the dozens of ships that have followed in Brave Commander's path a testament to what can be accomplished through cooperation. But while that safe passage deal is allowing grain exports to ameliorate the global food crisis, Guterres warned there was another on the horizon due to a shortage in fertilizer -- saying that while the current problems can be chalked up to distribution issues, the world's hunger may soon be the result of not having enough to go around at all. ""Without action now, the global fertilizer shortage will quickly morph into a global food shortage,"" he said. The secretary-general then alluded to the U.N.'s next major initiative: a proposal to export Russian fertilizer components through Ukraine. ""It is essential to continue removing all remaining obstacles to the export of Russian fertilizers and their ingredients, including ammonia. These products are not subject to sanctions, and we are making progress in eliminating indirect effects,"" Guterres said. The U.N. separately says it is ""pursuing all efforts"" to maximize fertilizer output, but the clock is ticking. The body's trade negotiator advises that shortages need to be addressed in October and November before the window for the northern hemisphere's planting season closes. The secretary-general on Tuesday also spoke to the even broader-sweeping challenges of the day, and advocated for even more ambitious -- or, to some, radical -- plans to address them. ""We need action across the board. Let's have no illusions,"" he said. ""Our planet is burning,"" Guterres called not only for initiatives to address the root causes of damage to the environment but also to compensate developing countries that bear the brunt of those problems. ""Polluters must pay,"" he said. ""Today, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the 'windfall' profits of fossil fuel companies. Those funds should be re-directed in two ways: to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis, and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices."" Guterres argued that the climate crisis was fueling ""a once-in-a-generation global cost-of-living crisis"" that could only be remedied through radical change. ""Today's global financial system was created by rich countries to serve their interests. It expands and entrenches inequalities. It requires deep structural reform,"" he said. ""The divergence between developed and developing countries -- between North and South, between the privileged and the rest -- is becoming more dangerous by the day. It is at the root of the geopolitical tensions."" While President Joe Biden isn't scheduled to take part in the summit until Wednesday, Guterres' speech mentioned a number of other items that coincide with the White House's priority list. On nonproliferation, the secretary-general noted that ""a nuclear deal with Iran remains elusive."" The Biden administration, with help from the European Union, has been embroiled in months of indirect negotiations with Tehran over returning to an Obama-era nuclear pact that then-President Donald Trump scrapped in 2018. But talks appear to have stalled again. Although a high-level delegation from Iran will participate in the General Assembly, there are no planned meetings with any U.S. officials. While addressing women's rights, Guterres also hit on a domestic matter: the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The U.N. women's rights committee has previously denounced the landmark ruling which reversed the national access to abortion in the U.S., calling ""access to reproductive rights is at the core of women and girls' autonomy and ability to make their own choices about their bodies and lives, free of discrimination, violence and coercion."" More broadly, Guterres said that gender inequality is ""going backwards"" and ""women's lives are getting worse, from poverty, to choices around sexual and reproductive health, to their personal security.""",25
2022-09-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-us-defend-taiwan-chinese-invasion/story?id=90184808,"Biden says, again, that US would defend Taiwan from Chinese invasion","President Joe Biden said Sunday that the U.S. would militarily defend Taiwan if China were to attack -- reiterating, again, his support for the island as Beijing responded with disapproval. In a ""60 Minutes"" interview, Biden was asked if ""U.S. forces"" would respond to aid Taiwan against China. He said, ""If in fact there was an unprecedented attack."" He was asked again, ""So unlike Ukraine, to be clear, sir, U.S. forces -- U.S. men and women -- would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion?"" ""Yes,"" Biden said. His answer mirrors his response when another a reporter asked him a similar question during a press conference in Tokyo in May and is at least the fourth time he’s said something along these lines, appearing to go beyond the historic U.S. policy of “strategic ambiguity” about Taiwan's relationship to China, which views the island as a breakaway province despite Taiwan's separate government. The U.S is legally required to provide Taiwan with resources to defend itself but doesn’t require a U.S. military response if China were to invade. Since the '70s -- and as codified by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act -- the U.S. has acknowledged the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China while officially considering Taiwan's status as unresolved and maintaining unofficial ties with the island, which emerged as a separate faction after the Chinese civil war. At a Monday press conference in Beijing, Chinese government spokesperson Mao Ning said that China had lodged complaints with the U.S. in response to Biden's comments about Taiwan. She said China ""deplores"" and ""firmly opposes"" the president's latest statements and that China reserves the right to take all necessary measures but said the country is ""willing to do our best to strive for peaceful reunification."" In May, Biden said the ""burden"" of the U.S. ""commitment"" to defend Taiwan was ""even stronger"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier in the year. Taiwanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Joanne Ou said then that their government ""expresses sincere welcome and gratitude to President Biden and the U.S. government for reiterating its rock solid commitment to Taiwan.” A White House official insisted to ABC News at the time that Biden’s comment didn’t represent a shift because the president “reiterated our commitment … to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself.” “The president has said this before, including in Tokyo earlier this year,” the official said. “He also made clear then that our Taiwan policy hasn’t changed. That remains true.” In Tokyo, when a reporter asked Biden how the U.S. was prepared to respond if China were to invade or tried to take over Taiwan, the president first said, ""Our policy toward Taiwan has not -- Taiwan -- has not changed at all."" But the reporter followed up, asking, ""Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan, if it comes to that?"" Biden responded, ""Yes."" Asked, ""You are?"" he said, ""That's the commitment we made."" The next day, asked if the policy of ambiguity toward Taiwan was ""dead,"" Biden said, ""No."" ""The policy has not changed at all. I stated that when I made my statement yesterday,"" he said. In July, after Biden and China's leader Xi Jinping spoke, a White House official said their discussion on Taiwan was “direct” and “honest,” with Biden reaffirming the U.S. commitment to its historic position. But the official wouldn’t respond to a Chinese readout claiming that Xi said, ""Playing with fire will set yourself on fire.” “President Xi used similar language in the conversation that the two leaders had back in November, but you know, I'm not going to get into parsing the various metaphors that the PRC regularly tends to use on these issues,” the administration official said.

2022-09-21,https://abcnews.go.com/US/deep-sea-mining-solution-tech-worlds-mineral-demand/story?id=88755205,"Deep sea mining, solution to tech world's mineral demand or potential ecological disaster?","It's the size of the continental U.S., more than 10,000 feet deep and its recently become the center point in the debate over what's the best way to build green products without making the environment worse off. There is still much that is unknown about the Clarion-Clipperton Zone off Mexico's Pacific coast, but scientists have said that the Pacific abyss is rich in minerals that are critical for renewable batteries and other green technologies. Even though international regulators are still hammering out the rules and regulations for conducting deep sea mining, one mining executive contended to ABC News that they can extract the critical minerals from the depths of the abyss without harming the seabed. ""I mean, why on Earth shouldn't we explore new frontiers? We need to mix it up,"" Gerard Barron, the CEO of The Metals Company, a Canadian-based firm that is one of 16 companies exploring ways to mine the CCZ, told ABC News. ""The question is, what's this impact? How can we mitigate those impacts? And how does that compare to the known impacts of land-based activity? And I think that's a decision that society is going to have to face,"" he added. Oceanography experts, however, warn that we still know little about the ecology this deep under the sea. Even though potential mining could benefit necessary green projects, it could have unforeseen negative effects down the road. ""The worst case scenario for the environment would be driving species extinct before we even know they exist,"" Matt Gianni, the co-founder, and the political and policy advisor of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, told ABC News. The zone is between 12,000 and 18,000 feet deep and is still not fully explored, but scientists have found polymetallic nodules that are millions of years old on the ocean floor and contain nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese. These are key minerals used in rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles, storage units and other major devices. The U.S. government has deemed cobalt as an essential mineral because of its importance in electric vehicles and many western countries are pushing for a supply chain that relies less on minerals produced by countries like China and Russia. Barron said that the move to more electric vehicles and non-fossil fuel energy means that the country needs to act immediately to meet the growing demand. ""People haven't given a lot of thought to where these metals come from and what we've woken up to is the fact that getting new mines permanent is really challenging because of the environmental impacts,"" he said. ""So, if you want to build an ecosystem that can make American batteries with secure supplies of battery raw materials, then it's not so easy [to] just imagine up a new mine because all the good ones have been discovered and getting anything permanent is really hard,"" he said. Currently, there is no active mining project within the CCZ, as the International Seabed Authority, an intergovernmental body that oversees ""mineral-resources-related activity"" in seaboards has not yet signed off on deep sea mining in the zone. In the meantime, the ISA, which doesn't yet formally include the U.S., awarded 17 exploration contracts to state sponsors and contractors which are meant to assess mining opportunities in the CCZ seabed. The Metals Company has three licenses and has already conducted research using sophisticated unmanned underwater tools, such as an automated underwater vehicle. ""They're actually like rockets that fly on the ocean floor and take really detailed imagery and measurements of everything,"" Barron explained. For more on this story, check out ""Lit: America's Future"" available on Hulu and wherever you stream ABC News Live. The company also received approval from the ISA to collect 3,600 tons of nodules while an independent team of scientists studies the potential impact it would have on the surrounding systems. Barron said his teams have identified 1.6 billion tons of polymetallic nodules in two of its three license areas in the CCZ, which is enough to produce materials for 280 million mid-sized heavy batteries. He estimated that it would take 30 years to mine the material in CCZ. He said based on his team's analysis there would be a minor impact on the ecosystem, because they've found very little life down there. ""It's a very low-energy area,"" Barron claimed. Environmental experts, however, argue that the companies looking to mine the seabed are premature in their ecological assessments and they need to reconsider their goals. Craig Smith, a professor of oceanography at the University of Hawaii, told ABC News that no one will really know what the mining impacts on the CCZ will be until at least one mine has been operating for a decade. ""Because the ecosystems will take millions of years to recover, no site that’s mined will recover before the last site that’s mined,"" he told ABC News. ""These nodule habitats will not recover."" One possible effect would be chronic stressors to the ecosystems in the area, according to Smith who compared the issue to a loud concert. ""Many humans enjoy going to a rock concert for an hour but if they were in that noise environment 24/7, they would go deaf,"" he explained. Gianni refuted claims by mining companies the CCZ is a low-energy area with little life. He said the seabed is home to many underwater fauna and flora and there are many more species that haven't been discovered. He said there is concern that the mining operations would push sediment into the water and affect the food chain from the smallest fish right up to whales. ""Scientists are saying [the CCZ is] teeming with life…We're still discovering them,"" Gianni said. He added that because of how the gradual flow of the deep sea's ecosystem, many of those changes won't be noticed until many decades later. ""We hope that we should learn by now from our past mistakes,"" Gianni said. ""There's a lot of value to keeping it natural, exploring it, understanding what the deep ocean is...rather than just going in blind, extracting metals until we can't get any more build cars. And then, oops, in 30, 50, [or] 100 years, future generations will say that was a big mistake."" The concerns about deep sea mining have already prompted companies such as Google and Microsoft to make pledges that they would not use minerals from those kinds of operations until more research has been done and more information is available. Gianni's group is one of many environmental organizations that have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining, contending that the environmental risks outweigh the ecological rewards. Barron defended his company's plans from the criticism and contended that their latest processes will not have long-term negative impacts on the seabed. In addition, he said his company is taking a hard look at how their presence will affect the CCZ and are willing to amend its plan. ""We've always said if the scientific evidence points to the fact that we shouldn't be doing this, then we stop. That's part of exploration,"" Barron said. Gianni contended that mining companies are rushing the process because of the increase in demand for rechargeable batteries but said that recycling older minerals will play a key role in reducing the amount of mining in the future. He argued that more patience would go a long way to solving both environmental issues. ""We need the foresight to say let's prevent this problem from happening before it starts taking place,"" Gianni said.",7
2022-09-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-releases-americans-captured-fighting-ukraine/story?id=90272604,Russia releases 2 Americans captured fighting in Ukraine,"Two Americans who were being held captive by Russian-backed forces after volunteering to fight with Ukrainian forces have been released, their families said. Alexander Drueke and Andy Huynh, both military veterans from Alabama, were reported missing by their families following a fight in the Kharkiv area of Ukraine in June. They are currently in the custody of the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia, their families announced in a joint statement on Wednesday. ""We are thrilled to announce that Alex and Andy are free,"" the families said. ""They are safely in the custody of the US embassy in Saudi Arabia and after medical checks and debriefing they will return to the States."" ""We deeply appreciate everyone's prayers and especially the close communication and support of our elected officials, Ukrainian Ambassador Markarova, and our members of the US embassies in Ukraine and Saudi Arabia and the US Department of State,"" the statement continued. The Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday that ""mediation efforts"" on behalf of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman led to the release of 10 prisoners of war -- among them U.S. nationals -- as part of an exchange between Russia and Ukraine. The prisoners of war also included Moroccan, U.K., Swedish and Croatian nationals, the ministry said. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., said in a statement that his office is working to get more information from the U.S. State Department on the health of the men and how soon they will be back in the U.S. ""I want to say how thankful and relieved I am that they have been freed,"" he said. ""I know we all look forward to seeing them back safely, on American soil."" Drueke's family told ABC News they were able to speak with Drueke on the phone for about 10 minutes on Wednesday from Saudi Arabia, during which Drueke said he and Huynh were at a hospital being evaluated and were then going to be taken to an apartment to sleep. Drueke, an Army veteran, and Huynh, a former Marine, both left Alabama for Ukraine in April and met there. After their families reported that they had lost contact with them in early June, photos started appearing online via Ukrainian and Russian social media that showed the men in captivity. Russian state-controlled news outlets also released videos of the two men in captivity. During calls with his family, Drueke read statements that identified his captors as forces from the Donetsk People's Republic, a Russian-backed region in Ukraine, his family said. The Kremlin claimed that the Americans were mercenaries and had ""committed crimes."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously called both men ""heroes"" and said he would fight for their release. ""We'll fight for them and get them back, and of course they will come back to their families,"" he said in June. A senior State Department official told ABC News their freedom is the result of months of negotiations by Ukraine, and in recent weeks the U.S. had been pushing Kyiv to include the Americans in their dealings. The official confirmed Prince Mohammed had played an important role in ensuring the success of the swap. Secretary of State Antony Blinken thanked Saudi Arabia and Ukraine for their roles in freeing the two American citizens. ""The United States is appreciative of Ukraine including all prisoners of war, regardless of nationality, in its negotiations, and we look forward to these U.S. citizens being reunited with their families,"" he said in a statement. The senior State Department official said the two men were in the care of the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia and would be on their way home ""before too long."" ABC News' Shannon K.

2022-09-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-support-ukraine-rebukes-putin-threats/story?id=90222526,"Biden calls for more UN support for Ukraine, rebukes Putin for new threats","Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, President Joe Biden on Wednesday cast the defining conflict facing global leaders as a duel between democracy and autocracy, directly responding to new threats from Russian President Vladimir Putin to escalate the war in Ukraine. The speech is Biden's first at the forum since Russia's invasion, offering him the opportunity to condemn the Kremlin in front of an audience of fellow heads of state. Biden opened his remarks with a strong rebuke of Putin after he earlier Wednesday ordered a partial mobilization of reservists in Russia and raised the specter of using nuclear weapons after a retreat in the northeastern Kharkiv region. ""Let us speak plainly, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase the sovereign state from the map,"" Biden said. ""Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenants of the United Nations Charter."" ""Just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and reckless disregard of the responsibilities of a nonproliferation regime,"" Biden continued. ""Now, Russia is calling, calling up more soldiers to join the fight and the Kremlin is organizing a sham referendum to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the U.N. Charter. The world should see these outrageous acts for what they are."" Biden called the conflict ""a war chosen by one man"" and slammed Putin for his attacks on Ukraine's schools, railway stations, hospitals. ""Even more horrifying evidence of Russia's atrocity and war crimes: Mass graves uncovered in Izium, bodies, according to those that excavated those bodies, showing signs of torture. This war is about extinguishing Ukraine's right to exist as a state, plain and simple. And Ukraine's right to exist as a people. Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should not--that should make your blood run cold,"" he said. Biden reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to help Ukraine and called on other U.N. members to do the same. ""Each of us in this body who determined to uphold the principles and beliefs we pledged to defend as members of the United Nations, must be clear, firm and unwavering in our resolve,"" he said. Biden also announced a commitment of $2.9 billion in global food aid, an effort to address growing famine in the Horn of Africa, and rising food prices worldwide due to the war in Ukraine, and inflation. As Biden grapples with a series of complicated global issues, the high-stakes summit presents a range of challenges for the administration. Although U.N. General Assembly meetings offer an abundance of opportunity for face-to-face diplomacy -- something the president prides himself on -- two key players weren't in attendance: the leaders of Russia and China. ""Our competitors are facing increasingly strong headwinds, and neither President Xi nor President Putin are even showing up for this global gathering,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Tuesday. In Putin's case, the most pressing of those headwinds are losses on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to administration officials. Ahead of an engagement with his counterpart from the U.K., Secretary of State Antony Blinken denounced reports that Moscow plans to hold sham referenda in occupied territories in Ukraine to pave the way to annex territory. ""I think this is also not a surprise this is happening now. We have seen in the last weeks significant gains by Ukraine,"" Blinken said. ""It's a sign of weakness. It's a sign of Russian failure."" But as a number of other heads of state push for negotiations for peace, the gathering won't offer a robust opportunity for Biden to pursue that path with the leaders of the countries involved in the conflict. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is in New York, but there are no plans for a meeting with U.S. officials on the books. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also give a speech on Wednesday, but he will do so remotely as the only leader allowed to appear virtually this year. China's Xi Jinping's absence means there's no chance an in-person meeting with the president, something that hasn't happened since Biden took office. And the two have an ever-growing list of differences to discuss. The past months have seen multiple escalations, with China responding to any step perceived as the U.S. moving towards recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state with shows of force, a strategy a senior State Department official described as an attempt to normalize military pressure. While the administration says Washington's long-standing ""One China"" policy remains in effect, Biden also said U.S. troops would defend Taiwan if it were attacked. Biden addressed competition with China during his speech Wednesday. ""As we manage shifting geopolitical trends the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader,"" Bien said. ""We do not seek conflict. We do not seek a cold war."" Russia's exalted position as one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council has thrown a significant wrench in the body's efforts to check its aggression, prompting calls that it should be removed altogether. U.S. officials appeared to be aligning behind a plan that, instead of subtracting Russia as a permanent member, would seek to make additions to the Security Council. A senior State Department official said that Biden would attempt to ""reenergize"" the push for reform by arguing the body needs to be ""more representative of the world's population, and filled with countries that are ready to work together."" The odds of expanding the Security Council appear slim. Reforming its makeup would require amending the U.N. charter, a step that Russia or any other permanent member could veto. While the war in Ukraine is shaping up to dominate the General Assembly, administration officials have stressed they want to take on other global issues as well. Biden in his speech discussed the need to tackle food insecurity and climate change. ""Let this be the moment, we find within ourselves, the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation and unlock a resilient, sustainable clean energy economy to preserve our plant,"" Biden said. Whereas COVID-19 was a major theme in his address last year, Biden this year only called for access to vaccines worldwide, and urged funding for prevention. One pressing matter facing the White House is its push to return to an Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran. Indirect negotiations appear to have stalled again, and officials from both countries appear increasing pessimistic that the pact can be renewed. Sullivan said Biden plans to reiterate that the U.S. is open to returning to an agreement, but that he isn't anticipating any major breakthroughs. ""While the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the joint comprehensive plan of action if Iran steps up to its obligation, the United States is clear: we will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon,"" Biden said in his speech Wednesday, in which he said the U.S. will pursue critical arm control measures. Even a meeting with one of America's closest allies has its thorns. Biden will hold his first meeting with the U.K.'s new prime minister, Liz Truss, as the differences between the two's economic policies become ever apparent. Recently, Truss said completing a long-awaited trade deal with the U.S. was not a key priority and unlikely to happen anytime soon. But Sullivan said it would be on the president's list. ""I do think that they will talk about the economic relationship between the U.S. and the U.K.,"" Sullivan said, adding they would also hit other areas where Truss and Biden have more in common, such as support for Ukraine and addressing Europe's energy crisis.",15
2022-09-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-majority-leader-outlook-control-congress-midterms-loom/story?id=90263982,House Majority leader gives outlook on control of Congress as midterms loom,"As the November midterm elections quickly approach, all eyes are on the latest efforts by both parties to gain control of the House of Representatives and U.S. Senate. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-M.D.) spoke with ""GMA 3"" Wednesday to discuss his outlook on the Democrats' chances of keeping their majority. GMA 3: A recent Siena College-New York Times survey found Democrats up two percentage points over Republicans among registered voters. Here to discuss is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer from Maryland. Leader Hoyer, thank you for being with us. And yes, T.J. just referenced that a lot is at stake. The power, the control of both the House and the Senate are at stake in that two percentage points. Difference is, as you know, razor thin. And we also know, looking back at 2016, not a lot of confidence necessarily in some of these polls that we're seeing. So how are you feeling heading into the midterms as a Democrat? Hoyer: Well, I'm feeling good. Yes, that poll shows [two percentage points] but we've had some real polls. And what I mean by real polls, voting people going to the ballot box, casting their votes for candidates and expressing their opinion. And we've had two huge victories, actually, three but two members, one in New York, Pat Ryan, in a district that the Republicans were expected to win. And then 2,600 miles further west in Alaska, again, we had former Gov. Sarah Palin running and our candidate, Mary Peltola, the first Native American to represent Alaska. And she is doing very, very well. So we won two races that we weren't supposed to win, just this past four weeks. And then the voters from Kansas, a red state with the Republican leadership, voted essentially 60-40 to make sure that a woman's right to choose was protected, [and] that her freedom to choose her healthcare options would be protected. So, you know, in a red state, a Republican state, that we won that election as well. But going forward, we have some very, very good candidates. The polling data you showed was a two-point ahead. But we have been as much as four or five points behind so that the movement and the momentum and the direction of support is coming our way. So I am confident that we're going to hold the House. I think we can expand our membership in the Senate to beyond 50. And so I think that on Nov. 8, we're going to have a good night and I'm looking forward to it. And I think we are showing that by the issues that we've adopted, whether it was the rescue plan, whether it was the infrastructure investment that we've made that's going to grow America and grow American jobs, or whether it was the bill that invests in science and chips to make sure that we rely on American technology, not a technology overseas that fails us. And then the inflation reduction plan where we're reducing the costs of healthcare for people, reducing the cost of prescription drugs, capping the cost of insulin, and we're going to make energy more available and more affordable for people. So I think that the issues are on our side, I think the people are on our side and I think the votes are on our side. GMA 3: You talked about the polling and some of that polling that we look at has to do with the president's approval rating, which has improved as gas prices continue to drop. We know that streak of gas prices dropping into the 99 days. They ticked up a little bit. We'll see what happens then in the coming days and weeks. But also, look, food prices are at highs that we haven't seen in the past since 1979, actually the inflation we've seen. So I know Democrats and the president love to talk about gas prices as one indicator, but what do you do when people are still hurting by trying to put food on the table? Hoyer: T.J., what we did is we passed a food and fuel bill, unfortunately, got almost no Republican support for it, which was directed at making sure we have competition in the food producing industry, that we have availability of supply chains in getting food to where it needs to be. Now, that's an uphill battle. Inflation is a serious issue that we are dealing with. That's why we passed the Inflationary Reduction Act to bring other costs down. Medical costs in particular down and energy costs down for people. But we've got to bring food prices down as well. Unfortunately, we have a war in Ukraine. That is creating a real challenge of starvation in Africa and some other places, not in America, but it is pressing prices up and we've got to get a handle on that. I go to the grocery store almost every weekend and see those prices rising and people are hurting and we're responding. And the Republicans don't have any response to inflation. They can complain about it. They can point the finger. And as you know, T.J., I'm sure inflation is impacting people throughout the world. Why? Because the pandemic, in effect, shut down the supply and it shut down supply routes. And so there are shortages. But people are hurting and we're acting. The Republicans are simply talking and criticizing. GMA 3: Let me ask you this. The president predicted and I'm going to quote him here, ""If we lose the House or lose the Senate, it's going to be a really difficult two years."" My question is, does it have to be difficult? Do you have any hope or belief that if either of those scenarios happen or one or both, could reach across the aisle, that Republicans and Democrats could work together to try and ease some of the pain that people are feeling in every part of their lives, especially when it comes to finances? Can you pass important legislation regardless? Hoyer: We have passed important legislation. But very frankly, Amy, if you look at the record, when Paul Ryan was Speaker and when John Boehner was speaker just a few years ago, it was Democrats that stepped up to help them get legislation through that America needed because they couldn't get the votes on their own side, even though they had the majority, very frankly, with a four-vote majority. We passed major pieces of legislation without help, which were designed to put people -- put money in people's pockets, get kids back in schools, and get 250 million shots in arms. Not a single Republican voted for that bill. And so, yes, there is a possibility of doing that. But let me tell you what's going to happen if the Republicans take over the House. They've said what they're going to do. They're going to investigate the president of the United States. They're going to try to tear him down. And our country is going to be deeply divided. And very frankly, what the Republicans have done, what Donald Trump has done is deeply divide our country, [and] polarize our politics. That's not good for our country. It's not good for our people. It's not good for success in the Congress of the United States. So I believe that Democrats over the years, whether it was Ronald Reagan, President George W. Bush, or any other president, we have seen Democrats support in a bipartisan way critical legislation. Frankly, we haven't seen that from our Republican friends. And I hope we do in the future. But I don't want to see our country locked down by partisan politics. And that's what's going to happen, I'm afraid, if our Republican friends win the majority in the House of Representatives because their agenda is not a constructive agenda. It's a negative agenda. It's creating fear in people. It's creating division in our country. And that's not good for anybody. And it's not good for the world. And we're at war. I'm wearing the Ukrainian flag as a symbol that we need to win this war against dictatorship and war criminals. And we need to be united to do that. And I think we Democrats, frankly, and I think Joe Biden, President Biden has worked all his life in trying to create bipartisanship. And so I will pursue that whatever happens in November.",7
2022-09-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/putin-ropes-ukrainians-continue-counteroffensive/story?id=90263857,Putin 'on the ropes' as Ukrainians continue counteroffensive,"As Ukrainian forces continue to mount a counteroffensive against the Russian Army and reclaim the country's invaded land in the northeast, Russian President Vladimir Putin has upped his military mobilization and rhetoric against Ukrainian officials. ABC News Foreign Correspondent Tom Soufi Burridge, who is in Kharkiv spoke to ABC News' ""Start Here,"" Wednesday about the latest developments. START HERE: Ukraine’s continuing to push Russia out of some of its strongholds…and we’re just beginning to see what life was like for residents there, right? TOM SOUFI BURRIDGE: Yeah, exactly. We've been into areas of the newly liberated territory. It took us about three hours to drive down there from Kharkiv City to the southeast of here. And we went to a city called Izyum, and it might be a name that's beginning to register with people right now. In the forest, by the city, we visited what is a newly discovered mass burial site and what the Ukrainian authorities have now been doing over the last few days, and we witnessed them working [with] these forensic teams in their white overalls. I mean, really digging with care down into the ground, into kind of sandy ground below this pine forest to dig up these bodies, remove them from the ground, [and] exhume them so that they can really identify the victims. Now, I think what people might not realize about this when they've watched this on the kind of news headlines is that some of the people in this forest have died of natural causes. Now, they might have died prematurely because of lack of food, lack of water [and] lack of medicine in these Russian-occupied territories during the war. And more disturbingly, I think, some of the victims being pulled out of the ground, according to Ukrainian officials, are showing signs of torture. We also met a guy called Sergei living still in Izyum. We met him by his apartment block, which was wrecked in a Russian missile strike. More than 40 of his friends and neighbors were killed during that attack and most of them are now buried in that burial site in the forest. We met relatives going up to those graves. They're going there to try and find relatives to try and identify where their relatives are. And we actually met one lady who had a piece of paper and she had the number of the grave of her husband. She knew where he was. He was killed in a Russian airstrike or shelling, but she had two numbers for her mother-in-law. And she had no idea which of the two graves, that were numbered, was the correct grave for her mother-in-law. START HERE: Well, so then you think about these towns that have been under Russian control for several months now, not weeks, but months. And does that help us explain what's happened in the last 24 hours? Because I heard Russia is now organizing referendums in some of the pockets of Ukraine where they do control. And these referendums would be like a vote, like do you want to be part of Russia? To which I would have said, like, duh, these can be sham elections. I'm sure Russia is going to say, ""Yep, everyone wants to be Russian now"" - it doesn't mean it's true. So like, why was that announcement such a big deal? BURRIDGE: I think it's a massive deal because…I'm pretty confident they will not be free and fair. This will not be a vote that will be recognized internationally. In the White House and the Pentagon [they] are saying it's a sham. And I think most people around the Western world would agree with that. And now we're effectively seeing Russia saying, ""OK, we're going to say that all of that territory in our command in the south and the east is actually Russian property. We're going to officially recognize that that is Russian land."" And the reason this matters is because in the war going forward, it raises the stakes a bit and it raises the possibility that if Ukraine with Western-supplied weapons is attacking those territories, Russia might try and claim that that is a direct attack on Russia and you get more. START HERE: So now all of a sudden the response is as if they attacked St. Petersburg or if they attack some border town in Russia. That's how they're going to react. BURRIDGE: Now, that's, I think that's the principle they're laying down in their rhetoric. Now, obviously, I think some analysts are already saying, well, wait a minute. And actually you hear this from U.S. officials already. They're saying, ""This is grandstanding by the Russians. This is part of their information game."" They're trying to raise the stakes. Putin's on the ropes. He's massively weakened after he lost huge amounts of territory in northeastern Ukraine, up around Kharkiv, where we are. And he's in trouble. He's being increasingly isolated internationally. In recent days it's been really interesting at home. It's hard to read right back in Russia. We don't know what public opinion's like. The media is very controlled. There's no freedom of expression, etc. For example, a megastar Russian singer came out recently on Instagram and basically, and really came out for the first time against the war. And that is a figure that really is massively popular among the generations, like someone who really stretches back to the older generations as well, who are traditionally quite a sort of fans of Putin. So Putin's in trouble and he's in a corner and now he's coming out with these kinds of tactics to raise the stakes on the battlefield. And it feels like a slightly dangerous moment. [ ]",7
2022-09-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-polls-tighten-border-crime-grow-issues-note/story?id=90201864,"Senate polls tighten as border, crime grow as issues: The Note","The TAKE with Rick Klein The governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, has been dominating the politics of the week, as flight trackers, the White House, a Texas sheriff and his political opponents try to figure out what he has already done -- and what he might do next. But there are fresh signs of the political climate shifting yet again ahead of the midterms, in races far from Florida and from the U.S.-Mexico border. A new Spectrum News/Siena College poll out of Wisconsin shows a virtual tie in the Senate race, with Democrat Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes at 48% and GOP Sen. Ron Johnson at 47%. That comes after Barnes and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers have been hammered by TV advertisements focusing on crime. In Georgia, two new polls out Tuesday had Sen. Raphael Warnock now leading inside the margin of error against Republican Herschel Walker. Warnock has been criticized by his rival over urban crime rates and his support for the Biden administration's economic and immigration policies. Races in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada are also showing signs of getting tighter, with a range of Democrats forced onto the air playing defense on issues surrounding crime. The recent burst of Democratic optimism -- enough to shift conventional wisdom about their prospects of holding the Senate -- appears to be dissipating. It comes as moves to transport migrants have put a new spotlight on the situation at the border. Candidates aren't necessarily embracing what the governors are doing, but they are leaning in on the kinds of issues raised by the focus on the border -- including attempts to enter the U.S. illegally, fentanyl and drug smuggling, as well as crime in general. It contributes to an issue set that Republicans like far better than the focus on abortion rights -- and suggests that voters aren't settled on what might determine their choices in November. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is leaving the door open to more chartered trips for migrants to Democrat-led cities despite a lawsuit filed by migrants flown to Martha's Vineyard, an investigation launched by a Texas sheriff and a letter from some Florida state lawmakers questioning if taxpayer money for the flights is being used appropriately. The lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges that DeSantis and other Florida officials were ""exploiting [the migrants'] most basic needs"" such as food and ""made false representations and to make them willing to board planes."" Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar has opened an investigation into how migrants were taken from the San Antonio area to Massachusetts. In an interview, Salazar told ABC News that interviews with migrants and witnesses would help determine if the transport of migrants constitutes human trafficking. ""If we can prove that they were taken from our county under false pretenses that may be criminal activity, it could be a fraud type offense,"" Salazar said during an interview with ABC News. ""It could be as strong as, and these are strong words to throw around, I don't use them lightly, it could be a human trafficking case."" Two Democratic leaders in Florida, Evan Jenne and Fentrice Driskell, wrote a letter to their Republican counterparts calling the migrant transport an ""inappropriate"" use of that money. The pair wrote that it was ""not intended to use state funds to transport migrants into the state solely so they could be deported to Massachusetts."" The Martha's Vineyard flight and the threat of others to land in cities led by Democrats have widely been interpreted as political theater. The continued backlash in Democratic circles gives DeSantis a win with conservatives in this deeply polarized political climate that values ""owning"" the other party over finding reasonable solutions to big problems. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose celebrated National Voter Registration Day on Tuesday at a local brewery, where he backed the use of mail-in ballots in his state's elections -- something his most high-profile supporter, former President Donald Trump, has falsely claimed to have caused election fraud. The state's top elections officer was asked to account for the discrepancy between his and the former president's positions on the voting method, ABC News' Paulina Tam reports. ""I don't speak for President Trump. He speaks for himself and does so very well. But that doesn't mean we agree on everything. I can tell you that Ohio runs secure elections. In many ways, we're really the example for the rest of the country. And President Trump himself has said that Ohio runs clean elections,"" LaRose said. LaRose is faced with walking the fine line of touting his administration's efforts in Ohio's election administration, while doing so on the periphery of Trump's continuous railing against the outcome of the last election. In November 2020, LaRose stood in opposition to false election fraud claims spread by members of his own party, even telling the Cleveland Plain Dealer at the time that it's ""irresponsible when Republicans say an election was stolen and don't have evidence. If anyone has evidence, they need to show it."" The ongoing spread of false election denial claims is something voting rights advocates and legal organizations are carefully monitoring as officials prepare to administer this year's elections. Janai Nelson, who serves as president and director of counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told reporters the added issue of some candidates for critical positions being election deniers themselves adds another layer of national concern. ""We have election deniers who are actively gaining ground in states across the country as candidates for secretary of state as candidates for governor. These are positions that hold tremendous power, particularly when it comes to our elections. They not only hold power within that state and their election outcomes but, as we know, in federal elections and especially in presidential elections,"" Nelson said.

2022-09-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/women-girls-affected-disproportionately-russia-ukraine-war-report/story?id=90324121,Women and girls affected disproportionately by Russia-Ukraine war: UN report,"Women and girls in Ukraine and around the world have suffered disproportionately as the men of the country fight against the invasion by Russia, a new report by the United Nations has found. The policy paper, published as the U.N. Security Council meets to discuss the war in Ukraine, reveals how the war and its global impacts on food, energy and finance have caused women in Ukraine and globally to suffer numerous hardships. The report states that 265,000 Ukrainian women who were pregnant when the war broke out in February either had to flee or give birth in a time of conflict. It also highlights how the crisis in Europe is exacerbating existing inequalities around the world, especially surrounding the scarcity of food. The war-induced food price hikes and shortages have widened the global gender gap in food insecurity, the report shows. Many women have even reduced their own food intake to provide for other household members. The report states that spiraling energy prices have caused families to return to using less clean fuels and technologies, exposing women and girls to household air pollution, which already kills 3.2 million people per year -- the majority of whom are women and children. Women-headed households in Ukraine were already more food insecure prior to the war, with 37.5% experiencing moderate or severe levels of food insecurity, compared to 20.5% of male-headed households, according to the report. The fate of women in rural territories occupied by the Russian military remains dire. The women are increasingly unable to perform agricultural work due to high insecurity and lack of resources, but they continue to rise to the challenge of accommodating and feeding internally displaced people, which then multiples their unpaid care and domestic work responsibilities, according to the report. In addition, school-aged girls are even more at risk of being obliged to drop out of school to get married for dowry or bride-price income for desperate families, officials stated. The report shows that there are alarming increases in gender-based violence, transactional sex for food and survival, sexual exploitation and trafficking, and early child marriage and forced marriage as a result of these worsened living conditions in conflict, crisis and humanitarian contexts worldwide. ""Systemic, gendered crises require systemic, gendered solutions,"" Sima Sami Bahous, the executive director of U.N.-Women, said in a statement. ""That means ensuring that women and girls, including from marginalized groups, are part of all the decision-making processes. That is simply the only way to be certain that their rights and needs are fully taken into account as we respond to the clear facts before us."" The policy brief calls for solutions from the international community to prioritize women's and girls' voice agency, participation and leadership in conflict response, recovery and peacebuilding as well as to enhance gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data to build the evidence base for gender-responsive policy. The U.N. also recommended that international communities promote and protect the right to food by targeting the specific nutrition needs of women and girls and accelerate the transformation towards more equitable, gender-responsive and sustainable food systems, equitable access to access to inputs, technologies and markets by women.",25
2022-09-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-declassify-documents-gop-sen-barrasso-acknowledges-pressed/story?id=90434232,"Trump can't 'declassify documents by saying so,' GOP Sen. Barrasso acknowledges when pressed","After Donald Trump suggested last week that as president “you can declassify just by saying it's declassified, even by thinking about it,” Republican Wyoming Senator John Barrasso disagreed -- but only after George Stephanopoulos pressed him on the issue twice on ABC’s “This Week.” During an interview on Sunday, Barrasso was asked by Stephanopoulos about Trump's handling of classified material, which is under federal investigation as Trump denies wrongdoing. Trump claimed to Fox News' Sean Hannity last week that while ""different people see different things,"" his view of this authority was absolute: ""If you’re the president of the United States, you can declassify just by saying it's declassified. Even by thinking about it."" Stephanopoulos asked if Barrasso agreed. The senator said that he had not heard about such an assertion and pivoted to criticizing the Department of Justice's court-authorized search of Mar-a-Lago. Barrasso said that he had ""never seen anything like that before,"" referring to the FBI ""raid"" Trump's home, and that it had ""become political."" Stephanopoulos pushed back: ""You know that a president can't declassify documents by thinking about it. Why can't you say so?"" The senator, who also said that he isn't versed in the rules of presidential declassification and wants to get a briefing from the DOJ on the investigation, then agreed with Stephanopoulos. He said, ""I don't think a president can declassify documents by saying so, by thinking about it."" That view lines up with what outside experts have told ABC News: The president must document his declassification process somewhere, whatever his process was. Barrasso spent much of his ""This Week"" appearance pushing back on President Joe Biden's foreign policy, including addressing the potential revival of the 2015 nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran. Stephanopoulos opened up the interview by having Barrasso respond to Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser. Sullivan was also interviewed on ""This Week"" on Sunday and said nuclear negotiations -- so Iran never has a weapon ""they can threaten the world with"" -- could be effective at the same time the White House was putting public pressure on the country over its treatment of women and protesters. ""Did you find his argument convincing for staying in the Iran nuclear talks?"" Stephanopoulos asked Barrasso. ""No deal with Iran, George, is a good deal … They continue to claim 'death to America.' We cannot allow them to have a nuclear weapon,"" Barrasso said. Stephanopoulos also sought clarity from Barrasso on the GOP and Ukraine. Citing criticism of American's continued aid to Ukraine by some Republicans, like Ohio Senate nominee J.D. Vance, Stephanopoulos asked Barrasso if Democrats were right to warn that the GOP may restrict future support if they retake Congress. ""No. There continues to be bipartisan support in the House and in the Senate for weapons to Ukraine,"" Barrasso said. He said he wanted the White House to be quicker in providing weapons to Ukraine and said ""we ought to be producing more American energy to help our European allies"" and American consumers who are dealing with the fallout of the conflict with Russia, a major energy provider. Stephanopoulos asked Barrasso, just as he asked Sullivan: ""Do you believe that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's hold on power is secure?"" ""I'm not sure,"" Barrasso, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said. ""He is in a deep hole right now and he's dug this hole. And I thought his statement to the country there really was desperate. It didn't show really confidence or strength."" ""The Foreign Relations Committee is going to have a hearing this Wednesday on what additional things we can do in terms of sanctions [on Russia],"" Barrasso said. ""And also we have a secure briefing on Thursday in the Senate to take a look right at what's happening on the ground in Ukraine.""",7
2022-09-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/italy-expected-elect-female-prime-minister-conservative-firebrand/story?id=90433783,"Italy expected to elect its first female prime minister, a conservative firebrand","Giorgia Meloni, leader of Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), could become the first female prime minister in the history of Italy in an anticipated right-wing surge to the polls on Sunday. Europe's attention is trained on Rome, where this potential first is joined by fears that Meloni would restore an ideology not seen in Italy since World War II. Pollsters expect the Sunday vote to deliver a conservative coalition to parliament, with the government guided by Meloni as premier. The archconservative of Italian politics, Meloni entered politics at age 15 in 1992, joining the neo-fascist Social Movement, a group with pronounced sympathy for Benito Mussolini, the country's dictator from 1925 to 1945. Fratelli d'Italia's party imagery evokes Italy's fascist past, but Meloni has rejected the associations, framing her proposed conservative coalition as a nationalist project that would recover power from Brussels. A Meloni government would represent a major change in tide from the technocrat government held together by former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi. Meloni's party was the only opponent to Draghi's coalition, which fell in July after maintaining a hardline on consensus issues in the European Union – including sending arms to Ukraine and sanctioning Russia. Observers say EU battle lines may be realigning, with Italy, one of the bloc's founders and its third-largest economy, cozying more to Hungary and Poland than Germany and France. The collapse of Draghi's government in July threw Italy into a familiar political tumult, and a splintered left wing, including the center-left Democratic Party and the populist Five-Star Movement, has not coalesced with a pre-election pact. The Democratic Party leader, Enrico Letta, has trailed consistently in polls and is expected to split ballots cast by liberals with voters for Five-Star and a ""Third Pole"" coalition. The right wing, though, has joined forces. Polls indicate Meloni will be the leading conservative finisher on Sunday; her government's junior partners would be Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, and Silvio Berlusconi, the head of the center-right Forza Italia. Berlusconi, the media tycoon and conservative firebrand, rose to power in 1994 and won three stints as prime minister, in total the longest serving premier in the post-war era. Salvini has been seen as the conservative in the wings of Palazzo Chigi, while Meloni had led the smaller Fratelli d'Italia, distant from the mainstream. Analysts credit Meloni's surge past them to her resolute anti-Putin, pro-NATO posture. Berlusconi, a longtime Putin friend, has outright echoed the Kremlin's war narrative. Salvini has wavered on continuing to send arms to Kyiv. In the two-month campaign sprint, Meloni has worked to settle fears over the conservative coalition, including those of her own making. If more pugilistic toward Brussels than her recent predecessors, Meloni does not propose a divorce with the EU or an exit from the euro, which is supported by more than 70% of Italians. She has tempered her past hostile tones toward LGBT rights and abortion rights. Amid rising energy costs hitting Italians particularly hard and long-stagnant wages in the country, Meloni has made her message economic, focusing on tax cuts and investment in nuclear energy. Anticipation for a far-right surge in Rome, which would follow closely behind Tuesday's stunning electoral victory for the Swedish Democrats, a party with neo-Nazi origins, has already provoked barbed remarks from Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission chief. Von der Leyen was not keen to veil Brussels' posture toward a government that could move to subvert democracy. ""If things go in a difficult direction, I've spoken about Hungary and Poland, we have tools,"" von der Leyen told students in the United States on Thursday. The Commission has recommended exercising an internal sanctions measure on Hungary over corruption it alleges. Potential clashes with the EU will not be the first order of business should the right-wing coalition win a majority of votes on Sunday. Before it can govern, conservatives will have to organize a government behind Meloni in a process that could take weeks. Fratelli d'Italia won 4.4% of the vote in the 2018 parliamentary elections, the last time Italians went to the polls. After votes are counted on Sunday, barring a major break from polling, it's poised to be the nation's leading political party.",3

The decree granting Snowden and 75 other foreign nationals citizenship was published on an official government website. Snowden’s attorney, Anatoly Kucherena, told Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti that Snowden and his wife, Lindsay Mills, intend to apply for Russian passports. Mills is also American and has been living in Russia with Snowden. A former contractor with the U.S. National Security Agency, Snowden has been living in Russia since 2013 to escape prosecution in the United States for leaking classified documents detailing government surveillance programs. The 39-year-old Snowden was granted permanent residency in Russia in 2020 and at the time said he intended to apply for Russian citizenship, but had no plans to renounce his U.S. citizenship. In December 2020, Snowden and Mills announced they had become parents to a baby boy. ""The greatest gift is the love we share,"" Snowden tweeted at the time, posting a photo of him and Mills kissing while holding their newborn. In 2013, Snowden claimed the U.S. government was spying on its citizens and leaked documents taken from the NSA to support his claim. Long vilified by current and former members of the intelligence community, Snowden has continued his advocacy for government transparency and pro-whistleblower measures from his home in Moscow. Snowden said in 2013 that he was motivated by principle to leak the NSA documents, saying he wanted to to pull back the veil on one of the government's most secretive entities and its programs to track Americans' phone records and internet usage. ""I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,"" Snowden told the British newspaper The Guardian, which broke the first in a series of headline-grabbing articles on NSA surveillance in June 2013. ""That is not something I am willing to support or live under.""",12
2022-09-26,https://abcnews.go.com/International/13-killed-russian-school-shooting/story?id=90518338,At least 17 killed in Russian school shooting,"At least 17 people, including 11 children, were killed after a man opened fire at a school in central Russia on Monday, officials said. Local authorities said at least 24 more people were injured, some severely, in the attack in the school in the city of Izhevsk about 600 miles from Moscow, making it one of the deadliest school shootings Russia has suffered. Twenty-two children were among the two dozen injured in the shooting. Two teachers and two security guards were among the dead, according to the region's governor. Police said the alleged shooter killed himself at the school following the attack. They identified him as a 34-year-old former student at the school. Russia's Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, identified him as Artyem Kazantsev, and posted a video it said showed his body lying in a pool of blood in a classroom. The motive for the attack was still unclear but the committee said it was investigating possible ""neofascist views"" held by the shooter, who in the video it released appeared to be wearing a T-shirt with a red swastika. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman called the shooting a ""terrorist act."" ""President Putin grieves in connection with the deaths of people and children in the school, where the terrorist act occurred. It was carried out by an individual who, judging by everything, belongs to a neofascist organisation or group,"" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary told reporters. The shooting began mid-morning, while children were in class. Video circulating in Russian media showed pupils cowering under desks and with blood stains visible on the floor. Police sealed off the school and emergency services could be seen carrying stretchers with the wounded from the building. The shooter was armed with two pistols, according to Alexander Khinstein, the chairman of Russia's parliamentary committee for information policy, technology and communications. School shootings have been relatively rare in Russia, but in recent years they have become increasingly frequent. In May 2021, a teenager killed seven children and two adults after attacking a school in Kazan, and in April this year a man shot two children and a teacher dead at a kindergarten in the Ulyanovsk region.

In the few days that remain, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will try to lead the Senate in passage of a short-term funding bill that is expected to include Sen. Joe Manchin's energy permitting reform legislation. Schumer struck a deal with Manchin to include energy permitting reform, a top priority for the West Virginia moderate Democrat, on a must-pass piece of legislation before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 in order to secure Manchin's crucial support for Democrats' keystone Inflation Reduction Act. But with the passage of the health care and environmental bill now in the rearview mirror, Schumer's behind-the-scenes deal making has come home to roost. The fiscal year ends on Friday, leaving the Democratic caucus in both chambers deeply divided with just days to a shutdown. On Tuesday, the Senate will take a key test vote to determine the fate of Manchin's legislation as it considers a bill to fund the government through mid-December. Schumer, with the backing of the White House, is sticking to his promise to include the Manchin legislation, introduced Wednesday, in the short-term funding bill. The Manchin bill would accelerate energy projects mandating that federal environmental reviews essentially be completed in two and a half years, a substantial increase from today's process. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Sunday, Manchin argued that his proposed legislation would bring the country in line with allied countries like Canada and Australia by reducing timelines on energy products from the current five to 10 years. He called his bill, which speeds up permitting process for both renewable projects like wind and solar as well as non-renewable energies like oil and gas, ""the kind of balanced and all-of-the-above energy approach America needs if we are to defend this nation's energy security from those who seem hell-bent on weakening it."" But it's proven a tough pill to swallow for some progressives, many of whom knew of the outlines of the Schumer-Manchin deal before the IRA vote but not the specifics, which were just unveiled at the end of last week. They're pushing back against what they see as a deal that goes counter to the very progress the IRA is expected to make against climate change. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., is organizing a letter to Schumer -- signed by a number of liberal senators, including Sen. Bernie Sanders -- asking that a vote on legislation speeding up permits occur separately from one on funding the government, according to an aide to the Oregon Democrat. But the Senate group, like the more than 80 House progressives who oppose the deal in the House, stopped short of threatening to vote against the government funding bill if permitting reform is attached. Sanders, however, has said unequivocally he intends to vote against funding the government if it includes Manchin's bill. In a scathing dear colleague letter on Friday, Sanders urged his fellow lawmakers to block the ""disastrous side deal recently introduced by Senator Manchin to make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to destroy the planet and pollute the environment."" ""Next week, Congress has a fundamental choice to make. We can listen to the fossil fuel industry and climate deniers who are spending huge amounts of money on lobbying and campaign contributions to pass this side deal. Or we can listen to the scientists and the environmental community who are telling us loudly and clearly to reject it,"" Sanders wrote. It is that Sanders' opposition in the narrowly divided Senate that has put Schumer in something of a bind. He needs GOP votes on government funding, but Republicans -- feeling they have leverage -- are anxious to pay Manchin back for what they see as his betrayal when he pivoted from opposing the Democrats' sweeping climate and health bill to casting the deciding ""yes"" vote. Manchin, in his Sunday op-ed, accused GOP leadership of playing politics in standing in the way of his legislation while promoting a competing, though slightly more expensive, bill by his home state GOP colleague, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. The bills are remarkably similar, especially in that both guarantee the approval of a top project for West Virginia -- the as-yet-unbuilt Mountain Valley Pipeline which is intended to carry natural gas some 300 miles from northern West Virginia into southern Virginia. The project is tied up in litigation. It's in part because of the greenlighted Mountain Valley Pipeline project that Capito said she intends to support Manchin's legislation when it comes to the floor. She'll back the short term funding bill with Manchin's legislation attached during Tuesday's test vote. But it's not clear if other Republicans will be ready to give Manchin another win. According to an aide, Manchin spent the weekend working the phones and shored up the support of several other Republicans. He's still confident there's a path to the 60 votes necessary to clear Tuesday's procedural vote on the short term funding bill that will include his legislation. Despite Manchin's optimism, that vote faces major headwinds. That's why there's a backup plan to keep the government funded. If the bill fails to get the necessary 60 votes to proceed, Schumer is largely expected to strip Manchin's permitting reform legislation and barrel forward. That's essential not only to keep the lights on in Washington but also to secure funds for a few other bipartisan priorities. There is support from both parties for additional funding to assist Ukraine in the ongoing war against Russia. The short term funding bill is expected to include at least $12 billion in economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The bill is also expected to include disaster aid for Jackson, Mississippi's ongoing water crisis. A flood in Jackson last month brought to a head years of water system failures in the area, leaving residents without access to clean drinking water. A potential funding crisis at the Food and Drug Administration will also be averted. After months of behind-the-scenes squabbling, negotiators reached an agreement late last week to include language reauthorizing FDA user fees in this short term package. Authorization for those fees on companies which seek authorization from the FDA for new drugs must be renewed every five years. Current authorization expires Friday. The FDA uses the user fees to fund an expedited approval process for new and innovative drugs and medical technologies. By including this language in the short term bill, the FDA won't be sending pink slips to workers who helped authorize COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic. But other COVID-19 priorities are expected to fall by the wayside, yet again. The administration wanted Congress to approve an additional $22 billion in funds to combat COVID-19 to fund vaccine research and additional testing. Republicans have blocked multiple efforts to secure these funds, arguing that there is still remaining funding that's yet to be utilized, and questioning the necessity of additional spending. The administration's efforts to secure COVID money were not helped, however, by Biden's comments on ""60 Minutes"" earlier this month that ""the pandemic is over."" Republican Whip John Thune told reporters last week that Biden's comments make it ""​​eminently harder for sure"" to persuade the GOP to support additional funds. The fate of a separate $4 billion request from the White House to combat monkeypox remains uncertain. The Senate is expected to act sometime this week to avert a shutdown, at which point the House will have to swiftly take up and pass the legislation. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the chamber may work through the weekend to secure funding if necessary.",26
2022-09-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abrams-kemp-rematch-black-voter-turnout-critical-factor/story?id=90541258,How Black voter turnout will shape Georgia governor's race: The Note,"The TAKE with Averi Harper Black voters are often referred to as the backbone of the Democratic Party -- and as high-stakes midterm elections approach, campaigns are working to ensure that this key voting bloc turns out in full force. In Georgia, where some Democrats have expressed fears that the party's gubernatorial candidate, Stacey Abrams, has hit a slump with Black male voters, Abrams' campaign has invested in outreach to Black men and other untapped voters of color. ""What we know is that Black voters are not deciding between whether they're going to vote for me or for [Gov. Brian] Kemp. They are deciding if they're going to vote for me or not vote,"" Abrams said on a call with Black journalists on Monday. There are signs that Democrats, in Georgia and across the country, should be concerned about Black voter turnout. According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, 55% of Black voters said they intended to vote in comparison to 72% of white voters -- a result that advantages Republicans, whose support is strongest by far among white voters. Plus, Biden's strong approval with Black voters is at a career-low 31%, according to the same poll. Research conducted by the NAACP and public opinion research firm HIT Strategies indicates that losing ground with Black men and Black millennials could become a stumbling block for Democrats. ""Young Black voters are extremely cynical, extremely frustrated, not just with Democrats, not just with Republicans, not even just with politics -- they are cynical towards institutions that they felt like have failed them. At the top of that list is the Democratic Party. But they are not exclusive on that list,"" said Terrance Woodbury, CEO of HIT Strategies. Abrams told reporters that her campaign has aimed, through targeted outreach, to ""connect the dots"" for Black voters about how her win could turn into policies that would benefit Georgians. It remains to be seen if that work will be enough to turn out the minority voters vital to her effort to unseat Kemp. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema The prospect of ticket-splitting could be a possibility in some of this year's most high-profile races and is already a reality in at least one case in a major battleground. In Pennsylvania on Monday, Philadelphia's police union, the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5, split their 2022 endorsements between both major parties by backing Republican Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz and the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, state Attorney General Josh Shapiro. On the campaign trail, Oz has sought to tie issues with crime and gun violence in Philadelphia to Democratic policies -- and his opponent, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. Although U.S. senators have no direct oversight of local policing practices, Oz cited crime in Philadelphia as part of his pledge to support officers and allow them ""to do their job,"" ABC News' Will McDuffie reports. Asked by ABC News if he believes in reforming any aspects of policing, Oz said Monday that he would encourage the use of body-worn cameras and more community policing. Oz also said the use of body cameras on officers ""provides a lot of freedom to the officers at a time of crisis."" FOP Lodge 5's president, John McNesby, said an endorsement committee met with Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano prior to making the decision to back Shapiro. The outcome of that meeting appeared to raise more questions for the group about how Mastriano would engage with union priorities, if elected. ""To me, it just doesn't seem like everything's clicking with Mastriano,"" said McNesby, adding, ""He was just totally different as far as right to work and as far as unions and as far as, 'Do as I say and not as I do.' We don't like that."" The TIP with Abby Cruz The Republican National Committee on Monday sought to spotlight concerns over migration at the southern border, hosting a press call in the wake of the latest numbers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. According to that data, released last week, Border Patrol apprehensions of migrants have exceeded 2 million so far this fiscal year, a significant increase from 2021. ""What's happening in South Texas isn't just affecting us, it's affecting the entire state, the entire country and we need help,"" said Rep. Mayra Flores, the Republican nominee for Texas' 34th District. ""We need help from other states like California and New York -- step up. We have a problem and it's not just a South Texas problem. It's an American problem."" The government's border data shows authorities overall saw a 2.2% increase month-over-month in unique encounters with migrants in August. People arriving from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela were the faces behind that growth, according to the Biden administration. Amid sharp GOP criticism, the White House has stressed its push to humanely process migrants who seek to enter the U.S. -- in contrast, officials say, with the Trump White House -- but note they have only limited influence over immigration from other countries. Republican lawmakers said on Monday's call that the influx of people was taxing their communities. ""How on earth are we going to provide for the ... immigrants who have crossed the border since January 2021?"" said Texas Rep. Monica De La Cruz, the 15th District Republican nominee. ""When we can't even take care of our own people in this area, it's absolutely outrageous. And it's unfair and is plain wrong."" Some of the Republicans on the call are running in competitive swing district races in Texas that could help decide who controls the House next year. The 15th and 28th seats are held by Democrats; the 34th is vacant. ""The good news is that it does not have to be this way,"" said Rep. Cassy Garcia, the 28th District's Republican nominee. ""Democrats and Republicans can come together to solve difficult challenges. And I believe in bipartisanship and all of us are eager to roll up our sleeves and work hard for our communities."" The growing numbers at the border and border security are among the leading concerns of Texans who will cast their ballots in November. Rep. Flores said enforcement was a priority for her but that she feels immigration is an issue -- despite the long history of unsuccessful legislation in Congress -- that can be worked out between both parties in Washington. ""This should not be political,"" she said. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast. ""Start Here"" begins Tuesday morning with a look at the preparations in Florida for Hurricane Ian.

2022-09-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/government-shutdown-avoided-sen-manchin-reverses-energy-permitting/story?id=90591054,Government shutdown likely avoided after Sen. Manchin reverses course on energy permitting,"An about-face from Sen. Joe Manchin on Tuesday evening helped to set the Senate on an unexpected glide path to averting a Friday night shutdown. The funding bill, which will keep the government running through Dec. 16, easily earned the 60 votes necessary to clear a procedural hurdle during a Tuesday vote. Seventy-two Senators supported moving forward with the proposal. It was not expected to be so easy. For several weeks, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has been carefully balancing his promise to Manchin to include Manchin's permitting change proposal on a must-pass bill before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 -- despite a growing coalition of members on both sides of the aisle vowing to block any short-term funding bill that included Manchin's changes. Schumer gave assurances to Manchin in order to secure the West Virginia Democrat’s essential support for the party's major social spending and tax bill this summer, the Inflation Reduction Act. As recently as Monday, Manchin was holding firm to that promise. He spent the weekend working the phones, rallying support and publishing op-eds extolling the benefits -- according to him -- that his legislation would heap upon both renewable and non-renewable energy sources, over cries from critics that it would support further fossil fuel development. He believed there was a path to 60 votes. But then he relented. In a statement on Tuesday just half an hour before the Senate was set to vote down a short-term funding bill that included permitting changes, Manchin announced that he had requested Schumer remove his language from the bill. ""It is unfortunate that members of the United States Senate are allowing politics to put the energy security of our nation at risk. The last several months, we have seen firsthand the destruction that is possible as Vladimir Putin continues to weaponize energy. A failed vote on something as critical as comprehensive permitting reform only serves to embolden leaders like Putin who wish to see America fail,” Manchin said in a statement. ""For that reason and my firmly held belief that we should never come to the brink of a government shutdown over politics, I have asked Majority Leader Schumer to remove the permitting language from the Continuing Resolution we will vote on this evening.” Schumer, in floor remarks moments later, said he would advance a short-term funding bill without Manchin's proposal. ""Senate Republicans have made clear they will block legislation to fund the government if it includes bipartisan permitting reform, because they’ve chosen to obstruct instead of work in a bipartisan way to achieve something they’ve long claimed they want to do,"" Schumer said. Republicans were largely united in their intention to block a funding bill that included Manchin’s permitting language. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky actively whipped against it. Though much of the GOP conference supports permitting changes, many saw this vote as an opportunity to push back on Manchin for what they saw as his betrayal when he pivoted from opposing the Democrats' sweeping climate and health bill to cast the deciding ""yes"" vote -- an unexpected reversal this summer that, until it was revealed, had lured some Republicans into backing a separate bill on domestic computer-chip manufacturing. In floor remarks before Manchin’s call to remove his permitting language from the bill, McConnell called the inclusion of Manchin's proposal a ""phony fig leaf."" ""The poison pill is a phony attempt to address an important topic of permitting reform,"" McConnell said. ""It is much too difficult to build things in America an unleash American energy. Liberal regulations are the problem."" But Republicans weren’t the only ones working to block the funding bill when it included Manchin's language. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders had vowed to vote against it too, citing concerns about the adverse environmental impact that speeding up permitting projects for non-renewable energies could have. In a scathing letter to his colleagues on Friday, Sanders urged Democrats to make what he called an environmentally conscious choice. ""In my view, the time has come for Congress to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of our planet,"" Sanders wrote. He also found Schumer and Manchin's behind-the-scenes deal making on the IRA objectionable, branding the agreement that helped yield the Democrats' climate and health bill last year as a ""disastrous side deal."" With permitting changes now sidelined, the Senate will likely pass a bill to fund the government as soon as Wednesday. The bill also provides emergency funding for a variety of bipartisan priorities. Money to Ukraine in their fight against Russia's invasion remains a priority. There's a combined $12.3 billion in aid to Ukraine that includes $3 billion for security assistance, $4.5 billion in economic support and $3.7 in drawdown authority for weapons. The funding bill would provide $35 million ""to respond to potential nuclear and radiological incidents in Ukraine, assist Ukraine partners with security of nuclear and radiological materials, and prevent illicit smuggling of nuclear and radiological material."" This comes in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin last week suggesting that tactical nuclear weapons could be used to change the course of his invasion of Ukraine, groundlessly accusing the West of threatening Russia's territorial integrity. But the funding bill also centers domestic aid. Jackson, Mississippi, would see a $20 million influx of cash to assist with the ongoing water crisis that has left many of its citizens without clean drinking water for more than a month. New Mexico, ravaged by wildfires last year, would get $2.5 billion to assist in rebuilding efforts. And, as conversations about the cost of energy swirl, there's language in the bill to provide $1 billion in low-income heating assistance. The legislation also averts a potential funding crisis at the Food and Drug Administration by including reauthorization for FDA user fees. But Democrats' long sought COVID-19 priorities have once again fallen by the wayside. The Biden administration wanted Congress to approve an additional $22 billion in funds to combat COVID-19 via vaccine research and additional testing. Republicans have blocked multiple efforts to secure these funds, arguing that there are still remaining monies yet to be utilized and questioning the necessity of additional spending. GOP lawmakers once again prevailed in blocking COVID funds, this time by keeping supplemental funding off of the short-term bill. During her weekly press conference on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre vowed the administration will keep working to secure funds. ""We are not going to give up,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""We need to protect and build on the progress we have made. We will continue that process."" Once the Senate passes the short-term funding bill, that legislation will need to pass the House before the Sept. 30 fiscal year deadline. The House could begin considering it as soon as Thursday.

2022-09-28,https://abcnews.go.com/International/tens-thousands-russians-flee-putins-mobilization/story?id=90588897,Russians who fled Putin's mobilization speak out,"Tens of thousands of Russians continue to try to flee the country, fearful of being caught up in the military mobilization ordered by president Vladimir Putin last week to replenish his forces in Ukraine. Miles-long lines of traffic have formed at border crossings with some neighboring countries amid the exodus, as Russians pack exit routes, worried the government might soon impose further restrictions on military age men leaving. Officials in Kazakhstan, which borders Russia to the south, said 98,000 Russians have crossed into their country since Putin announced the mobilization last Wednesday. Georgia's interior ministry told ABC News Tuesday that 100,000 had entered its territory in the past few days. Tens of thousands more have left via other countries, including Finland and Mongolia. The European Union's border service said 66,000 Russians had entered the bloc over the past week, 30% more than the week before. Russians began fleeing the country within hours of Putin's ordering what he called a ""partial"" mobilization to call-up 300,000 men in an effort to reverse the course of his faltering war in Ukraine. In reality, experts say there are little restrictions on who can be drafted and there are widespread reports of men being mobilized regardless of their eligibility. Although the mobilization for now is officially meant to apply only to those with some military experience, many fear the criteria could be expanded and that the government could block military age men from leaving the country. Men subject to the draft are barred from leaving the country and widespread reports are emerging of men with military experience being turned back from borders. At the Verkhny Lars crossing where Russia borders Georgia, a line of hundreds of cars has formed, stretching back around 12 miles, according to journalists there, with thousands of people waiting, some sleeping in their cars. The BBC reported 2,500 cars were currently in the line, citing Russia's customs service. Russian authorities on Tuesday confirmed that Russian troops with armored vehicles had set up a checkpoint at the crossing to turn back those subject to the call-up and were handing out draft papers there. Officials said a mobile enlistment office had also been set up at the border crossing. Kazakhstan, which has a nearly 5,000 mile-long border with Russia and a relaxed entry regime, has become a magnet for those leaving, with border crossings swamped. A 37-year-old man who entered Kazakhstan Monday near the Oral-Uralsk crossing said the line of traffic waiting at one checkpoint point now stretched nearly 20 miles. ""There's simply a hellish line -- it's endless. And moreover at all checkpoints,"" the man, a manager from Tver, a city just outside Moscow, said by phone. He asked to remain anonymous for fear of punishment by the Russian authorities. The man said he had spent 20 hours by road to reach the border from Moscow and was now in the border city of Uralsk, on the Kazakhstan side. Although he is currently not subject to the draft because he has no military experience, he said he had still decided to flee because he feared the borders being closed soon and did not believe in fighting against Ukraine. ""There is a risk that later you will simply find yourself in a cage,"" he said. He said he had chosen to leave despite having only $250 in his pocket and planned to stay with relatives initially, before finding work in Kazakhstan. ""I'm preparing myself for a hard time. I'm preparing myself that I won't know where to sleep, what I'm going to eat,"" he said. A local journalist writing for the Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta.eu wrote, that hundreds of Russian men with luggage could be seen on the streets in Uralsk. Local authorities have reportedly commandeered a cinema to house some of the influx. The sudden mobilization has abruptly brought home the war for millions of Russians, after months during which the Kremlin has sought to present it as a distant conflict with little effect on people's daily lives. Group chats have sprung up on the Telegram social media platform, where Russians anxiously trade information about potential crossing points and look for spots on transport headed over the borders. One chat called Guide to the Free World, has over 100,000 members. The Kremlin has said for now it has made no decision on whether to close Russia's borders in response to the mobilization. Asked by journalists on Monday about reports in independent Russian media that the Kremlin was considering closures in the coming days, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was ""not aware of anything about that."" ""At the present moment, no decisions have been taken on that account,"" he said. The branches of the Federal Security Service in the southern Kurgan and Tyumen regions told the TASS state news agency, that border guards were stopping those subject to mobilization, informing them they must appear at their enlistment offices.",17
2022-09-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-nord-stream-gas-pipeline-leaks-apparent/story?id=90652002,White House: Nord Stream gas pipeline leaks 'apparent sabotage',"The White House said this week that large leaks in undersea gas pipelines running from Russia to Germany were the result of ""apparent sabotage."" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday night that he had spoken with his Danish counterpart about the leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, which he labeled ""apparent sabotage."" ""I spoke to my counterpart Jean-Charles Ellermann-Kingombe of Denmark about the apparent sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines,"" Sullivan tweeted. ""The U.S. is supporting efforts to investigate and we will continue our work to safeguard Europe's energy security."" On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also said the leaks of the pipelines were the result of ""apparent sabotage."" The pipelines, which run under the Baltic Sea, were not actually supplying gas to Europe at the time, although both did still contain gas. ""We have been in touch with our European partners there about the apparent sabotage of the pipelines,"" she told reporters. ""We are supporting European efforts to investigate this. The investigation is still underway, and it could take some time."" Asked whether the United States would consider the leaks an attack on a NATO ally worthy of retaliation, Jean-Pierre said she wouldn't ""get ahead of the investigation."" ""We have to see who is behind this at this time,"" she said. Some European leaders have gone further than U.S. officials have. Denmark's prime minister said Tuesday that ""it is the authorities' clear assessment that these are deliberate actions -- not accidents,"" although she added that ""there is no information indicating who could be behind it,"" according to the Associated Press. The Kremlin said accusations that Russia could be behind the leaks were ""absurd,"" according to the Russian news agency Interfax. ""It is quite predictable and predictably ridiculous and absurd to make up such theories,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday, noting ""this gas costs a fortune but it is now siphoning off into the air."" Poland's prime minister called the development ""an act of sabotage,"" and Sweden's acting prime minister said ""it is probably a case of sabotage,"" the Associated Press reported. Experts told ABC News that only one country -- Russia -- stood to benefit from the pipeline leaks, although officials have yet to offer evidence Russia was behind them. ""No one aside from Russia stands to gain from sabotaging these pipelines,"" said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. An act of sabotage on this scale fits neatly into Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts ""to sow confusion and panic in Europe and weaken European solidarity,"" Cahill said, but also carries tremendous risk for Moscow. ""If it is true that Russia is culpable, this is Putin cutting off his nose to spite his face,"" said Matthew Schmidt, director of the International Affairs program at the University of New Haven. ​​Also Wednesday, the United States announced $1.1 billion in new security assistance for Ukraine, including long-range missile systems, armored vehicles, radars and more.

During her journey Wednesday through New York City, the 12-foot-tall puppet made her live studio world debut on the Emmy Award-winning daytime talk show, ""The View."" Created in 2021, the puppet represents a 10-year-old Syrian refugee from Aleppo searching for her mother. In Arabic, Amal means ""hope,"" and the hope behind the larger-than-life puppet is to make sure nobody forgets about the children fleeing war, violence and oppression around the world. It's estimated that Little Amal has reached more than 1 million people in-person with her artistic and commanding presence, traveling over 5,500 miles and visiting over 12 countries. She began her journey on the Syrian-Turkish border, then crossed Turkey, Greece, Italy, Belgium, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and even visited refugee children in Lviv, Ukraine. Little Amal towered over ""The View"" co-hosts and audience alike as she entered the studio. She was joined by Artistic Director Amir Nizar Zubai, who's the brains behind the international symbol of human rights. ""We wanted to create a project that honors this long journey across Europe that refugees take,"" Zubai said. ""Knowing the problem of refugees is an ongoing problem in the world caused by climate change, wars, conflict, and we wanted to create a project [that] honors them, but is also theater."" Little Amal was built by the Handspring Puppet Company in Cape Town, South Africa, which also is responsible for the puppetry behind the play ""War Horse.""

2022-09-29,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doctor-army-spouse-accused-provide-service-member-medical/story?id=90705031,"Doctor, Army spouse accused of trying to provide service member medical records to Russia","Federal prosecutors on Thursday unsealed a new indictment charging a Johns Hopkins doctor and her spouse, a U.S. Army Major stationed at Fort Bragg, with attempting to provide military service members' medical information to the Russian government. Anna Gabrielian, an anesthesiologist, and Jamie Lee Henry, an Army Major who held a Secret level security clearance, are alleged to have met with a person they believed was associated with the Russian government but who was actually an undercover agent with the FBI -- and told the person they wanted to assist Russia by providing them secret medical information on members of the U.S. military, their family members and other patients of Johns Hopkins. According to the indictment, both discussed with the undercover agent their desire to maintain ""plausible deniability"" about their actions and suggested a cover story for their negotiations with the person they believed was an agent for Russia as well as a plan for their children to be able to flee the U.S. quickly if the government became aware of their actions. Gabrielan is alleged at one point to have accessed medical records for patients at Johns Hopkins that included the spouse of a person employed by the Office of Naval Intelligence and an unnamed veteran of the Air Force, and transferred it to the undercover agent -- believing it would be handed over to Russia.

Henry is also alleged to have obtained secret medical records from five members of the military, one retired Army officer and family members of deceased Army veterans that were handed over to the undercover agent.

2022-09-30,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/government-shutdown-averted-house-senate-pass-funding-bill/story?id=90721352,"Government shutdown averted after House, Senate pass funding bill","A bill to avert a federal government shutdown passed the House on Friday, just hours before the midnight deadline. The House voted 230-201 to pass the stopgap legislation, which will keep the government funded through mid-December -- past the midterm elections. The bill now heads to President Joe Biden's desk. He'll need to sign it before the end of the day Friday to avert a shutdown. The Senate voted 72-25 to advance the legislation on Thursday afternoon after some stumbles earlier this week over energy permitting reform. The legislation moved forward after Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., agreed to drop the provision -- which was opposed by some progressives and most Republicans -- from the continuing resolution. All 25 ""no"" votes came from the GOP side of the aisle. The bill includes an additional $12 billion in military and economic aid for Ukraine, $1 billion in heating and utility assistance for low-income families, $20 million in response to the water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, and includes a five-year reauthorization for Food and Drug Administration user fees. The measure also includes money for Federal Emergency Management Agency's main disaster relief fund, an infusion that comes amid Hurricane Ian's leveling of southwest Florida and after Hurricane Fiona's devastation on Puerto Rico. In floor remarks just before the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., highlighted some of the emergency appropriations included on the bill, including aid for Ukraine and to assist with the water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi. She also highlighted a relatively small amount of funding that could be immediately deployed to assist with Hurricane Ian recovery effort, but noted that even more funds will likely be needed. ""This legislation is a package for the people. I urge a strong bipartisan yes on the continuing resolution so that we may swiftly send this bill to the President's desk,"" Pelosi said on the floor. What's not included in the legislation is the billions of dollars the White House requested to continue its COVID-19 response. The Biden administration requested $22.4 billion for vaccines, treatments and next-generation research. ""This legislation avoids a very bad thing --shutting down the government -- and does a lot of good things: money for the people of Ukraine, funding for communities reeling from natural disasters, aid to families with their heating bills, just to name a few,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said just before the vote. ""Millions and millions of people can breathe easy,"" Schumer added. Republicans tried to get the continuing resolution to lapse early next year, rather than mid-December, in the hopes that the GOP will gain control of the House after the November midterm elections. Sen. Schumer announced Thursday that the Senate will not return for its next vote until Nov. 14, giving members time to campaign in their home states from now until Election Day. When the Senate returns for the lame duck session, it will have a hefty to-do list to tackle. Members will have to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, fund the government, confirm nominees and potentially take up legislation to protect same sex marriage. Schumer warned of an ""extremely busy"" final two months of the calendar year.",26
2022-10-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/americans-released-detention-venezuela-biden/story?id=90831450,"7 Americans released from detention in Venezuela, Biden says","Seven Americans detained in Venezuela have been released, the White House announced Saturday. ""Today, after years of being wrongfully detained in Venezuela, we are bringing home Jorge Toledo, Tomeu Vadell, Alirio Zambrano, Jose Luis Zambrano, Jose Pereira, Matthew Heath and Osman Khan,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement. Five of the individuals released were oil executives who were part of the ""Citgo 6"" group that was jailed in 2017 after being arrested on corruption charges when they were called to the country for a meeting. Earlier this year, Venezuela released the sixth oil executive, Gustavo Cardenas. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday the release came after ""extraordinary efforts and perseverance across the State Department and wider U.S. government for many months."" Senior administration officials said the Americans were released in exchange for two Venezuelans with ties to President Nicolas Maduro's wife. Efrain Antonio Campo Flores and Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas -- sometimes referred to as the ""narco nephews"" due to their relationship with Maduro's wife -- were arrested nearly seven years ago after unsuccessfully attempting to smuggle cocaine into the United States. They had been sentenced to 18 years in prison, until Biden granted them clemency in the exchange. Officials declined to provide specifics on the negotiations when asked if Biden spoke with Maduro directly to secure the swap, calling the choice to release the two Venezuelans a ""painful one."" Biden spoke with the Americans' families to share the good news of their release, officials said. When it came to the swap, officials said two planes carrying the individuals landed in an undisclosed country between the U.S. and Venezuela, and after visually verifying the correct individuals were the ground, they were swapped, and sent home on their respective country's plane. All seven Americans are in ""stable health,"" according to the administration, and have been offered a ""range of support options, including medical care."" Biden expressed his gratitude for the ""hard work of dedicated public servants across the U.S. Government who made this possible, and who continue to deliver on my Administration's unflinching commitment to keep faith with Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained all around the world."" Amid the good news, Biden also noted there are still many families who have family members detained overseas, recommitting his administration to bring them home. The Biden administration has been under pressure for months to bring home WNBA star Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan, both of whom are being detained in Russia. Griner was arrested in February on drug charges and sentences to nine years in prison. Whelan has been detained in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family says were trumped up. ""Today, we celebrate that seven families will be whole once more. To all the families who are still suffering and separated from their loved ones who are wrongfully detained -- know that we remain dedicated to securing their release,"" Biden said. A report released this week by the Foley Foundation, whose namesake James Foley was a freelance journalist executed by ISIS in 2014, found more foreign governments -- including Venezuela and Russia -- are wrongfully detaining Americans and that those cases are taking longer to resolve. ""Nearly half of the U.S. nationals still held hostage have been held for more than five years. While the number of U.S. nationals taken hostage has decreased over the past 11 years, many cases are not being resolved,"" the report said, also noting that the number of U.S. nationals who continue to be wrongfully held by foreign governments has increased by 580% over the last decade.

2022-10-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/october-jolts-threaten-midterm-surprises-note/story?id=90870517,October jolts threaten to become midterm surprises: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The story of the midterms has yet to be written. But with barely a month to go before Election Day, a striking array of narratives are competing for attention -- any or all of which could wind up being of outsized consequence. There could be an October surprise in the form of a foreign-policy crisis – with a cornered Russian President Vladimir Putin challenging the world community and threatening further disruptions as a bad play on Ukraine turns worse. A jolt could also come domestically -- with another round of inflation data looming and Republicans getting traction with messaging around crime and immigration, both of which could easily begin resonating more. And the Supreme Court might not be done making headlines. A new term starts Monday with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on the bench, but with an ascendant conservative majority in a stronger place than ever in recent history as cases impacting affirmative action, gay rights, environmental protections and state legislative powers come up for argument. Surprises might come from familiar sources around election denialism. The coming weeks will bring a final Jan. 6 committee hearing in the House, debates -- or the lack thereof -- highlighting candidates who advance false claims about the last election and a picked-up pace of campaigning as well as legal scrutiny featuring former President Donald Trump. Amid swings in optimism and pessimism inside both major parties, it's worth remembering that sometimes October surprises aren't all that shocking. Sometimes the surprising things were there all along and just needed a nudge inside the news cycle. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The death toll continues to rise in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian and recovery could take years, according to Gov. Ron DeSantis. President Joe Biden has approved federal funding to cover the disaster response in the immediate aftermath of the storm that pummeled western Florida last week, but funding for the long-haul recovery necessary will be subject to congressional approval. In 2013, Sen. Marco Rubio (and then-congressman DeSantis) voted against recovery funds for Hurricane Sandy. Then, Rubio justified his ""no"" vote by blaming what he described as spending unrelated to the storm included in the legislation. Now, faced with a daunting recovery effort in his own state, the Florida Republican was challenged by ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl on if he'd vote against aid if the bill included add-ons. ""What we're going to ask for Florida is what we supported for every other state in the country that's been affected by natural disasters, and that's emergency relief designed to be sent immediately to help the people affected now,"" Rubio said. That commitment comes after Rubio and Sen. Rick Scott sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee asking for support in Ian's aftermath. President Biden is slated to travel to Puerto Rico Monday and Florida on Wednesday to survey the destruction and recovery from the recent storms -- Ian and Hurricane Fiona -- in person. Rubio told Karl on ""This Week"" that he's been pleased so far with the federal response: ""We're grateful for that."" The TIP with Lalee Ibssa In a blow to Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams less than 40 days until the midterm races, a federal judge last week upheld the state's election laws in ""what is believed to have been the longest voting rights bench trial in the history of the Northern District of Georgia,"" Judge Steve Jones wrote. The case -- filed by Abrams' Fair Fight Action shortly after her 2018 election loss to now-Gov. Brian Kemp -- targeted Georgia's policies on absentee ballot cancellations, management of voter rolls and ""exact match"" policies, which suspend a person's voting status if there are inconsistencies between their voter registration form and their identification. ""Although Georgia's election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the [Voting Rights Act],"" Jones wrote on Friday in his 288-page ruling. ""The court finds that the burden on voters is relatively low."" He added that the plaintiffs ""have not provided direct evidence of a voter who was unable to vote, experienced longer wait times, was confused about voter registration status."" In a statement, Abrams said the decision was ""not the preferred outcome"" but nonetheless represented a ""hard-won victory"" for Black and brown voters. ""This case and the public engagement on these issues have had measurable results: the reinstatement of over 22,000 ballots, substantive changes to voting laws, and a platform for voters of color to demand greater equity in our state,"" she said. Out on the campaign trail, Abrams continues to defend her criticism of Georgia's voting laws, often saying that Gov. Kemp created barriers for people to vote when he was serving as secretary of state – which, she has claimed despite setbacks like the ruling last week, played a role in her 2018 election loss. Meanwhile, Kemp took a victory lap following Friday's decision. ""Judge Jones' ruling exposes this legal effort for what it really is: a tool wielded by a politician hoping to wrongfully weaponize the legal system to further her own political goals ... In Georgia, it is easy to vote and hard to cheat - and I'm going to continue working to keep it that way,"" he said in a statement. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-10-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-1st-secretary-state-testifies-asked-tom-barrack/story?id=90939437,Trump's 1st secretary of state testifies he never asked Tom Barrack to 'conduct any diplomacy' for US,"Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson testified Monday during the illegal foreign lobbying trial of former Donald Trump ally Tom Barrack that he never asked Barrack to undertake any diplomacy on behalf of the United States during his year-long stint as Trump’s secretary of state. ""Did you ever ask Tom Barack to commit any diplomacy on behalf of the United States?"" prosecutor Hiral Mehta asked. “No,” Tillerson replied. Barrack, a billionaire California businessman who ran Trump's 2016 inaugural committee, is currently on trial in Brooklyn federal court for alleged illegal lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates before and during the Trump administration. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which Barrack's defense attorney has dismissed the charge as ridiculous. ""[The government's] accusations are nothing short of ridiculous. Tom Barrack was never under anybody's direction. Tom Barrack was never under anybody's control,"" said Michael Schachter, Barrack's attorney, during opening statements. ""Tom Barrack was his own man [and] said things because he wanted to."" Tillerson, the former chief diplomat of the United States, during his three hours on the stand said he had had no knowledge of Barrack's communications with the UAE. Prosecutors allege failing to register as a lobbyist for those communications constitutes a crime. But Tillerson also conceded there were conversations about foreign policy that he was not always a part of, including between Trump and his son-and-law, Jared Kushner -- who he said was also in communication with government officials, though not always in lockstep. ""It was evident that at times Mr. Kushner was engaging with the same government officials on the same issues I was engaging with them on and that those messages were not consistent,"" Tillerson said. Regardless, he emphasized the importance of transparency surrounding relationships with foreign governments. ""You always, in any communication, want to understand the context in which the information is coming to you,"" Tillerson said. Tillerson also testified that his dealings with Barrack were limited, but that Barrack had called him ""on a couple of occasions"" to discuss a potential ambassadorship. ""I recall him expressing interest in serving as an ambassador,"" said Tillerson, who said he brought the idea up to Trump, who ""did not direct [him] one way or another"" on the idea. On cross-examination, the defense sought to normalize Barrack's contacts with the UAE by likening them to Tillerson's own contacts with foreign government officials during his time as the chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil. Tillerson testified he took over one hundred foreign trips and met with dozens of foreign government officials when serving in that private role, including in the Middle East and Russia, in his efforts to promote the interests of his company. ""The fact that you were interacting with government officials in Russia... in no way meant you adopted all of their views or operated under their control, right?"" asked Randall Jackson, Barrack's attorney. ""We at all times represent our views, nobody else's,"" said Tillerson, who has since retired. But Tillerson said during that time, he explored registering. ""I had my attorneys look at the law,"" Tillerson said, ""and I wanted to be sure."" Barrack was arrested in California in July 2021, accused of using his connection to Trump to surreptitiously promote UAE interests. The trial is expected to last five weeks, attorneys said during a hearing earlier this year. According to the indictment, The UAE worked through Barrack ""to influence United States foreign policy in the first 100 days, 6 months, 1 year and 4 years of the Trump administration."" The UAE funds committed nearly $400 million to Barrack’s investment management firm, the indictment said, though it did not make clear whether Barrack’s firm ever received the money. The indictment released last July also charged Barrack with obstruction of justice and making multiple false statements during a June 20, 2019, interview with federal law enforcement agents.",0
2022-10-05,https://abcnews.go.com/International/catalan-separatist-movement-stalemate-years-independence-vote/story?id=91022032,Catalan separatist movement in Spain at 'stalemate' 5 years after independence vote,"LONDON -- When an independence referendum was held in Catalonia on Oct. 1, 2017, some citizens in Spain saw an illegal travesty -- and others viewed the vote as a sign of hope. Elisenda Paluzie, a University of Barcelona economics professor, who favors independence, said she endured an all-night plight to vote in the referendum after Spanish police confiscated ballot boxes at her voting center. The Parliament of Catalonia passed the referendum, but the Constitutional Court of Spain declared the vote unconstitutional. About 90% voted in favor of separating from Spain. The Spanish government placed doubt on the quality of these landslide results, alleging voters could cast multiple ballots. In the five years since the referendum, tensions within the wealthy, autonomous region of Spain have remained high, while the concerted effort to separate has waned, according to the Center for Opinion Studies. Despite the pandemic and war in Ukraine threatening Europe’s economy, the question of the region’s autonomy continues to polarize Catalonia, as recorded by the Library of Congress. Still, pro-independent activists and anti-separatists agree on one idea: the route to independence is uncertain. In the coming months and years, further developments could propel or quell the movement, including the Spanish elections on May 28, 2023, and Catalan regional elections in 2025, Paluzie said. Experts on both sides of the issue predict a right-wing win in upcoming elections would mobilize the movement, said Paluzie and anti-separation politician Rafael Arenas. Both sides doubt a future with compromise in it, they added. United Nations research published in the past six months said that at least 65 separatist leaders have been surveilled by spyware made by Israel's NSO Group. The spyware investigation lacks proof of Spanish federal involvement, said Arenas. One alleged target, Paluzie, also works as the vice president of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization in Washington. Since the referendum, she said the independence effort has mostly “retreated under repression.” “Now we are in a turning point of starting to retake positions,” Paluzie said. David Aguinaga, a city council member in Terrassa, east of Barcelona, said Catalonia is still “at a stalemate.” Aguinaga said he opposes the movement because he believes in the Spanish constitution. He said he didn't vote in the referendum. “This isn’t a conflict between Spain and Catalonia,” Aguinaga said. “This is a civil conflict in Catalonia, among those who are for independence, and those who are against independence.” From 2015 to 2016, Arenas, the former president of Societat Civil Catalana, utilized the courts to remove public funding and enact bans against local governments using public buildings to display Catalonian flags, which he said were “using public funds for partisan propaganda.” Societat Civil Catalana is an organization countering the independence movement. On Aug. 31, the U.N. Human Rights Committee said Spain violated international human rights by suspending four Catalan independence leaders from their positions. Erika Casajoana, deputy representative of the Catalan Government to the EU, said the negotiations on the global stage have been hard-fought, like the debates at home. “Victories before international institutions justify us, but will not get us to independence, we need to make independence ourselves,” Casajoana said. An obstacle to those seeking independence is their lack of singular leadership, Casajoana said. The two biggest pro-independence parties in the Catalan government -- Esquerra Republicana (the Catalan Republican Left) and Junts (Together for Catalonia party) -- are evenly matched in the Catalan parliament, splintering the movement’s efforts. “There's no way back,” Casajoana said. “We only can break away. The moment Spain lifts the boot, boom, we are gone.”",3
2022-10-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/florida-georgia-showcase-trumpism-potential-limits-note/story?id=90983129,Florida and Georgia showcase Trumpism and its potential limits: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein A typical post-storm meeting and a less-than-typical political imbroglio are together dominating midterm messaging -- with Donald Trump as an intriguing through-line and wild card. In Florida on Wednesday, President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet with a man widely seen as wanting his job -- on a day the former and perhaps would-be-future president also appears in another part of the state. Just to the north, in Georgia, the Senate race has been rocked by new revelations and a raw family dispute surrounding Herschel Walker, the Trump-endorsed GOP nominee who is now testing Trumpian tactics and assumptions. Biden's meeting with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, as they jointly survey damage from Hurricane Ian on Wednesday, was previewed by the White House as ""not the time"" for political differences to be aired. It's not so likely that message will apply to Trump, who will be in Miami for a conference of conservative Latino leaders. Meanwhile, Trump is standing by Walker -- his longtime friend and hand-picked Senate candidate -- even while Walker's son Christian makes clear he thinks his father isn't telling the truth. That son, for what it's worth, is a conservative influencer who has long been a public booster of DeSantis -- himself hardly a Trump favorite at the moment. The overlapping storylines point to another stark reality: If the elder Walker hangs on amid the latest scandal about him, it will be an act of political survival straight out of the Trump playbook. The GOP's congressional hopes once again hinge on Trumpism, if not Trump himself. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper National Republican figures are, so far, sticking by Walker after his forceful denial of a bombshell Daily Beast report that an ex-girlfriend claimed he paid for her abortion more than a decade ago. (""It's a lie,"" Walker said on Fox News.) ""They know they are on the verge of losing the Senate and they know that Herschel Walker is winning, so they have cranked up the smear machine,"" Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the GOP's campaign arm in the Senate, said Tuesday. Trump, whose endorsement was critical to Walker's primary win, also reiterated his support on Tuesday. ""Herschel has properly denied the charges against him and I have no doubt he is correct,"" Trump said in a statement. The accusations of mudslinging from the right are complicated, of course, by Walker's own son slamming him publicly via social media. The results of Walker's race against Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock could determine the balance of power in the Senate. And, just 34 days before Election Day, the GOP has few options for recourse. Perhaps, like his presidential endorser's infamous ""Access Hollywood' tape, a scandal of this nature may not be completely disqualifying for Walker in the current GOP. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The debate over voting rights reached the nation's highest court on Tuesday as justices weighed potential limits on the Voting Rights Act. The case stems from the impact of the redistricting process in Alabama where new maps drawn by the majority-Republican legislature created a single majority-Black district, despite 27% of the state's population being Black. A group of Black Alabama residents challenged the configuration, saying the map violates the Voting Rights Act, which requires states to provide minority voters with ""an equal opportunity to participate in the political process."" The group says the map dilutes the voting power of Black citizens and that the state is obligated to create another majority-Black district. Meanwhile, Alabama defended the map by saying it was created in a race-neutral process and that the creation of a second majority-Black district would impose race-based discrimination. ""We're talking about a situation in which race has already infused the voting system. So can you help me understand why you think that the world of, you know, race-blind redistricting is really the starting point in this situation?"" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked Alabama's solicitor general, Edmund LaCour, during oral arguments. Although LaCour replied that the effort was meant ""to make sure that no one is being harmed,"" the case heightens the stakes of the existing power of the Voting Rights Act. Civil rights groups have already expressed concerns about the future of the landmark law following a series of decisions by the Supreme Court's conservative majority addressing racial discrimination in the voting process. As reported by ABC News' Devin Dwyer, Tuesday's arguments demonstrated an openness from several of those justices to raising the legal bar for challenges to maps that may deny a minority group equal opportunity to elect preferred candidates. In one exchange, Samuel Alito suggested the current legal standard for challenges to maps is so broad that it could consistently skew toward plaintiffs, making it potentially impossible for states to win. The court is expected to hand down a decision next year. But in the meantime, the contested maps will be in place for this year's midterm elections. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-10-06,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/herschel-walker-tests-partys-patience-words-note/story?id=91059571,Herschel Walker tests his party's patience with own words: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein In keeping his party united behind him, Herschel Walker is the beneficiary of years' worth of battles waged by others -- media-intensive fights over congressional candidates, Supreme Court justices and, of course, former President Donald Trump. But Walker himself may pose the biggest challenge from here to efforts to keep the GOP behind his Senate candidacy in Georgia. In the days since his latest scandal broke -- when he denied a news report that he paid for an ex-girlfriend's abortion in 2009 -- he has offered incomplete statements in his defense and has not filed the lawsuit against The Daily Beast that he promised. He spent the last two days ducking media coverage, save for a pair of Fox News interviews where he offered denials but also said he is ""living proof that you can make mistakes"" and suggested that son Christian, who publicly denounced him, is enabling ""the left"" by saying he believes the latest allegations. Thursday brings Walker's first public event in days, a ""Unite Georgia"" bus-tour stop where it will be harder to avoid questions from the press. Prominent Republicans in Georgia have been notably less quick to vouch for his version of events on this or other matters, even as they stand with him as their only chance at this point in a pivotal state. Numerous Walker supporters interviewed by ABC News this week in Georgia say they just don't care about his past actions enough to rethink their choice. One thing that might help Walker is that he's been there before -- battling allegations, making denials and even making things more confusing with what he has said. ""There might not be many voters left to turn on Walker"" in a state with few true ""swing"" voters, FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich writes. For all that, it's more than conceivable that Walker wins his race against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. That remains Republicans' hope -- with faith placed in Walker to run the same game-plan that got him to this point. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The OPEC+ alliance's decision to cut oil production in November to shore up prices could be a blow to President Joe Biden and Democrats more broadly, as the nation closes in on midterm elections and the party in power hopes to keep domestic gas prices and other costs on the downswing. The alliance is slated to cut production quotas by two million barrels a day, which could result in higher prices at the gas pump for Americans already struggling to keep up with high costs from inflation and other forces. The OPEC+ news comes after Biden's summer trip to the Middle East during which he urged leaders in the region to up production to bring costs down -- which have been a major drag on the president's approval ratings. Soaring costs would run counter to midterm messaging from the White House touting lower gas prices and progress in the continued fight against inflation via legislative wins like the Inflation Reduction Act. Administration officials expressed dissatisfaction on Wednesday with the oil producing group's move. ""The president is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of [Vladimir] Putin's invasion of Ukraine,"" the White House said in a statement from the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese. The White House has said that 10 million oil barrels from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be released next month, a tactic that could help keep prices down. But if that effort is unsuccessful, it could spell trouble for Democrats just before votes are tallied in crucial elections. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Incumbent Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett are set to face off Thursday evening in their final debate of the midterm season after having already clashed on stage last month. Thursday's debate is happening a week after early voting opened to Michigan voters who requested absentee ballots and puts one of the nation's most competitive congressional districts in the spotlight in the wake of census-mandated map redrawing. According to FiveThirtyEight, the new boundaries of Michigan's 7th District -- where Slotkin and Barrett are campaigning -- slightly narrowed to a +4 Republican partisan lean from its 2020 partisan leaning of +6. Although Slotkin has already served two terms in a district that had a higher Republican leaning, it remains to be seen whether national policy issues surrounding abortion and the economy impact the race. Meanwhile, in another redrawn and competitive seat, Slotkin's Democratic colleague Elaine Luria of Virginia is facing the opposite issue when it comes to partisan leans. Virginia's 2nd District -- where Luria has served since 2019 -- used to be more evenly split, with a +2 Republican lean in 2020, which grew to a +6 lean as the district stretched farther to the west after redistricting. As evidenced by ongoing hits from the National Republican Congressional Committee and Congressional Leadership Fund that tie Luria to Biden, the slight shift could be giving the GOP hope of claiming the district this fall due to evolving national sentiments. Redistricting could offer better odds for Democrats in Texas' 34th District, despite it being occupied by Republican Rep. Mayra Flores, who won the deep blue area in a special election earlier this year. Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez -- who currently represents the neighboring 15th -- is running in place of retired Rep. Filemon Vela, whose vacancy opened the doors for Flores' victory. The race now puts two House incumbents against one another, but the +17 Democratic partisan leaning could complicate the sprint to November. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-10-06,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russians-seeking-asylum-arrive-boat-rural-alaska-senators/story?id=91123043,"2 Russians seeking asylum arrive by boat to rural Alaska, senators say","A pair of Russian nationals have requested asylum in the U.S. after arriving on Alaska's St. Lawrence Island earlier this week, Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan said in a press release on Thursday. The Department of Homeland Security said the two people arrived on a small boat on Tuesday and were met by DHS officials and state police. ""The individuals were transported to Anchorage for inspection, which includes a screening and vetting process, and then subsequently processed in accordance with applicable U.S. immigration laws under the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" a DHS spokesperson told ABC News in a statement Thursday. While it's unclear why the two Russians fled the country, Sullivan said he believes it's because of Russia's war against Ukraine. ""This incident makes two things clear: First, the Russian people don't want to fight [President Vladimir] Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine,"" he said in the press release. ""Second, given Alaska's proximity to Russia, our state has a vital role to play in securing America's national security."" The Russian Embassy in D.C. is aware that the two nationals are with authorities in Alaska, according to Nadezhda Shumova, head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy. ""The diplomats plan to hold a telephone conversation with them and provide the necessary assistance,"" Shumova told ABC News. ""We are actively engaged with federal officials and residents in Gambell to determine who these individuals are, but right now, we already know that the federal response was lacking,"" Murkowski said in the release. ""This situation underscores the need for a stronger security posture in America's Arctic."" Lead State Department spokesperson Ned Price said last week that it's important for the U.S. to have an open-door policy to Russians who can come into the country, especially during the country's invasion of Ukraine. ""We think it's important for our part, to continue to have our doors open to Russians who are in a position to come to this country, and we have seen over the course of this war, potentially hundreds of thousands of Russians quite literally vote with their feet,"" he told ABC News at the time.

2022-10-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nobel-peace-prize-awarded-belarusian-human-rights-advocate/story?id=91154539,Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Belarusian human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski and 2 organizations,"The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to Belarusian human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski and two groups, Memorial, a human rights organization from Russia and the Center for Civil Liberties, which is based in Ukraine. The prizes were awarded for contributions to civil society, according to the committee. Bialiatski ""devoted his life to promoting democracy and peaceful development in his home country,"" founding the organization Viasna to counter the dictatorial powers granted to the Belarusian president, according to an announcement for the prize. As a result of his work, Bialiatski was jailed from 2011 to 2014 and arrested again in 2020. Currently he is being detained without trial, the committee said. Memorial, founded in 1987 under the former Soviet Union, grew to become the biggest human rights organization in Russia. It ""became the most authoritative source of information on political prisoners in Russian detention facilities,"" according to the announcement. Perils attached to the work -- in 2009, the head of the group's branch in Chechnya was killed. And the Center for Civil Liberties, founded in 2007, has dedicated itself to making Ukraine a ""full-fledged democracy."" Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, it has ""engaged in efforts to identify and document Russian war crimes against the Ukrainian civilian population."" Last year, the prize was given to two journalists, Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov, for their work in the Philippines and Russia respectively. Ressa co-founded an investigative journalism company and worked to shine a spotlight on former president Rodrigo Duterte's brutal anti-drug campaign, according to the prize announcement. Muratov was credited with founding the ""most independent"" newspaper in Russia today, Novaya Gazeta, which has garnered ""harassment, threats, violence and murder,"" including the killings of six of its journalists, the announcement said. Past Nobel Peace Prize winners have included former Presidents Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter, Nelson Mandel, Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King Jr. Since the program's inception in 1901. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been awarded the prize three times.",12
2022-10-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/foreign-actors-information-manipulation-tactics-2022-election-feds/story?id=91160649,Foreign actors 'likely' to use 'information manipulation' tactics during 2022 election: Feds,"Foreign actors are ""likely"" to use ""information manipulation"" to try to influence the 2022 election, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and FBI warn in a new bulletin. ""Foreign actors may intensify efforts to influence outcomes of the 2022 midterm elections by circulating or amplifying reports of real or alleged malicious cyber activity on election infrastructure,"" the public service announcement dated Oct. 6 states. ""Additionally, these foreign actors may create and knowingly disseminate false claims and narratives regarding voter suppression, voter or ballot fraud, and other false information intended to undermine confidence in the election processes and influence public opinion of the elections' legitimacy."" CISA is the cyber arm of the Department of Homeland Security. The law enforcement agencies cite previous elections where foreign governments, without directly naming any, have attempted to influence the election and ""incite violence"" as a result of spreading misinformation. In the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, the U.S. government identified Russia, China and Iran as election disrupters. ""Foreign actors can use a number of methods to knowingly spread and amplify false claims and narratives about malicious cyber activity, voting processes, and results surrounding the midterm election cycle,"" the alert says. ""These actors use publicly available and dark web media channels, online journals, messaging applications, spoofed websites, emails, text messages, and fake online personas on U.S. and foreign social media platforms to spread and amplify these false claims."" John Cohen, the former Acting Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security said it is ""critical"" local, state and federal officials come together to ""understand the risks posed by these foreign and domestic threat actors and take steps to protect elections officials, workers and infrastructure from physical and cyberattacks."" ""As we approach the midterm elections, state and local officials face a number of highly dangerous election-related threats ranging from cyberattacks and information operations by hostile foreign powers to threats of violence directed at election officials and infrastructure,"" Cohen, an ABC News contributor said. ""The security of the nation depends on it."" In one example, federal officials say foreign actors might try and say hackers have compromised voter registration data -- that voter registration data is publicly available from state and local governments. ""These efforts by foreign actors aim to undermine voter confidence and to entice unwitting consumers of information and third-party individuals to like, discuss, share, and amplify the spread of false or misleading narratives,"" the alert says. ""The FBI and CISA urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information from trusted sources, such as state and local election officials and reputable news media. The FBI and CISA will continue to quickly respond to potential threats, by seeking to engage with state and local officials and the public when possible."" Earlier this week, officials from the Department laid out what they see as the biggest threats to the 2022 midterm elections. Among the ""big four"" areas of concern Jenn Easterly, the director of CISA says, are insider threats, threats from state-sponsored actors, physical threats and disinformation. ""Cybersecurity threats from sophisticated state sponsored threat actors, but also from cyber criminals, we still worry about potential ransomware attacks, insider threats from people with institutional knowledge and current or prior Authorized Access to equipment or sensitive information,"" she told reporters on Monday, adding they've seen examples of these activities but declined to provide any. ""We've seen some of this increasing physical security concerns which very sadly include unprecedented levels of threats and harassment targeting election officials and, increasing myths and disinformation about elections that that undermine confidence in our democratic institutions."" Easterly told ABC News that the challenges are ""interconnected"" and cannot be viewed individually, especially when it comes to foreign threat actors.",12
2022-10-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-day-office-sensitive-documents-allegedly-disarray/story?id=90989613,"On Trump's last day in office, why were sensitive documents allegedly in such disarray?","At the end of Donald Trump’s presidency, his team returned a large batch of classified FBI documents and other government records to the Justice Department in such disarray that a year later -- in a letter to lawmakers -- the department said it still couldn’t tell which of the documents were the classified ones. The documents came from the FBI’s controversial probe in 2016 looking at alleged links between Russia and Trump's presidential campaign. Trump tried to make the documents public the night before he left office, issuing a “declassification” memo and secretly meeting with conservative writer John Solomon, who was allowed to review the documents, Solomon told ABC News this past week. But for reasons that are still not clear – and to the great frustration of Trump and his political allies – none of the documents were ever officially released, and the Justice Department said Thursday it's still working to determine which documents can be disclosed. “[T]he Justice Department has ... failed to declassify a single page,"" Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., complained to the attorney general in February. Much of what happened with the documents in those last days of the Trump administration -- and ever since -- remains shrouded in mystery because current and former government officials involved have refused to speak about it, especially now that the FBI is pursuing its investigation into Trump’s alleged mishandling of a separate cache of classified documents. The story that still emerges, though, from pieces of public statements and Solomon’s own accounts is one that sheds further light on how Trump’s White House treated certain government secrets. And it helps explain how – in the midst of the FBI probe – Solomon became one of Trump’s official “representatives” to the National Archives. By the middle of Trump’s presidency, Solomon had become one of Trump’s favorite voices in media. ""John Solomon should get the Pulitzer Prize,"" Trump said to cheers at a rally in Louisiana in October 2019. At the time, Solomon was promoting a series of since-discredited claims about supposed Obama-era corruption in Ukraine, claims which Trump then privately pushed the Ukrainian president to investigate, leading to Trump's first impeachment. Solomon's own employer then, The Hill newspaper, eventually launched an internal review and concluded his Ukraine-related pieces ""potentially blurred the distinction between news and opinion"" and at times failed to include relevant ""context and/or disclosure[s]."" Solomon has stood by those pieces, insisting still that they were accurate. His work at the time was also focused on the FBI’s Russia-related investigation and its offshoots, which he described as ""a sin against Donald Trump,"" an ""offense against the entire American people,"" and “arguably the most devious political dirty trick in American history.” ""Thank God we have [Solomon and several Fox News hosts] on our side,"" Trump declared at the 2019 rally. So when Trump and his team were determined to push out the so-called ""full story"" of ""the Russia hoax"" before Trump's presidency ended, Solomon was well-positioned to help, with his online media platforms and regular TV appearances. ""We worked closely together in trying to get to the truth on that,"" Solomon recounted to Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in an interview with him last year. In its final report on the investigation, the Justice Department’s internal watchdog said that while it found “fundamental errors” and significant “failures” in the FBI probe, it found no evidence that “political bias or improper motivation influenced” the investigation, including the decision to eavesdrop on one of Trump’s former campaign advisers. But Trump and many of his allies contended otherwise. With just weeks left as president, Trump ""demanded"" that ""key documents"" – still classified by the FBI and Justice Department – “be brought to the White House” so they could be “entered into the public record once and for all,” Meadows wrote in a memoir published last year. On Dec. 30, 2020, the Justice Department delivered a binder filled with internal notes, memos, emails and other records. The White House was unsure of what should be disclosed, so Trump’s team asked a group of Republican staffers on the House Intelligence Committee to make recommendations, a congressional source informed of the request told ABC News. “[It’s] a foot-and-a-half of documents, almost everything that the FBI had left out of public sight,” Solomon said in an interview with a right-wing website on Jan. 14, 2021, predicting that the documents could be “made public as early as tomorrow.” But the FBI objected to ""any"" release at all, Trump’s ""declassification"" memo said. ""The FBI has concerns about everything, from the protection of assets and codenames, and prior investigations that may be referenced in the Russia materials, to Privacy Act stuff,"" Solomon said in an interview with another right-wing website on Jan. 18, 2021. ""There’s been a lot of back and forth."" The FBI even sent a letter to the White House identifying passages in documents that were particularly ""crucial to keep from public disclosure,"" the subsequent memo said. Trump then agreed to some redactions, declaring that everything else in the binder was declassified, according to the memo. “I personally went through every page, to make sure that the President’s declassification would not inadvertently disclose sources and methods,” Meadows wrote in his book. It’s unclear if the FBI and Justice Department ever agreed with the review Meadows conducted. Around that time, White House staffers produced multiple copies of documents from the binder, a former Trump administration official told ABC News. Trump formally issued his “declassification” memo regarding those documents at around 7 p.m. ET on his last full day in office, Jan. 19, 2021, the same day Solomon allegedly met with him. ""I had a brief interview with President Trump in which he told me unequivocally he had signed the order completing the [declassification] and that I would be getting a set of the declassified documents to post online for the public,"" Solomon told ABC News in a statement this past week. ""Later that same day, I was allowed, on two occasions, to briefly review a stack of documents that I was told were the declassified documents. I wasn't allowed to keep the documents either time, but was told I would get a full set later in the day."" Shortly after 9 p.m. ET that day, Solomon appeared on Fox News and said he had ""been through all the documents at least one time now."" He told ABC News the documents he reviewed had redactions, cross-outs and other “markings on them indicating they had been declassified” – though at least some of them were not stamped “declassified,” as formally-declassified documents often are. Nevertheless, on the same day Solomon met with Trump and reviewed the documents, the Justice Department and U.S. intelligence community ""were trying to get the documents back"" from the White House,” Solomon said in a subsequent interview on Fox Business Network. Several people at the White House ""were fearful that something was going to happen to the larger batch,"" so they took steps to get at least ""some of the documents"" to Solomon, he said in a separate interview on Newsmax TV last September. That night, a ""courier"" or staffer he didn’t know delivered a package to his Washington, D.C., office with a ""small batch"" of the documents in it, he told ABC News. The envelope carrying the documents had the Justice Department insignia on it, he said. Meadows did not respond to questions from ABC News, and the Justice Department declined to comment for this article. Just before his Fox News appearance the night of Jan. 19, 2021, Solomon published a piece online revealing the ""First Trump declassified Russia document,"" which he told ABC News came in the package he received. The document was an FBI report detailing two September 2017 interviews with Christopher Steele, the former British spy whose ""dossier"" -- much of it since debunked -- was used to separately convince four federal judges that the FBI should be allowed to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign adviser. ""There are some bombshell revelations,"" Solomon said of the FBI report on Fox News. Despite such rhetoric, it’s unclear how much new information the documents could actually reveal about any FBI missteps or alleged bias in 2016. Meadows claimed in his book that ""several key papers"" could ""unravel the full story of how the United States intelligence community had targeted President Trump, spied on his campaign, and attempted to bring him down."" And on Fox News that night, Solomon called the FBI report ""the most important of all the documents."" As Solomon touted it at the time, the FBI report supposedly revealed that Steele viewed Trump as his ""main opponent,"" that he was worried Trump would hurt the U.S.-U.K. relationship, and that he leaked information about Trump and the FBI to the media because of Hillary Clinton’s ongoing email scandal during the 2016 campaign. But records with that same information had been released by Senate Republicans seven weeks earlier and mentioned in the Justice Department inspector general’s report two years earlier, which outlined Steele’s ""bias against Trump"" and questions about the credibility of Steele’s sources. Next week, one of Steele’s primary sources, Igor Danchenko, is set to go on trial in Virginia for allegedly lying to the FBI about his own sources of information as the FBI was trying to vet Steele's ""dossier."" Danchenko has pleaded not guilty in the case. On the morning of Jan. 20, 2021 – with just two hours left before Joe Biden would become president – Meadows found himself racing to the White House to retrieve at least some of the documents, he recalled in his book. And in a memo to then-acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen that morning, Meadows said he would be returning “the bulk of the binder” to the Justice Department. According to the memo, which Solomon later obtained, and more recent statements from Meadows, the department raised last-minute concerns about ""privacy” and “personal information.” So “out of an abundance of caution” the White House gave the documents back to the Justice Department “to do final redactions,” he said in an interview with Solomon last December. The New York Times recently reported that the privacy concerns stemmed from years-old text messages between then-FBI agent Peter Strzok and his romantically-connected colleague Lisa Page, who in 2016 exchanged a series of anti-Trump sentiments as they worked on the Russia-related probe. Meadows said he expected that when the ""final redactions"" were completed, the documents would be released. But that never happened. “[D]etermining precisely what was declassified by [Trump] has proven challenging given the manner in which the relevant records were returned to the Department on January 20, 2021,” the Justice Department wrote Grassley and Johnson earlier this year, after they repeatedly expressed concern that none of the documents had been released. “The Department has been taking steps to determine what material is appropriately and lawfully disclosable.” The National Archives also received a batch of related documents, which were similarly delivered in a not “easily discernible manner,” Solomon quoted the National Archives as telling him. Efforts by ABC News to understand why at least two separate tranches of documents were allegedly both in such disarray were not successful. Meanwhile, Meadows allegedly kept copies of at least some of those documents himself after leaving government. In a newly-released book, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said Trump told her in an interview last year, months after leaving the White House, that Meadows still had ""in his possession"" the internal FBI text messages between Strzok and Page that Trump planned to make public on his last night in office. ""[Trump] offered to connect me with him,"" Haberman wrote. As for Solomon, he told ABC News he never received the full set of documents Trump promised him. The conservative group Judicial Watch recently filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to force the Justice Department to release all of the document In a court filing Thursday, the department said it is now ""processing"" 815 pages relevant to Judicial Watch's request and expects to start releasing ""non-exempt records"" in late December. It's unclear if the Biden administration may have reclassified any of the documents that Trump previously declared as ""declassified."" In June, Trump announced he had designated Solomon and a former Trump administration official, Kash Patel, as his official representatives to the National Archives. By then, a federal grand jury was already weeks into its investigation of Trump’s alleged refusal to return sensitive government documents to the National Archives and his alleged mishandling of national security documents at Mar-a-Lago. When the FBI then sought approval from a judge to raid Mar-a-Lago, it noted – among many other things – that Patel publicly claimed Trump had already ""declassified the materials at issue."" The next two-and-a-half pages of the FBI's submission to the judge were completely redacted. In a recent interview on Fox News, Trump made a series of widely-disputed claims about a president's authority to declassify information. ""If you’re the president of the United States, you can declassify ... [just] by thinking about it,"" Trump said. ""So when you send it, it’s declassified. I declassified everything."" After the raid at Mar-a-Lago, Solomon issued a statement insisting his role as Trump’s representative to the National Archives ""has nothing to do with the [FBI] investigation."" He was acting ""as a reporter in an effort to resolve the question of what happened to the Russia probe documents that former President Trump declassified but which were never released,"" he said. Solomon has denounced the FBI investigation as the ""criminalization of a records dispute."" According to the Justice Department, hundreds of documents marked classified, including many marked “top secret,” were kept in unsecure locations at Mar-a-Lago after Trump left office. And a federal appeals court recently noted that, with respect to documents found during the raid, Trump has offered “no evidence that any of these records were declassified.”",11
2022-10-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/500-children-reunited-biden-harris-task-force-200/story?id=91180989,"500 children reunited with families by Biden-Harris task force, nearly 200 still in process","More than 500 children have been reunited by the Biden administration's task force to find families separated as a result of the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy at the border, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Friday. ""This is a significant milestone that reflects the tireless dedication of the many public servants in the Department of Homeland Security and across the federal government, including those in the Departments of Health and Human Services, State, and Justice,"" Mayorkas said in a statement. ""It is a milestone that we could not have achieved without the partnership and critical work of several incredibly committed non-governmental organizations."" Nearly 200 other children have yet to be reunited and are in the process, Mayorkas said. The administration had previously identified 3,855 total children who would qualify for government-assisted reunification, according to the last formal progress report from the task force in July. Since then, the administration has now reached out to about 150 families who are eligible but have not responded. Prior to the establishment of the task force, some 2,260 known children were reunified. The work is done in connection with international non-governmental organizations including the International Organization for Migration and the UN Refugee Agency. Human rights workers have fanned out across Central America, traveling over 62,000 miles to find separated parents. ""We will continue to work tirelessly to deliver on President Biden's commitment to reunite children separated from their families at the United States-Mexico border,"" Mayorkas said Friday. Those admitted for reunification receive humanitarian parole for three years to live and work in the U.S. The status is similar to those who have fled Afghanistan and Ukraine over the past year. The administration continues to operate two websites -- Together.gov and Juntos.gov -- where families can register to check their eligibility. So far, the government has registered about 1,700. Once found eligible, families then submit documentation to receive parole, allowing them to enter the U.S. The government is also providing families access to mental health services as part of the reunification effort. Last month, the Justice Department asked a federal judge to approve a new round of psychological evaluations for those separated and a part of an ongoing lawsuit in Arizona federal court. Five mothers who were separated from their kids are seeking compensation for mental health damages from the U.S. government. Lee Gelernt, the lead ACLU attorney representing migrant families said in a statement to ABC News that the progress was notable, but much more work needs to be done, noting they continue to look for 150 separated families. ""The task force should be given credit for reunifying 500 families, but unfortunately there is still a long way to go to remedy the historic wrong committed by the Trump administration,"" Gelernt said. ""Beyond reunification, these families deserve comprehensive relief, including a chance to remain in the United States."" Armando Garcia and Luke Barr contributed to this report.",12
2022-10-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-back-off-armageddon-language-work-russia-table/story?id=91211746,"Biden needs to 'back off' Armageddon language, work to get Russia to the table with Ukraine: Mullen","President Joe Biden’s warning last week that Vladimir Putin was ""not joking"" about possibly using nuclear weapons was ""concerning"" and counterproductive to bringing an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, retired Adm. Mike Mullen said Sunday. Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was asked in an interview on ABC's ""This Week"" to assess the nuclear risk from Russia after Putin said he would use ""all available means"" to protect what he called his country's territorial integrity. “President Biden's language -- we're about at the top of the language scale, if you will. And I think we need to back off that a little bit and do everything we possibly can to try to get to the table to resolve this thing,” Mullen told ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. Mullen was referring to what Biden said on Thursday when he warned that for the ""first time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have the direct threat of the use of a nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path that they are going."" “I don't think there's any such thing as the ability to easily [use] a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon,"" Biden said then. The White House has since clarified that the president was not acting on new intelligence of looming danger but was trying to underline the stakes given the current conflict in Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have recaptured ground in the country's contested eastern and southern regions and have pushed back Russian troops. On ""This Week,"" Raddatz pressed Mullen on his proposed resolution: “How do you see him [Putin] saving face if he doesn't come to the table? If Ukraine can't figure anything out?” Diplomacy and international pressure on both Ukraine and Russia would ultimately be key, Mullen argued. “It's got to end and usually there are negotiations associated with that,” he said. “The sooner the better, as far as I'm concerned.” Putin is ""pretty well cornered and boxed in,"" Mullen said. And potential use of tactical nuclear weapons could cause problems for Russia's president at home: ""The winds all blow back onto Russia, so he would have to, in a way, contaminate his own country."" Forecasting a possible strike, Mullen said Putin ""could pick a symbolic target. He could pick [Ukraine President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy’s hometown, for instance."" Raddatz opened Mullen's interview Sunday by having him respond to John Kirby, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, who also went one-on-one with Raddatz on Sunday. Kirby said that the Biden administration’s strategy against nuclear threats from North Korea was both to ensure the U.S. can ""defend our national security interests"" and to pursue direct talks with Kim Jong Un's regime to denuclearize the region. “Do you see any strategy differences? Do you see anything that’s going to work?” Raddatz asked Mullen in light of Kirby's comments. “I believe for some time that the path to any resolution of this has got to go through Beijing -- pressure brought on by Xi Jinping, with respect to dealing with Kim Jong Un,"" Mullen said, referring to China's leader. ""I'm fine with us negotiating directly, if that’s what Kim Jong Un wants to do."" ""Is denuclearization really realistic at this point?"" Raddatz asked. “I think sometimes we lose perspective on how devastating these weapons are. And I think we need to do everything we possibly can to the extreme to make sure that that still is a possibility,” Mullen said. ""And I'm just not willing to admit that it isn’t yet. I know it’s difficult."" Raddatz cited Mullen's view in 2017 that North Korea had increased the possibility of nuclear war to a historic high. ""How about now?"" she asked. ""I think in the end it comes down to will he [Kim] ever use it? And I just don’t know the answer to that,"" Mullen said. But he was concerned: “I think it’s more possible than it was five years ago.""",7
2022-10-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/murphy-democrats-call-consequences-saudi-arabia-oil-production/story?id=91245011,Murphy and other Democrats call for 'consequences' for Saudi Arabia over oil production cut,"Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy on Sunday called for a change in Washington's ties to Saudi Arabia after the country and other members of the OPEC+ alliance decided to significantly cut production later this year in a move that will likely drive up the slumping cost of crude oil. Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Murphy added to the growing number of Democrats arguing that the U.S. should, as he put it, ""rethink"" the relationship with the Gulf kingdom in light of the announced 2-million-barrel-per-day cut in oil production as well as Riyadh's human rights record. The forthcoming restrictions by OPEC+, which will begin in November, come after President Joe Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia this summer seeking, in part, to lower domestic gas prices before the midterms. But OPEC+ said the cuts announced last week were necessary to help support the international price for oil. The global market has been roiled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other forces. ""We are here to stay as a moderating force, to bring about stability,"" a Saudi minister said Wednesday. The cuts, the minister insisted, were not about ""belligerence."" Biden told ABC News on Thursday he was unhappy with the move. And while he maintained that the trip was not essentially for oil. ... It is a disappointment and it says that there are problems."" On CNN on Sunday, Murphy said that ""it’s clear that we didn’t get as much as we needed to."" ""We wanted to know that when the chips were down, when there was a global crisis, that the Saudis would choose us instead of Russia. Well -- they didn't. They chose Russia. They chose to back up the Russians, drive up oil prices, which could have the potential to fracture our Ukraine coalition. And there's got to be consequences for that,"" Murphy said. ""We sell massive amounts of arms to the Saudis. I think we need to rethink those sales,"" he said. ""I think we need to lift the exemption that we have given this OPEC+ cartel from U.S. price-fixing liability. I think we need to look at our troop presence in the middle East and Saudi Arabia,"" he said. ""For years we have looked the other way as Saudi Arabia has chopped up journalists, has engaged in massive political repression."" Beyond rethinking the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, Murphy also focused on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's de facto ruler, whom Biden met with in July in negotiations that drew scrutiny given that U.S. intelligence has assessed bin Salman approved the killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The prince has continued to claim he was not involved, though Biden said he raised the issue at their meeting this summer. Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fiancée, sharply criticized Biden's ""heartbreaking"" decision to travel to Saudi Arabia. While running for president in 2019, Biden said he would make the country a ""pariah."" Murphy's comments on Sunday follow similar calls from other Democrats last week for some kind of punishment after the oil production cut. A trio of House Democrats introduced a bill to remove the U.S. military presence from Saudi Arabia. ""Many argued that we had to 'repair' our relationship with our Gulf partners to win their cooperation in stabilizing global energy markets following Russia’s invasion, and President Biden made every effort to do so, going so far as to meet the Saudi Crown Prince personally in Riyadh, despite his role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,"" Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois, Tom Malinowski of New Jersey and Pennsylvania's Susan Wild said in a joint statement last week. ""It is time for the United States to resume acting like the superpower in our relationship with our client states in the Gulf. They have made a choice and should live with the consequences. Our troops and military equipment are needed elsewhere,"" the trio said. The White House, while disagreeing with the production cuts, is remaining tight-lipped about how it plans to respond to OPEC+, which is unofficially led by Riyadh.

2022-10-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/horrific-biden-officials-condemn-russias-sweeping-strikes-ukraine/story?id=91299948,"'Horrific': Biden, more officials condemn Russia's sweeping strikes on Ukraine and reconfirm US aid","Joe Biden and top U.S. officials on Monday denounced Russia's latest aerial assault across Ukraine, with the president saying in a statement that the attacks ""only further reinforce our commitment"" to supplying billions in aid and weapons to Ukrainian forces. Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and leading military officials all spoke out in the wake of the strikes that Russian President Vladimir Putin called retaliation for a weekend explosion that damaged a key bridge linking Russia and Crimea, the disputed peninsula Putin annexed from Ukraine in 2014. On Sunday night, 12 Russian missile strikes hit residential Zaporizhzhia neighborhoods in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said, and on Monday morning another series of Russian missiles struck civilian targets in Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv and other cities. At least 11 people died and 64 were wounded across eight oblasts and the capital of Kyiv, according to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service, while power and other critical infrastructure services like energy were interrupted in several cities. ""A massive strike of high-precision, long-range weapons has been delivered from air, land and sea on Ukraine's energy facilities, military command and communication,"" Putin said in a speech Monday. ""In the case of continuing terrorist attack on our territory, the answers from Russia will be severe and by their scale correspond to the level of threat created for the Russian Federation. No one should have any doubts about that."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy quickly shared his outrage on social media, lamenting the civilian casualties of Russia's military, as he has done repeatedly in the eight-month-old war. (Russia insists it seeks to avoid targeting civilians, despite the record of aerial strikes like those this week.) ""The world once again saw the true face of a terrorist state that is killing our people. On the battlefield & in peaceful cities. A country that covers its true bloody essence & goal with talks about peace. It proves that the liberation of is the only basis of peace & security,"" Zelenskyy wrote in a tweet. In a statement issued as he was returning to the White House from Delaware, Biden said the missile attacks demonstrate Putin's ""utter brutality"" in the ""illegal war on the Ukrainian people."" Biden spoke Monday with Zelenskyy, the White House said later that day; and Biden is expected to attend a virtual meeting on Tuesday of the Group of Seven countries to discuss the situation. The White House said that in his call with Zelenskyy, Biden ""conveyed his condolences to the loved ones of those killed and injured in these senseless attacks"" and ""pledged to continue providing Ukraine with the support needed to defend itself, including advanced air defense systems."" In a tweet, however, Zelenskyy said air defenses were critical. He and others in Ukraine have urged the U.S. to institute a so-called no-fly zone to deter Russian air strikes. But the U.S. believes such a direct step could risk escalating the conflict beyond Ukraine and into a continental if not global war. The president last week warned of possible nuclear ""Armageddon,"" given Putin's repeated invocations of his country's arsenal amid Russia's recent string of defeats in Ukraine. A White House spokesman said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that Biden was not referring to any imminent threat -- but was trying to reflect that ""the stakes are very high."" In his own statement on Monday, Blinken said that Russia's attacks on Ukraine present a ""profound moral issue"" and the ""international community has a responsibility to make clear that President Putin's actions are completely unacceptable."" Blinken stressed that the U.S. views Putin as responsible for the bloodshed. ""There is one person who can stop this war now and withdraw Russia's forces: Vladimir Putin,"" Blinken said. He also spoke by phone on Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, his counterpart, according to State Department spokesperson Ned Price. On the call, Blinken ""commended Ukraine for not allowing President Putin to break Ukraine's spirit while noting that the United States will continue to provide vital economic, humanitarian, and security assistance so Ukraine can defend itself and take care of its people,"" according to Price. The U.S. Army's top leaders were likewise critical of the latest Russian attack in Ukraine. Speaking Monday at a press conference at the Army's annual conference hosted by the Association of the U.S. Army in Washington, the officials said that the strikes were reminiscent of earlier days in the conflict, which began when Russia invaded in February, arguing that it was carrying out a necessary security operation. ""It is horrific that Russia is directly targeting civilians and critical infrastructure for civilians,"" Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said when asked by a reporter about the attack. ""This is what unfortunately, though, President Putin and the Russian military have been doing."" ""It's very, very concerning,"" Wormuth said. ""But I think it's an extension of the kind of tactics that we've seen from the beginning of the invasion."" ABC News' Shannon K.

2022-10-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/steele-dossier-collector-trial-major-test-durham-probe/story?id=91288704,Steele dossier 'collector' goes to trial in major test for Durham probe,"The trial of a Russian national accused of lying to federal investigators about information he contributed to the so-called Steele dossier is set to begin this week, marking a major test for the special counsel investigating the origins of the FBI probe of former President Donald Trump's relationship with Russia. Igor Danchenko, a Washington-based think tank analyst, was hired by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele in 2016 to collect information compiled in his now-infamous ""dossier,"" which included explosive and unproven claims about the former president. In a November 2021 indictment, prosecutors accused Danchenko of misleading FBI agents about his sources of information. Danchenko has pleaded not guilty. Danchenko's trial, which begins Tuesday in Alexandria, Virginia, is expected to offer special counsel John Durham an opportunity to justify his years-long probe, which Trump and his allies once hoped would uncover a widespread ""deep-state"" conspiracy within the bureau. Assigned in 2019 by then-Attorney General William Barr to pursue allegations of misconduct by the FBI and intelligence community in their Russia investigation, dubbed ""Crossfire Hurricane,"" Durham has secured indictments against only three individuals, one of whom, Michael Sussmann, was acquitted at trial earlier this year. In another case, former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith admitted to altering a document used in the application process authorizing continued surveillance against a former Trump campaign aide. Danchenko is the third defendant and the most politically fraught. As Steele's primary collector, Danchenko was responsible for sharing the salacious claim that Russian officials may have had a videotape of Trump watching prostitutes in a hotel room during a 2013 trip to Moscow. Trump has vehemently denied the claim and no evidence has surfaced to support the allegation. Prosecutors accused Danchenko of falsely telling the FBI that he never communicated with an unidentified U.S.-based individual ""who was a long-time participant in Democratic Party Politics"" about any allegations included in the dossier -- whereas the indictment says Danchenko had actually sourced one or more of the allegations to that individual. The indictment also accused Danchenko of lying to the FBI when he suggested that he had spoken with a Belarusian-born businessman named Sergei Millian, who at the time served as president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce and had obtained information from Millian that then made its way into the dossier. ""Danchenko stated falsely [to the FBI] that, in or about late July 2016, he received an anonymous phone call from an individual who Danchenko believed to be ... then president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce"" and obtained information about Trump from that man, the indictment says, referring to Millian but not naming him. In fact, according to the indictment, ""Danchenko never received such a phone call or such information from any person he believed to be [Millian] ... rather, Danchenko fabricated these facts regarding [Millian]."" The indictment goes on to claim that Danchenko ""never spoke to"" Millian at all, which would support Millian's longstanding contention that he was not the source – knowing or unwitting – of any material in the dossier. Millian has called any suggestions that he was a source ""a blatant lie."" Ahead of his trial, Danchenko and his legal team sought to have their case dismissed and nearly succeeded. Danchenko's lawyers have insisted that Danchenko presented information to the FBI in accordance with what he believed was true and questioned the framing and interpretation of agents' questions during interviews with Danchenko. U.S. Judge Anthony Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia ultimately ruled that the trial should move forward but characterized his decision as ""an extremely close call."" Last week, Trenga ruled that prosecutors should avoid reference to the most salacious allegations in Steele's dossier in presenting their case to jurors. Steele, who has largely remained silent since his dossier became public in January 2017, told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive interview last year that he was ""interested to see what [Durham] publishes and what he says about us and others,"" but did not fear any personal legal exposure. ""Do you think he's coming for you?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""I don't think so, no,"" Steele replied. ""Are you worried you'll be indicted?"" Stephanopoulos added. ""No,"" Steele said. Durham's failure to expose allegations of widespread politicization within the FBI has drawn the ire of Trump and his supporters, who at various stages of the probe expressed hope that the special counsel would validate their claims of a ""deep state"" conspiracy. ""The public is waiting 'with bated breath' for the Durham Report, which should reveal corruption at a level never seen before in our country,"" Trump wrote in August on Truth Social, his social media platform. To Trump and his supporters' apparent chagrin, however, Danchenko's trial may be one of the final acts of Durham's tenure as special counsel. The New York Times reported last month that a grand jury empaneled by Durham had expired and that his office hoped to complete a final report by the end of the year.

2022-10-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-seek-debate-season-daylight-biden-note/story?id=91244630,Some Democrats distance themselves from Biden during debate season: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It’s not a full-scale revolt -- and a light presidential travel schedule has kept most Democrats from having to make the show-up-or-don’t choice posed by a visit from Joe Biden in the weeks before the midterms. But with debate season in full swing, Democrats in make-or-break races are looking for ways to put daylight between themselves and Biden’s White House -- in a way most Republicans running this year are not seeking distance from former President Donald Trump. On Friday, at the first and likely only Arizona Senate debate of the year, Sen. Mark Kelly called the situation at the southern border ""a mess"" and touted areas where he has broken with Biden on gas prices and inflation. ""When Democrats are wrong, like on the border, I call them out on it,” Kelly said, per ABC News' Libby Cathey. That same night, in North Carolina, Democratic Senate candidate Cheri Beasley said Biden and members of Congress ""could work a whole lot harder"" to address rising prices. She also refused to say if she would campaign alongside the president in the state. “It's wrong to align me with anybody unless I specifically say what my positions are,” Beasley said, ABC’s Hannah Demissie reported. As for their GOP opponents, Blake Masters, who is running against Kelly in Arizona with Trump’s backing, decried what he called the “Joe Biden-Mark Kelly economy.” Rep. Ted Budd, the Trump-backed Republican running for Senate in North Carolina, said flatly, “Joe Biden is on the ballot on Nov. 8, and he goes by the name this year of Cheri Beasley.” It’s a trend that’s likely to continue this week. The first Senate debates in their respective states are on tap Monday in Ohio and Friday in Georgia, with a second Senate debate in Wisconsin scheduled for Thursday. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema The Republican path to seeing midterm success could hinge on Arizona and Nevada, as evidenced by former President Trump's swing across the two Western states over the weekend. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, on Saturday, Trump echoed his party's campaign season rhetoric by tearing into Democrats over high inflation and claiming an ""invasion"" is happening at the southern border. Meanwhile, Republican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville also joined the event and made headlines over his claims that Democrats are ""pro-crime"" and that ""they want reparation because they think the people that do the crime are owed that!"" Although Trump was joined on stage by two of the Nevada Republicans he endorsed -- gubernatorial candidate Sheriff Joe Lombardo and Senate candidate Adam Laxalt -- he also took the opportunity to, yet again, tease his own possible political moves when discussing his past presidential campaigns and adding ""we may have to do it again."" But it remains to be seen how members of his party would respond to a Trump run in 2024 -- including at least one of the candidates he currently backs. A week before rallying in front of supporters with Trump, Lombardo hedged his answer during the only gubernatorial debate of the season when asked if he thought Trump was a great president, ABC's Abby Cruz reports. ""I wouldn't say great. I think he was a sound president,"" Lombardo said at the time. Lombardo also diverged from the former president's false, sweeping allegations of the 2020 election having been rigged against him. When asked if he shared those views a week ago, the Clark County sheriff said, ""No, I do not. I think there was a modicum of fraud but not to change the election."" However, on Saturday, Lombardo shared a different view of the former president while vowing to ""bring trust back to the office [of the governor]."" ""We're here to rally the ticket and who's going to help us today? Who's going to help us? The greatest president, right? Donald J. Trump,” the Republican said. The TIP with Lalee Ibssa As Georgia GOP Senate hopeful Herschel Walker dominated campaign coverage in recent days -- in the wake of him denying a claim that he paid for an ex-girlfriend's abortion -- the reaction from state Democrats was slight. Walker's opponent, Sen. Raphael Warnock, largely avoided making specific comments on the allegations, only voicing general criticisms about Walker when pressed by reporters. ""Here's the thing: What we're hearing about my opponent is disturbing,"" Warnock said at a campaign stop in Savannah on Thursday. ""I think the people of Georgia have a real choice about who they think is ready to represent them in the United States Senate."" Stacey Abrams, Georgia's Democratic gubernatorial nominee, used the accusations against Walker to condemn Gov. Brian Kemp -- who suggested it wasn't his place to weigh in on Walker while saying, ""I'm supporting the ticket,"" when asked by ABC News on Friday if Walker still has his vote. ""A Black woman faces lethal choice, and that is to either have a crystal ball and know she's pregnant before she can actually know or face forced pregnancy with very little support,"" Abrams said while criticizing the state's six-week abortion ban during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""In the state of Georgia, Brian Kemp has said that Herschel Walker is entitled to his personal choices, but no woman is, and that is unconscionable,"" Abrams continued. Out on the campaign trail, rather than more specific criticism, Democrats have used the Walker controversy to have broader conversations about reproductive rights as some pro-Democratic advocates warn not to overestimate the effects the headlines will have on the state of the midterm races. ""While this news around the Walker family is a bombshell, it DOES NOT mean that Democrats have this election in the bag. Remember, weeks before the 2016 elections, the audio of Trump bragging about sexually abusing women came out and Republicans (including the majority of white women, and white voters) sent him to the White House. We must continue knocking every single door in order for Warnock and Abrams to win,"" said Care in Action Executive Director Hillary Holley. The twists and turns of Walker's week are the focus of the new episode of Hulu's ""Power Trip,"" streaming now, with the ABC News campaign team and George Stephanopoulos.

2022-10-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-faces-make-break-realities-georgia-walker-note/story?id=91288498,GOP faces make-or-break realities in Georgia for Walker: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The past week of Herschel Walker stories has been filled with what-ifs for Republicans -- counterfactuals pondering the benefits of pre-primary vetting, the costs of Trump loyalty and even how the latest scandal might have been turned into a boon for the candidate in the center of it all with a different initial reaction. Now, Republicans are trying to turn toward what might still be. Walker is seeking a reset around his campaign with national GOP figures front and center, even as state-level Republicans hesitate just a bit in offering full-throated support from here. Walker's ""Unite Georgia Bus Tour"" on Tuesday will include a stop in Carrollton, Georgia, featuring Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. That's the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and a younger and no-less-ambitious colleague, making clear they stand behind Walker despite the drip-drip of stories that have brought confusing and sometimes contradictory answers. ""I never heard of whatever they call 'October surprises,' but whatever they're doing now, as I always say, I move forward,"" Walker told Breitbart. At the national level, Republicans have little choice but to try to move forward with Walker. Georgia, in addition to its famously complicated history with former President Donald Trump, sent two Republicans to the Senate through the Trump years and now sends none; the state is the likeliest to determine the majority this year, according to FiveThirtyEight's Senate forecast. In his latest interview, Walker said the people of Georgia know him: ""I do what I say, and I say what I do."" That's an assertion now being tested rather directly in his race. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema With debate season underway, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan and Republican J.D. Vance faced off Monday night in Ohio's first Senate debate. The pair exchanged near-immediate blows over abortion, with Ryan claiming that Vance called those getting pregnant from rape an ""inconvenience,"" which Vance pushed back on, saying he has never uttered those words, ABC News' Paulina Tam reports. The Senate hopefuls also took swipes over the opioid crisis: Vance alleged Ryan did ""nothing to stop the flow of fentanyl,"" while Ryan brought up Vance's shuttered nonprofit, which he alleged was a fake pursuit. When asked whether he wanted President Joe Biden to run in 2024, Ryan answered ""no."" ""I like to see a generational change. With Mitch McConnell. Donald Trump. The president. Everybody,"" the congressman said. Leading up to the debate, Vance focused his messaging on the issue of crime in Ohio and pledged to prioritize increased funding for police, if he were to be elected. The approach is also visible in rhetoric from Republicans in other battlegrounds such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- in both states, Republicans are labeling their Democratic opponents in various ads as being soft on crime. In Wisconsin on Friday, Democratic Senate candidate and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes challenged incumbent GOP Sen. Ron Johnson about Republicans' ads regarding his position on ending cash bail in the state, which he once sponsored as a state lawmaker. According to Barnes, the ads were ""mischaracterized"" and ""sensationalized."" While the pair of Wisconsinites is set to debate again for a final time on Thursday, voters in Pennsylvania -- where Dr. Mehmet Oz and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman are lobbing personal and political attacks -- are still two weeks away from seeing their Senate candidates take to the debate stage. Oz and Fetterman have agreed to a debate on Oct. 25. The TIP with Brittany Shepherd Just days before Rep. Liz Cheney makes her final stand as the vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee on Thursday, the woman who ousted her from her spot in the next Congress may be eclipsing her spotlight. Harriet Hageman, the former Cheney adviser-turned-Trumpian firebrand who handily defeated Cheney in Wyoming's Republican primary, has joined Iowa Republicans as one of their marquee guests as they host get-out-the-vote rallies and party events ahead of the midterms. On Tuesday, Hageman is set to attend several events with Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann, including headlining the Scott County Republican Party's 14th Annual Ronald Reagan Dinner, an event known to pull national party stars, including presidential candidates, and sitting members of Congress. What makes Hageman's recent swing through the Hawkeye State so notable beyond the counterprogramming element is that she's neither a presidential candidate nor a sitting member of Congress -- in fact, she has very few political bona fides. The attorney ran and lost her bid for Wyoming governor in 2018 and was the Republican National committeewoman representing her home state for two years. The tour also shows other state parties' willingness to not only accept but apotheose the most conservative flank of their ranks. Hageman is an unapologetic election denier and unrelenting supporter of former President Trump (though she once maintained a firm never-Trump posture and condemned him as ""xenophobic"").

2022-10-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-thinks-us-evaluate-relationship-saudi-arabia-white/story?id=91327505,Biden thinks US needs to 'reevaluate' relationship with Saudi Arabia: White House,"President Joe Biden thinks the United States needs to ""reevaluate"" its relationship with Saudi Arabia, especially in light of the decision by the OPEC+ oil cartel to cut production, the White House said Tuesday. ""I think the president's been very clear that this is a relationship that we need to continue to reevaluate, that we need to be willing to revisit,"" White House spokesman John Kirby said in an interview with CNN. ""And certainly in light of the OPEC decision, I think that's where he is."" OPEC+, a group of oil-producing countries led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, announced last week it would significantly slash production in order to boost oil prices. Kirby said Biden ""is going to be willing to work with Congress as we think about what the right relationship with Saudi Arabia needs to be going forward."" Later, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, ""Last week, when OPEC made the decision to align their energy policy with Russia's war ... further underscores that reasoning to realign that relationship, to reevaluate that relationship with Saudi Arabia."" Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Monday called on the U.S. to ""immediately freeze all aspects of our cooperation with Saudi Arabia, including any arms sales and security cooperation beyond what is absolutely necessary to defend U.S. personnel and interests."" Menendez cited Saudi Arabia's financial support for Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. His get-tough-on-Saudi-Arabia stance seems to be gaining traction with other Senate Democrats as the administration eyes conversations with Congress about the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, during a brief meeting meant to tee-up consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act next month, Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, told reporters that he is ""very supportive of Menendez"" and his efforts to end arm sales and security cooperation with Saudi Arabia. ""I think we should look carefully at everything we're sending them,"" Reed said. ""Because their inability to cooperate with the West and their willingness to cooperate with Russia is very disturbing."" Last week, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on the Senate to pass a bill that would allow the Justice Department to sue oil cartel members for antitrust violations, including, he said, ""price fixing by OPEC"" and its partners. Sen. Angus King, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he agrees with proposals to cease sending arms to Saudi Arabia. ""Why should we? If they don't have any ore concern for international security and stability of the world economy, why should we be helping them?"" King said. Biden would be willing to start conversations with Congress ""right away,"" Kirby said. Following the administration's announced intention to work with with Congress, Democrats Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Roe Khanna introduced legislation Tuesday that would stop U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. ""This simple yet urgent measure would halt U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia after their deeply offensive, destructive blunder: siding with Russia at this historic moment. Saudis must reverse their oil supply cuts, which aid and abet Russia’s savage criminal invasion, endanger the world economy, and threaten higher gas prices at U.S. pumps. We cannot continue selling highly sensitive arms technology to a nation aligned with an abhorrent terrorist adversary,” Blumenthal said. The move by OPEC+ could send oil prices higher, which in turn, could raise prices at the gas pump in the United States. Higher gas prices could hurt Biden and Democrats politically heading into this fall's midterm elections. Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia in June to, in part, push the kingdom's leaders to increase production. After OPEC+ announced the production cut last week, Biden's top economic adviser, Brian Deese, told reporters the White House would ""be assessing and consulting closely with Congress around a range of issues on the back end of this."" Deese, the director of the White House National Economic Council, declined to say whether the Biden administration thought the U.S. should continue to provide weapons and other military assistance to Saudi Arabia if the Gulf nation was not willing to keep the price of gas in the U.S. lower.",23
2022-10-11,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-desperate-position-uk-spy-chief/story?id=91323871,"Russia in 'desperate' position, UK spy chief says","LONDON -- Russia is in a “desperate” position in its war in Ukraine and is running out of weapons and allies, according to the U.K.’s Director of GCHQ Jeremy Fleming. “We believe that Russia is running short of munitions, it’s certainly running short of friends … Russia and Russia’s commanders are worried about the state of their military machine,” Fleming said in an interview with the BBC News on Tuesday morning. “The word I’ve used is ‘desperate.’ We can see that desperation at many levels inside Russian society and inside the Russian military machine,"" said Fleming, whose British Government Communications Headquarters has a mission similar to the U.S. National Security Agency. Fleming gave the interview ahead of a speech he was schedule to give to a London think tank Tuesday, in which he was expected to be highly critical of the Russian military’s performance in the nearly eight-month-long war. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it's clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming said in his prepared remarks, adding that, “The costs to Russia -- in people and equipment are staggering. We know -- and Russian commanders on the ground know -- that their supplies and munitions are running out.” Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a series of missile strikes across Ukraine in the last 48 hours in retaliation for an attack on the strategically important Kerch bridge into Crimea over the weekend, with Fleming arguing this will have depleted their dwindling arsenal. “Russia, as we’ve seen in the dreadful attacks yesterday, still has a very capable military machine. It can launch weapons, it has deep, deep stocks and expertise. And yet, it is very broadly stretched in Ukraine,” he told the BBC. He also took aim at Putin’s leadership: “With little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed. It’s a high stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgement. Their gains are being reversed.” “And the Russian population has started to understand that too, “ he added. “They’re seeing just how badly Putin has misjudged the situation. They’re fleeing the draft, realizing they can no longer travel. They know their access to modern technologies and external influences will be drastically restricted. And they are feeling the extent of the dreadful human cost of his war of choice.”",7
2022-10-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-officials-reportedly-kidnapped-pressure/story?id=91349880,2nd kidnapping reported at Ukraine nuclear power plant amid 'unacceptable' conditions,"Ukraine's nuclear energy company has accused Russia of ""kidnapping"" a top official at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for the second time this month, amid growing concerns about the safety and security of the Russian-controlled facility. Energoatom claimed that Russian forces kidnapped Valery Martynyuk, the deputy general director for human resources of the plant, on Monday and ""are holding him in an unknown place."" Earlier this month, Energoatom said that Russia had seized the director general of the plant, Ihor Murashov. He was released two days later and has not returned to the facility, officials said. The Zaporizhzhia plant has been caught in the crossfire of the war nearly from the start. Shortly after invading neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russian troops stormed the plant, strategically located on the banks of the Dnipro River in the country's southeast. Russian forces gained control of the plant, though it continues to be run by Ukrainian staff as it supplies electricity to the country. Experts and workers have raised alarms about the potential for a catastrophic nuclear disaster as it continues to come under shelling, and staff have reported that the conditions can be intimidating and stressful. The alleged kidnappings come amid renewed tensions at the plant and increased attacks on the Zaporizhzhia region, where the plant is located. Zaporizhzhia is one of the four regions where Russia held sham ""referendums"" to annex the territory in violation of international laws. On Oct. 5, the same day Russian President Vladimir Putin signed laws claiming the annexation of the regions, the Kremlin announced plans for its own personnel to supervise operations of the Zaporizhzhia plant. Energoatom chief Petro Kotin rejected the plan and said Ukraine will continue to operate the plant. The staff at the facility have faced ""enormous pressure,"" including recent demands to sign a new employment contract with the Russian nuclear company Rosatom while Energoatom urges them not to, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog. With the latest incident, Energoatom claimed in a statement on Telegram that ""the Russians are trying to get the much-needed information about the personal affairs of Zaporizhzhia NPP employees in order to force Ukrainian personnel to work at Rosatom as soon as possible,"" accusing the Russians of torturing staff. Kotin has previously said he believes that Russia intends to switch power to Russian-controlled areas. If Russia is able to switch the grid to Russian-controlled areas, Ukraine could also lose a significant source of power. In August, Kotin told ABC News that nuclear power generated at the Zaporizhzhya plant supplies around 20% of Ukraine's energy. In demanding the release of Murashov, Kotin called on Russia to ""stop immediately the acts of nuclear terrorism towards the management and personnel."" Russia has not publicly commented on the kidnapping allegations. The IAEA, which has staff at the plant, has also not commented on the latest kidnapping allegations, though it said Murashov's detention had ""an immediate and serious impact on decision-making in ensuring the safety and security of the plant."" The group has also raised concerns about the ability of the staff to ""fulfill their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure."" The staff has been ""subjected to unacceptable pressure, carrying out their crucial work tasks under increasingly difficult conditions with potentially severe consequences for nuclear safety and security,"" the IAEA said. The leaders of the Group of Seven industrial powers condemned Russia's actions at the plant ""and the pressure exerted on the personnel of the facility"" in a joint statement on Tuesday. The conditions at the plant, which include reports of staff working at gunpoint, undermine morale and the safety of the facility, said Nickolas Roth, senior director of nuclear materials security for the Nuclear Threat Initiative. ""It's essential that there'll be strong leaders at Zaporizhzhia who are willing to prioritize the safety and security of the facility, and I worry that by essentially terrorizing the senior management of this facility, that that has been undermined,"" he told ABC News. Ongoing shelling near the facility has disrupted its power supply in recent days and weeks. The kidnapping reports only add to the challenging conditions at the plant, Roth said. ""We need to not just protect the physical facility itself -- the reactors, the spent fuel pools, the off-site power lines -- but we have to protect the people there, as well,"" he said. ""This is not sustainable. You can't operate a nuclear facility safely under these conditions."" The reported kidnappings come amid continued calls for a security protection zone around the Russian-occupied facility -- the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Military attacks increase the risk of a nuclear accident if the plant's external power lines are damaged, according to the IAEA. ""Now more than ever, during these extremely difficult times, a protection zone must be established around ZNPP,"" Rafael Grossi, the IAEA's director general, said in a statement Wednesday, as he met with Putin to discuss a demilitarized zone around the plant. ""We can't afford to lose more time. We must do everything in our power to help ensure that a nuclear accident does not happen during this tragic conflict."" The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected any proposals to remove its troops, with a Russian Foreign Ministry official previously saying it would ""make the plant even more vulnerable.""",10
2022-10-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-women-run-ukraine-anti-war-protests-danger/story?id=91378202,Russian women run Ukraine anti-war protests despite danger,"LONDON -- After President Vladimir Putin’s decree to mobilize Russia on Sept. 21, a secretive Russian protest group called Feminist Anti-War Resistance (FAR) instructed women to wear black and hold white flowers as they march the nation’s streets, a striking demonstration of grief. “Your son, your father, your brother can be in a warzone,” said FAR coordinator Lolja Nordic. “We want the Russian army weaker. We don't need more ordinary civilians turned into dead soldiers.” Russia has a history of women’s activism, both in Soviet and post-Soviet times, in spite of women’s chronic political underrepresentation, including FAR’s action on March 8 -- International Women’s Day -- organized in remembrance of Ukrainians killed in the war, which compelled peace campaigners to protest in 112 cities. FAR originated on Feb. 25, the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, and even though the number of members is not exact, the group has over 42,000 Telegram subscribers. “We are the opposition to war, patriarchy, authoritarianism and militarism,” the organization’s manifesto, which has been translated into 13 languages, reads. “We are the future, and we will win.” Due to her participation with FAR, Nordic notes that she has been surveilled, cyberattacked and arrested four times, her home has been raided twice and her devices were confiscated. After she was exiled to Tallinn, Estonia, she decided to forego her anonymity. “All our participants are aware: none of what we do is 100% safe,” Nordic said. FAR, though not exclusive to women, organizes online and street protests, posts strategies for avoiding conscription, disseminates anti-war messaging and volunteers with aiding Ukrainian refugees. The group also pays legal costs via crowdsourcing for residents who face illegal termination from their jobs for opposing the war. Nearly eight months since the invasion, FAR is now active in over 40 Russian cities, says another FAR coordinator Julia, whose last name has been redacted for her security. “Before the war, for most Russians, there was an illusion that politics won’t affect their lives,” Julia said. “Now, political decisions severely affect their lives.” A former biochemistry student, activism now monopolizes Julia’s time and, in March, the 24-year-old fled her home in Russia to another European country. “When Western journalists think of Russia, they think people here are super supportive of their, like, führer,” said Julia. “But that’s not the case.” Putin has been threatening to use nuclear weapons since the beginning of his war in Ukraine. But, in his Sept. 30 speech in which he formally and illegally proclaimed the annexation of four Ukrainian regions, the Russian president intensified his rhetoric. Julia described the notion of introducing nuclear weaponry to this war as, “horrible, horrible, absolutely horrible.” “Putin and his political allies have lost any connection with the real world,” she added while noting she can’t predict what could possibly come next in the conflict. At the latest count, more than 14,900 Russian people have been detained by security forces and police for protesting, according to OVD-Info, a Russian human rights organization. FAR exists among a coalition of anti-war groups and dissenters in Russia. Founded in 2013, Vesna is a Russian youth organization working towards liberal democracy. Vesna has a core group of about a hundred members who have been thoroughly checked, said Vesna leader Maria Lakhina who handles finances and works in Vesna’s international cooperation team. To eventually reach its goal of a liberal democratic state, Lakhina added, Vesna wants to topple the current Russian regime, promote the values of human rights and the rule of law. “It may sound unrealistic, but we believe it is the only way our country may positively change,” Lakhina said. Growing up in Siberia, 26-year-old Lakhina, lived in St. Petersburg for the past six years before emigrating to Yerevan, Armenia, in March. She participated in two rallies in St. Petersburg but was arrested during the last one. After she left the country, Lakhina coordinated four more rallies, two of which were anti-war rallies in March and two anti-mobilization rallies in September. Lakhina now receives treatment for trauma symptoms, insomnia and panic attacks. “I shut down emotions and bury them in work as much as possible,” said Lakhina. “That does not sound healthy, and it will probably have consequences in the future, but that is the only way to stay productive in our field in times like this.”",7
2022-10-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-believes-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine/story?id=91375725,Biden believes Putin won't use nuclear weapons on Ukraine,"President Joe Biden said he does not believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin would use a tactical nuclear weapon on Ukraine. “I think it’s irresponsible for him to talk about it, the idea that a world leader of one of the largest nuclear powers in the world says he may use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an exclusive interview with the network. “The whole point I was making was it could lead to just a horrible outcome. And not because anybody intends to turn it into a world war or anything, but just once you use a nuclear weapon, the mistakes that can be made, the miscalculations, who knows what would happen,” Biden continued. When asked if the United States had considered what would happen if Putin did use a nuclear weapon and what the “red line” for his administration would be, Biden said it would be irresponsible of him to discuss specifics but made it clear that the Pentagon did not have to be asked to game out potential outcomes. “He, in fact, cannot continue with impunity to talk about the use of a tactical nuclear weapon as if that’s a rational thing to do. The mistakes get made. And the miscalculation could occur, no one can be sure what would happen and could end in Armageddon,” Biden added later on in CNN’s interview. Biden was questioned on whether he thought Putin was a rational actor and made it clear that he thought Putin was “a rational actor who miscalculated significantly.” “I think he thought he was going to be welcomed with open arms, that this was the home of Mother Russia in Kyiv, and that where he was going to be welcomed, and I think he just totally miscalculated,” Biden said. Following a large explosion on the Kirch Strait Bridge last Saturday, Russia, who has blamed Ukraine for the attack, has retaliated with a wave of powerful attacks across Ukraine with missile strikes on Kyiv and around the nation, killing at least 19 and injuring hundreds more. Biden said he has “no intention” of meeting with Putin at the G20 taking place next month in Indonesia. “He’s acted brutally, he’s acted brutally. I think he’s committed war crimes. And so I don’t, I don’t see any rationale to meet with him now,” said Biden. But he did include a caveat with that statement. “If he came to me at the G20 and wanted to talk about the release of Griner, I’d meet with him,” said Biden. “We’ve taken a position. I just did a G-7 meeting this morning … I’m not about to, nor is anyone else prepared to, negotiate with Russia about them staying in Ukraine, keeping any part of Ukraine.” “But look, he’s acted brutally, he’s acted brutally. I think he’s committed war crimes,” Biden continued. “I don’t see any rationale to meet with him now.”",7
2022-10-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-candidates-read-pages-trumps-playbook-note/story?id=91347486,GOP candidates read from different pages of Trump's playbook: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It's an obvious enough point that former President Donald Trump broke and then rewrote the traditional rules of politics in ways that are still being felt inside of both major parties. What's becoming more apparent is the extent to which different Republican candidates are taking different lessons of the Trump era and applying them to their unique circumstances. They're testing intraparty loyalties and assumptions along the way, much like Trump himself. Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker is in defiance-and-denial mode as he digs in on a scandal that puts him at odds with the mother of one of his children as well as one of his sons. ""Yes, she's lying. Yeah, she's lying. Yes, she's lying,"" Walker told ABC News' Linsey Davis on Tuesday, referring to the woman who claims he paid for her to get an abortion in 2009 and whom, he now acknowledges, is the mother of one of his children. Trump's approach toward the news is a lesson internalized by a range of GOP campaigns -- manifesting itself in part with candidates like Pennsylvania's Doug Mastriano who echo his periodic media hostility by largely, if not entirely, avoiding interviews with mainstream outlets. But Trump also talked to basically any news organization who would have him during his 2015-2016 campaign. Embracing a similar ubiquity, in Pennsylvania, Trump-backed Senate candidate Mehmet Oz's campaign pushed to have far more debates than the one Democrat John Fetterman agreed to. And in Arizona on Wednesday -- the first day of early voting in the state -- gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, a former TV news anchor who regularly talks to the press, will appear solo for an interview on an Arizona PBS station. It would have been a debate, except her Democratic opponent, Katie Hobbs, rejected the invitation, saying that facing off against a ""conspiracy theorist"" on television would ""make Arizona the subject of national ridicule."" That leads to another important point about the lessons derived from Trump. His lies and misleading statements about the last election have become something close to boilerplate for Republican candidates, even as some of them minimize that part of their pitch to voters in the final stretch. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper While Republicans hammer Democrats on the economy, including the high cost of living and fears of a recession, Democrats are ramping up economic messaging of their own focused on programs critical to the nation's social safety net -- Social Security and Medicare. Democratic politicians have been issuing stark warnings to voters about the future of the programs that they claim would be put in jeopardy if the GOP takes control of Congress. ""They're coming after your Social Security and Medicare,"" President Joe Biden said during remarks on Friday in Maryland. Biden referred then to Florida Sen. Rick Scott, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Scott's agenda proposed earlier this year. In his ""Rescue America"" plan, Scott called for federal legislation to ""sunset"" every five years. That would include the legislation that authorizes Social Security and Medicare. In response to backlash about his plan, Scott has said he wants to ""fix"" the programs. Democratic groups have also lobbed similar criticism at House GOP candidates in competitive districts. For example, in New Hampshire, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee aired an ad criticizing Karoline Leavitt after she floated the idea of privatizing Social Security (while grandfathering in those who have already paid into the program). The DCCC called the former Trump aide ""too extreme."" The committee likewise has aired ads hitting GOP candidates on Social Security and Medicare in battlegrounds including Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. It's a message that could help mobilize voters 65 and older for whom these programs could be immediately important. According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, 84% of voters 65 and up said they were ""absolutely certain to vote"" in November's elections -- a number that outpaces younger groups. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Voting administration hurdles plagued elections officials two years ago -- leading administrators in some key states to now set expectations weeks in advance for when this year's Election Day results will be tallied. Pennsylvania's acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman told reporters on Tuesday that it's unlikely the state will have official results on Nov. 8, ABC News' Will McDuffie reports. The update signals a looming scenario that could resemble the days-long process of vote tabulation that occurred in the 2020 races. That delay ultimately opened the door to false claims of election fraud by former President Trump and some of his supporters, including this year's Republican gubernatorial nominee in Pennsylvania, Doug Mastriano. ""Official results will be available within a few days,"" Chapman said Tuesday. ""This delay does not mean anything nefarious is happening. It simply means that the process is working as it is designed to work in Pennsylvania and that election officials are doing their job to count every vote."" Under current law, ballot processing is prohibited from beginning before 7 a.m. on Nov. 8. That requirement has affected the speed of ballot tabulation as recently as the May primary elections, which was followed by a recount in the Republican race for the Senate nomination. Echoing sentiments she expressed in the aftermath of that election, Chapman on Tuesday attributed the expected delay to a failure by the state's Republican-led legislature to pass a law allowing counties to begin canvassing mail-in ballots before Election Day. The voting calendar could also present challenges for voters in Florida with the passage of Tuesday's voter registration deadline. The DeSantis administration did not extend the deadline despite many citizens grappling with the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

The State Department spokesperson did not confirm the man’s identity, but the sister of Dane Partridge confirmed he was the victim.

2022-10-13,https://abcnews.go.com/International/brittney-griner-struggling-russian-prison-hopeful-ahead-appeal/story?id=91444868,"Brittney Griner struggling in Russian prison, 'not very much hopeful' ahead of appeal hearing, attorney says","WNBA star Brittney Griner, who is facing nine years in a Russian prison, is worried that she may not be released, her attorney told ABC News as the U.S. works to secure her freedom. ""Her being afraid of not being released is mostly connected to the negotiations, which we are not aware of at all,"" Griner's attorney Alexandr Boikov told ABC News on Thursday. After being detained in Russia for more than five months, Griner was found guilty on drug charges in a Moscow-area court on Aug. 4 and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Her attorneys filed an appeal on Aug. 15 and a hearing is scheduled for Oct. 25. ""She is not very much hopeful for the appeal because the first court decision -- the verdict showed that the case is totally unjust even by present Russian standards, and we are not hoping for a big release, but of course we hope for the best,"" Boikov told ABC News. According to Boikov, decisions on appeals are usually made during one hearing, but other hearings could be scheduled and he expects a decision by the end of October. Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native who plays professional basketball for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained on Feb. 17 at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki as she returned to Russia to play during the WNBA's off-season after she was accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges in July, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage mistakenly and that she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law. Since she was detained in February, Griner has only spoken to her wife, Cherelle Griner, twice and currently ""she's not having phone calls with her family,"" Boikov said. He added that while requests are not being ""denied,"" there's ""a lot of bureaucracy and paperwork and back and forth between different institutions"" so scheduling phone calls has been ""very hard."" Boikov said that Griner is also experiencing some physical ""pain"" in prison, where she is unable to exercise or receive physical therapy. ""She has some issues with her knees, with her back, I think basketball-related but of course, she doesn't have a big bed, a good mattress or a time or place to exercise and to keep her muscles in shape,"" he said. ""Of course, without movement and the conditions in jail, she is not in very good shape,"" he added. The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained,"" meaning the U.S. will more aggressively work to negotiate her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department has said. Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained, and some officials have expressed concern that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing war. President Joe Biden initially told CNN on Tuesday that he would be open to meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 November summit to discuss Griner's release, but when asked by ABC News on Wednesday about a potential meeting, the president said, ""not with Putin."" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday that Biden ""has no intention of meeting with President Putin."" State Department spokesperson Ned Price told ABC News on Wednesday that ""securing the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner is a priority for this administration."" Asked about Griner's condition and whether the U.S. has access to her in prison, Price said that the ""most recent consular access with Brittney Griner was at the beginning of August."" ""We continue to impart on the Russian government the necessity of consistency and regular consular access to Brittney Griner but also to all of those Americans who are detained in Russia,"" he added. ABC News' Tanya Stukalova, Shannon Crawford and Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.",20
2022-10-13,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-saudis-level-accusations-wake-opec-production-cuts/story?id=91450572,"US, Saudis level accusations at each other in wake of OPEC+ production cuts","During a trip to Los Angeles Thursday, President Joe Biden told reporters he plans to speak with Saudi Arabia soon, following the OPEC+ decision to slash oil production. Asked what his message would be to Saudi Arabia on the price of gas, Biden said ""We're, we're about to talk to them,"" but he wouldn't give more details, simply telling reporters to ""stay tuned."" Meanwhile, the Biden White House and Saudi foreign ministry leveled accusations against each other amid fallout from the OPEC+ move. The Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a lengthy statement Wednesday that the kingdom had turned down a U.S. request to delay the OPEC decision by a month -- in effect, after the midterm elections in the U.S. -- and took issue with any characterization that the decision ""was politically motived against the United States of America."" ""The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would first like to express its total rejection of these statements that are not based on facts,"" the ministry said, adding: ""This decision was taken unanimously by all member states of the OPEC+ group."" The White House fired back Thursday, with spokesman John Kirby saying in a written statement that other OPEC nations have communicated to the U.S. ""privately"" that they disagreed with Saudi Arabia's decision to cut oil production – but felt ""coerced"" to support it anyway. In a call with reporters, he declined to name the other countries but said ""there was more than one."" Saudi Arabia on Wednesday did vote in favor of a U.S.-backed United Nations resolution condemning Russia's attempt to annex parts of Ukraine. While Kirby called the vote ""welcome,"" he said ""it doesn't erase the fact that the decision that OPEC+ made was unnecessary, mathematically speaking."" That decision, he said, provided not just economic support to Russian President Vladimir Putin, but also moral and military support, ""because it allows him to continue to fund his war-making machine and it certainly gave him, Mr. Putin, a sense of comfort here."" It was remarkable accusation to make about a longtime U.S. partner, albeit one with whom the U.S. relationship is rapidly fraying. ""The Saudi Foreign Ministry can try to spin or deflect, but the facts are simple,"" Kirby said in the statement. Kirby said the U.S. ""presented Saudi Arabia with analysis to show that there was no market basis to cut production targets, and that they could easily wait for the next OPEC meeting to see how things developed."" He said Saudi Arabia took the ""wrong direction"" by taking a ""they knew would increase Russian revenues and blunt the effectiveness of sanctions"" the U.S. and other Western nations had imposed in wake of Russia's aggression toward Ukraine. For its part, the Saudi foreign ministry said it ""clarified through its continuous consultation with the US Administration that all economic analyses indicate that postponing the OPEC+ decision for a month, according to what has been suggested, would have had negative economic consequences."" On Tuesday, Kirby said President Biden thinks the United States needs to ""reevaluate"" its relationship with Saudi Arabia, especially in light of the decision by the OPEC+ oil cartel to cut production. ""I think the president's been very clear that this is a relationship that we need to continue to reevaluate, that we need to be willing to revisit,"" Kirby said in an interview with CNN. ""And certainly in light of the OPEC decision, I think that's where he is."" Kirby said Biden ""is going to be willing to work with Congress as we think about what the right relationship with Saudi Arabia needs to be going forward."" Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Monday called on the U.S. to ""immediately freeze all aspects of our cooperation with Saudi Arabia, including any arms sales and security cooperation beyond what is absolutely necessary to defend U.S. personnel and interests."" Other Democrats, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Rep. Ro Khanna of California, on Wednedsay introduced a bill that would pause U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia for one year. Biden on Wednesday declined to take a position on the legislation. Kirby said Thursday ""future arms sales… are certainly going to be on the table."" ""We understand that there are no imminent pending arms sales to Saudi Arabia right now,"" Kirby told reporters. ""So there's not-- you know, we're not going to rush to make some kind of judgment here.""",7
2022-10-13,https://abcnews.go.com/International/americans-captured-ukraine-russian-forces-detail-time-imprisoned/story?id=91407392,'Prayed for death': Americans freed from Russia claim torture at 'black site',"When Alex Drueke and Andy Huynh were captured by Russians in Ukraine over the summer and later held in a ""black site"" for a month, where the two Alabama men said they endured daily torture and lived on spoiled bread and dirty water, they expected death at any moment. ""I am going to die from this situation, or they are going to kill me,"" Drueke said he thought during that time. ""We prayed for death. We just wanted to die. We just wanted it to end,"" Huynh added. In their first broadcast interview together, the two U.S. military veterans told ABC News that, although they were from the same state, they did not know each other when they met in Ukraine, where they had traveled to offer their services, either in humanitarian work or training troops. The interview with Drueke and Huynh will air Thursday on ""Good Morning America"" and across ABC News. ""Good Morning America"" airs at 7 a.m. on ABC. ""I did not go over there to fight specifically. But I understood that that was a very real possibility,"" Drueke said. What he and Huynh shared, he said, was concern that the Russian invasion of Ukraine would be successful and then spread across Europe. ""We could see that there was a very good possibility this could grow into something much, much larger ... We didn't know how big this was going to get. So it was best to stop it early,"" he said. Drueke, 40, retired from the U.S. Army after 12 years, during which he served two tours of duty in Iraq and ended his career as a platoon sergeant. Huynh, 27, a Marine who was living outside Huntsville with his girlfriend, was working as a delivery driver and going to school when he watched the invasion on television. Volunteering to fight was justified, he said, to prevent ""World War III."" ""It felt wrong just to sit back and do nothing,"" he said. For the following month, the invasion ""kept gnawing"" at him until he was losing sleep. ""I didn't want to do nothing. The situation in Ukraine was all I could really think about."" Both men arrived in Ukraine in early April. They entered the country separately through Poland and, through different circumstances, ended up serving in a unit for Ukraine's foreign legion. Their capture two months later, on June 9, resulted from a mission gone wrong. Although both men said they would not offer specific details in order to not compromise Ukraine's ongoing efforts, they said it did take place during a drone reconnaissance mission, which involved scouting areas for intelligence. ""What could go wrong went wrong,"" Drueke said. ""It was very unfortunate how it played out, but just everything went wrong,"" and the two men found themselves facing a battalion where a firefight broke out, he said. They evaded capture for eight hours after running through thick woods where they dodged active drones and land mines they said. Eventually, they said they were surrounded, ordered to their knees, their hands bound, and bags thrust over their heads. ""We were pretty darn sure they were going to execute us right then and there,"" Drueke said. Both men were moved to outposts until they ended up in a ""black site,"" where they said they were interrogated, beaten, deprived of sleep and forced for hours to sit blindfolded, on their knees, and with their hands across their necks. Drueke's ribs were forcibly cracked. What kept them going was thinking of their families. Huynh got engaged days before leaving while Drueke, who is not married, left behind an extended family and his dog, Diesel. While imprisoned, they said their sole objective was to look out for the other person. ""We were bonded for life,"" Drueke said. ""My mission was to keep Andy alive, and his mission was to keep me alive. And that's all it was."" The men spent 105 days in captivity before their release in late September, along with eight other foreign-born volunteer fighters from England and Canada and more than 200 Ukrainian soldiers. During their captivity, Russians forced them to make propaganda videos, give interviews to journalists sympathetic to Russia and contact different government agencies in the U.S., including the State Department. Drueke, who his captors chose as the duo's spokesperson, was allowed to make frequent calls to his family in Tuscaloosa. Those calls, Drueke said, were made under duress. ""The guys beating me were in the room with me,"" he said. While being transported, their bodies were stacked on top of one another, they said, along with other prisoners, in the vehicle. In prison, they suffered solitary confinement. Their captors, they said, were wrongly convinced they were spies. ""They wanted to believe that we were something special,"" Huynh said. Now home, the men are inseparable, as are their families, who bonded in their absence. They said they have no regrets and are open to returning to Ukraine to help rebuild once the conflict ends. Drueke said he believes their capture helped the Biden administration open channels to Ukraine that hadn't been opened yet. ""I hope that we had an impact,"" he said. Civilians remain imprisoned in the same locations they were kept for more than three months. ""We feel guilty that we got traded and they are still there ... That's one of the worst feelings you can have,"" Huynh said. While Ukrainians will need continued humanitarian help for years, they said they're convinced the country will emerge victorious over Russia. ""[Russian President Vladimir] Putin underestimated them ... They are very united as a people. They are not going to give up, no matter what,"" Drueke said.

2022-10-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/winter-bring-health-crises-ukraine/story?id=91507577,"Winter could bring health crises to Ukraine, WHO says","The World Health Organization is warning Ukraine could face several health crises this winter as its war with Russia enters its eighth month. According to the Ukrainian government, more than 800,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war in addition to other structures and buildings. During a press conference Friday, Hans Kluge, the WHO's regional director for Europe, said this means thousands of Ukrainians are now living in collective centers or damaged buildings without enough resources to protect them against the freezing weather. The latest escalation in fighting will likely only add to these challenges, he said. ""Too many people in Ukraine are living precariously, moving from location to location in substandard structures, or without access to heating,"" Kluge told reporters. ""This can lead to frostbite, hypothermia, pneumonia, strokes and heart attack. Destruction of houses and lack of access to fuel or electricity due to damaged infrastructure could be a matter of life if people are unable to heat their homes."" He warned the season will be especially dangerous for at-risk, vulnerable populations including the elderly, those with underlying conditions, pregnant women, women who have just given birth and newborns. According to the WHO, there have been 620 attacks on health care facilities since the war began. Because of this, the agency has been committed to helping rebuild as well as train health care workers in several areas including trauma surgery, mass casualties, exposure, epidemiology and laboratory diagnostics. ""[This] complements ongoing efforts to bring in life-saving medical supplies, over 1,300 metric tons so far. Supplies such as power generators for health care facilities, oxygen, ambulances, surgical kits, medicines to treat non-communicable diseases and vaccines,"" Kluge said. Kluge said he is also worried about the spread of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, during the winter. WHO data shows that only about 34% of the country is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with a little more than 15.1 million doses administered. What's more, a WHO report released Wednesday showed weekly cases across Europe reached 2.8 million this week, compared to 1.5 million the previous week. ""Indeed, we have seen COVID cases rise sharply in recent weeks, as they have elsewhere in the WHO European region,"" Kluge said. ""We must prepare for an increased burden of respiratory diseases this autumn and winter as seasonal influenza course replete with such COVID."" The country has also been trying to beat back a polio outbreak since October 2021 due to low immunization rates. During that period, at least one child was identified with paralytic polio and 19 other children have been infected but not paralyzed, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. Kluge added that it's not just Ukrainians' physical health that could be at risk but mental health as well. ""Earlier this week, on World Mental Health Day, we noted that almost 10 million people at the present time are potentially at risk of mental disorders such as acute stress, anxiety, depression, substance use and post-traumatic stress disorder,"" he said. ""This estimate was made before this week's escalation of hostilities.""",25
2022-10-17,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/voting-vote-counting-concerns-grow-ahead-midterms-note/story?id=91590070,Voting and vote-counting concerns grow ahead of midterms: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Almost 2 million people have already voted in this year's general election -- a level of participation reached earlier than ever in a midterm cycle, according to the University of Florida's U.S. Elections Project. With 22 days -- and what may be more than 100 million more ballots -- to go before Nov. 8, the pace of voting is set to pick up even as questions grow around almost every aspect of voting: access to ballots, manpower running elections, the pace and integrity of vote counting and, of course, whether results will be accepted by losing Republicans up and down the ballot. Early voting starts Monday in Georgia, a state at the center of so many of 2020's political storms and where additional voting restrictions have been imposed since then. Monday night's debate between Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams is likely to surface questions about 2022 in a high-profile way. Other key states, meanwhile, are already warning that vote counting could take days after Election Day to complete -- and that if that happens, it doesn't indicate there's automatically something to mistrust about the results. On Sunday on CNN, Arizona GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake again refused to commit to conceding if she loses and laid the groundwork for sowing mistrust if the winner isn't known on election night: ""We don't want to be counting for 10 days,"" Lake said. With similar messaging out of Republicans for top offices in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and a range of other states, Democrats are picking up the intensity of their messaging on the subject. Lake's Democratic opponent, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, responded by saying Lake's position is ""absolutely disqualifying."" While campaigning in Oregon over the weekend, President Joe Biden cited state legislative and other down-ballot races where GOP candidates could impact ""whether or not the votes are counted, federally or locally, and who gets to make those judgments."" With the House Jan. 6 committee having likely finished with its public hearings, concerns are being voiced by some lawmakers that last year's Capitol riot might be a precursor to even more consequential efforts to overturn outcomes. ""What happened on Jan 6 was terrible. What led up to that and what happened since is what I'm more worried about,"" committee member Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper With about three weeks until Election Day, Democrats running in Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin are getting a boost from a popular former president: Barack Obama. Starting next week, Obama is slated to make stops to campaign for the Democratic tickets in each of those three states. An appearance from him could be considered a net positive for candidates in races with razor-thin margins, particularly in Senate contests that could determine the balance of power on Capitol Hill. Visits from President Joe Biden on the other hand, given that his approval numbers remain underwhelming, come with more political baggage for Democrats fighting for every single vote. In Wisconsin, Democratic Senate nominee Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes greeted Obama's announced trip with a warm statement -- though Barnes was glaringly absent from a Biden visit to the state in September (his campaign blamed scheduling). ""Could not be more excited to have him back in Wisconsin to join us on the trail,"" Barnes said. Obama, according to a recent interview with ""Pod Save America,"" intends to address both Democratic legislative victories and the threat election denialism poses to democracy, not only in the high-profile gubernatorial and senatorial races but also down-ballot. He's expected to challenge the rhetoric of GOP candidates like Kristina Karamo, who has pushed false claims about the outcome of the 2020 election in Michigan and is running to oversee the state's elections. ""If you combine the deep concerns about our democracy with the concrete accomplishments that this administration has been able to deliver -- because we had a narrow majority in both the House and the Senate -- that should be enough to inspire people to get out,"" Obama said. Only time will tell if the inspiration he speaks of will actually come to fruition and make a difference for Democrats at the polls. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Iowa's Senate race appears to be tightening less than a month before polls close, as retired Navy admiral and Democrat Mike Franken takes on incumbent Sen. Chuck Grassley. Grassley, who is 89, is seeking his eighth term in office after being elected in landslide victories since the 1980s. Despite Grassley's position as one of the highest-ranking Republicans in the upper chamber, a recent Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll showed a narrow margin separating Grassley's 46% lead among likely voters from that of Franken's 43%. Although Grassley's long tenure in the Senate could be seen as an asset among some voters, his age could be a concern for others. (Democrats have said the same about Joe Biden, who is 79.) If the senator wins in November, he would be 95 years old upon completion of that term, which he has said he intends to fulfill. Franken's campaign is also seeing hurdles. As first reported last month by the conservative website Iowa Field Report, a former Franken staffer accused the Democratic candidate of kissing her on the mouth without her consent. The incident was filed with the Des Moines Police Department, and the case was closed as ""unfounded"" with no charges filed. Franken has denied the accusation. While Democrats have struggled in recent cycles to make gains in the perennial presidential battleground, the small decrease in the margin of Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst's 2020 victory compared to her initial 2014 win could open the door to promising possibilities this year. Meanwhile Republicans are looking toward a broader map of opportunities -- in Colorado and Washington -- to go on the offense.

2022-10-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/report-finds-declines-womens-childrens-health/story?id=91620943,UN report finds declines in women's and children's health,"A United Nations report published Tuesday showed women's and children's health have backslid due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict and climate change. The report, titled Every Woman Every Child Progress Report, found that since 2020, rates of anxiety and depression, food insecurity and intimate partner violence have risen while rates of vaccination have declined. ""The impacts of COVID-19, conflicts and climate crises have raised the stakes for vulnerable communities, revealing the weaknesses and inequities in health care systems and reversing hard-won progress for women, children and adolescents -- but we are not powerless to change this,"" UNICEF Executive Catherine Russell said in a statement. ""By investing in resilient, inclusive primary health care systems, jumpstarting routine immunization programs and strengthening the health workforce, we can make sure that every woman and every child can access the care they need to survive and thrive,"" Russell said. The report found that at least 25 million children were either unvaccinated or under-vaccinated in 2021 -- at least 6 million more than in 2019. This includes routine childhood vaccinations like the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which prevents against certain strains of the virus that can lead to cervical cancer. The pandemic also forced millions of children to miss school, and the report estimates that 80% of children in 104 countries and territories ""experienced learning loss because of school closures."" Additionally, the report found that more than 45 million children are suffering from acute malnutrition, which occurs when children don't have adequate nutrient intake. According to the report, this leaves children vulnerable to developmental delays, disease and death. What's more, world hunger had risen since the beginning of the pandemic, with 768 million people experiencing hunger. The report attributes the rise in global hunger to pandemic-related economic disruption and climate change events such as drought and conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war. In addition, estimates showed an increase in mental health conditions compared to years prior, including an increase in major depressive disorders of 27.6% and a 25.6% increase in anxiety disorders since the pandemic began. The report also examined how records from helplines, police departments and other organizations showed an increase in violence against women and, specifically, intimate partner violence. The authors said the rise could be attributed to several factors, including lockdowns forcing women to spend more time in close proximity to abusive partners, stress from the pandemic leading to violence and less access to social services. ""Almost three years on from the onset of COVID-19, the pandemic's long-term impact on the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents is becoming evident: Their chances for healthy and productive lives have declined sharply,"" Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general for the World Health Organization, said in a statement. The statement added, ""As the world emerges from the pandemic, protecting and promoting the health of women, children and young people is essential for supporting and sustaining the global recovery.""",25
2022-10-18,https://abcnews.go.com/US/jury-begins-deliberations-case-steele-dossier-collector/story?id=91642931,'Steele dossier' 'collector' found not guilty on all counts,"A federal jury in Alexandria, Virginia, delivered a verdict of not guilty on all four counts against Igor Danchenko, the Russian national accused of lying to federal investigators about information he collected in 2016 for former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele that was included in Steele's now-infamous ""dossier"" detailing Donald Trump's alleged ties to Russia. A Washington-based think tank analyst, Danchenko was hired by Steele to contribute intelligence information to Steele's research. He became a primary source to what came to be known as the ""Steele dossier,"" which included explosive and unproven claims about Trump. In a November 2021 indictment, prosecutors accused Danchenko of misleading FBI agents about his sources of information. In a statement outside of court after the ruling, Danchenko defense attorney Stuart Sears said, ""We've known all along Mr. Danchenko was innocent. We are happy now that the American public knows that as well. We thank these jurors with their hard work and deliberation for reaching the right result."" Special counsel John Durham, who prosecuted the case, said in a statement: ""While we are disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury's decision and thank them for their service. I also want to recognize and thank the investigators and the prosecution team for their dedicated efforts in seeking truth and justice in this case."" Danchenko's trial was the final case of three prosecutions secured by special counsel John Durham in his years-long probe into alleged misconduct by the FBI and intelligence community in their investigation of Trump's ties to Russia. During the trial, Durham himself questioned prosecution witnesses and delivered the prosecution's rebuttal at the end of closing arguments. Danchenko served as a paid FBI informant from 2017 to 2020, when the bureau was pushed to sever its relationship with him after the Justice Department named him as a source for the Steele dossier. Federal prosecutors had argued during the trial that Danchenko misled the FBI during three days of voluntary interviews in January 2017 about where the dossier's information came from and about his contact with other individuals. They said Danchenko told a ""shifting story"" to the agents who were trying to trace the source of the information. The government alleges that false information provided to the FBI by Danchenko was used to renew the bureau's application to continue its secret surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page after Page's visits to Moscow. After the prosecution rested its case Friday, the defense asked U.S. Judge Anthony Trenga to dismiss all five counts in the indictment against Danchenko, saying that Durham did not prove Danchenko lied to the FBI and obstructed its investigation into Trump's alleged Russian ties. Trenga dismissed one count: the prosecutions' accusation that Danchenko falsely told the FBI that he never spoken with ""a long-time participant in Democratic Party Politics"" about any allegations included in the dossier. The judge ruled that Danchenko's denial was ""literally true"" because the communication occurred over email and not via the spoken word. The four charges remaining against Danchenko surround a phone call he told the FBI he received from an unidentified Russian male in July of 2016 relaying allegations later contained in Steele's dossier. Danchenko told the FBI he believed the call was placed to him by the then-head of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce, Sergei Millian. Prosecutors allege no call took place, and that Danchenko lied to investigators to stay consistent with what he had told Steele. ""There was no call with Millian and there was no call with any individual and these phone records prove that,"" prosecutor Michael Keilty told the jury in the closing argument. In his closing arguments, defense attorney Sears contended that the phone records did not prove Danchenko did not receive a call since, he said, the call may have come through an internet app – a possibility evidence showed Danchenko mentioned in one of his initial interviews with the FBI. Sears also emphasized that Danchenko never told the FBI that the caller was definitely Sergei Millian but rather ""only said he thought it could be Sergei Millian,"" and that this reflected his belief at the time. Millian has adamantly denied he was a source for any information included in the dossier. In the defense's closing argument, Sears accused prosecutors of being on a ""mission to prove [Danchenko] a liar"" and said they failed to present evidence which ""doesn't support their narrative that he's a liar."" Sears also pointed to the defense's cross examination of the prosecution's FBI witnesses, during which they spoke of the value of Danchenko's contributions as an intelligence source and said that his outing as a source had damaged U.S. national security. ""They didn't say what [the prosecution] wanted them to say,"" said Sears, who contended that the prosecutor's own evidence ""proves the defendant is not guilty."" In the government's closing argument, prosecutors told jurors that Danchenko's ""own words"" in emails from 2016 demonstrate that he provided misleading statements to investigators. ""You didn't check your common sense at the courthouse door. You need to use it,"" Keilty told the jury.",11
2022-10-18,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nord-stream-pipeline-leaks-caused-powerful-explosions-danish/story?id=91683432,"Nord Stream pipeline leaks caused by 'powerful explosions,' Danish police say","A preliminary investigation of damages to the two Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Danish part of the Baltic Sea shows that the leaks were caused by ""powerful explosions,"" Copenhagen police said Tuesday. Swedish and Danish authorities are investigating four holes in the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, which link Russia and Germany through the Baltic Sea. The investigations confirmed there is extensive damage to the pipelines, according to police. Copenhagen police have set up a joint investigation group handling the investigation of the incidents which includes the Norwegian Police Intelligence Service and the Norwegian Armed Forces. Danish officials said it is not possible to determine when the investigation can be expected to be completed, declining to reveal any other information from the investigation into the gas leaks. Last week, Germany announced it has also opened an investigation into the damage to the pipelines. Last month, President Joe Biden called the damage to the pipelines a ""deliberate act of sabotage,"" vowing to work with allies to get to the bottom of what exactly happened. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the West of sabotaging the Russian-built pipelines, a charge vehemently denied by the United States and its allies. The dispatchers of the Nord Stream 1 control center registered a pressure drop on both strings of the gas pipeline on Sept. 26. Pressure in both pipelines was stabilized on Oct. 3, according to the company that operates the pipelines. The damaged pipelines led to huge methane leaks, but Danish officials said the pipelines stopped leaking on Oct. 1. Last week, Putin said Russia is ready to resume supplying gas to Germany through Nord Stream 2, but Berlin rejected the offer. Berlin claimed Russia halted supplies through Nord Stream 1 as a political gambit and questioned why supplies through Nord Stream 2 would be any more reliable, according to Reuters. According to Swedish newspaper Expressen, at least 50 meters, or 160 feet, of the pipeline appears to be missing after the explosion. NATO has doubled its presence in the Baltic and North Seas to over 30 ships supported by aircraft and undersea activities, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said last week. ""We will further increase protection of critical infrastructure in light of the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines,"" he said.",3
2022-10-19,https://abcnews.go.com/International/uk-prime-minister-liz-truss-lost-authority-govern/story?id=91670396,How new UK Prime Minister Liz Truss lost her authority to govern,"LONDON -- It was only six weeks ago that Liz Truss met Queen Elizabeth II and was appointed the new prime minister of the U.K. But six weeks is a long time in British politics and, after a major policy U-turn along with unconvincing attempts to reassure her Conservative party and the public, she is already under major pressure to resign. Prime Minister Truss, who remained loyal to her predecessor Boris Johnson before his resignation this summer, won the Conservative leadership contest with the promise of a low tax, high growth economy. Her spending plans were criticized by her leadership rival, former finance minister Rishi Sunak, who said “borrowing your way out of inflation is a fairytale” at the time in July. Kwasi Kwarteng, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced the government's first major policy plan to advance Truss's economic vision in the House of Commons on Sept. 23. Their package included measures to cut the rate of tax for the highest earners, cancel a planned corporation tax increase, remove a cap on bankers’ bonuses, and all this while also promising billions to tackle the looming threat of rising energy bills ahead of the winter, attributed by the government to the war in Ukraine. The plan was criticized by opposition politicians and economists, and the International Monetary Fund issued a sharp rebuke to their plans, saying in a statement widely interpreted to be scathing that “we do not recommend large and untargeted fiscal packages at this juncture” and the budget would “likely increase inequality.” Economic chaos followed, as the budget triggered an immediate adverse reaction from the markets. The Bank of England, the U.K.’s central bank, was forced to buy government bonds to ease fears that the state pension fund could collapse. Interest rates were forecast to rise, meaning mortgages rates, as well as household bills, were set to increase against a backdrop of rising inflation. The budget prompted rare criticism from President Biden, who said “I wasn’t the only one that thought it was a mistake,” and that the outcome was “predictable.” Amid mounting criticism the government attempted to calm the storm, but last week Kwarteng, a long-time supporter and personal friend of Truss, became the first ministerial casualty of the policy, as he was asked to resign as chancellor. The new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, then announced an effective reversal of all the key measures introduced in the September budget -- leading many to speculate that he, and not Truss, had become the de facto leader of government policy. Tuesday’s headline in the Daily Mail, which backed her leadership campaign and supported her budget at the time, read: “In Office, But Not In Power.” While Truss insisted her plans were right for the country in public, the speed of the collapse in her authority with her Conservative colleagues has generated a great deal of parody. After The Economist magazine quipped that Truss “blew up her own government” so quickly that she had “roughly the shelf-life of a lettuce,” the Daily Star, a tabloid, set up a live stream to monitor if she could outlast a lettuce of their own. The Conservative Party still command a strong majority in the House of Commons after Boris Johnson’s election win in 2019, and the next public vote is not due until 2024. Truss insisted to the BBC on Monday she will lead her party into the next election, but now the new prime minister faces a daily challenge to stay in office.",3
2022-10-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-discusses-top-challenges-facing-us-abroad-russia/story?id=91741206,"Blinken discusses top challenges facing US abroad: Russia, Saudi Arabia, China","U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown ""no interest"" in engaging in ""meaningful diplomacy"" with Ukraine, after eight months of bloody war. ""Our purpose is simple. It's to stand with the Ukrainians, to make sure that their country remains independent ... and, ultimately, to have the strongest possible hand at a negotiating if one emerges, because President Zelenskyy has said himself -- at some point, this is going to end through diplomacy,"" Blinken told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in a sit-down interview airing Thursday on ""Good Morning America."" Stephanopoulos pressed Blinken on that point, noting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ""also said he's not going to negotiate with Vladimir Putin, only with the next Russian president."" ""Well, he's been clear that diplomacy is going to have to bring this to an end at some point,"" Blinken responded. ""But what we've seen thus far is no interest on the part of Putin in meaningful diplomacy."" When asked whether he thinks Putin is ""still rational,"" Blinken said: ""It's hard to put yourself in someone else's mind. I think he's rational, but the decisions he's making -- or maybe better put, his objectives -- are not rational."" Meanwhile, OPEC+, a group of oil-producing countries led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, announced earlier this month that it will significantly slash production in order to boost prices. The move has forced the United States to release 15 million barrels of oil from its strategic reserve, leaving many in Washington to question whether Riyadh remains an ally, even though Saudi Arabia voted in favor of a U.S.-backed United Nations resolution last week condemning Moscow's illegal attempts to annex parts of war-torn Ukraine. ""The step that Saudi Arabia and the OPEC+ organization took was one that was deeply unfortunate and also deeply misguided,"" Blinken said, ""to the extent that this causes oil prices to go up and Russia's exporting oil, it's helping to line Putin's pockets."" ""We're all trying to restore economic growth,"" he added. ""That's exactly the wrong time to engage in production cuts."" Stephanopoulos pressed Blinken on whether those are ""the actions of an ally."" ""In this instance, it's not,"" Blinken replied. ""But we have a multiplicity of interests with Saudi Arabia."" Russia's ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine and its global economic fallout are not the only challenges the United States is facing abroad. With Chinese President Xi Jinping poised to secure an unprecedented third term in office, Blinken said he believes Beijing will seek a speedy reunification with Taiwan, a self-governing island that split from mainland China in 1949, though Beijing claims as its territory. Xi, who has been in power for over a decade, has made clear his desire to reunite China with Taiwan and, in his speech opening the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing on Sunday, he gave no indication of changing course on the issue. When asked whether he thinks Xi will speed up the reunification process ""by any means necessary,"" Blinken said: ""Potentially by any means. Through coercion and pressure and potentially, if necessary, by force."" The U.S. government has a ""One China Policy"" that recognizes the people of mainland China and Taiwan as being part of ""One China,"" views Beijing as China's sole legal government and does not support an independent Taiwan, but considers the matter ""unsettled."" Washington is also militarily supportive of the self-governing island and maintains extensive commercial and unofficial ties. ""We're committed to doing everything we can ... to make sure that Taiwan has the ability to effectively defend itself against aggression,"" Blinken added. ""We've also made very clear to China that our expectation is these differences will be resolved peacefully."" Stephanopoulos asked Blinken what he has to say to Americans who may feel ""the world is more dangerous now than it's ever been."" ""I say yes, it is dangerous. It is complicated. It is full of challenge. And part of it is because we know what's happening around the world in real-time in ways that we never did before,"" Blinken replied. ""But at the same time, I'm also seeing incredible opportunities, and opportunities that we have to find ways to seize."" ""One of the first instructions I got from President Biden in taking this job was to reenergize our partnerships,"" he added. ""We have to be able to work with other countries. That's what our diplomacy's all about. And later today, here in Philadelphia, I'm going to get a chance to swear in some new American citizens -- one of the parts of my job that gives me the greatest satisfaction."" Stephanopoulos noted how Blinken's ""face just lit up."" ""It's the renewal of our country,"" Blinken responded. ""My late stepfather, he became a citizen of the United States ... and he used to say to me: 'You know, you are an American citizen by a very happy accident of birth. I'm an American by choice.' That's a very powerful thing. That's what carries our country forward.""",7
2022-10-20,https://abcnews.go.com/International/uk-prime-minister-liz-truss-announces-resignation/story?id=91788547,UK Prime Minister Liz Truss announces resignation,"LONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation on Thursday. Truss, who only became prime minister on Sept. 6, will be the shortest serving prime minister in modern political history. ""I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party,"" Truss said. Her resignation follows weeks of political and economic crisis, after the government introduced a new ""mini-budget"" which was roundly criticized. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer, has called for a general election. The Conservative Party, then under the leadership of Boris Johnson, won a large majority in the last general election in 2019. Whoever is chosen as Truss' successor from the Conservative Party ranks will become the fifth prime minister since the U.K. voted to leave the EU in the Brexit referendum of 2016 in an unprecedented period of turbulence in British political history. From outside the steps of Number 10 Downing Street, Truss said a leadership election would take place over the next seven days. Truss' budget was roundly criticized by opposition figures and economists, as well as sparking rare criticisms of domestic policy from President Joe Biden and the International Monetary Fund. Biden released a statement after Truss announced her resignation, saying, ""The United States and the United Kingdom are strong Allies and enduring friends -- and that fact will never change. I thank Prime Minister Liz Truss for her partnership on a range of issues including holding Russia accountable for its war against Ukraine. We will continue our close cooperation with the U.K. government as we work together to meet the global challenges our nations face."" While the chancellor in charge of the budget, Kwasi Kwarteng, resigned last week and his successor immediately set about reversing the tax cuts that had been promised, the damage to Truss' authority ultimately proved terminal. Tensions within the party reached a boiling point on Tuesday night ahead of a parliamentary vote that was seen as a confidence vote in the prime minister. Reports emerged that some lawmakers were manhandled by government ministers to get them physically to cast their ballots in the panic that ensued after more ministers resigned. ""It was very aggressive, very angry -- there was a lot of shouting. There was at least one hand on another MP and, to me, that was clear bullying and intimidation,"" a Labour opposition politician who witnessed the incident said. Rishi Sunak, Truss' former leadership rival and Jeremy Hunt, the recently installed chancellor, are the early favorites to succeed the prime minister, observers said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who resigned in scandal this summer, has emerged as a preferred candidate among certain lawmakers to make a sensational, if unlikely, return to the frontline of British politics.

2022-10-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/google-sees-chinese-iranian-hacking-election-cycle/story?id=91761304,"Google sees less Chinese and Iranian hacking this election cycle, they say","Just weeks away from the 2022 midterm elections, a senior Google official said Wednesday that the company hasn't seen the same style of hacking from groups backed by the governments of China and Iran as during the 2020 election. Speaking with reporters, Shane Huntley, the senior director Google's Threat Analysis Group, compared the current level of activity to past reports from the company that Chinese and Iranian actors targeted email accounts related to the campaigns for then-candidate Joe Biden and then-President Donald Trump in 2020. ""We haven't seen that this year,"" Huntley said. ""We're watching very closely.” ""It's so far relatively quiet on the hacking front,” he said. But, he added, outside groups remained focused on disinformation: ""There's a lot happening behind the scenes, but we haven't seen that sort of cyberattack nature that we've sort of have seen in previous years.” During the 2020 campaign, Google went public with what it said were documented attempts by Chinese and Iranian hackers to to compromise email accounts for Biden and Trump campaign staff. The efforts appeared to be unsuccessful -- but were a part of what federal government officials described then as ongoing attempts by foreign countries to interfere in domestic elections. (Both China and Iran have in the past denied accusations of cyberattacks on U.S. entities.) Of election security, Google's Huntley said Wednesday that major efforts were being made regarding that and disinformation. Google officials on Wednesday also offered a broader look at personal cyber security. Heather Adkins, Google's vice president of security engineering, told reporters that in the next five to 10 years, “We will see the death of the password.” She added that Google would continue to iterate on things like “security keys, passkeys that the authentication experience.” In May, Apple, Google and Microsoft announced a joint effort to expand support for passwordless sign-in across devices and platforms. “The reality is that everyone's gonna get hacked at some point,"" Adkins said. ""And the differentiator will become how quickly we recover from that. And you actually see that in Ukraine.” Noting the cyberattack on the American satellite company Viasat in the early days of Russia's attack on Ukraine, earlier this year, Adkins said the firm was “actually able to recover very quickly, quickly enough to put their feet back on the ground and then resist the invasion.” Huntley, the security official, said that Google has been able to to help Ukraine and Ukrainian government officials protect themselves amid the conflict, thus allowing the Eastern European nation to “take direct actions because we were actually able to help out.”",12
2022-10-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-travels-battleground-pennsylvania-john-fetterman/story?id=91795124,Biden makes rare appearance with Democrat for Fetterman's Senate race against Oz,"With the clock ticking toward next month's midterm elections, President Joe Biden on Thursday traveled to battleground Pennsylvania to tout his infrastructure law and stump for Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman. Biden's first stop was in Pittsburgh to visit Fern Hollow Bridge -- which collapsed earlier this year when Biden was visiting the state. Fetterman, the state's lieutenant governor, joined him there. ""You all told me about the emergency workers and pull the survivors to safety,"" Biden said at the bridge site. ""There were heroes that day, and a complete catastrophe was avoided. But it never should have come to this."" Biden gave remarks on the progress in the rebuilding of the bridge, which he said will now be done in a single year thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law -- one of the major legislative victories his administration's been highlighting ahead of the Nov. 8 midterms. Later Thursday, Biden is going to Philadelphia for a fundraiser in support of Fetterman, who's running against Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. Stepping off Air Force One in Pittsburgh on Thursday, Biden shook hands with Fetterman on the tarmac, telling him: ""You're gonna win."" The event was a somewhat rare appearance for Biden with a Democratic candidate this cycle. Some other hopefuls in the party have kept their distance from the president as he faces low approval ratings, and a handful have gone so far as to say Biden shouldn't run for office again in 2024. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released last month found Biden's approval rating underwater: 39% of Americans approved of his job performance while 53% disapproved. Fetterman, when asked earlier this month if Biden should run again, said that should be a ""decision made by Joe Biden."" “It’s not a matter of anyone’s choice other than his, and I respect any choice he decides,” Fetterman said on the podcast “On with Kara Swisher.” Fetterman added that he believes Biden would beat Donald Trump in a rematch, if both were to seek office again. ABC News White House Correspondent MaryAlice Parks questioned Biden about his appearances on the campaign trail as he departed the White House on Thursday morning. ""Mr. President, John Fetterman is gonna appear with you today in Pennsylvania ... but there haven’t been that many candidates campaigning with you,"" Parks said. ""That’s not true. There have been 15, count, kid, count."" Biden interrupted. ""OK, and are there gonna be even more?"" Parks pressed further. ""Yeah,"" Biden replied. At the fundraiser in Philadelphia Thursday night, Biden and Fetterman appeared to loud cheers and applause from attendees. ""I tell you what, I want to be standing next to big John when he wins,” Biden said to cheers as he concluded 26 minutes of remarks about Fetterman, Republicans, his own accomplishments and more. “Because John, you have character, pal. Character matters. And you have it."" Biden told donors “we need John badly” in Washington. “We've got to win,” he said. ""John's got to win. John's got to win."" The president this week vowed to sign a law codifying Roe v. Wade's abortion access rules -- if Democrats have enough senators after the November elections. “If we keep the Senate, keep the House, we’re going to pass, codify Roe,” he said to applause. “We’re going to make sure Roe v. Wade becomes the law of the land.” He said Fetterman has “integrity” and “you never have to wonder that he means what he says.” With a jab at Republican candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz, Biden said he didn’t realize Oz went to high school in Delaware, but “Delaware was smart enough to send him to New Jersey” and that Oz “is for undoing everything we have done.” Biden warned that if Republicans take control of Congress, they will attempt to undo some of the president’s first-term achievements and also attacked their latest threats to block aid for Ukraine. He also argued that if Democrats don't win, people will pay more for drugs and insulin.. The Pennsylvania Senate race between Fetterman and Oz -- who has labeled Fetterman a radical and assailed him over crime and safety -- is one that could determine which party controls the chamber next year, and Democrats see the contest as one of their best chances to pick up a seat and preserve or expand their bare majority.

2022-10-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/uks-prime-minister-potential-candidates/story?id=91851680,Who will be the UK's next prime minister? Here are the potential candidates,"LONDON -- Liz Truss announced her resignation on Thursday after only 45 days in office, making her the shortest-serving U.K. prime minister in history. Her resignation follows weeks of political and economic turmoil after her government introduced a ""mini-budget"" that sent financial markets into crisis and cratered the value of the Great British Pound. As a result, members of the Conservative Party’s 1922 Committee, the ruling group that sets out leadership contest rules, have introduced immediate changes to the process as the party prepares to name its third prime minister in two months. Potential prime ministerial candidates will need the support of at least 100 fellow Members of Parliament to secure their spot on the ballot to become the next party leader. The Conservative Party currently has 357 members in Parliament meaning there will be a maximum of three leadership candidates that could be put forward. The increased threshold of MPs needed to support a candidate for office “can be achieved by any serious candidate with a chance of going through” Sir Graham Brady, Chairman of the 1922 Committee, said on Thursday. Many see these changes as an attempt to bypass the Conservative Party’s internal membership voting in the leadership contest and, as a result, could produce another leader who creates further political and economic instability. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is speculated to make a dramatic return to the frontline of British politics only 6 weeks after he reluctantly resigned amid intense scandal. He remains popular with Conservative Party members but is seen as a liability by many of his fellow colleagues. On the potential return of Johnson, John Baron, MP for Basildon and Billericay, told the BBC that “we've now got to look forward and pick a new candidate, somebody who has credibility, experience and can unite the party.” Johnson has not yet confirmed if he is standing for office again but will be flying back to the U.K. this weekend after enjoying a vacation in the Caribbean. Former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is seen as another likely candidate after he came second to Liz Truss in this summer's leadership contest. Sunak repeatedly warned Truss that her economic plans and proposed tax cuts would create economic turmoil. The subsequent financial fallout looks to have proven him correct. Sunak is a potential calming voice and remains the U.K.’s seventh most popular politician, according to analytics firm, YouGov. However, reports that his wealthy family used non-domiciled status to reduce their tax payment is seen as a potential gift to Labour, the U.K.’s opposition party, amid the current cost of living crisis. Penny Mordaunt, who placed third in the leadership contest, is another likely favorite. Mordaunt served as former Prime Minister Theresa May’s defense secretary, the first woman to hold the post in British history, and her previous experience within the Ministry of Defense could be a vital benefit when it comes to how the U.K. deals with the war in Ukraine. Suella Braverman, the former Interior Minister -- who lasted a day less in office than Liz Truss did -- is another probable contender for the top job. A renowned anti-immigration and Brexit supporter, Braverman proposed strengthening the punishment for possessing cannabis and is seen as the preferred candidate for the ideological right of the Conservative Party. Across the aisle, however, Leader of the U.K.’s Opposition Party, Sir Keir Starmer, has joined other political leaders from the minority parties in calling for a general election. “The British public deserve a proper say on the country’s future” and “we need a general election,” he said on Twitter. The next prime minister will be announced by Oct. 28.",3
2022-10-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/chinas-xi-jinping-flipped-script-world-10-years/story?id=91858424,How China’s Xi Jinping flipped the script on the world during his 10 years in power,"Xi Jinping will stroll across the red-carpeted dais inside Beijing’s gargantuan Great Hall of the People on Sunday, having firmly secured a norm-busting third term as leader of the Chinese Communist Party, cementing his power atop a more confident -- and more defiant -- China. When he did the same walk 10 years ago, there was a brief sense of hope in the West that China was about to embark on a kinder and gentler age. “Just as China needs to learn more about the world,” Xi told the gathered press with a modest smile in his first speech as party leader in November 2012, “so does the world need to learn more about China.” In the lead-up, many sifted through his available biography for clues of what kind of leader he would be. He came of age during the chaotic years of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, rose to govern two of China’s most prosperous coastal provinces as well as the country’s most cosmopolitan city, Shanghai. Xi oversaw the well-received 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, sent his daughter to study at Harvard and often talked about the fond memories of an Iowa homestay in the 1980s. The son of a revolutionary-turned-liberal reformer, many China-watchers had hoped that the son would be like the father. This resume led many, like New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, to boldly predict in January 2013 that “Xi Jinping will spearhead a resurgence of economic reform, and probably some political easing as well. Mao’s body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch, and Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer, will be released from prison.” “I may be wrong entirely,” Kristof cautioned. Ten years on, not only is Mao’s body still comfortably lying in his mausoleum, but Liu was never released from prison until the final months before his death from cancer in 2017. Meanwhile, Xi’s China has become more confident, powerful and influential than ever before. Xi brought the Communist Party back to the forefront of daily life in China, linking the party to the country’s growing strength and success, which, in return, has fostered a nationalism that has become inseparable from the party itself. Yet, at the same time, his policies -- most notably his signature zero-COVID policy -- also has also left China more isolated and xenophobic than it has been in generations. In ten years, Xi has reshaped China Citing ""disorderly capital,"" Xi has cracked down on private companies, like tech giants Alibaba and Tencent, that powered much of China’s growth in the last 15 years and signaled a desire to return to the heavily self-reliant state-run model. Instead of political reforms, Xi dismantled China’s nascent civil society, shuttered NGOs and locked up human rights lawyers, stifled religious institutions from Tibetan Buddhism to Christian churches across the country -- perhaps nowhere more prominently than in the western region of Xinjiang where many mosques were dismantled and hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uyghurs have been forcibly re-educated in the name of anti-terrorism. He muzzled the domestic media, dictating that they must ""serve the party,"" suppressed Hong Kong’s once-promised autonomy and built a high-tech surveillance state that ultimately gave the state the ability implement its zero-COVID measures throughout the pandemic. Xi modernized the party’s People’s Liberation Army, encouraged a more strident foreign policy -- especially over territorials claims like Taiwan, the South China Sea and the Himalayas where Chinese soldiers had a deadly tussle with Indian troops in June 2020. He has sought to challenge the U.S.-backed world order by cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin whom Xi called in 2018 “my best, most intimate friend.” It turns out that pre-leadership Xi was not only a cypher to the West, but also worked within the opaque operations of the Party itself. Deng Yuwen, the former deputy of editor of the Central Party School’s journal, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this week that, according to party insiders, Xi was selected by party elders believing his low key demeanor would lend to him being more controllable than his rivals. “One can only imagine their regrets,” Deng wrote. Many should have taken heed when Chinese state media reported that one of the Xi’s favorite films was “The Godfather.” Like Michael Corleone, Xi quickly out maneuvered his rivals within the party and consolidated power through anti-corruption and loyalty campaigns and muted the influence of retired party members. ‘Redder than Red' Much more prescient at the time was the leaked 2009 U.S. State Department cable entitled “Portrait of Vice President Xi Jinping: ‘Ambitious Survivor’ of the Cultural Revolution.” Sourced from a private acquaintance of Xi, the summary read “Xi is ‘exceptionally ambitious’ confident and focused, and has had his 'eye on the prize' from early adulthood.” Unlike many youth who ""made up for lost time by having fun"" after the Cultural Revolution, Xi ""chose to survive by becoming redder than the red."" If the Party was China’s church, Xi is the ultimate true believer and, in Xi’s China, there is no separation between church and state. During the last party congress in 2017, Xi triumphantly declared, “Government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west -- the party leads them all.” Standing between China and chaos The exact same day as Kristof’s optimistic column on Jan. 5, 2013, the true Xi revealed himself to the party elite, delivering a secret speech that was only published in its entirety in the party’s magazine “QiuShi” -- Seeking Truth” in 2019. “Hostile forces at home and abroad … doing all in their power to smear and vilify,” he warned. “They aim to incite [the people] into overthrowing both the Communist Party of China’s leadership and the socialist system of our country.” His internal party speeches at that time reveals Xi’s greatest motivating factor: for the Communist Party of China to avoid the fate of the Soviet Union. In party study sessions, Xi would often pose the question, ""why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Communist Party of the Soviet Union fall to pieces? “In the end, no one was man enough, and no one came out to fight,” he answered in one speech. This was the period of the Arab Spring when popular uprisings in the Middle East overthrew their authoritarian dictators, Xi saw crises everywhere and a strong Communist Party with him at the helm was the only thing standing between China and chaos. During this time a secret document circulated within the party known as “Document No. 9” which warned that western democratic ideals like universal values, civil society, free market economy and the West’s idea of journalism threatened China’s security and needed to be eradicated. It read like roadmap for Xi’s eventual heavy hand. A veteran Chinese journalist was later sentenced to seven years in prison for leaking the document deemed ""a state secret"" to an overseas media outlet. There are no official polls in China but by all accounts, Xi enjoys popular support by those who have not been negatively affected by his policies. The Chinese government often points to a Harvard survey that found that 95.5% of Chinese respondents in 2016 were either “relatively satisfied” or “highly satisfied” with their government. As he is poised this weekend for even greater power, Xi once again highlighted looming external threats in his speech in front of the congress this week and doubled down on the path he has set for China and, by extension, the world. “The world has entered a new period of turbulence and change,” Xi warned the delegates. “External attempts to suppress and contain China may escalate at any time.” “We must therefore be more mindful of potential dangers, be prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios, and be ready to withstand high winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms.”",6
2022-10-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/early-voting-begins-north-carolina-abortion-inflation-appeals/story?id=91816703,"As early voting begins in North Carolina, abortion and inflation appeals divide the race","Hannah Demissie is one of seven ABC News campaign reporters embedded in battleground states ahead of the November midterms. Demissie is covering Missouri and North Carolina. Below, she describes what she saw and heard in North Carolina as early voting got underway last week -- with control of Congress hanging in the balance. See more of Demissie's work with the embed team and anchor George Stephanopoulos on Hulu's ""Power Trip: Those Seeking Power and Those Who Chase Them."" We're entering crunch time in the final weeks of the 2022 election cycle. Amid that countdown, a slew of big-name surrogates have been turning out for North Carolina's Democratic and Republican Senate nominees, Cheri Beasley and Rep. Ted Budd -- who are locked in a close, potentially crucial, race. Thursday stands out for me as a moment when the contest between Beasley and Budd may have started to shift. It was the first day of early in-person voting in the state, and some political heavyweights joined the campaigns. After months of the polling showing a virtual tie between the two candidates, according to FiveThirtyEight, Budd also began to open up a small but notable lead. Over the course of the day, though, both he and Beasley insisted that every vote mattered: not just for their race but for which party would have a Senate majority come January, with the power to block or confirm presidential appointments and shape or filibuster legislation on abortion, the economy and more. I started Thursday off with the North Carolina Democratic Party, which held a rally to kick off the first day of early in-person voting. There, Beasley, a former state judge, spoke along with other down-ballot Democratic candidates -- setting the stakes as she saw them. ""We know that the fundamental freedom to pursue life, liberty and happiness must be protected,"" she said, ""and we are the protectors every time we exercise our right to vote."" Another influential Democrat who joined the rally was North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who won reelection in 2020 despite former President Donald Trump winning the state that same year. Cooper notably expanded his margin of victory from 2016 in what one expert told ABC News was an example of the purple state's ""blue tinge"" at the state level. Beasley -- emphasizing health care and abortion access -- hopes to build on that success, despite her party's headwinds over inflation and the economy. Speaking Thursday, Gov. Cooper focused on what he called the GOP's extremism after Jan. 6. ""It's pretty clear that a majority of the Republican Party prefers an autocracy to a democracy as long as their guy is in charge,"" he said. ""If we want to preserve our democracy, we have to make sure that we're electing people who believe in it."" Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade this summer, abortion has become one of the most critical issues in North Carolina and Democrats have seized on the opportunity. During Thursday's rally, Beasley promised to use her Senate vote to codify Roe's protections, if elected. ""I will fight, and I will fight to make sure that Roe vs. Wade is the law of the land,"" she said. After she spoke, Beasley headed to a polling station in Raleigh -- trailed by reporters like me -- to cast her early vote alongside her husband and one of her sons. From there, I drove to Greensboro, where Budd was holding a campaign event with Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. During the event, Scott emphasized the importance of conservatives holding onto the North Carolina Senate seat after Richard Burr's retirement. ""We have to win in North Carolina,"" Scott said. ""If we don't win North Carolina, we're not gonna get a majority."" During Scott and Budd's remarks, both hit on the economy and underlined how many Americans are feeling the pain of historically high inflation. ""If you like paying more for everything, you should vote for Beasley and [President] Joe Biden, because they did that,"" Scott said Thursday. Budd was even more blunt, saying he'd heard directly from locals about how the rising cost of living made their daily needs less attainable. ""This is the grocery cart that she could afford two years ago,"" he said, describing one anecdote from a voter. ""And unfortunately, this is the grocery cart that [she] can afford now -- which is pretty empty."" Polls consistently show the economy and inflation are top of mind of many voters, who in turn give the edge on addressing it to the GOP. Republicans blame Democratic spending policies while Democrats, who defend themselves by citing low unemployment, say prices are fueled by supply chain issues, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other factors. Voters also largely disapprove of the president. On Thursday, as North Carolina voters began casting their ballots, Budd wanted them to think about Biden and Beasley as a package deal. ""I've got a record in the U.S. Congress that I'm running toward,"" he said. ""She's going to try to hide. She's going to run away from Joe Biden.""

2022-10-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/backlash-house-progressives-retract-letter-biden-ukraine-strategy/story?id=92063699,"After backlash, House progressives retract letter to Biden on Ukraine strategy","House progressives on Tuesday retracted a letter they sent Monday to President Joe Biden in which they urged him to directly negotiate with Russia on an end to the war in Ukraine, now in its ninth month. ""The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting,"" Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said in a statement Tuesday. Jayapal said she accepts responsibility for its release. Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar confirmed in a statement to ABC News Tuesday that the 30 progressives wrote the letter over the summer ""in response to reports that Ukraine was being pressured by Washington not to negotiate."" The retraction follows backlash from both Democrats and Republicans, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It also comes less than a day after Jayapal clarified the letter's meaning after initial criticism from lawmakers. ""Let me be clear: we are united as Democrats in our unequivocal commitment to supporting Ukraine in their fight for their democracy and freedom in the face of the illegal and outrageous Russian invasion, and nothing in the letter advocates for a change in that support,"" Jayapal said Monday. ""Diplomacy is an important tool that can save lives -- but it is just one tool."" When asked if the White House advised the Progressive Caucus to retract the letter, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday declined to comment on the letter. ""We appreciate the bipartisan effort,"" she said about funding for the war effort to date, ""and we are going to continue to be in conversations with members of Congress on how to continue to move forward in order to support Ukraine in their efforts,"" Jean-Pierre said at her daily press briefing. Speaking Tuesday, Pelosi vowed that Ukrainian aid would be included in an end-of-year funding bill. While the progressives who penned the letter urged direct talks with Russia, none of them have opposed more aid for Ukraine. ""Congress has secured over $60 billion in security, economic, humanitarian and budget assistance for Ukraine,"" she said at an international aid conference summit in Zagreb, Croatia. ""And more will be on the way when we pass our omnibus funding bill this fall."" In her remarks, Pelosi made it clear that the U.S. will continue defending democracy in Ukraine ""until victory is won."" Those comments make her the highest-ranking Democrat to seemingly buck the Progressive Caucus' message, which other Democratic lawmakers have criticized. Arizona Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego pushed back on the letter on Twitter, saying, ""The way to end a war? Win it quickly. How is it won quickly? By giving Ukraine the weapons to defeat Russia.""The letter also ruffled feathers among some who signed it. ""I signed this letter on June 30, but a lot has changed since then,"" California Democrat Sara Jacobs tweeted. ""I wouldn't sign it today."" Wisconsin Democrat Mark Pocan also said in a tweet that the letter was written over the summer and held for release until now. ""I have no idea why it went out now. Bad timing,"" he said. Directly engaging with Moscow as the now-retracted letter called for would mark a major shift from Biden's strategy of providing billions in military and economic aid as talks with Russia have faltered in recent months. House Republicans plan to put up a fight on passing Ukraine aid. Top House Intelligence Committee Republican Mike Turner of Ohio told reporters Monday that the end-of-year funding is going to be ""the wild, wild west of spending"" as Democratic lawmakers attach their final wish list of items during the upcoming lame-duck session. ""The problem with Ukrainian funding in the House is not Ukraine,"" he said. ""It's all the things that are being attached to it that have nothing to do with Ukraine."" Turner later signaled that the House GOP, including Leader McCarthy, would support providing more weapons to Ukraine. It all comes weeks before the midterm elections in which Republicans could take over control of the House. Last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Punchbowl News that a Republican House majority in the next Congress would not support ""a free blank check"" for Ukraine as Americans face a recession at home. Asked about the letter during her press briefing Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration is ""very thankful"" for the ""bipartisan support"" for Ukrainian aid it has enjoyed in Congress since earlier this year. Jean-Pierre said she had not seen the letter but that the White House would ""continue to keep those lines of communication open and continue to have conversations with members of Congress.""",15
2022-10-25,https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-brittney-griners-detention-russia-us-vows-secure/story?id=87925739,Timeline of Brittney Griner's detention in Russia as US vows to secure her release,"WNBA star Brittney Griner, who has been detained in Russia for over five months, was found guilty on drug charges in a Moscow-area court Thursday. She was sentenced to nine years in prison. As the U.S. floats a proposal to negotiate her release, here's a look back at major developments since she was detained in Russia more than five months ago. Feb. 17 Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native and professional basketball player for the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, is detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki as she returns to Russia to play during the WNBA's off-season. She is accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. Feb. 24 Russia invades Ukraine, unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases. March 16 After imposing a wave of new sanctions against Russia, President Joe Biden labels Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" during a press conference at the White House amid a State Department review of whether the U.S. considers Russia's attacks on Ukrainian civilians a war crime. March 17 Concerns in the U.S. over the well-being of Brittney Griner grow as Russia extends the pre-trial detention of the WNBA star until May 19. The extension of Griner's detention comes during a volatile time for U.S.-Russian relations as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates attacks on Ukraine. March 18 The U.S. State Department issues a statement demanding access to Griner. ""We are closely engaged on this case and in frequent contact with Brittney Griner's legal team. We insist the Russian government provide consular access to all U.S. citizen detainees in Russia, including those in pre-trial detention, as Brittney Griner is,"" it says. March 23 Griner meets with U.S. officials for the first time since being held in pre-trial detention in Russia for over a month. ""The consular officer who visited with Brittney Griner was able to verify that she is doing as well as can be expected under these very difficult circumstances,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price tells reporters. Griner's meeting comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken announces that the State Department has made a formal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. ""Based on information currently available, the U.S. government assesses that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Our assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources,"" Blinken said in a statement. April 27 Calls to free Griner and other Americans detained in Russia escalate following the release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed on April 27, who was freed from a Russian prison as part of a prisoner exchange. Former Marine Paul Whelan has also been detained in Russia since 2019. May 3 The U.S. State Department announces that the U.S. government has classified Griner's case as ""wrongfully detained"" in Russia. With this classification, the U.S. becomes more involved in negotiating for her freedom as opposed to waiting for her case to play out in the Russian legal system. May 6The WNBA honors Griner with a floor decal bearing her initials and jersey number (42) on the sideline of all 12 WNBA teams as the 2022 season kicked off. May 13Russia extends Griner's pre-trial detention until June 18 as the U.S. works to secure her release. May 25Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, speaks with ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts about her wife's detention and urges President Joe Biden to do everything he can to bring her home. Cherelle Griner says that her wife texted her when she was first taken into custody, but Brittney's phone is taken soon after. She says she is ""grateful"" for a call from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but adds that she would also like to also speak with Biden. ""I just keep hearing that, you know, he has the power. She's a political pawn,"" she said. ""So if they're holding her because they want you to do something, then I want you to do it."" June 8As the Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors prepare to face off in the 2022 NBA finals, players call attention to Griner's case. ""She needs to be home, she needs to be safe, she needs to be with her family,"" Warriors point guard Steph Curry tells ESPN. June 14A Russian court extends Griner's pre-trial detention for a third time, and says that she will remain in custody until July 2. June 20Cherelle Griner tells The Associated Press that she has lost ""trust"" in the U.S. government after a planned anniversary call between the couple didn't take place because the embassy line wasn't staffed over the weekend. ""I was distraught. I was hurt. I was done, fed up,"" Cherelle Griner said. ""We deeply regret that Brittney Griner was unable to speak with her wife because of a logistical error,"" a State Department spokesperson told ABC News, adding that the call will be rescheduled for a later date. June 27Griner attends a preliminary hearing as her detention is extended for the fourth time and the first day of her trial is set for July 1. June 30Friends and family members of Griner gather for a vigil outside the Russian Consulate in New York City, as pressure mounts on the U.S. to secure the release of the WNBA star. July 1Griner's trial begins in Russia. July 4Griner personally reaches out to President Biden, urging him to help get her out of Russian custody, in a handwritten letter delivered to the president on the 4th of July. ""As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey, or any accomplishments, I'm terrified I might be here forever,"" Griner wrote to the president. July 5White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tells reporters during a briefing that Biden read Griner's handwritten letter and her case is a ""top priority"" for the president. July 6Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris calls Cherelle Griner to ""reassure"" her that they are working to secure her wife's release, the White House announced. July 7Griner pleads guilty on drug charges, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage unintentionally. She said that she had ""no intention"" of breaking Russian law and packed the cartridges by accident. During the hearing, U.S. officials who attended the trial delivered a response letter to Griner from Biden, the State Department said. July 8Cherelle Griner speaks out at a press conference, saying that she read the letter Biden wrote to her wife and it brought both of them ""so much joy.""""I believe every word that she said to him, he understood and he sees her as a person,"" Cherelle Griner said. ""And he has not forgotten her, which was her biggest cry in her letter."" July 14Character witnesses take the stand in Griner's trial as the U.S works to secure her release. July 15Griner appears for the fourth day of her trial, where her attorney presents a letter from an American doctor giving Griner permission to use cannabis to reduce chronic pain. Griner is expected to testify but her testimony is delayed. July 26Griner returns to court, where she speaks briefly with ABC News and shares a message for her wife, Cherelle, who recently graduated from law school. ""Good luck on the bar exam,"" Griner said. July 27Griner testifies in court, saying she did not mean to leave the vape cartridges in her bag, but that she was in a hurry and was stressed after recovering from COVID-19 that month. She adds that she had permission to use medical cannabis and used a certificate to buy it in the U.S. In a sharp reversal, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced later that day that he will hold a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""in the coming days"" to discuss securing Griner and Whelan's freedom. ""We put a substantial proposal on the table weeks ago to facilitate their release,"" he said. July 29Blinken tells reporters that he had a ""frank and direct conversation"" with Lavrov about a U.S. proposal to exchange convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout in return for Griner and Whelan's freedom. ""I pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner,"" Blinken said. ""I'm not going to characterize his responses and I can't give you an assessment of whether I think things are more or less likely, but it was important that [he] hear directly from me on that."" Aug. 4Griner is found guilty on drug charges and sentenced to nine years in prison as her trial came to an end. Griner's attorneys, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, told reporters outside of the courthouse in Moscow on Thursday that they plan to file an appeal. Biden slammed Russia in a statement and called on Russia to ""release her immediately."" ""My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible,"" he said. Aug. 14A senior Russian diplomat confirms that exchange talks between the U.S. and Russia are underway. ""This quite sensitive issue of the swap of convicted Russian and US citizens is being discussed through the channels defined by our presidents. These individuals are, indeed, being discussed,"" Alexander Darchiev, head of the foreign ministry's North America Department, told Russian state news agency TASS. ""The Russian side has long been seeking the release of Viktor Bout. The details should be left to professionals, proceeding from the 'do not harm' principle."" Aug. 15Griner's attorneys file an appeal for her nine-year prison sentence, according to Blagovolina. Oct. 25A Russian judge rejects Griner's appeal of her nine-year prison sentence after just a half hour. Griner appeared via video before the appeal was denied, saying, ""I beg that the court takes in all of the stakes that was overlooked in the first court and reassess my sentence here."" ""I want to apologize for this mistake,"" Griner said. ""I did not intend to do this but I understand the charges brought against me. ... It's been very stressful and traumatic [being away from my family].""

Griner appeared virtually at her appeal hearing on Tuesday and urged the court to reassess her sentence, saying that people found guilty of lesser crimes were given shorter sentences. ""I beg that the court takes in all of the stakes that was overlooked in the first court and reassess my sentence here,"" Griner said, apologizing for her ""mistake"" and saying that it has been ""traumatic"" to be away from her family. Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native who plays professional basketball for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained on Feb. 17 at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki as she returned to Russia to play during the WNBA's off-season after she was accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges in July, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage mistakenly and that she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law. Griner's agent, Lindsay Colas, called the appeal decision ""disappointing, yet unsurprising,"" and one that ""further validates the fact that she is being held hostage and is being used as a political pawn.""

""In recent weeks, the Biden-Harris Administration has continued to engage with Russia through every available channel and make every effort to bring home Brittney as well as to support and advocate for other Americans detained in Russia, including fellow wrongful detainee Paul Whelan,"" Sullivan said. ""The President has demonstrated that he is willing to go to extraordinary lengths and make tough decisions to bring Americans home, as his Administration has done successfully from countries around the world. The Administration remains in regular touch with representatives of the families, and we continue to admire their courage in the face of these unimaginable circumstances."" Later Tuesday, Biden told reporters at an event while receiving a COVID-19 booster that ""we are in constant contact with Russian authorities to get Brittney and others out and, so far, we've not been meeting with much positive response. But we're not stopping."" As the U.S. works to secure the basketball star's freedom, Griner's attorney told ABC News earlier this month that Griner is worried that she may not be released. ""Her being afraid of not being released is mostly connected to the negotiations, which we are not aware of at all,"" Griner's attorney Alexandr Boikov told ABC News on Oct. 13. After being detained in Russia for more than five months, Griner was found guilty on drug charges in a Moscow-area court on Aug. 4 and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Her attorneys filed an appeal on Aug. 15. ""She is not very much hopeful for the appeal because the first court decision -- the verdict showed that the case is totally unjust even by present Russian standards, and we are not hoping for a big release, but of course we hope for the best,"" Boikov previously told ABC News. The WNBA star turned 32 behind bars in Russia on Oct. 18 but she was able to spend a few hours with her lawyers, who relayed birthday messages to her, as well as speak on the phone with U.S. officials. ""Thank you everyone for fighting so hard to get me home. All the support and love are definitely helping me,"" Griner said through a message shared by her attorneys. The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained,"" meaning the U.S. will more aggressively work to negotiate her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department has said. Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained, and some officials have expressed concern that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing war.

2022-10-26,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-hones-crime-debate-messaging-overlaps-note/story?id=92072154,GOP homes in on crime as debate messaging overlaps: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The biggest debate of the election cycle was about the outsized personalities in Pennsylvania -- and it was Democrat John Fetterman who was the first to mention the medical condition that couldn't help but draw notice. ""Let's talk about the elephant in the room: I had a stroke. He's never going to let me forget that,"" Fetterman said at the top of the first and only Senate faceoff in Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night. But his GOP opponent, Mehmet Oz, wasn't there to remind voters of that or to highlight halting answers that went into immediate social-media circulation. Oz was on the attack on other fronts -- repeatedly calling Fetterman a ""radical,"" ""extreme"" and ""dishonest"" -- and leaning in on crime and the southern border, where so many other Republicans are eager to go. ""John Fetterman takes everything to an extreme,"" Oz said. ""We should be talking about crime and inflation."" He was, and they did -- just like the candidates for governor of New York, debating an hour earlier on the same night, two weeks before the election, were also doing. Republican Lee Zeldin said at his debate with Democratic incumbent Kathy Hochul that he was there to ""save our state"" -- hitting on a theme that's recurred throughout debate season this fall. The fallout of the Pennsylvania debate is impossible to handicap. Fetterman repeated a refrain about his campaign being about anyone who ""got knocked down that had to get back up again."" And while his doctor says he's ready to serve and his team has touted his resilience, his recovery could be an awkward journey for some voters. But if Oz wins -- and he's had polling momentum, with more resources heading his way -- it's likely to be more about the issues he's raising than the words his opponent is using. In that sense, a highly unusual race could wind up looking something close to normal. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper House Progressives are retracting a letter that called for President Joe Biden to engage in talks with Russia regarding its invasion of Ukraine. The letter, signed by 30 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, stated that ""if there is a way to end the war while preserving a free and independent Ukraine, it is America's responsibility to pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine."" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, subsequently issued a statement on Tuesday withdrawing the letter that drew intense criticism from within her party. She claimed it was ""drafted several months ago"" and ""released by staff without vetting."" ""As Chair of the Caucus, I accept responsibility for this,"" she wrote. She later added that because the letter was issued after the House GOP leader, Kevin McCarthy, said there shouldn't be a ""free blank check"" from the U.S. for Ukraine, ""The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance that Democrats, who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of military, strategic, and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people, are somehow aligned with Republicans."" The controversy comes ahead of midterm elections that could shake up progressive ranks. It also puts a spotlight on intraparty divisions. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on the letter when asked Tuesday. The TIP with Libby Cathey In what could be an early sign of the ballot battles to come in 2022, a federal judge in Arizona will hear a newly filed lawsuit on Wednesday afternoon that is petitioning the court to block armed ""vigilantes"" from surveilling ballot drop box sites, according to court documents obtained by ABC News' Ali Dukakis. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi on Tuesday ordered an in-person hearing for the motion filed by two Arizona advocacy groups after reports of potential voter intimidation at two drop box locations over the last week. ""And things are getting worse,"" the lawsuit states. ""On Friday, two of the drop box watchers were armed and wearing tactical gear, and again on Saturday, armed and masked individuals were gathered near drop boxes."" The Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans and Voto Latino, in the complaint filed Monday, accused Clean Elections USA, the group's founder Melody Jennings and individuals who carried out ballot box surveillance associated with them of conducting a ""coordinated vigilante intimidation campaign"" -- in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 -- and ""with the express purpose of deterring voters … from depositing their ballots."" Jennings, who was a guest last week on former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's podcast and talked there about finding ""mules,"" a reference to the debunked ""2000 Mules"" film, posted on Truth Social over the weekend that some of the individuals at the drop boxes were not associated with her group. (Jennings and her attorney did not respond to requests for comment.) Wednesday's hearing comes after Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, also the Democratic nominee for governor, announced Monday that she's already referred six cases of potential voter intimidation to the Justice Department. ""Immediate relief is necessary,"" the lawsuit stated. ""Voting is already underway, and there are only 15 days left until election day. Defendants' organized vigilante groups have already turned away voters."" THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" podcast.

2022-10-30,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nancy-pelosis-husband-violently-assaulted-san-francisco-home/story?id=92280229,"Attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband was not random, police chief says","Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was ""violently assaulted"" by a man who broke into his San Francisco home early Friday, according to her spokesperson. Nancy Pelosi said in a Dear Colleague letter to all House members Saturday that she and her family were left ""heartbroken"" and ""traumatized"" by the attack on her husband. ""We are grateful for the quick response of law enforcement and emergency services, and for the life-saving medical care he is receiving,"" the letter read. ""Please know that the outpouring of prayers and warm wishes from so many in the Congress is a comfort to our family and is helping Paul make progress with his recovery. His condition continues to improve."" The attack was intentional, and not random, according to San Francisco Police Chief William Scott. The suspect, 42-year-old David Depape, attacked Paul Pelosi with a hammer when officers responded to a priority well-being check at 2:27 a.m. local time, San Francisco police said. Officers found both Paul Pelosi and Depape with one hand on a hammer when they responded to the home, according to Scott. When they commanded both men to drop the weapon, ""Mr. Depape took the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently attacked him with the hammer,"" Scott told reporters during a press briefing Friday evening. Officers tackled the suspect and disarmed him, police said. ""This was not a random act. This was intentional. And it's wrong,"" Scott said. ""Our elected officials are here to do the business of their cities, their counties, their states and this nation. Their families don't sign up for this, to be harmed."" ""Everybody should be disgusted about what happened this morning,"" he added, getting emotional. Paul Pelosi, 82, was struck at least one time, though it's unclear how many, Scott said. He underwent ""successful"" surgery Friday to repair a skull fracture and ""serious injuries"" to his right arm and hands, and his doctors ""expect a full recovery,"" the speaker's spokesperson, Drew Hammill, said in a statement. Two sources familiar with the matter told ABC News his injuries are ""significant."" Depape allegedly entered the house through a sliding glass door, law enforcement sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. The suspect shouted ""Where's Nancy?"" before allegedly striking Paul Pelosi, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington, D.C., with her protective detail at the time, according to the Capitol Police. Police said it was Paul Pelosi who called 911, and that the dispatcher could listen in to what was going on during his interaction with the suspect. Scott credited the dispatcher with using her intuition to know something was wrong and ""read between the lines"" of what she was being told. She dispatched the call at a higher priority than a welfare check would normally get, he said. ""I think this was life-saving,"" Scott said. Depape, who was hospitalized with injuries, will be booked on charges including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and elderly abuse, police said. San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said her office plans to bring forward ""multiple felony charges"" on Monday. His arraignment will likely be on Tuesday, she said. The motive is under investigation, Hammill said. Scott said they are not ready to publicly say what the motive was. But according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank dedicated to researching extremism and disinformation, Depape ""likely was motivated by a wide range of conspiratorial beliefs."" ""In the last two months, DePape has posted dozens of articles and videos to his blogs spreading conspiracies and hateful rhetoric related to COVID-19, women, Hillary Clinton, the Jewish community, federal law enforcement (e.g., FBI), government censorship, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the climate crisis, QAnon, the 2020 election, the transgender community, and 'grooming' in schools,"" the ISD said, though no posts were found specifically mentioning Nancy Pelosi. Authorities are examining a number of social media posts that appear to be associated with Depape which espouse conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines, 2020 false election theories, frustration with the Jan. 6 congressional hearings and anger over the conviction of Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd, law enforcement officials told ABC News. The FBI is expected to seek search warrants for any phones, computers or other devices that might be associated with Depape, the officials said. FBI agents were also interviewing people who know Depape across the Bay area on Friday, according to federal law enforcement sources. President Joe Biden spoke with Nancy Pelosi Friday morning ""to express his support after this horrible attack,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. ""It's despicable,"" Biden said during a fundraiser in Philadelphia Friday evening. ""Enough is enough. Every person of good conscience needs to clearly and unambiguously stand up against the violence in our politics regardless of what your politics are."" Vice President Kamala Harris told ABC News' Allison Pecorin that she also spoke with the speaker this morning. She condemned what she called an ""act of extreme violence."" ""I think we're looking at it at a time in our country where there is so much discourse that is fueled by hate and division. And anyone who professes to be a leader I think has to really understand the meaning and the impact of their words,"" Harris said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement, ""What happened to Paul Pelosi was a dastardly act. I spoke with Speaker Pelosi earlier this morning and conveyed my deepest concern and heartfelt wishes to her husband and their family, and I wish him a speedy recovery."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted that he's ""horrified and disgusted"" by the attack, adding, ""Grateful to hear that Paul is on track to make a full recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy reached out to Nancy Pelosi to ""check in on Paul and said he's praying for a full recovery,"" according to his spokesperson. Hammill said, ""The Speaker and her family are grateful to the first responders and medical professionals involved, and request privacy at this time.""

2022-10-31,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ufo-report-week-incidents-unexplained/story?id=92303931,"Another UFO report expected this week, some incidents still unexplained","The enduring debate about whether UFOs are caused by extraterrestrial beings will once again be front and center this week as U.S. intelligence agencies will provide Congress with an updated report on UFO incidents over the past year. Meanwhile, it appears that other more recent incidents are being attributed to weather balloons, other airborne clutter, and foreign surveillance, according to a U.S. official. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines has until Monday to provide Congress with its first annual unclassified update on Unexplained Aerial Phenomena, the new term for UFOs, that includes all new UAP incidents over the past year and any previously unreported incidents. The report was required by the 2022 Defense Bill that mandated that the DNI provide an annual declassified update and a classified annex by Oct. 31 of every year through 2026. The update follows the DNI's first-ever report released in June 2022 that listed 144 UAP incidents, only one of which could be explained. At a congressional hearing earlier this year Pentagon officials said that the number of UAP incidents under investigation had risen to more than 400. While it is unclear how many new reports will be included in the upcoming update, a U.S. official told ABC News that the most recent UAP incidents can be explained as a mix of weather balloons, airborne clutter, and foreign surveillance. But the official stressed that other incidents still cannot be explained. The official added that it cannot be determined who is behind the foreign surveillance but the most likely candidates would be China and Russia since they have the most interest in monitoring the U.S. military. ""There is no single explanation that addresses the majority of UAP reports,"" Sue Gough, a Defense Department spokesperson, said in a statement. ""We are collecting as much data as we can, following the data where it leads, and will share our findings whenever possible. We will not rush to conclusions in our analysis"" ""In many cases, observed phenomena are classified as 'unidentified' simply because sensors were not able to collect enough information to make a positive attribution,"" said Gough. ""We are working to mitigate these shortfalls for the future and to ensure we have sufficient data for our analysis."" Analysis of more recent UAP incidents is helped by the amount of information and data available as compared to older incidents. The U.S. official told ABC News that two of the three videos declassified by the Pentagon in 2020 and recorded from the sensors aboard fighter aircraft now have plausible explanations. In the ""Go Fast"" video Navy pilots are heard exclaiming how fast an object is moving above the water. According to the U.S. official, the leading assessment from experts is that what the pilots saw on their video screens was actually an optical illusion of an object that was not moving very fast at all. The illusion was created by the angle and height at which the object was viewed by the sensors as it moved above the water. The ""gimbal"" video taken in 2015 by a jet fighter crew that shows an object rotating in the clouds. The official says it's now believed that the object's strange movements and observed spinning was caused by the sensor aboard the plane that captured that image. There is no assessment for what is being seen in the third video commonly referred to as the ""Flir"" video that was taken in 2004. The general public's appetite for UFOs is sure to continue, and just last week NASA announced the 16 people who would serve on a new panel tasked with studying UAPs. Their report, based on unclassified information, is slated to be released in mid-2023. ..",12
2022-11-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-citizen-imprisoned-saudi-arabia-tweets/story?id=92478196,US citizen imprisoned in Saudi Arabia over tweets,"U.S. citizen and Florida resident Saad Ibrahim Almadi was arrested for a series of tweets he published that were critical of Saudi Arabia while visiting family in the Kingdom last November. His son, Ibrahim Almadi, spoke with ABC News' Linsey Davis Monday about his fight for his father's release and what he knows about the case. Almadi said his father has been tortured and sentenced to 16 years in prison, and that the U.S. is not doing enough to help his father. The U.S. State Department said in a statement to ABC News, ""we've consistently and intensively raised our concerns regarding his case at senior levels of the Saudi government several times in both Washington and Riyadh and will continue to do so. The Saudi government understands the priority we attach to resolving this matter."" PRIME: Thank you so much for joining us. Talk to me about that day that you last saw your dad. How did you hear about what happened? ALMADI: Last time I saw my dad, I thought everything was okay. I didn't know about his situation until December 20. That's when I reached out to the State Department and our embassy in Riyadh. PRIME: And what did you hear? ALMADI: They told me, ""we'll try to locate your father. We have no idea where he is right now."" PRIME: And did you ever learn then about some charges? How did that information come to you? ALMADI: Nothing until March 29th, when they saw my father at Al-Ha'ir prison. It's a political prison where they throw all the Saudis there for practicing freedom of speech, which they don't have in their constitution there but as American citizens, we have it here. PRIME: And so what are they accusing him of? ALMADI: Terrorism, trying to destabilize the kingdom and they torture him until convicted himself that he made these tweets to do that. PRIME: And you say that he's been tortured. What evidence do you have of that? ALMADI: That's his own words, his own reply to the judge. The judge wanted to sentence him for 42 years. But after reading my father's reply to the way the investigation went, they discounted him to 16 years from 42. PRIME: You've not been able to talk to your father. ALMADI: Until now. And the Department of State has no news about my father since August 10th. PRIME: So you don't really know his status at all? Is there any way to get any kind of update or what is the United States— ? ALMADI: I mean, the White House needs to recognize my father. He's a senior American citizen. I don't want my father to die in prison like Dr. Abdullah Mohammed. PRIME: Of course, you're aware of the publicity and the push to get the United States to free Paul Wheelan and Brittney Griner from Russia. Do you feel that there are any similar efforts underway to get your dad out? ALMADI: That's that's what I'm that's what I'm hoping for, but nothing yet. PRIME: You've said that the State Department has mishandled your father's case. And I do want to give you a quote that they have told ABC, they say ""we've consistently and intensively raised our concerns regarding his case at senior levels of the Saudi government several times in both Washington and Riyadh and will continue to do so. The Saudi government understands the priority we attach to resolving this matter"" and that they have no further updates. How do you respond to that? ALMADI: I mean, if His Highness Crown Prince, is quite sensitive from Twitter, I suggest he buy the rest of the stake, he can shut down Twitter. He can't send a senior American citizen to prison for practicing his First Amendment. PRIME: And so what does the U.S. State Department tell you? Do you get any updates from them at all? ALMADI: Nothing. Last time I talked to them was two weeks ago, and that is nothing. PRIME: And what did they say? ALMADI: We're still working on it. We submitted a ticket to see your father, but the Saudis didn't respond to the ticket. PRIME: If you could talk to your dad, what would you say to him? ALMADI: I love you so much. I will do everything to bring you back home. PRIME: Is there anything else that you can do? Do you feel, are your hands tied because you're just waiting for the State Department to act? ALMADI: Absolutely. They need to act and they must act. My father is facing the most aggressive sentence for an American citizen overseas. The Saudi court under MBS they broke a new record. They need to act. PRIME: Did your dad express any concern when he was going over there to Saudi Arabia, that because he had been critical of the government that something might happen? ALMADI: That's a lovely question. My father had his American passport printed, a photo of it, in his bedroom. And he told me 'son, if I'm gone, immediately reach out to our embassy.' PRIME: And you did that? ALMADI: Absolutely. PRIME: And you feel that the response has not been adequate? ALMADI: Not yet. PRIME: Well, we thank you so much for sharing your story, your father's story with us, and hope that it will do some good for you. ALMADI: Thank you, Linsey.",7
2022-11-01,https://abcnews.go.com/US/suspect-paul-pelosi-attack-now-facing-federal-charges/story?id=92424128,"Suspect in Paul Pelosi attack wanted to break Nancy Pelosi's kneecaps, according to court documents","The suspect accused of attacking Paul Pelosi told authorities he wanted to break Nancy Pelosi's kneecaps to show members of Congress that there are ""consequences to actions,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court Monday. The new revelation came Monday as the Department of Justice filed federal charges of assault and attempted kidnapping against the man suspected of attacking Paul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, last week. David DePape, 42, is accused of attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer in the couple's San Francisco home just before 2:30 a.m. Friday, according to San Francisco police. The state later announced charges against DePape including attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, false imprisonment of an elder, and threats to a public official and their family. ""What is clear based on the evidence thus far is that this house and the speaker herself were specifically targets of the defendant,"" San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said during a press conference Monday. Jenkins will ask for DePape to be held without bail on Tuesday. He is expected to appear physically in court for his arraignment. Nancy Pelosi issued a new statement Monday night, giving an update on her husband's condition and saying, ""Since the horrific attack on Paul early Friday, we have been deluged with thousands of messages conveying concern, prayers and warm wishes. We are most grateful."" ""Thanks to the excellent trauma care medical team at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, Paul is making steady progress on what will be a long recovery process,"" she said. ""Our family thanks everyone for their kindness."" DePape was charged with one count of assault of an immediate family member of a United States official with the intent to retaliate against the official on account of the performance of official duties, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, according to a criminal complaint filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. He is also charged with one count of attempted kidnapping of a United States official on account of the performance of official duties, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Federal charges were always a possibility due to early evidence suggesting the suspect appeared to be motivated to allegedly break into the home, at least in part, to reach the speaker, sources told ABC News. The attack was intentional, San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said Friday, describing a chaotic scene at the home once police arrived. Paul Pelosi woke up to the suspect confronting him about the whereabouts of the House speaker, Jenkins said Monday during the press conference. Paul Pelosi, who had been sleeping, was wearing a loose-fitting pajama shirt and boxer shorts, and was forced to get out of bed, Jenkins said. At some point, Paul Pelosi attempted to access the home's elevator, which contains a phone, but the suspect blocked his access, she said. At some point, Paul Pelosi asked to go to the bathroom, where he was able to call 911, the district attorney said. The defendant realized Paul Pelosi had called 911 and took him downstairs near the front door, Jenkins said. Paul Pelosi and DePape each had one hand on a hammer when officers from the San Francisco Police Department arrived before DePape was allegedly able to wrestle the hammer away and begin ""violently"" attacking Paul Pelosi with it, Scott said. Officers then tackled DePape and disarmed him, Scott said. DePape allegedly later told officers ""that he was going to hold Nancy hostage and talk to her"" and that he wanted to use the House speaker to lure another unnamed individual, the affidavit states. The suspect also allegedly told investigators that he intended to break Nancy Pelosi's kneecaps if she didn't tell him the ""truth"" about ""lies told by the Democratic Party"" and said she would have to be wheeled into Congress, therefore showing other members of Congress that there are ""consequences to actions,"" according to the criminal complaint. Paul Pelosi was struck at least twice with the hammer, sources told ABC News. He underwent successful surgery on Friday to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands, the speaker's spokesperson, Drew Hammill, said in a statement. Although his injuries are significant, he is expected to make a full recovery, Hammill said. DePape allegedly shouted ""Where's Nancy?"" repeatedly after entering the home through a sliding glass door and moving about the house, law enforcement officers familiar with the investigation told ABC News. The speaker was in Washington, D.C., at the time, according to Capitol Police. The suspect was carrying a bag that contained duct tape and zip ties, two law enforcement officials briefed on the probe told ABC News on Sunday. DePape was hospitalized with injuries following the attack. While police are still investigating the motive, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank dedicated to researching extremism and disinformation, said DePape ""likely was motivated by a wide range of conspiratorial beliefs."" ""In the last two months, DePape has posted dozens of articles and videos to his blogs spreading conspiracies and hateful rhetoric related to COVID-19, women, Hillary Clinton, the Jewish community, federal law enforcement (e.g., FBI), government censorship, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the climate crisis, QAnon, the 2020 election, the transgender community, and 'grooming' in schools,"" the ISD said in a statement, though no posts were found specifically mentioning Nancy Pelosi. Among the number of social media posts being examined by investigators include some in which DePape allegedly espouses conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines, 2020 false election theories, frustration with the Jan. 6 congressional hearings and anger over the conviction of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd, law enforcement officials told ABC News. Chief Scott said the department is working with Capitol Police, and that the SFPD is providing security. ""We will do whatever is necessary ... but right now, we want to make sure that people are safe, that they feel safe."" The incident has ""shaken a lot of people, and we want to make sure we do what we can,"" he said. ""It's sad to see that we are once again at a point in history where people believe that it's OK to express their political sentiment through violence,"" the chief added. DePape is expected to be arraigned Tuesday. It is unclear whether he has retained an attorney.

""The divisiveness that now grips this country is something that our adversaries, our adverse nation-states seek to exploit,"" Mayorkas told ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas. ""And they do that on online platforms."" The three main adversaries, he said, are Russia, China and Iran, which purposely attempt to sow discord ""in the American public."" The secretary was asked whether or not former President Donald Trump makes his job harder because people believe his falsehoods about the 2020 election. The secretary, while not directly addressing Trump by name, said the words of leaders ""matter"" and that the misinformation leaders perpetuate makes their job harder. He was also asked if DHS has a responsibility to neutralize claims of election fraud. ""It is the responsibility of government, not just the Department of Homeland Security, the responsibility of government. It is a responsibility of leaders. It is the responsibility of people in positions of trust to communicate accurate information to the American public and disabuse them of falsehoods,"" he said. Mayorkas, when asked, said he has not communicated with the former president about taking the temperature of the rhetoric down. Last week, the department warned in a bulletin obtained by ABC News that violent extremists could pose a ""heightened threat"" to the midterm elections, which are on Tuesday. ""The integrity of an individual's right to vote and to be able to vote with a complete feeling of safety and security is absolutely vital. That is the foundation of our democracy,"" Mayorkas said. ""Freedom of speech is a fundamental right in this country. That does not mean that one gets to scream fire in a movie theater or incite people to violent acts."" Mayorkas, who oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is primarily in charge of securing the nation's cyber infrastructure during the midterms and beyond, said they are doing everything they can do to protect the vote, including by combatting misinformation, and that the election infrastructure is ""safe and secure."" ""I think what's important is that we will do everything that we can to protect the American public, to protect the integrity of the vote,"" he said, adding that there is no credible direct threat to the election. ""It is our responsibility as a country to make sure that the American public understands what is true and what is not, in the sense that we have to build digital literacy. We have to make sure that an individual who reads things online or otherwise learns to assess the credibility of the source and make decisions for themselves as to fact or fiction,"" he said. Mayorkas also said there are a ""number of forces that are fueling violent extremism, ideologies of hate, false narratives, anti-government sentiment, personal grievances."" The attack against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, is just one example of the moment the country is in, he said. On Friday, a suspect assaulted Paul Pelosi with a hammer after breaking into the couple's San Francisco home in what the district attorney called ""politically motivated violence."" The suspect is facing a slew of state and federal charges. Since Mayorkas took the job in 2021, he has been sounding the alarm on domestic violent extremism in the United States. On Tuesday, he called what happened on Jan. 6 a wake-up call, along with the assault at the Pelosi home. ""Let's think about that assault and the fact that there is not unanimity of condemnation and abhorrence in this country over that brutal act,"" the secretary said. ""It should be another wake-up call with respect to the moment that we're in.""",12
2022-11-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/american-elections-resilient-vulnerable/story?id=89859386,Why American elections are resilient but still vulnerable,"This story is part of the ABC News series ""Democracy in Peril,"" which examines the inflection point the country faces after the Jan. 6 attacks and ahead of the 2022 election. America's elections system, though battle-tested and proven over decades, is facing a political environment in which public distrust has quickly eroded voters' confidence and threats to elections officials have raised new concerns. Voter confidence has wavered significantly following the 2020 election after former President Donald Trump denied Joe Biden's victory and promptly instructed his allies and supporters to demand the election results be overturned, leading to the violent events of Jan. 6. That, despite an election that experts called the most secure in the nation's history. Election skepticism stretches back years -- and, experts and polls say, is getting worse -- fueled in part by Trump's attacks on early and mail voting and before that, in 2016, doubt began to grow with reports of foreign interference. The reality, though, is that federal elections in America are hard to manipulate, nonpartisan experts told ABC News. Increased federal funding to support election staff and technological upgrades, expanded verified paper ballots and post-election audits, they say, along with electing public servants who fundamentally believe in the elections process, have produced federal elections that are mostly resilient. Experts from the Brennan Center, the States United Democracy Center and other groups who spoke with ABC News said elections succeed because of how diffuse they are -- any disruption would likely occur at the local level but not affect counting on a state or national scale. While fraud at any level is extremely rare, they say, there are more opportunities for interference at the local level because of thousands of different elections systems. These experts also said the election system's overall function and integrity falls squarely on the shoulders of one group -- elections officials -- from secretaries of state to election night volunteers -- who despite an unprecedented number of recent threats have mostly risen to the occasion to ensure accuracy and fairness throughout the process. Senior FBI officials told ABC News their election security task force has received more than 1,000 tips about threats to election workers since June 2021. Those threats were overwhelmingly through email, along with some others by phone and social media. Fifty-eight percent of the threats involved disputed election results, with roughly 11% of those more than 1,000 tips warranted further federal investigation. ""I'm not concerned about this upcoming election, because we have been relying on these public servants who really are willing to put partisanship aside, do the right thing to make sure our elections are reliable,"" said Gowri Ramachandran, senior counsel in the Brennan Center for Justice Elections & Government Program. ""But I would also say in the longer term, you know, we can't take those people for granted and we shouldn't take them for granted."" Elections in the United States, even on the national scale during presidential contests, are run largely at the county level. In some states, it's even more local, down to a municipality or township. Those on the front lines of elections are some of the biggest players: state and local governments, election officials, federal partners, and vendors. The top election official is usually the secretary of state, board, commission, elected or appointed individual, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Then, various levels of county officials, clerks or election boards who are tasked with designating polling locations and overseeing the volunteers who direct voters at the ballot box, run tabulation machines and observe lines, among other responsibilities, said Joanna Lydgate, the co-founder and CEO of the States United Democracy Center. ""The fact that election administration is so decentralized in the United States, it is an asset when it comes to election security, because it means that if there is some kind of disruption, often the impact of that is limited to just that local jurisdiction,"" Ramachandran said. ""It really severely limits the impact of any mistakes or interference that does happen."" But because American elections vary by jurisdiction, their safety and security also depend on the locality. Elections officials are typically trained through rigorous certification programs specifically tailored to their duties. In a state like Georgia, election superintendents provide training to all poll officers and poll workers regarding the use of voting equipment, voting procedures, all aspects of state and federal law applicable to conducting elections, and the poll officers' or poll workers' duties in connection to each election. Tina Taylor, who worked elections in Charleston County, South Carolina, in 2016 and 2020, said it was during her training that she really got a sense of how secure the voting process was in her county, given the number of different people and steps involved. ""How the voting machines are set up, there's no way that someone can cheat. I mean, we have so many checks and balances … you have to go through so much just to vote,"" she said. ""Everything is locked. Everything is calibrated, everything is numbered. Everything is initialed two to three times, witnessed by two or three people at the same time … I was just like, 'Well, I really don't know how someone could cheat.'"" Taylor's trust in the election process echoes what election security experts have long stated: disrupting federal elections in a significant way would be extremely difficult, if not nearly impossible. While mail ballots are more susceptible to fraud than in-person voting, it is still more likely for an American to be struck by lightning than to commit mail voting fraud, according to one Brennan Center report. ""Elections are run by states, but one thing that's consistent across the country is that state and local election officials have strict procedures in place to protect your ballot. These measures make sure that every vote is cast by a registered voter, and then counted and certified. Your vote is secure, no matter how you choose to cast your ballot -- whether you use a drop box, put your ballot in the mail, vote early, or vote in person on Election Day. We have a long history in this country of safe and secure elections. This year is no different,"" said Lydgate. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, dozens of state and local officials across the country told ABC News that preparations for the election are being hampered ongoing threats against election workers, but federal and state laws may provide protection. The nation's top intelligence and law enforcement agencies -- from the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security -- Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, U.S. Election Assistance Commission -- have confirmed the security of the 2020 election, saying there were no significant instances of voter fraud. The courts have also struck down cases alleging wide-scale voter fraud through legal challenges, Trump and his allies ""have failed to discount a significant number of votes, block the certification of results, or overturn the results of any race,"" according to a Brennan Center report. ""To date, [DOJ investigators] have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,"" said Trump Attorney General William Barr in December 2020. One of the primary resiliency measures employed in 2020, Ramachandran said, is that many election jurisdictions made significant progress on using voting systems that have verifiable paper records, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. Widespread mail-in voting added to that paper trail during the coronavirus pandemic, along with printouts of the voter's choices at in-person polling locations. ""The good news is that a lot of those are still in place, in terms of people's confidence in the upcoming midterms,"" said Ramachandran. There's also a promising trend of information sharing between The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (created in 2018) and state and local election officials, she said, with the federal government providing warnings and alerts to local officials, along with increased security at physical voting locations. Post-election tabulation audits, or checks on the equipment and procedures used to count votes during an election, are another foolproof way to ensure the safety of elections. This is already required in most states, including many battleground ones like Pennsylvania and Nevada -- states that have also been subject to intense voter fraud speculation from certain groups. Joanna Lydgate of the States United Democracy Center said that as she travels the county and talks with election officials, she's also encountered an ""incredible resilience and a commitment"" to the work, which is a promising trend ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. ""It's a very difficult environment right now in which to be doing these jobs. That said, I think that there is so much. There is so much resilience, and, you know, we saw in 2020 How good pro-democracy election officials from both sides of the aisle stood up and did their jobs under the most challenging circumstances,"" said Lydgate. ""You trust nurses and doctors with your health, you trust teachers, with your children's education, you trust a car mechanic with your vehicle. Election officials are professionals in the same way. They're trained to run our elections and we've trusted them to do that for decades."" Because elections are run at the local level, the process can also easily become subject to interference due to the vast number of opportunities for meddling among the thousands of different elections systems. Interference could occur through foreign adversaries, harassment and intimidation of election workers or even voter suppression measures, Ramachandran said, but because each election is conducted locally, those vulnerabilities would not affect voting on a nationwide or even statewide scale. ""Having so many different entities involved in elections … provides checks and balances, but it also provides more opportunities for interference,"" said Ramachandran. Taylor has been a poll worker at the same precinct in Charleston, South Carolina for six years. The 2016 cycle went off without a hitch, she said, with no recollection of fear and threats. During Election Day in 2020, she remembers a few Trump-aligned people who were not registered to vote at the location that showed up with aims to harass voters and poll workers. ""We had a couple of Trump supporters that came in. One in particular really took like, a couple of hours to get off the premises,"" Taylor said. ""She was trying to convince us that we were seeing things the wrong way … it was mostly mixed with QAnon and MAGA."" Taylor is not planning on returning as a poll worker at a time when South Carolina is seeing a mass exodus of election employees -- 22 South Carolina election directors across 19 counties who have left office since the 2020 general election. Two others have announced plans to leave at the end of the year, according to a new report by The State newspaper. And that's not unique to South Carolina. Another Brennan Center survey of nearly 600 local officials across the country found that one in five reported they were unlikely to continue serving through the 2024 presidential election. The problem is evident in places like rural Gillespie County, Texas, where all the elections officials abruptly left their posts just ahead of the midterm elections, or as large as in Georgia's largest county, Fulton County, detailed by former election worker Wandrea ArShaye ""Shaye"" Moss, who testified during a June 21 Jan. 6 committee hearing about her experience with harassment following false claims made by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Senior FBI agents told ABC News that foreign governments, especially Russia, continue to try to take full advantage of lies and misinformation suggesting mistrust in election results. Russia -- now embedded in the U.S. social media ecosystem and elsewhere digitally -- is using technology to covertly push and amplify false narratives about the election, they said. While Russian counterintelligence operatives used to create false narrative content themselves -- they can now rely on lies about the election being told by Americans and U.S. organizations, the senior FBI officials told ABC News. The officials also said that China is beginning to use some Russian tactics aimed at undermining confidence in U.S. elections and in some cases is targeting state and local officials.

2022-11-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-acting-worried-sounding-midterms-note/story?id=92396229,Democrats acting more worried than they're sounding about midterms: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein You can measure Democrats' confidence in their own midterm prospects by Twitter jubilation over polls that show tied Senate races, excitement over scattered early voting numbers or hype around late-breaking storylines that could impact a small handful of Senate races. Or you can look at where they're spending and what they're doing in the final stretch of voting -- and, in some cases, even what they're saying about how things look. Sandwiched between stops in Florida on Tuesday and weekend campaigning in Pennsylvania, President Joe Biden is campaigning in New Mexico and San Diego this week, where he hopes to help a gubernatorial candidate and a House incumbent in jurisdictions he carried by double digits two years ago. Biden will spend election eve in deep-blue Maryland, where he can celebrate a Democratic rising star in a race for governor, but where he is unlikely to move any congressional needles. Vice President Kamala Harris is also boosting a likely gubernatorial winner Wednesday in Massachusetts before heading to New York City on Thursday to help save another blue-state governor who is suddenly endangered. Former President Barack Obama is hitting a range of battlegrounds with specific hopes of juicing turnout among Black and Latino voters. Meanwhile, former President Bill Clinton has popped up down the stretch primarily in his adopted home state of New York, for his former White House aide, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney -- the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- and with more travel planned upstate on Wednesday. Biden has adjusted his messaging a touch in the last few days. He said after voting over the weekend that the election should rightfully be a choice and ""not a referendum."" That's a common refrain for the party in power -- but also one that points to the messaging difficulties in running on accomplishments that voters aren't necessarily feeling. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, recovers from a brutal attack by a hammer-wielding individual, some Republicans have made light of the incident. ""Nancy Pelosi, well, she's got protection when she's in D.C. -- apparently her house doesn't have a lot of protection,"" Kari Lake said at an event in North Scottsdale on Monday night. ""There's no room for violence anywhere, but we're going to send [Nancy Pelosi] back to be with him in California,"" Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin told a crowd last week while campaigning for Virginia congressional candidate Yesli Vega. Donald Trump Jr. retweeted a picture Sunday of a hammer and underwear with the message, ""Got my Paul Pelosi Halloween costume ready."" The insensitive remarks about the attack are in addition to false conspiracy theories floated by conservative figures including former president Donald Trump, who claimed on a conservative radio show Tuesday that Pelosi's attacker didn't break into the home. Law enforcement officials have denounced these claims. Both Democrats and Republicans have been on the receiving end of political threats and violence, but it's impossible to ignore the escalation of the rhetoric from the right that has fueled threats and attacks by extremists. Speaker Pelosi issued a statement Monday that her husband is ""making steady progress on what will be a long recovery process."" Paul Pelosi's accused attacker, David DePape, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to state charges stemming from the incident. He was expected to be arraigned Wednesday on federal charges he's facing. Many Republicans have condemned the attack of Paul Pelosi. In an interview with ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said, ""We do have to lower the temperature, and words have meaning. Words sometimes mean someone might come after you and take action."" The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The number of independent candidates threatening the possibility of upending statewide races fell slightly on Tuesday, as libertarian Marc Victor announced he is dropping out of Arizona's Senate race. As he ended his candidacy, Victor gave his endorsement to Republican Blake Masters, who is facing off with incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. Victor told ABC News' Libby Cathey in a written statement that Masters approached him and agreed to a public conversation, which ultimately pushed Victor to end his candidacy and give him support. ""I publicly offered to meet with either Mark Kelly or Blake Masters to have an unscripted discussion about why it was in the interests of freedom, peace and civility for me to step down and endorse either of them,"" Victor said. ""Blake Masters availed himself of that opportunity yesterday, and we had a public conversation where I asked him whatever I wanted. I was impressed with Blake Masters and his commitment to being a Live and Let Live senator from Arizona."" Despite dropping out of the race a week out from Election Day, Victor's name will still appear on the ballot in Arizona, and he has already had ballots cast in his favor. According to a spokesperson with Arizona's secretary of state's office, any votes cast for him will not be tabulated. Third-party candidates in Oregon and Utah could still impact their respective races. In Oregon, Democrats are at risk of losing supporters to independent gubernatorial candidate Betsy Johnson, a former state legislator who served for nearly two decades as a Democrat and is attracting support by presenting herself as a median between her opponents. In Utah, incumbent Sen. Mike Lee is in a tough contest against independent Evan McMullin, who is getting a boost from Democrats who chose not to advance a candidate from their own party.

2022-11-03,https://abcnews.go.com/US/brittney-griner-meets-us-officials-russia-white-house/story?id=92616275,Brittney Griner meets with US officials in Russia as White House works to secure her release,"WNBA star Brittney Griner, who is facing nine years in a Russian prison, met with U.S. Embassy officials in Russia on Thursday, according to State Department spokesman Ned Price. ""They saw firsthand her tenacity and perseverance despite her present circumstances. We continue to press for the immediate release of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan and fair treatment for every detained American,"" Price said in a tweet announcing the visit. Thursday's visit marks the first time U.S. officials have been able to gain direct Griner since early August. Most recently, they were able to speak with her over the phone on her birthday on Oct. 18. Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native who plays professional basketball for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained on Feb. 17 at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki as she returned to Russia to play during the WNBA's offseason after she was accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that the Biden administration was told that Griner is ""doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances."" Jean-Pierre said that securing the freedom of Griner and Whelan, a U.S. citizen and former Marine who has been detained in Russia since 2019, continues to be a ""top priority"" for the White House. ""As we have said before, the U.S. government made a significant offer to the Russians to resolve the current unacceptable and wrongful, wrongful detentions of American citizens Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""I can also tell you that in the subsequent weeks, despite a lack of good faith negotiation by the Russians, the U.S. government has continued to follow up on that offer and propose alternative potential ways forward with Russians through all available channels."" Price previously expressed concern about the irregular access to Americans detained in Russia. ""We continue to impart on the Russian government the necessity of consistency and regular consular access to Brittney Griner but also to all of those Americans who are detained in Russia,"" Price said last month. Griner's meeting with U.S. officials comes after a Russian court denied Griner's appeal in a hearing on Oct. 25. Griner appeared virtually at her appeal hearing and urged the court to reassess her sentence, saying that people found guilty of lesser crimes were given shorter sentences. ""I beg that the court takes in all of the stakes that was overlooked in the first court and reassess my sentence here,"" Griner said, apologizing for her ""mistake"" and saying that it has been ""traumatic"" to be away from her family. Prior to the denial of her appeal, Griner's attorney, Alexandr Boikov, told ABC News, ""Her being afraid of not being released is mostly connected to the negotiations, which we are not aware of at all."" Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, told ""The View"" in an interview that aired on Tuesday the denial of the WNBA star's appeal was ""just disheartening"" and left her in ""complete disbelief."" ""I understand being in the field of law that every state, every country has their own rules, but this is just absurd,"" Cherelle Griner said. ""The crime and the punishment is disproportionate at its finest. ... There are people convicted of murder in Russia who [have] a sentence way less than B.G., and it just makes absolutely no sense to me."" Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges in July, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage mistakenly and that she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law. The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained,"" meaning the U.S. will more aggressively work to negotiate her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department has said. Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained, and some officials have expressed concern that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing war. ABC News' Sarah Kolinovsky, Tanya Stukalova and Shannon Crawford contributed to this report.",20
2022-11-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/midterms-outcome-shape-us-foreign-policy/story?id=92146530,How the midterms outcome might shape US foreign policy,"While domestic issues such as inflation, crime, and abortion access have dominated the run-up to the midterm elections, how Americans cast their ballots may also have consequences for a host of pressing international concerns, including Vladimir Putin's ruthless campaign in Ukraine and Iran's rapidly accelerating nuclear program. ABC News spoke to foreign policy and national security experts and former officials about how the outcome of the midterms vote might drive the country's foreign policy for the next two years. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the leading candidate for House speaker if Republicans take control of the chamber, warned last month that his party wouldn't ""write a blank check"" to Ukraine, suggesting a Republican red wave might mean rolling back support for Kyiv's efforts to fend off Russia's invasion. Scott Anderson, a former U.S. diplomat and a visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, says opposition to major aid packages for Ukraine could build in a Republican-run House -- but it's unlikely to happen overnight. ""I suspect it is going to be a slow, gradual shift over the course of the next Congress. Generally, support for Ukraine seems pretty popular right now,"" he said. ""I don't think Republicans are going to want to run headlong against that."" But Anderson says McCarthy's comments likely resonate with at least some Republicans who have remained mostly quiet through the Ukraine crisis so far -- a group closely aligned with former President Donald Trump. ""It's the contingent that was most vocally opposed to Ukraine in the first impeachment, that was more skeptical of Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- who is now broadly seen as a pretty heroic figure -- and more friendly to Vladimir Putin, who is coming out of this not just looking like a villain, but looking like an incompetent villain,"" he said. ""So, it's been very embarrassing for them to talk about, but those underlying views haven't really changed."" Those lawmakers could soon become louder, according to Anderson. ""Because it's a wing tied to Donald Trump and his political support base, it's tied to a lot of people who right now are some of the biggest funders and most active organizers in the Republican Party. So, they have a kind of outsize influence, because they're the ones who can help House races and members of Congress fight in competitive elections,"" he stated. Recently, Democratic politicians have also cast doubt on whether their party will remain united behind the Biden administration's approach to Ukraine. In late October, a letter signed by 30 House progressives was released calling for the White House to link aid to Kyiv with movement towards a negotiated end to the conflict, but withdrew it after they faced significant blowback. Anderson says the letter was poorly timed, but illustrative of a faction that could ultimately break with President Joe Biden even if Democrats hold onto the House. ""They frame themselves more as noninterventionist -- folks who are worried about promoting conflict or exercising too much malign influence overseas,"" he said, adding that if the tides change in Ukraine during the months to come, those lawmakers may feel embolden and more aggressively advocate for a different approach. Both Anderson and Anthony Cordesman, the Emeritus Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former national security assistant to GOP Sen. John McCain, argue that economic woes could eventually challenge support for Ukraine across the political spectrum. ""When you really look at the money going abroad, it so far is still pretty limited compared to what we were spending on Afghanistan,"" Cordesman said. ""But if there is a steady increase in inflation and economic problems, there may be pressure for civil spending at the expense of defense spending."" Cordesman thinks the economy would have to suffer a few more blows to get to that point, but it ""doesn't mean that there won't be a lot of noise"" about money flowing abroad coming from Capitol Hill when the new Congress is sworn in in January. A Republican-dominated Congress could push the Biden administration to pay more attention to another thorn in its side: Iran. Originally, the president's approach to curbing Iran's nuclear program was dominated by its efforts to coax it back into the Obama-era pact that Trump exited in 2018. After months of sputtering negotiations, that aim has been all but abandoned -- but the White House has not officially declared that the talks are dead. ""The Biden administration has signaled that the nuclear deal is not its priority, but there is a significant disconnect between its actions and its words on the Iran threat,"" said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who argues there is a persisting perception that the U.S. remains eager to resurrect the agreement in exchange for rolling back other penalties against Tehran. ""If there is a change in control of Congress, because of how partisan unfortunately a lot of Iran policy has become, there would be more pressure--given that the current administration and many Democrats in general campaigned on resurrecting a deal and engaging with Iran,"" he said. ""There certainly will be desire for more scrutiny and oversight."" Regardless of which party is in the driver's seat, Taleblu says the next Congress' first order of business should be demanding a clear strategy from the White House on combatting the blooming partnership between Iran and Russia. ""There is a lot to unpack there, and in order to move forward on policy, Congress needs answers first,"" Taleblu said. After OPEC+ announced last month it would cut oil production, potentially hurting Democrats' chances at the ballot box, members of the party started calling for its de facto leader -- Saudi Arabia -- to be punished, calling for a block on arm sales to Riyadh or for the U.S. to pull troops from the country. President Biden has promised ""consequences"" for the kingdom but slow-walked any action, while administration officials have stressed the U.S has a range of interests in Saudi Arabia extending beyond energy needs. Anderson says no matter the outcome of the elections, any sharp retaliation is unlikely. ""Even if you see Democrats being more vocal and threatening sanctions for Saudi Arabia, they aren't going to disagree with the Biden administration. They're just playing bad cop to the Biden administration's good cop, and trying to encourage Saudi Arabia to take a little bit of a different tack,"" he said. But Taleblu predicts that if Democrats have enough momentum and the votes to follow through on their proposals next year, the measures could prove detrimental when it comes to stamping out mutual threats in the Middle East. ""Ally maintenance is sometimes harder than adversary maintenance, especially when it intersects with partisan politics,"" he said. ""If the relationship with Saudi Arabia and other states in the Persian Gulf are further politicized and the dividends of the existing national security relationships are not appreciated, Washington could be shooting itself in the foot."" Cordesman argues that regardless of how the midterms play out, how bitter things get with Saudi Arabia depends on whether winter brings surging energy costs. ""The more prices rise, the more people may find themselves feeling that more pressure should be put on Saudi Arabia other Gulf exporters to go back to the higher levels of export,"" he said.",7
2022-11-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/women-turn-home-abortions-unregulated-pill-sites-expand/story?id=92599420,"Women turn to at-home abortions, as unregulated pill sites expand operations","Jane was living in rural New Mexico when she discovered she was pregnant. She never wanted to have children or carry a pregnancy and knew immediately she wanted an abortion. But while abortion remains legal in the state, she says she also didn't want to take her chances with long waitlists at a clinic or a sudden change in the law that would put her in limbo. She had volunteered at an abortion hotline years ago and knew that even before the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, waiting periods and mandated ultrasounds can cost extra time and money. So, instead she turned to her closet, where she kept a package of abortion pills purchased online for $150 after an earlier pregnancy scare. Rather than a doctor, she relied on the counsel of a few close friends and called the M+A Hotline, an anonymous help line that counsels women experiencing miscarriages and abortions. ""I was not in a place where I could call a bunch of (clinics), and get 'no's,'"" said Jane, who agreed to tell her story on condition that ABC not use her real name -- or identify the online pharmacy she used -- because of privacy concerns and fear of criminal prosecution. ""I wanted certainty,"" she added. ""And I didn't want to be pregnant."" Less than five months after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the impact on women across the country has become almost impossible to measure. Abortion access has become considerably more restricted on paper – at least 14 states have ceased nearly all legal abortion services, including prescriptions for medication abortions. Data released this week estimated there were 10,670 fewer legal abortions since the Supreme Court decision. But advocates say those numbers aren't telling the whole story. They estimate that demand for abortion pills has exploded, even in states where abortion remains accessible because of the legal uncertainty. Stepping in to fill that demand are online pill brokers that are buying generic versions of the drugs in bulk from pharmacies in India, Russia and Vietnam. The drugs are then shipped illegally to U.S. consumers at a significant markup -- as much as 10 times the original cost or higher -- but still a fraction of the $400 to $500 price tag charged by many abortion clinics, advocates say. The result in many cases is that online abortion medication is emerging as a cheaper, easier option, if also unregulated in many cases. ""We have known for a long time -- even when people have access to clinics -- that some people may prefer other routes of access because of privacy, convenience or cost reasons,"" said Elisa Wells, founder of the online abortion site Plan C, which helps people find services that will deliver abortion medication. While a precise accounting of self-managed abortions is nearly impossible, there's no doubt it's growing dramatically, she said. ""There's a big market for these pills,"" Wells said. Mifepristone, also sold under the brand name Mifeprex, has been available in the U.S. for 22 years. It works by blocking the hormone progesterone needed to continue a pregnancy. It is typically prescribed with a second drug, misoprostol, which causes cramping and bleeding to empty the uterus. Under rules by the Food and Drug Administration, only certified providers can prescribe mifepristone to someone less than 10 weeks pregnant. The person must be screened for potential health complications like bleeding disorders. They also would would want to rule out an ectopic pregnancy, which requires immediate life-saving treatment. While state rules can be stricter, or might ban the drug outright, the FDA says mifepristone is safe enough to be offered via telehealth and mailed to a person's house without seeing a doctor in person -- so long as it comes from one of two government-inspected manufacturers -- Danco Laboratories and GenBioPro. ""You should not buy Mifeprex or its approved generic over the Internet because you will bypass important safeguards designed to protect your health,"" the FDA warns online. Still, as Americans in recent decades have crossed the U.S.-Canadian border for cheaper insulin or flown to India for more affordable medical procedures, many women post-Roe appear to be bypassing these warnings and state laws to get the abortion pill delivered to their doorstep. One site, Medside24, said it's based in Kazakhstan and ships medication into the U.S. from overseas. The company said it began operations three years ago as an anonymous ""no questions asked"" way for people to access the drug. In answers to questions emailed by ABC, the company said its suppliers can change based on availability but generally come from Vietnam, Thailand, China and Russia. It said it takes about a 30% profit margin -- down this year from 50% as manufacturers raise their prices to supply the drug. Medside24 said its abortion medication is ""genuine because we use them in our family planning clinics in Kazakhstan"" and have never had a problem. When asked about the FDA's warning not to use unregulated medications procured from overseas, the company said it's not surprising a U.S. regulatory agency would discourage use of any product it can't control. ""If the kits are used according to instructions then it would be fine,"" the company wrote in a statement. A research paper published Tuesday in the medical journal JAMA found another online site Aid Access -- which offers women telehealth appointments and writes abortion prescriptions filled by a pharmacy in India and shipped to their home -- saw a spike in requests for pills from the U.S. following the Supreme Court decision. Requests increased the most in states with near-total bans, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Oklahoma. ""The evidence that we've seen shows us that when you ban or severely restrict abortion, you don't do anything to change the need for abortion. But what you seem to do is change how and where people access care,"" said Dr. Abigail Aiken, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the co-authors on the study, in an interview with FiveThirtyEight. Other online pharmacies appear to offer little or no medical evaluation, shipping the medication directly with few questions asked. That leaves many people getting abortions with medical concerns that they can't always take to their doctor due to fears of prosecution. April Lockley, the medical director of the M+A Hotline, which answers medical questions about miscarriages and abortions but does not provide access to abortion medication, said the line saw an uptick in calls after Texas passed its abortion ban and again after the Supreme Court decision last summer. She said the hotline is currently averaging about 25 to 50 contacts per day. It's not immediately clear whether the FDA has any of these online pharmacies on its radar, or if the agency has the bandwidth or appetite to go after them. While the agency has written stern warning letters to Aid Access, no other enforcement actions have been made public. Online medication abortion is an option that Texas resident Jessica Garza wished was on her radar last year when she found out she was six-weeks pregnant. Garza said she was struggling with severe depression following the traumatic birth of her daughter six months prior. A stay-at-home mom, she arranged to travel to Louisiana, which at the time allowed surgical abortions. At the clinic, Garza faced a lengthy wait list and state-mandated restrictions that meant she had to make the trip multiple times. She was 15 weeks along before she could get the abortion – a wait she described as agonizing and traumatic. ""I believe if I was forced to carry that pregnancy to term – I don't think I would have survived it. I was in such a bad place,"" said Garza. For Jane, she said she has no regrets working outside the system. ""As much as I worried about what I Googled and who I texted – going to a clinic physically in some ways felt more visible and legally risky,"" she said. With clinics, she said, ""you've got to cross borders and you've got to cross picket lines. No thank you.""",25
2022-11-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-fetterman-celebrates-oprah-endorsement-unbelievable/story?id=92662674,John Fetterman celebrates Oprah endorsement: 'It's unbelievable',"Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman told the hosts of ABC's ""The View"" on Friday he's thrilled about receiving Oprah Winfrey's endorsement over his Republican opponent, and her former TV sidekick, Dr. Mehmet Oz. ""She’s an icon. It’s unbelievable,"" Fetterman said. ""It’s an honor and I’m so grateful that she understands what’s at stake here in this race."" Winfrey, whose hit daytime show gave Oz national attention as ""America's Doctor"" in the 2000s, announced Thursday night she's supporting Fetterman in the highly contested Senate race that could determine which party wins control of the chamber. ""If I lived in Pennsylvania, I would have already cast my vote for John Fetterman, for many reasons,"" Winfrey said during an online discussion about the importance of voting. For months, Winfrey had been silent about Oz's candidacy. The Oz campaign responded to her endorsement of Fetterman late Thursday night. ""Doctor Oz loves Oprah and respects the fact that they have different politics,"" said spokesperson Brittany Yanick. ""He believes we need more balance and less extremism in Washington."" Fetterman suffered a stroke in May and has since worked with a speech therapist. As an aid for Fetterman's auditory processing issues during his debate with Oz last week, two monitors were hung above moderators' heads to transcribe both the questions and Oz's answers in real time. A week before his debate with Oz, Fetterman's doctors said he was ready for ""full duty"" in office. Still, he declined to release his medical records. Fetterman addressed his health on ""The View."" ""I continue to get better and better every day,"" he said. ""I really do fundamentally believe that both our doctors believe we're fit to serve, and we've been able to maintain the ... rigors of running a campaign going all across Pennsylvania, and spending thousands and thousands of miles all across the state."" ""The View"" co-host Ana Navarro pointed out that while senators in the past have faced serious health challenges in office, none have had these health issues before being elected. With only having released two letters from his doctor and failing to share his medical records, Navarro questioned if Fetterman owes voters full transparency regarding his health. ""I really feel that we have been leaving the same equivalent, kind of, medical information that Dr. Oz did,"" he said. ""We have been very transparent in all our doctors' beliefs, both from June, and also in October, all agree that I am fit to serve."" ""I believe in the team of my doctors, and believe that we're here today, right now on live TV, being able to have this conversation,"" he added. ""I feel that we're running a very transparent race about health issues."" Fetterman addressed his debate with Oz last week, saying that ""it certainly wasn't an even event"" for him, but he thought it was ""critical"" that he ""showed up."" ""I was proud to show up,"" he continued. ""It was much more pleasant being with all of you today than it was on the stage with Dr. Oz."" During his debate with Oz, Fetterman pressed him on his wealth, including the number of mansions he owns. Acknowledging that he has a privileged upbringing himself, Fetterman explains the difference between him and his opponent in that regard. ""It's not necessarily a full equivalence in terms of the money involved, but I really dedicated my career to help young people get their GEDs; to run for mayor of the community; to fight against gun violence as they try to create economic development,"" Fetterman said. ""Dr. Oz chose to really fight for his bank account,"" he added. During last week's debate, Oz made a controversial comment about a woman's choice to have an abortion when he said, ""I don't want the federal government involved with that at all. I want women, doctors, local and political leaders leading the democracy ... to put the best ideas forward so states can decide for themselves."" On ""The View,"" Fetterman said that ""as a local political official"" himself, it's not his decision to make. ""I've always believed that the choice is always between a woman and their doctor,"" he said. ""I've always believed in Roe v. Wade."" Another hot button issue during the debate was fracking. While Fetterman previously opposed it, he came out in support of it during his debate. He told co-host Alyssa Darah Griffin on Friday, ""Any of the issues I ever had with fracking is really around environmental regulations. Once those were passed and they were addressed, you know, I support fracking."" ""I'm absolutely supporting energy independence as well, too, and making sure we can never be held by a country like Russia, and making sure we produce as much American energy as possible,"" he continued. ""I fully support fracking."" Fetterman added that he thinks it's important ""to walk that line between ... making sure we produce as much energy from traditional sources here, but we also make the kind of investment to make sure we make the transition to more and more green energy."" On ""The View,"" Fetterman acknowledged that inflation is ""really critical"" to voters and ""a tax on working people,"" something he believes Oz couldn't relate to. ""To really fully understand how to fight inflation, you have to understand how it works and how it impacts working people, as well. And I just fundamentally believe Dr. Oz doesn't really understand that,"" Fetterman said, adding that it's ""critical that we step up and fight against"" corporate greed and price gouging. ""Inflation, as we know, hurts working families all across Pennsylvania. And I think that leads to, you know, record profits for corporations,"" he continued. ""It is more critical we stand with American workers and making sure that we manufacture more and more things here, both in Pennsylvania and in America. Closing out his interview on the daytime talk show, Fetterman shared his message with Pennsylvania voters, calling out his opponent for ""using Pennsylvania"" in the process. ""I believe that I'm running to serve Pennsylvania because I've made that long career serving Pennsylvania, and I believe Dr. Oz is essentially using Pennsylvania,"" he said. ""[Oz] is attempting to buy the seat here, and he is gonna be spending over $20 million of his own money."" ""I really want to fight for every person in Pennsylvania that ever got knocked down, that had to get back up,"" Fetterman continued. ""I fundamentally believe that I'm always gonna keep getting better and better, and Dr. Oz is gonna remain to be the kind of fraud in the kind of career, lying and kind of selling these kinds of magic pills, and enriching himself.""",7
2022-11-04,https://abcnews.go.com/International/muppets-moscow-true-story-making-sesame-street-russia/story?id=92540407,Muppets in Moscow: The true story of making 'Sesame Street' in Russia,"When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, producers, artists, writers and other creative people became involved in creating culture for what they imagined would be a new, more open society. Natasha Lance Rogoff, a journalist and filmmaker living in Russia at the time, author of the new book ""Muppets in Moscow: The Unexpected Crazy True Story of Making Sesame Street in Russia"" was one of these people. ""This was an exciting time. There was so much hope,"" Rogoff told ABC News Live anchor Linsey Davis. Rogoff said she was approached by the executives of ""Sesame Street"" about making an international co-production of the show in Russia. It was a remarkable and ambitious project, she said, adding that ""the idea was that the Muppets would be the best ambassadors to bring idealistic values to post-communist Russia."" ""Sesame Street,"" which launched in the U.S. in 1969, has had international spin-offs from the start, with early co-productions in Brazil, Mexico, Canada and Germany. There are currently more than 30 international co-productions of the show, and “each show in every different country reflects the culture and values of that society,” according to Rogoff. Russia, which had been part of the Soviet Union and ruled under the political ideology of Communism for nearly seven decades, began to loosen the state's control over all aspects of society in 1991. ""I thought that Sesame Street could really help in terms of modeling different values and skills that children would need to thrive in a new, open society,"" said Rogoff. The Russian co-production of ""Sesame Street,"" translated as ""Ulitsa Sezam,"" first aired in 1996. The characters of ""Sesame Street"" were adapted to a Russian audience so Big Bird, for example, was modeled after the character of Domovoy in Russian folklore. But certain ideas and themes did not always translate. Rogoff recounted the story of how she suggested a storyline for the show that featured a lemonade stand, which she suggested could teach children counting and team-building skills. It was met with ""complete horror,"" she said, with Russian educators, who were consultants for the show, telling the team it would be ""shameful to show children selling things on the street."" ""Under communism,"" she explained, ""the people who would be illegally selling items on the street for profit under communism would be criminals and the mafia."" Moments like this illustrate how sensitive the situation was at times. ""It was a very intense period,"" Rogoff said, ""not only in Russia, but for us, for our team, trying to be sensitive to help, you know, as much as we could create a show that reflected their society, but also would promote values which would help them move a transition towards an open society.” ""Ulitsa Sezam” last aired in Russia and other nations of the former Soviet bloc in 2010, reportedly because it lost the support of the Putin regime. Rogoff said the war in Ukraine has an additional layer of meaning for her because she experienced the modern-day nation of Russia in its infancy, witnessing the culture shift from the 1980s to the 1990s. ""I watched the Soviet Union collapse,"" she said. ""That changed in my lifetime."" Rogoff suggested that her work on the ""Ulitsa Sezam"" had, and continues to have, an impact on Russian society. ""The 20-year-olds, late twenties, and the 30-year-olds who are now marching out of Russia because they don't want to fight,"" said Rogoff, ""that is the Sesame Street generation."" ""And on the Ukrainian side, same thing,"" she added. ""That's the 20-year-olds, the same age cohort that are defending their freedom and independence that they got and built during the period of creating 'Ulitsa Sezam.' Those adults now also grew up on the show.""",1
2022-11-05,https://abcnews.go.com/US/explainer-law-enforcement-responding-election-threats-country/story?id=92686448,Explainer: How law enforcement is responding to election threats around the country,"Election security is on the minds of many Americans in the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections. The aftermath of the 2020 elections coupled with an increased threat of foreign interference through election tampering, fraud, and intimidation have forced the federal government to create an election security umbrella that never existed before. That umbrella is, in large measure, coordinated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with support from the Department of Homeland Security's Critical Security and Infrastructure Agency as well as the National Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. military Cyber Command. For the FBI, the threats can be in person, in writing, via phone, or made online. They can include: - Voter suppression, where bad actors spread disinformation about voting using various methods such as social media platforms, texting, or peer-to-peer messaging applications on smartphones. They may provide misleading information about the time, manner, or place of voting. This can include inaccurate election dates or false claims about voting qualifications or methods, such as false information suggesting that one may vote by text, which is not allowed in any U.S. jurisdiction. - Threats against election workers, which includes any threat to an election worker or volunteer that causes fear, danger or intimidation. - Voter fraud, by giving false information when registering to vote (such as false citizenship claims), by voting when ineligible to vote, and by voting more than once or using someone else's name to vote. - Election fraud, which includes changing a ballot tally or engaging in other corrupt behavior as an elections official; providing a voter with money or something of value in exchange for voting for a specific candidate or party in a federal election; threatening a voter with physical or financial harm if they don't vote or don't vote a certain way; and trying to prevent qualified voters from voting by lying about the time, date, or place of an election, i.e., voter suppression. - Campaign fraud, which includes excessive campaign contributions above the legal limit, conduit contributions or straw donor schemes, contributions from prohibited sources, cording between Super PACs and independent expenditure organizations and a candidate's campaign, and using campaign funds for personal or unauthorized use. The threats can emanate from domestic and foreign sources, including state and non-state actors and radical U.S.-based groups. In every case, these attempts are meant to sway voters and the election process in one direction or another. In August of 2020, then-Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina warned that China, Russia and Iran were attempting to sway American voters and influence the election. The same holds true today as these same state actors, once again, are trying to usurp the U.S. election process. To combat this, in addition to its broad partnerships, the FBI has created a robust and expansive election intelligence effort aimed at identifying and mitigating any threat to the election process. This includes the creation of the Foreign Influence Task Forces, which brought the FBI's national security and traditional criminal investigative expertise under one umbrella to prevent foreign influence in our elections. Additionally, as has been done in the past, on Election Day the FBI will spin up command posts across the nation that will monitor and respond to investigative tips as well as real time election issues. These command posts are staffed by investigators and analysts from the FBI and its partners, including local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, that coordinate and work together to thwart any evidence of election tampering, fraud or abuse. Since all alleged Election Day offenses get referred to the FBI for investigation and potential prosecution by the Department of Justice, the Justice Department will run a nationwide Election Day Program, where an assistant U.S. attorney is appointed by the United States attorney in that district as the election coordinator. All of this is in an effort to ensure that the election is safe and that any nefarious actors are identified and stopped, in order to protect the voting process. Donald J.

2022-11-06,https://abcnews.go.com/International/foreign-fighters-ukraine-speak-willingness-serve/story?id=91671528,Foreign fighters in Ukraine speak out on their willingness to serve: 'I had to go',"When Andy Huynh watched the news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, he started losing sleep. All he could think about was the struggle of the Ukrainian people against an aggressor he felt was violating their sovereignty and opening the world up to a third World War. ""All my personal problems didn't feel important anymore … It felt wrong just to sit back and do nothing,"" he said. ""I had to go."" The Alabama man was not alone. Two days after the invasion, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for ""friends of Ukraine, freedom and democracy"" to serve as volunteers in the Ukrainian military. More than 20,000 volunteers from 52 countries responded, many of whom had served in the U.S. Army, British Army, and, like Huynh, the U.S. Marine Corps, according to Ukrainian officials. Their experience is credited by Zelenskyy for bolstering the war effort for Ukraine, especially since NATO countries have rejected sending ground troops in fears of starting their own conflict with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in March that 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East would be joining his country's fight. Tanya Mehra, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for Counterterrorism at The Hague, said the mobilization of foreign fighters on battlefields dates to 1816 and they have played prominent roles in conflicts in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya and Somalia since the 1980s. The evolution of foreign-born fighters has created distinct classes of fighters, from mercenaries who join conflicts primarily for financial gain, Mehra said, and others who are driven by ideological reasons. Mercenaries, she said, who are outsourced contractors for small governments, tend to be associated to ""increases in violence and higher civilian casualties,"" which can prolong the conflict, whereas foreign fighters become part of the state military, which makes them ""accountable for the acts they have committed."" Many of those foreign fighters serving in Ukraine tend to be older than your average soldier, and in a stage in their lives where they felt they could help through their years of experience. John Harding, 59, joined the Ukrainian military in 2018, when the country was fighting Russian-backed separatists. As a professional combat medic who served in Syria, the British-born Harding put his experience to use on the battlefield. But he also found he was in demand as a trainer for other medics who had no idea how to apply first aid in a hostile combat environment ""Medics are notorious for getting themselves killed,"" Harding said. ""You may know how to apply a torniquet, but you also need to know how to apply a tourniquet while watching out for snipers."" One American, who did not want to use his name because he is still fighting in Ukraine, said he joined the Ukrainian military in April because he felt ""it is important for the world to stand up with the Ukrainians and resist aggression."" Having grown up in a military family and a U.S. Air Force veteran himself, the man took leave of his job in IT while living in central Europe to join the fight. Today, he uses his background in engineering systems, cybersecurity and computer networks to operate drones in anti-tank and stinger missions. He said his squad was responsible for taking down a Mil Mi-28 Russian helicopter on July 18. The man said his homemade bombs and grenades are constructed using Coke cans and some of the 60 kilograms of TNT captured during an offensive in September. They take flight via off-the-shelf commercial drones. The man said that the number of foreign fighters he encounters, the majority of whom were from the U.S., has decreased since the spring. The intensity of the fighting weeded away what he called the ""TikTok warriors"" who were not prepared for the danger, or length, of the missions. He remains fighting after seven months because of ideological reasons, but also because of the survivor's guilt he felt when two men from his squad -- Huynh and Alex Drueke, also from Alabama -- were captured on June 9 following a firefight. ""I felt I lost my two brothers. They followed me to this unit. I felt very guilty,"" he said. ""Part of the reason I stayed this long is because of them."" Huynh and Drueke, a U.S. Army veteran, spent 105 days in captivity, including a month in a Russian ""black site,"" where they endured daily torture. In late September they were released, along with eight other foreign-born volunteer fighters from England and Canada and more than 200 Ukrainian soldiers. Harding was among those men released. He met Huynh and Drueke in a prison cell after having been captured in May when a Ukrainian unit he was with in Mariupol was forced to surrender. The torture he suffered has led to a diagnosis of permanent neurological damage to his hands, along with broken ribs and damage to his sternum. One aftereffect is ""more psychological"": ""I have mood swings which I don't have control of,"" he said. He now lives close to family in Luton, a town in the southeast of England. The results of ongoing medical treatment will determine his ability to work. ""Would I do it again? Knowing what I know, probably not. Would I do it again if I didn't know? Yes, I would,"" he said. ""The only thing I would have done different is I wouldn't have surrendered. I would have fought to the very last round."" Like Harding, Drueke and Hyunh also say they have no regrets. Back home in Alabama, they are adjusting to their former lives. Hyunh is engaged and will marry soon, while Drueke is contemplating his next career move. They have bonded, not just with one another, but with Harding and the other men in their unit who are either still in Ukraine or returned home. One day they hope to reunite, either in the U.S. or in England -- or even Ukraine itself to help rebuild. ""Honestly, Ukraine has really surprised the world. We did not expect them to be that feisty, that strong, that determined,"" said Drueke. ""They are amazing people.""",27
2022-11-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/stake-joe-biden-midterm-elections/story?id=91867635,What's at stake for Joe Biden in the midterm elections,"President Joe Biden may not be on the ballot this election cycle but his agenda hangs in the balance as Democrats defend their majorities in Congress. Biden, making his final pitches to voters ahead of next Tuesday's races, is casting the midterms as a critical moment for the nation. ""I know there is a lot at stake in these midterm elections, from our economy, to the safety of our streets, to our personal freedoms, to the future of healthcare and Social Security and Medicare,"" Biden said this past week. ""It's all important."" Republicans are favored to win back control of the House, according to FiveThirtyEight's midterm forecast. As for Senate control, the forecast shows a dead heat between Democrats and Republicans. A Republican majority in either chamber would doom Democratic priorities like climate change, voting rights and abortion access. And the remaining pieces of Biden's signature ""Build Back Better"" framework would likely meet a similar fate. ""I think there were certainly pieces that got left on the table, like the child tax credit and the universal pre-K, that would be very hard to do in a divided Congress,"" Jim Kessler, the executive director at the center-left think tank Third Way, told ABC News. Though Kessler had some optimism that bipartisan legislation could still get through a divided Congress, noting that many of Biden's major legislative achievements have gotten some Republican support: the CHIPS Act, the gun safety package and the infrastructure law. ""Biden is uniquely qualified to pass bipartisan legislation if that's necessary,"" he said. ""He's done it before."" But other political strategists said a Republican majority could make governing difficult for Biden. ""The biggest challenge that both the president and the Democrats in Congress are going to face is going to be the extreme, dangerous Republican caucus,"" Craig Varoga, a Democratic strategist, told ABC News. Republicans have expressed little interest in working with Democrats if they gain control on Capitol Hill. GOP lawmakers are eying rollbacks of Biden's corporate tax increases, and Rep. Kevin McCarthy's vowed to repeal the $80 billion set aside for the Internal Revenue Service in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Republicans misleadingly claim will lead to more agents going after middle-class Americans. Also on the chopping block, McCarthy's said, is the steady stream of financial assistance to Ukraine as the nation staves off Russia's invasion. And if Republicans take over the Senate, they could block Biden's judicial nominees, who need a majority vote to be confirmed. Still, no legislation will get past the finish line without Biden's signature -- setting up potential showdowns between him and a Republican Congress. Several House Republicans have already pledged to launch several investigations targeting the administration if they're the majority, including probes into Hunter Biden, the president's son. Hunter Biden, who also faces a federal probe over his tax affairs, has been scrutinized by the GOP for his international business dealings. Other potential investigations would likely target COVID-19 policies, the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and the handling of the southern border. Some GOP lawmakers have already proposed impeaching Biden as well as Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland. ""I’m already being told, if they win back the House and Senate, they’re going to impeach me,"" Biden told supporters last Thursday.""I don’t know what the hell they’ll impeach me for."" Some Democratic candidates, especially those in tough races, have distanced themselves from the administration this cycle on hot-button issues like immigration or the economy. Others, such as Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio and Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, have openly suggested he shouldn't run for another term. Biden himself has said he intends to run, but hasn't made any concrete announcements. At 79, and turning 80 later this month, he's currently the oldest person to serve as commander in chief in the nation's history. One ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in late September found that 56% of Democrats and independents that tend to vote for Democrats said they wanted ""someone other than Biden"" to run in the next presidential election. If Democrats lose badly this cycle, it could potentially increase calls for Democrats to look elsewhere for a 2024 nominee. ""The stakes are obviously high but midterm elections that are bad for presidents are the norm, not the exception,"" Kessler said, noting several presidents -- most recently former President Bill Clinton and former President Barack Obama -- were able to win reelection after Democrats were trounced in the midterms. Since the Civil War, the party in the White House has gained seats in the House just three times in 40 tries. In the Senate, since the direct election of senators began in 1914, they've gained or retained their seats just seven times. If Democrats manage to hold onto their majorities in Congress, Kessler said it would be affirmation that ""running a mainstream Democratic agenda through Congress works.""",21
2022-11-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/expect-republicans-control-senate-midterms/story?id=91864098,What to expect if Republicans take control of the Senate,"With FiveThirtyEight forecasting a slight edge for a GOP takeover in the Senate -- and with momentum solidly behind Republicans -- what would that mean? In short, big changes and a Biden presidency instantly having to play defense. Senate Republicans, unlike their House counterparts, have not put out a 'contract' or plan for what they would do if they take over, but in speeches and interviews and looking at who is poised to take the gavels at powerful Senate committees, some priorities seem clear. For starters, inflation. Laying the blame for historically high inflation at the feet of President Joe Biden and his unified Democratic government, Republicans have repeatedly called for an end to the ""spending spree"" in Washington. It's worth noting that some of that increased spending was related to trying to bring the U.S. economy back from a historic pandemic, action that began under former President Donald Trump. Still, Republicans have charged that Democrats went entirely too far with the American Rescue Plan that pumped nearly $2 trillion into the economy, fueling inflation already aggravated by the roiling supply chain crisis. The situation was made worse with Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. Republicans have pointed to a handful of solutions, such as making some of the business tax cuts from their 2017 package -- set to expire in the next few years -- permanent, as well as, mounting an effort to roll back the new corporate minimum tax against larger corporations enacted in the recently-passed climate, health and tax bill by Democrats. The boogeyman in many GOP ads the latter part of this midterm cycle has been the Democrats' plan to beef up the IRS to go after tax cheats. It was a key way they planned to raise revenue to pay for their climate and health bill, but Republicans seized on it to falsely warn Americans that an ""army of IRS agents"" were coming for them. The IRS commissioner, Charles Rettig, a Trump appointee, has tried to reassure lawmakers that the new resources would not be focused on middle income Americans, but the claims continued and oversight hearings are a sure bet. Republicans might even try to find a way to roll back that effort. Whether or not any of this could have any effect on inflation remains to be seen. Usually tax cuts -- in other words, less revenue for the federal government -- are not seen as inflation-reducing. And while spending cuts are, the level of draconian cuts needed to make a dent are not likely to be approved by a majority of the new majority. With gas prices soaring, Republicans laid into Democrats for clamping down on domestic energy production, and with Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso expected to resume the chairmanship of the Energy Committee, the focus almost surely will be squarely placed on that issue. In that same vein, and with GOP anger at Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. for that deal he made with Democrats passing the Inflation Reduction Act having subsided, it is entirely possible that energy permitting reform will be back on the table but in a bipartisan way this time. That is actually something that might get done in the lame duck session. While Senate Republicans might not ramp up the number of investigations expected by their GOP counterparts in the House, the upper chamber's new majority is expected to spin up quite a few of their own. For starters, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who can be is expected to retake the gavel at the Judiciary Committee for a year, has already been looking into the affairs of the president's first son and conservative lightning rod, Hunter Biden. His partner in the years-long effort, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson -- who has been locked in a fierce contest to keep his seat -- can be is expected to helm the powerful investigative subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee known as the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI). It has a large budget for investigative staff, as well as subpoena power It's unclear if the GOP duo can outrun the Justice Department on this one, though. Federal investigators have made clear they feel they have enough to charge the Hunter Biden with financial crimes, sources told ABC News in early October, and a federal probe has been underway for quite some time. Top of Grassley's to-do list is also how to tackle the nation's rising violent crime, a centerpiece of GOP campaigns this midterm season, and what to do about what conservatives see as a politicized Justice Department. ""All of the things that Republicans have been talking about that aren't really getting a huge amount of attention in the Judiciary Committee will be a focus, particularly violent crime,"" a GOP committee aide told ABC News. While it might seem as if the COVID-19 pandemic has lost its grip on the nation, conservative Sen. Rand Paul has some old scores to settle. Paul, on track to win a third term this year, has promised to investigate the origins of the pandemic, a pet issue for the irascible conservative. ""When we take over in November, I will be chairman of a committee and I will have subpoena power,"" the Kentucky Republican, told those gathered at a campaign event in Smithfield in May, according to an account from the Associated Press. ""And we will get to the bottom of where this virus came from."" Running contrary to two previous scientific reports this summer on the origins of the virus pointing to a zoological connection from the Huanan Seafood Market, a recent report by GOP staff on the Senate panel Paul is set to chair, came to a different conclusion. The 35-page interim report concluded that the origin ""was most likely the result of a research-related incident,"" though the document specifically states, ""This conclusion is not intended to be dispositive."" The report does not mention anything about motive, as some conservatives have sought to espouse, claiming China may have weaponized a virus, nor does it mention any involvement of the frequent target of Paul's ire, the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. From practically the outset of the pandemic, Paul questioned the power of the virus and government mandates to try to contain it, repeatedly clashing in hearings with Fauci. All of it fed a ""fire Fauci"" movement in conservative circles. Fauci, who said he plans to retire at the end of Biden's first term, has said he and his family have been the victim of threats. Paul and his conservative counterparts in the House have all indicated Fauci's retirement will not stop their push to have him testify and deliver documents related to their probes. Firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz is champing at the bit to take over at the Senate Commerce Committee. The Texas conservative, known to have 2024 presidential ambitions, is sure to capture the spotlight as he takes on social media platforms, a frequent target of his displeasure claiming widespread anti-conservative bias. On his podcast, ""The Verdict,"" earlier this year, during the frenzied confusion amid billionaire Elon Musk's attempted takeover of Twitter, Cruz said, ""I think it is one of the most important moments for free speech in decades. This is a testing moment where Big Tech keeps getting more and more brazen, saying we can control everything you say; we can control everything you hear; we can control everything in your feed; we can control everything you listen to … suddenly Elon Musk came in and is threatening to tip over the apple cart."" Of course, there is wide-ranging jurisdiction at this panel covering Commerce, Science, and Transportation issues. There are some GOP aides speculating that Cruz will cast a wide net. ""'Science' could cover practically anything,"" one GOP leadership aide said cryptically. Whereas House Republicans appear poised to make it more difficult to pass future foreign aid for Ukraine, their Senate counterparts are not expected to follow suit -- at least not the vast majority. In a recent statement, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell -- a full-throated supporter of Ukraine -- said, ""The Biden Administration and our allies need to do more to supply the tools Ukraine needs to thwart Russian aggression,"" even urging that the aid be ""expedited."" Taking over at the Armed Services Committee, barring something unforeseen, will be Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, a McConnell ally. Wicker, who has worn a Ukrainian flag pin on his lapel since Russia invaded, has fought for military equipment and ammunition to be sent, including MiG fighters and HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems). In an interview with Gray Television earlier this month, the senator sounded a tone of bipartisanship on Ukraine funding. ""It's a clear distinction between good and evil, between a war criminal who has no respect for the rights of people to people that are fighting for their own homeland,"" said Wicker. Republicans have been hammering the administration and Democrats for what they say has been a dereliction of duty at the southern border. Many want a return to the hard-line policies under President Donald Trump. At the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction over border issues, the expected chairman, Sen. James Lankford, has pushed repeatedly for hearings. In an April letter, Lankford and his fellow GOP committee members, wrote to the then-chairman Gary Peters, D-Mich., ""The Biden Administration's policies are directly contributing to the historic levels of illegal immigration. Administration officials must explain to the American people the rationale for their decisions, and what their plans are to deal with the consequences of their actions."" The group demanded to have Attorney General Merrick Garland, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus, and Rochelle Walensky, CDC Director, among others. That could prove a template for early hearings. President Biden has seen a record 84 federal judges confirmed to the bench, according to the American Constitution Society, including one historic nominee to the Supreme Court. But once Republicans take over the Judiciary Committee, that pace is sure to slow, the scrutiny to mount. Depending on how many nominees the panel's current chairman, Dick Durbin of Illinois, can get cleared and on to full floor confirmation in the lame duck session, scores will still be pending. There are expected to be 57 nominees pending, according to the ACS, a number that has vexed some progressive groups like Demand Justice. But the issue that already has Democrats and their outside allies up in arms is the prospect of a Supreme Court vacancy in the next year of Biden's presidency, a full year before presidential election season kicks off. McConnell, who is expected to keep his position in the new Congress, has suddenly gone mum on whether or not he would stick with the normal practice in the Senate of considering Supreme Court nominees for the president of any party. Vilified by Democrats for refusing to even consider President Barack Obama's replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, claiming it occurred in a presidential election year with Republicans in charge and voters should decide, McConnell has left everyone wondering if he might enact yet another new policy. Asked by Fox News recently if he would allow consideration of a Supreme Court nomination if a vacancy occurred on his watch as majority leader next year, McConnell demurred. ""I'm not gonna announce what our agenda might be on appointments before we even become the majority. I hope we're in a position to make a decision,"" said McConnell. It would have been easy to say yes. It is quite notable that he did not. Speaking of McConnell, retaining his position as GOP leader would put him at the 15-year mark for his service as a Senate leader, both in the majority and minority. Next year, he will match the record set by the late Sen. Mike Mansfield, D-Mont. It's widely believed the Kentucky Republican is focused on beating that record, making history, after which he might consider stepping aside, though he has made clear he intends to complete his full term as a senator which ends in 2027. But it won't all be smooth sledding for McConnell. Former President Donald Trump, who could announce a run for re-election soon after the midterms, has chosen to continue his attacks on the Republican leader, recently calling for his impeachment in a radio interview. There is no mechanism for impeaching a senator and McConnell enjoys wide support in his conference, but it was a clear sign that the anger at the senator - unleashed in force after the GOP leader lambasted the former president for ""practically and morally"" sparking the January 6 insurrection - is sure to continue, particularly with Trump more in the spotlight. McConnell has largely chosen to ignore the attacks, though, as is his style, making light of one Trump nickname - ""Old Crow"" - telling reporters with a grin, ""It's my favorite bourbon.""",16
2022-11-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/expect-republicans-house-midterms-investigations-impeachment/story?id=92799444,"What to expect if Republicans take the House in the midterms: Investigations, possible impeachments","Republicans are laying the groundwork for dozens of investigations into the Biden administration -- and the president's family -- should they retake the House in Tuesday's midterm elections. Already, GOP lawmakers have floated January hearings on Hunter Biden's business dealings as well as a major congressional probe of the withdrawal from Afghanistan and a new committee to investigate China's political and economic influence on the United States. ""There is a burning desire by Republicans to provide some type of oversight to the Biden administration,"" Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., his party's ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, told ABC News. ""We're going to be under a lot of pressure to perform, but I think we will be up to the task."" That pressure could include calls from rank-and-file GOP lawmakers and conservative activists to impeach President Joe Biden and some Cabinet secretaries, rebut the findings of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection and revisit former President Donald Trump's false claims about the results of the 2020 election -- all ahead of another consequential presidential election season. ""Republicans have not made a secret of what they intend to do,"" Kurt Bardella, a former GOP operative-turned-Democratic strategist, told ABC News. ""They see congressional oversight as the tip of the spear for the 2024 presidential election."" Here's a look at some of Republicans' potential moves and lines of investigation should they retake the House this week. Beginning when President Biden announced his third bid for the White House in 2019, Republicans have spent years raising questions about his son Hunter Biden's business dealings and accused the younger Biden of trading off his father's positions in the Senate and Obama White House for personal financial gain. Hunter Biden has long insisted he did nothing wrong, ethically or criminally, but has acknowledged his family ties likely did boost his own career. Comer, the ranking Republican on oversight, and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is poised to lead the House Judiciary Committee, are planning to dig deeper into Hunter Biden in the majority by pursuing sensitive banking records and investigating the Justice Department's handling of investigations of Hunter Biden over potential tax and gun crimes. Federal investigators have examined whether Hunter Biden paid adequate taxes on millions of dollars of personal income, including money he made during business pursuits in China and Ukraine. The Justice Department has also reviewed whether he lied on a gun-buying application about his drug use, ABC News previously reported. He has not been charged with any crimes. Comer told ABC News that in a GOP majority -- which would bestow subpoena power -- the oversight committee may hold its first hearing next year on Hunter Biden and the Biden family's finances, which Senate Republicans have already spent years investigating. ""I think you're gonna see some action on holding a hearing about the Biden family,"" Comer said. When asked if that would be the first GOP-led oversight hearing, he simply replied, ""Potentially."" He told ABC News that the Treasury Department has refused to turn over to his committee financial reports related to the Biden family without Democrats joining the request. ""That's bull crap,"" he said. ""We won't be in the minority in January. So the Treasury Department is gonna have to give me those one way or the other. If they don't give them to us, we're gonna get them from the bank."" Republicans who have criticized the Biden administration's response to COVID-19 and federal guidance around masking, vaccine mandates and school closures could be in a position to revisit the decision-making inside key federal health agencies and the White House. They have vowed to subpoena Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top medical adviser for Biden and Trump and the outgoing director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, for testimony before Congress despite his imminent retirement at the end of the year. Fauci recently told ABC Chief Washington Correspondent Jon Karl that he would have no problem appearing before Republican-led committees after spending 38 years speaking to lawmakers on Capitol Hill as a senior public health official. Republicans have also been critical of federal spending on the pandemic response and the $1.9 trillion in a COVID-19 relief and stimulus spending package signed into law by Biden last year -- a Democratic package that continued the federal response to the pandemic that began during the Trump administration. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who is expected to become speaker if his party retakes the chamber, said in a recent Fox News interview that a GOP majority would investigate the origins of the virus. Senate Republicans recently released a report claiming the pandemic may have originated with a leak in a large viral laboratory in China -- a claim that has been debated within the scientific community for years. In that same Fox News interview, McCarthy also said a GOP-led House would establish a select committee solely focused on China, to address concerns about Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property and how to best reinforce domestic supply chains and the economy's reliance on trade with China. Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., who has helped coordinate House Republicans' policy on China, told ABC News that a GOP majority would ""continue to work to bring those [supply] chains home"" and push to scrutinize both foreign investments in critical U.S. companies and American investments in key industries abroad. McCarthy said in September, while touting Republicans' campaign-season ""Commitment to America"" agenda, that the first piece of legislation they will put on the House floor if they are in the majority will be to block new funding for 87,000 agents at the IRS. The agency has said those funds are to replace retiring agents, increase staff for customer service and technology support and enhance the enforcement on high-income earners rather than for those making less than $400,000 a year. McCarthy has for months been suggesting his party would remove some leading Democrats from their committee positions in response to what he argued was a ""new standard"" set when Democrats stripped committee assignments from two controversial GOP lawmakers, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona. (Gosar had posted an animated video depicting violence against Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez while Greene has a long history of inflammatory and conspiratorial statements, some of which she has apologized for.) ""What they have started cannot be easily undone. Their actions today, and the past, have forever changed the way the House operates,"" McCarthy said last year ahead of a vote against Gosar. He later told CNN, ""The Democrats have created a new thing where they're picking and choosing who could be on committee,"" and he has identified Ilhan Omar, Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell as Democrats who would lose their committee spots. McCarthy has said that Greene will be reinstated to committees after being removed last year -- in a bipartisan vote by Democrats and 11 Republicans -- for incendiary remarks she made before her election to Congress. Greene made an apologetic floor speech at the time attempting to disavow some prior comments. And though McCarthy has indicated Greene will be placed back on committees, he has demurred when pressed if the firebrand congresswoman would get a seat on the oversight panel, something for which she has pushed. Republicans could also wield a House majority to probe the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year -- a military exit, ending a decades-long war, that was marred by a deadly suicide attack on Americans and allies, the stranding of numerous Afghans who had supported the U.S. and a Taliban takeover in the capital of Kabul. Already, Republicans led by McCarthy and Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, have forecasted investigations of the retreat's aftermath, including billions of dollars' worth of U.S. equipment falling into Taliban hands, the resulting rule of the hardline group, emerging violent threats and people left behind by the frantic evacuations. ""These strategic failures are too grave to ignore. That is why House Republicans are committed to pursuing answers to Biden's disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal,"" McCarthy, McCaul and other Republicans wrote in an op-ed in August before the release of a GOP report on the withdrawal. The resulting 115-page report included a number of recommendations, but Republicans hinted at more oversight to come, echoing warnings from others that inquiries into the retreat would not cease until there were repercussions within the administration. Republicans in the Senate have pushed for blockades on certain nominees from the Biden White House over what they said was a lack of transparency over the withdrawal's execution. ""President Biden's own officials have described the end of the U.S. presence in Afghanistan as a 'strategic failure' and 'an ugly final phase.' Yet, to date, no senior administration officials have been held accountable,"" read the House GOP report, spearheaded by McCaul. ""The Committee Minority believes a much more thorough examination is needed to find complete answers as to how this happened and how to ensure something like this does not happen again."" Biden and his aides have defended the choice to leave Afghanistan, saying the war's costs, in lives and dollars, outweighed the strategic value. Republicans have consistently railed against what they see as the ""politicization"" of the Department of Justice under Biden, with McCarthy himself boasting that investigations would be incoming under a Republican House. The floodgates of Republican claims of DOJ wrongdoing burst open in August when Attorney General Merrick Garland signed off on the FBI's execution of a search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort over allegations he improperly stored government documents there after leaving the White House. (Trump contends he is being politically persecuted.) ""I've seen enough,"" McCarthy said in a statement. ""The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization. When Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned. Attorney General Garland, preserve your documents and clear your calendar."" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a member of the GOP's far-right flank, also drafted articles of impeachment for Garland over the search, arguing he did not ""preserve, protect and defend"" the U.S. Constitution. And while it's unlikely that an impeachment effort would go far, Greene has an outsized megaphone for a House backbencher and could keep the pressure on McCarthy to exercise stringent oversight of the DOJ if she chooses. The Justice Department's investigation into Trump's handling of documents, both classified and unclassified, continues. Garland has defended his department's law enforcement actions, arguing that ""faithful adherence to the rule of law is the bedrock principle of the Justice Department and of our democracy. Upholding the rule of law means applying the law evenly, without fear or favor."" Republicans are also furious over a Justice Department memo last year warning of a ""disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation's public schools,"" which Republicans alleged was a precursor to clamping down on conservative activists. Jordan, the likely chair of the House Judiciary Committee if Republicans retake the chamber, asked the DOJ to preserve its documents surrounding the memo. Republicans in the House are eyeing impeachment efforts for Biden as well as several of his top administration officials -- a potentially historic escalation of the conflict between the legislative and executive branches, which the GOP casts as a necessary correction to congressional Democrats who impeached Trump. Greene and some of her hardline allies have said they intend to impeach Biden for a range of supposed wrongdoings, an effort that has become a punchline in Democratic stump speeches but could be a headache for both Biden and McCarthy in the next Congress. Other targets for impeachment include Garland and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. While Republican fury with Garland has focused over alleged politicization of his department, the GOP has lambasted Mayorkas over what they say are overly lax border policies leading to a surge in unauthorized migration at the southern border. ""Mayorkas deserves [impeachment] for sure, because we no longer have a border,"" Jordan told CNN last month, while Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Greene ally, said impeaching Mayorkas should be a ""priority."" Republicans are unlikely to succeed in impeaching all of their top administration foes, but McCarthy could try to funnel frustration into impeachment proceedings against a Cabinet secretary as a way to relieve some pressure from his conference and avoid impeaching Biden over a slew of amorphous allegations. ""I think the country doesn't like impeachment used for political purposes at all,"" McCarthy told Punchbowl News in an interview published Oct. 19. ""If anyone ever rises to that occasion, you have to, but I think the country wants to heal and … start to see the system that actually works."" Republicans have wielded immigration and unauthorized border crossings as potent attack lines against Democrats in recent election cycles, and there's no reason to suspect the rally cry will stop at a House GOP majority. Biden has already been caught between competing political forces over Title 42, a pandemic-era health order that allowed officials to turn away migrants at the border, though border encounters surged above 2 million in fiscal year 2022. And as border crossings increase, Republicans are anticipated to keep hammering the White House even beyond going after Mayorkas, setting up what is anticipated to be a legislative fight. Immigration reform has been a white whale for both parties in recent years, with Democrats pushing for increased protections to so-called Dreamers and Republicans clamoring for more border security measures like increased agents. The two parties have not been able to come up with a compromise with enough support to pass Congress, but Republicans have indicated another try is ahead. ""The first thing you'll see is a bill to control the border first,"" McCarthy told CNN Monday. ""You've got to get control over the border. You've had almost 2 million people just this year alone coming across."" Editor's note: This article has been corrected to note Rep. Michael McCaul's correct position as ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ABC News' Trish Turner contributed to this report.",16
2022-11-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-heads-post-midterms-trip-egypt-cambodia-indonesia/story?id=92993835,"Biden to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping as he heads on post-midterms trip to Egypt, Cambodia, Indonesia","President Joe Biden is set to meet with China's President Xi Jinping on Monday while the two are in Bali, Indonesia, for the annual summit of leaders from the ""Group of 20"" industrialized nations. This will be the first time the two have had a face-to-face meeting since Biden took office. ""The Leaders will discuss efforts to maintain and deepen lines of communication between the United States and the PRC, responsibly manage competition, and work together where our interests align, especially on transnational challenges that affect the international community. The two Leaders will also discuss a range of regional and global issues,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Thursday. Biden is set to depart Thursday for a three-country tour to Egypt, Cambodia and Indonesia as he pivots to foreign policy following his party's surprising electoral successes. The president plans to make a quick stop in Egypt for the annual United Nations global climate summit, followed by a longer visit to Cambodia for a pair of conferences with southeast Asian nations. He's then scheduled to fly to Indonesia, for the G-20 summit, where he will meet with President Xi Jinping. Here's a look at what to watch for as Biden heads abroad. Biden often speaks of his long relationship with Xi, whom he has spoken to five times as president -- but never in person. Both leaders have emphasized the importance of managing their countries' strategic relationship -- amid China's global rise. The Biden administration recently labeled China ""the only competitor with both the intent and, increasingly, the capability to reshape the international order."" For its part, China has called on the U.S. to stop trying to contain its rise. It has also taken issue with American tariffs on Chinese imports and on U.S. lawmakers' support for the self-governing island of Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of China. ""One of the things we think is really important is that we find a way to build a floor for the relationships, and that for us means, No. 1, making sure that there are rules of the road, that there are ways that we bound the completion,"" a senior administration official told reporters Thursday. ""The way we've heard this from our Chinese friends is 'stopping the downward spiral.'"" The official also emphasized the need to establish ""ongoing lines of communication"" as one of the ""biggest pieces for what success looks like."" The leaders are also expected to discuss Russia, the war in Ukraine and North Korea. On North Korea, the official said the president will approach his conversation with Xi in a spirit of historical cooperation on the issue of nonproliferation but declined to offer any specifics of what asks the president may make of Xi. China has toed the line with Russia, aligning itself with Moscow but declining to provide military assistance for its invasion. It has not, however, joined widespread sanctions on Russia. ""What I want to do with him, when we talk,"" Biden told reporters Wednesday, ""is lay out what the – what kind – what each of our red lines are, understand what he believes to be in the critical national interest of China, what I know to be the critical interest of the United States, and determine whether or not they conflict with one another. And if they do, how do we resolve it and how to work it out."" Biden said Wednesday he did not expect Putin to attend the G-20; the White House had said previously that Biden did not intend to meet with him even if he did go. The two leaders have not spoken since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February. The Kremlin announced Thursday that Putin will not travel to Bali for the G-20 summit, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will attend in his place. Putin may attend meetings virtually. Biden had last month left the door open a crack for a potential meeting if, he said in an interview, Putin wanted to discuss WNBA star Brittney Griner, an American who has been detained for months in Russia. ""I mean, it would depend,"" Biden said. Tensions between Russia and the West remain extremely high, with unprecedented sanctions on Moscow and Putin becoming a global pariah as he continues to wage war. Ukraine will take center stage, with Europe heading into winter with limited natural gas from Russia and spiking energy costs. The war has put pressure on economies across the world, and Biden will look to maintain a solid front against Putin. Before heading to Asia, Biden will stop in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, to address the United Nations' global climate summit, known as COP27. After playing a prominent role at last year's gathering in Scotland, Biden is heading to Egypt with an historic legislative win in hand: his Inflation Reduction Act, which contained $369 billion in investments in climate and clean energy programs. But the U.N. has said the world is far off track from the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and countries are expected to focus on how to make up that gap. A report released Tuesday from a coalition of local leaders and private businesses found Biden's law, combined with state and local action, could meet the president's goal to reduce U.S. emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030, as long as current policy trends continue. The poorest nations are facing the worst impacts of climate change and many want financial compensation. The United States, though, is not yet on board with new funding. With Biden hitting the road so soon after his party's surprising midterm performance, he'll have to keep an eye on developments back in Washington – and how they could impact U.S. foreign policy. Some Republicans, who may be on the verge of taking control of the House of Representatives, have decried the billions of dollars of military and financial aid that the U.S. has provided Ukraine. Biden said Wednesday he did not think America's bipartisan support for Ukraine would erode. Other world leaders, too, will likely try to understand what impact the vote in America may have on their countries. American officials may face questions from their foreign counterparts, not to mention reporters, trying to make sense of what's next for U.S. foreign policy. A hallmark of Biden's foreign policy has been his re-engagement with the world and traditional U.S. partners after four years of the Trump administration's isolationism. His attendance at U.N. climate conferences, and his attendance at two major regional conferences in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, reflect his endorsement of international institutions and multilateralism for addressing global challenges. The president plans to attend a summit with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, and another with East Asian nations. While no major announcements are expected, his presence will be symbolic following the turbulent years under President Donald Trump. But even with Biden at the helm, many nations will continue to question whether ""America is back"" on the world stage – as Biden proclaimed last year – or if the pendulum has merely swung back toward the rest of the world temporarily.

2022-11-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gops-maga-reckoning-faces-major-speed-bumps-note/story?id=93064784,GOP's MAGA reckoning faces major speed bumps: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein For six years now, most Republican loyalties to Donald Trump have rested on a simple assumption: Trump helps them win. That notion has collapsed under the weight of a third straight anti-MAGA election. But it won't be easy for Republicans to free themselves of Trump's influence -- and they have the man himself and the forces he continues to spin up in part to blame. Even before his party learns whether it will control either house of Congress, the former president is on a tear. He's casting doubt on elections in settled states as well as some where counting is ongoing -- and is bringing far-off fights over 2024 into 2022 with attacks on Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., who won huge on Tuesday even as Trump-aligned Republicans lost. MAGA may yet salvage wins out of Nevada and particularly Arizona, which could host some of the few notable successes for Trump-backed candidates. That could get dangerous, with Republicans across the statewide ticket following Trump's path in attacking election integrity without evidence. On Capitol Hill, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is already making ""transition"" plans for a speakership that may not be his, either because his party doesn't capture the majority or because Trump allies might sink him even if they do. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is making no such plans to take over a majority that looks increasingly likely not to belong to Republicans at all. That can be laid at Trump's feet to some extent -- though, as always with things Trump, it's complicated: Senate Republicans and the party's base welcomed some of the former president's celebrity choices for candidates, including Herschel Walker in Georgia. Now, a runoff looms in that state during a moment primed for 2024 attention. Former Vice President Mike Pence's book arrives in the very week Trump has suggested he may announce another candidacy -- and just days ahead of a major GOP gathering in Las Vegas that will include Pence, DeSantis and virtually every major Republican considering a run other than Trump. Particularly given the way abortion politics impacted the midterms, it's worth remembering that Trump is the source of many but surely not close to all of the obstacles Republicans see to reclaiming power. But how so many of them rode with him to the pinnacle is impacting views of how to make it back. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Young voters can be credited, in part, for helping Democrats stave off the so-called red wave that many anticipated in the midterms. Voters ages 18-29 showed up in typical numbers, accounting for smaller portion of the vote than any other age group, according to exit poll data -- but 63% voted for Democrats versus 35% who voted for Republicans. That's a marked increase from 2016 and 2014. ""With 18-29-year-olds being the only age group that gave their overwhelming support to Democrats, it is clear they were the margin of victory in several key races, securing victories for John Fetterman in Pennsylvania and Governorships in Wisconsin and Michigan,"" Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, president of the voting advocacy group NextGen America, said in a statement to ABC News. President Joe Biden thanked young voters for their turnout during his post-election press conference on Wednesday and referred to their participation as ""historic"" during remarks Thursday. ""Young people voted to continue addressing the climate crisis, gun violence, personal rights and freedoms student debt relief,"" he said. Garnering the support of the youth is one thing. Being able to deliver on the agenda promised will be another especially if, as many expect, Democrats lose control of the House of Representatives. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Despite several high-profile election deniers losing their races on Tuesday, one major Trump-backed candidate still has a shot at winning. Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake is tangled in a tight contest with Democrat Katie Hobbs, who currently serves as Arizona's secretary of state. With tens of hundreds of thousands of votes still left to be counted, Lake would need about 51% of the outstanding vote to win the governor's mansion, according to an ABC News assessment. However, the final tabulation could still take days and stretch into early next week. Although the lengthy process signals that local officials are navigating election administration with painstaking attention to detail, the slow drip of information could also give way to the kind of false rhetoric seen in the days following the 2020 election. Last month, when pressed by ABC News' Jonathan Karl about whether she would accept the certified results of the 2022 election even if she loses, Lake answered with a caveat. ""I will accept the results of this election if we have a fair, honest and transparent election. Absolutely, 100%,"" said the former TV anchor at the time, adding, ""As long as it's fair, honest and transparent."" What the future holds could still remain unclear given that Lake previously told CNN she would ""win the election and accept that result."" THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" podcast.

2022-11-11,https://abcnews.go.com/International/midterm-elections-war-ukraine/story?id=93008710,What the midterm elections could mean for the war in Ukraine,"While Republicans have expressed disappointment in the party's performance in the midterm elections so far, the GOP is poised to retake the House of Representatives, which may spell trouble for Ukraine. Some Republican officials have shared that they will cut back or end funding to the eastern European country as it defends itself against Russia's invasion, which began in February. Here's what some lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have said regarding the United States' support of Ukraine, and what the midterm election results could mean for Ukraine moving forward. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who is expected to become speaker if his party retakes the chamber, said last month that Republicans wouldn't ""write a blank check"" to Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion. McCarthy subsequently said that comment was being over-interpreted as anti-Ukraine: ""Wouldn't you want a check and balance in Congress? Wouldn't you want this hardworking taxpayers' money, someone overseeing it? We've got to eliminate the wasteful spending in Washington."" Others in the caucus have taken a harder line. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who won her reelection bid on Tuesday, said during a Trump rally in Iowa last week that ""under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine. Our country comes first."" ""I suspect it is going to be a slow, gradual shift over the course of the next Congress. Generally, support for Ukraine seems pretty popular right now,"" Scott Anderson, a former U.S. diplomat and a visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, told ABC News last week. ""I don't think Republicans are going to want to run headlong against that."" But Republicans aren't the only ones who have signaled an end to supporting Ukraine financially. Some Democratic politicians have also cast doubt on whether their party would continue to back the Biden administration's approach to Ukraine, particularly around pushing for talks with Russia. In late October, 30 House progressives signed a letter calling for the White House to link aid to Kyiv with movement toward a negotiated end to the conflict. They withdrew it after they were heavily scrutinized, with one lawmaker in the group, Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., saying: ""Let me be clear: We are united as Democrats in our unequivocal commitment to supporting Ukraine in their fight for their democracy and freedom."" Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. has committed more than $18.9 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, according to the Department of Defense. Last week, the Defense Department provided $400 million to the country in security aid, which includes funding for air defense missiles, refurbished tanks, armor packages, and tactical secure communications and surveillance systems. In May, President Joe Biden signed a $40 billion bipartisan military and humanitarian aid package for Ukraine. While the package did get bipartisan support, 11 Republican senators, including Kentucky's Rand Paul, Missouri's Josh Hawley and Tennessee's Marsha Blackburn, voted against the bill. Americans support the U.S. providing economic and military assistance to Ukraine, according to an October poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Around 72% of Americans support military aid to Ukraine, with 58% willing to help the country ""as long as it takes,"" according to the nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. ""Supporting Ukraine is in the U.S. national interest,"" Andres Kasekamp, Ph.D., a professor at the University of Toronto specializing in Eastern Europe, told ABC News. ""This Russian attack is the most egregious breach of the rule-based international order since World War II."" According to Kasekamp, it's likely that Russian President Vladimir Putin's goal is to weaken the U.S. resolve and create polarization within western countries. ABC News' Shannon K.

2022-11-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/media-freedom-safe-ukraine-war-officials/story?id=92590788,"Media freedom safe in Ukraine despite the war, officials say","KYIV, Ukraine -- Freedom of speech in Ukraine has not faded away and has survived the ongoing Russian aggression against the country, Ukrainian officials said. “We live in times when the main news is coming from the frontlines,” Oleksandr Tkachenko, the Ukrainian Minister of Culture and Information Policy, told a crowd at a recent conference on media freedom in Kyiv. Government officials have put some limitations on media freedoms, including restrictions on reporting on the military, but media experts said those limitations shouldn’t be transformed into restrictions on political reporting, according to a group of Ukrainian government, parliament, media and NGO members who gathered for a “National Media Talk” conference. Andriy Kulykov, who chairs the Commission on Journalistic Ethics, said he wanted to dispel some of the lingering doubts about restrictions, pointing out that the Ukrainian society, with two recent revolutions behind its back, is learning and will not let political censorship take over. The media audience in Ukraine still has a variety of information sources to choose from -- unlike on the territories currently occupied by Russia, the experts said. “This is not a limitation on the freedom of speech -- let’s call it forced moderation during the war,” Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defense minister, said. The function of journalism in Ukraine has changed since the beginning of the war, Reznikov added, as journalism today could serve as just another weapon. And Ukraine is struggling with propagandists from the Russian side. He highlighted the role of journalism in uncovering counter-propaganda and fake news, he said. Reznikov also explained the rationale behind information silence or control in Ukraine -- most evident on social media -- saying Russian army reports to the Kremlin facts from the frontline roughly two and a half days after the given event. It is vital to make sure that the Russians will not be provided with valuable information in that time frame, before the Ukrainian army is ready to make its next move, Reznikov said. Despite the maintained levels of information control, Reznikov said he does not “foresee any danger of information dictatorship in Ukraine.” Journalists in Ukraine are fighting “on their battlefield,"" the Ukrainian defense minister told ABC News. But the lines have been further blurred for some journalists who’ve enlisted in the military, according to Lesya Ganzha and Maksym Skubenko, former media representatives currently fighting in the Ukrainian army. Another former journalist who joined the fighting, Artem Kolosov, said, “It is anger that I feel.” Denys Bihus, a former investigative reporter and editor, said, “The simplicity of war means that complicated questions you easily solve by a 120-mm mortar.” Bihus said he believes that currently enlisted journalists will come back from the war more angry and more radicalized, which may change the media landscape in coming years. Yet according to Mykyta Poturayev, a lawmaker leading the charge in adopting a new law on media development, free media after the war will not only be about freedom, but also about responsibility. “All this talk about online anarchy somewhere else in the world is over. These times are gone,"" he said. ""Now, everybody understands the danger of that poison that is poured through the online space and out of Moscow on all democratic and civilized countries.""",27
2022-11-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/brittney-griner-faces-russian-prison-camps/story?id=93080807,What Brittney Griner faces in Russian prison camps,"Brittney Griner, the WNBA star held hostage by Russia, has been transferred to a prison camp somewhere in the country, according to her lawyers. It is still unknown which camp Griner has been moved to but testimonies from prisoners, including other Americans, describe the grim conditions she is likely to face there. Griner had been held in a pre-trial detention center in Moscow since she was detained in February for carrying a small number of vape cartridges containing cannabis oil. The U.S. has accused Russia of using the incident to trump up large-scale drug smuggling charges against Griner in order to seize her as a political bargaining chip. The upholding of her 9-year sentence late last month by a court meant she is now being transferred to a camp somewhere outside the capital. The camps, known as penal colonies, are often former Soviet gulag prison camps and inmates are usually kept in crumbling, crowded barracks, sometimes with 50 to 60 sleeping in rows of bunks. Paul Whelan, the former U.S. Marine held hostage like Griner and imprisoned in a camp for nearly two years, told ABC News in 2020 that conditions there were “Dickensian.” ""It's pretty grim. Quite dilapidated,"" Whelan said then, speaking from prison. ""We kind of live on top of each other."" Prisoners share only a few toilets and are permitted to use a shower only once or twice a week, Whelan said, with no hot water the rest of the time. Whelan is currently being held in Correctional Colony-17, a camp for foreign prisoners in Mordorvia, a region about 300 miles from Moscow known for its large number of prison camps. Trevor Reed, the other ex-U.S. Marine who was released in a prisoner swap earlier this year after 986 days in detention, was kept in a neighboring camp. Griner will also almost certainly be sent to a prison camp for foreign female inmates. Whelan said the barracks are often cold in winter as temperatures fall far below freezing outside and many prisoners are sick. Medical treatment in the camps is minimal, with prisoners routinely reporting being denied requests to see doctors for weeks and often deprived of medication to treat chronic conditions. Inmates are obliged to work in the camps, most often sewing clothes or manufacturing other goods, including sometimes tourist souvenirs. Prisoners work eight hours a-day -- sometimes more -- in conditions recalling sweatshops and receive a few dollars each month for their labor. A normal day, according to Whelan, sees prisoners wake up at 6 a.m. and brought to do 15 minutes of physical exercise on the parade ground before starting their work shifts. Endemic physical torture is well-documented in Russian prisons, but most experts believe that high-profile detainees like Griner will be shielded from it because it would undermine their usefulness as bargaining chips and embarrass authorities. Both Reed and Whelan said they were protected from physical violence but were subjected to solitary confinement and other forms of psychological pressure. Reed told ABC News in May he spent repeated 15-day stints in an isolation cell as punishment for his refusal to work for his captors. Inmates are forbidden from lying down or sometimes even from sitting during daylight hours in those cells, which are usually only a few meters in size and sometimes have holes in the floor for toilets. Whelan has been placed on an escape watch list, meaning that every night for years he has been woken up every two hours with a flashlight shone in his face to register he is still there, according to his family. Other political prisoners have described being sent to solitary confinement for infractions as minor as an unbuttoned uniform. Despite the camp’s conditions, some prisoners have said they are still an improvement on those in pre-trial detention centers, where prisoners are kept in their cells almost 24-hours a day. Guards are not posted in the barracks themselves and, in practice, much of the daily prison life is organized by criminal gangs who oversee order in the barracks, current and former prisoners have told ABC News. Reed and Whelan have both described being treated generally well by their fellow inmates. “Everybody works together as a team, so there is kind of a bit of a brotherhood,” Whelan told ABC in 2020. ""The guards call me 'Tourist,'"" he said. Reed said his frequent clashes with the prison authorities had won him respect among other prisoners. ""I was consistently fighting and resisting the government there,"" he said. ""The prisoners inside of the Russian prison, the criminal element there, they respected that."" By law, prisoners should be permitted to speak to their families regularly by phone but prison authorities frequently restricted Reed and Whelan’s communications for long stretches, withholding letters and phone calls sometimes for weeks, and also preventing them for communicating with the U.S. embassy. Whelan in recent months has been able to speak by phone most weeks with his parents. Maria Alyokhina, a member of the anti-Kremlin art group Pussy Riot, who spent a year and a half in a camp for a 2012 protest in a cathedral, told Reuters this week that Griner’s supporters should write letters to her. ""Do not leave someone alone with this system,"" she said.",2
2022-11-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-xi-meet-time-person-presidents/story?id=93080106,"Biden, Xi to meet for first time in person as presidents","DENPASAR, Indonesia -- President Joe Biden often describes his relationship with China's President Xi Jinping in terms of miles -- the thousands he says they traveled together when they were vice presidents. But despite their personal history, the two have never met in person in their current roles. That will change Monday when they come together for a highly anticipated summit in Indonesia. As they meet on the sidelines of the annual gathering of the Group of 20 leaders, this year held on the island of Bali, each man will have the wind at his back: Biden following Democrats' surprising performance in the midterm elections, and Xi after securing a third term in office with the approval of the country's Communist Party. Biden told reporters Sunday that ""I know I'm coming in stronger, but I don't need that."" He cited his long relationship with Xi and noted, too, that Xi's ""circumstance has changed, to state the obvious, at home."" ""I've always had straightforward discussions with him,"" Biden said during a visit to Phnom Penh, Cambodia. ""There's never any miscalculation about what each of us -- where each of us stand. And I think that's critically important in our relationship."" The U.S. and China have expressed a desire to effectively manage their ties and tensions, and the White House said this meeting will focus on maintaining communication about areas of contention -- and cooperating on areas of mutual interest. ""Having the two presidents actually be able to sit face-to-face, and not face-to-face with a video screen between them, for the first time in President Biden's presidency -- it just takes the conversation to a different level, strategically,"" Biden's top national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Friday. Amid China's military and economic rise, Biden and Xi are expected to discuss how to ""responsibly manage competition, and work together where our interests align, especially on transnational challenges that affect the international community,"" according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. ""What I want to do with him, when we talk,"" Biden told reporters Wednesday, ""is lay out ... what each of our red lines are, understand what he believes to be in the critical national interest of China, what I know to be the critical interest of the United States and determine whether or not they conflict with one another. And if they do, how do we resolve it and how to work it out."" Economic competition is a key component of that. China has taken issue with American tariffs on Chinese goods, while the U.S. accuses Beijing of engaging in unfair trade practices. Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One, while en route to Bali, that the president intends ""to make clear in the meeting [with Xi] that the United States is prepared for stiff competition with China but does not seek conflict, does not seek confrontation, wants to make sure that we manage that competition responsibly."" Sullivan said that their meeting could last multiple hours. The leaders will also discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to the White House. Xi has spent years building a bond with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Beijing has largely toed Moscow's line on the war -- while declining both to provide military assistance to Putin's forces or to join widespread sanctions on his country. But there have been some recent cracks in China's position. Xi did recently state, publicly, that he was opposed to threatening the use of nuclear weapons. That apparent disapproval of Putin's saber-rattling drew praise from Sullivan, who on Thursday called the comment ""constructive."" Despite lingering distrust and a resentment of the U.S. government since the Trump administration initiated a trade war on China, Xi's most important bilateral relationship remains with the United States even as issues remain over China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights in its Xinjiang region. After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the self-governing island of Taiwan in August, the Chinese retaliated by largely freezing all exchanges with the United States. Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of China, has been a third rail for Xi, and in the lead-up to China's crucial Communist Party congress in mid-October, Xi had to demonstrate his resolve to his fellow party members -- especially over Taiwan. But after he secured his third term as leader, cementing his near-absolute authority over the party and the country, a flurry of activity signaled his desire to stabilize, if not mend, his country's relationship with the U.S. Within days of the conclusion of the party congress, Xi sent a personal message of reconciliation to an annual dinner held by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, a nonprofit group headquartered in New York. ""China stands ready to work with the United States to find the right way to get along with each other in the new era on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, which will benefit not only the two countries but also the whole world,"" Xi said. He then added that he hoped the attendees of the annual gathering would ""play an active role in helping Sino-U.S. relations return to the track of healthy and stable development."" Chinese diplomats have started to once again engage with their American counterparts, and in the weeks that followed Xi's message, a flurry of meetings took place -- absent the rancor that had permeated the relationship in the preceding months. China's ambassador to the U.S., Qin Gang, paid a visit to the official residence of the American ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who was newly elevated to China's all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee, and Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua connected with his American counterpart, John Kerry, on the sidelines of the U.N. climate conference known as COP27, in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt. The Chinese previously suspended talks with the U.S. on climate issues -- the countries' sole area of agreement -- to protest Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. The White House has warned reporters to expect no major announcements or a joint statement from the countries following the Biden-Xi meeting on Monday. ""It's about the leaders coming to a better understanding and then tasking their teams to do intensive work,"" Sullivan said Friday. And despite its overtures, Beijing has portrayed the meeting as the United States' idea. ""The Chinese side takes seriously the U.S. proposal for a meeting between the two presidents in Bali,"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said Thursday. ""The teams on both sides are in communication on this."" Both the U.S. and China are hoping to find enough common ground to keep their relationship from deteriorating beyond repair, especially over Taiwan.

2022-11-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pence-deepens-rift-trump-gops-maga-fallout-continues/story?id=93220157,Pence deepens rift with Trump as GOP's MAGA fallout continues: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Republicans are looking for answers and people to blame -- after a midterm bust that left them out of power in the Senate and, with multiple races still unprojected, potentially not in a position to take over the House. Now, as former President Donald Trump readies another run, his No. 2 in the White House has entered the conversation in a significant way. Former Vice President Mike Pence's long-awaited book lands Tuesday amid a Republican reckoning over the MAGA movement -- and what he is saying about Trump on Jan. 6 could help shape what comes next. In his first interview in conjunction with the book's release, Pence tells ABC ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir that Trump's words that day ""endangered me and my family and everyone at the Capitol building."" ""The president's words were reckless. It was clear he decided to be part of the problem,"" Pence told Muir. Trump's handling of his election loss, of course, spilled over into 2022. He made falsehoods about 2020 and its aftermath a virtual prerequisite for his endorsements, and his hand-picked candidates were rejected in key races across major battleground states and districts. The search for scapegoats is impacting leadership races inside the GOP in both the House and Senate. With Trump expected to announce his candidacy Tuesday and already attacking possible challengers, questions about what went wrong for Republicans in the midterms are already a big part of debates over 2024. Pence isn't ready to declare himself a candidate again just yet. But he's not alone in wondering aloud if Trump is more a problem than part of potential solutions for the GOP from here. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Party control of the House of Representatives is still up for grabs, with a number of those midterm races outstanding days after polls closed. The balance of power is in limbo -- and it seems that the leadership of both parties might be, too. While House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has made his ambition to be speaker quite clear, it is unclear if he has the votes should his party win the majority. According to reporting from ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl, the MAGA wing of the party could keep McCarthy from garnering the support he needs to earn the post. At the same time, the fate of the Democratic side of the aisle is unsettled. Some believe there could be a path, albeit a narrow one, to retaining control of the House. During his overseas trip, President Joe Biden called it ""a stretch"" when asked by ABC News about his confidence that Democrats could win. ""We can win it. Whether we're gonna win it remains to be seen,"" he said. Additionally, who will lead the Democrats (majority or not) remains in question. Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously said that the attack on her husband, Paul, will factor into her decision to retire or not. Sunday on ABC's ""This Week,"" Pelosi declined to delve any deeper into her decision. ""Right now, I'm not making any comments until this election is finished, and we have a little more time to go,"" she said of her future role in House leadership. ""I wish it [the counting] was faster."" Questions about which party will control the House will likely be answered well before questions about which lawmakers will be at the helm of each party. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Although the outcomes of several races are still outstanding, the contours of the incoming Congress are coming into clearer view with Latino lawmakers at the forefront of lawmaker changes. High-profile wins on both sides of the aisle are sure to brighten the spotlight on elected Latinos in both chambers as well as the focus on future candidate recruitment efforts. ""The year that 'Latinos are sliding to the GOP' is the year that elects the most Latino Democratic members of Congress,"" Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego tweeted after Election Day. Gallego serves as chair of the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and has been an outspoken force for Democratic Latino representation in Congress. Across the aisle, Republican congresswoman-elect Monica De La Cruz contested the notion that the latest election countered evidence of Latino voters leaning toward Republicans. De La Cruz will represent Texas' 15th Congressional District which partially covers the southern border after winning her race against fellow Latina Michelle Vallejo, the Democratic nominee, by 9 points. ""The GOP just had its best midterm performance ever with Hispanics nationally, not just in FL. I love Cubans, but we don't have many in South Texas,"" De La Cruz tweeted in response to reporting about Democrats outperforming Republicans among Latino voters outside of Florida. Although Republicans made inroads with both Latino voters and candidates in several states, the most high-profile case study of this year's winning Latino-focused campaign belongs to Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. Cortez Masto's victory banked heavily on Nevada's Latino vote and will likely lay the groundwork for future political messaging among the growing voter demographic in 2024. As reported by ABC News' Abby Cruz, four out of five Latinos in Nevada live in Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas and the surrounding metro area. The region comprises about 70% of the state's total vote. Somos Votantes, a group that engages Latino voters and who endorsed Cortez Masto's reelection bid, knocked on more than 1 million doors across Nevada in an effort to turn out voters to the polls.

2022-11-15,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/governable-republican-house-majority/story?id=92563990,How governable would a Republican House majority be?,"Democrats began the last Congress with the smallest House majority in 20 years: just 222 seats, four more than the minimum required for control. In January, when the next Congress begins, Republicans could be back in power in the lower chamber -- with an even smaller majority. As of Monday night, ABC News estimates that the GOP won 214 House seats in last week's midterm elections. There are 14 districts still unprojected, though Democrats lead in some, and FiveThirtyEight forecasts that Republicans may retake the House with as few as 218, which is the minimum needed. That has never happened in the modern era and already has some conservatives wondering how governable their caucus would be with such limited room for error. ""Tread carefully,"" one House Republican, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said when asked what advice they'd give GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who is seeking the speakership. ""This is just such a divisive time. It's divisive within our party, it's divisive Republican-on-Democrat and vice versa."" The makeup of every Congress is fluid at the margins. At various points since January 2021, for example, there have been four, five, six -- as many as seven -- simultaneous vacancies in the House. Lawmakers die, resign or leave office for other positions in government. Those changes could have day-to-day ramifications on a majority of only a few seats. McCarthy and other Republicans entered the midterms bullish on flipping as many as two dozen districts in the House. Anticipating a return to power, McCarthy had unveiled a ""Commitment to America"" while promising to focus on immigration at the southern border, cutting funding to the IRS, reassessing U.S. support for Ukraine and investigating the Biden White House. But last week's election results indicate that McCarthy would instead have to lead with few, if any, votes to spare on those priorities from a fractious conference made up of competing viewpoints from moderates, pro-Trump representatives, fiscal conservatives and more. ""It's going to be very difficult to navigate and keep everybody happy, but he cannot make everybody happy,"" the House Republican said. Former Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Mich., put the lack of a large margin another way. ""It makes a big difference for a leader to have that kind of cushion,"" he said. In a Sunday appearance on ABC's ""This Week,"" current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was asked by George Stephanopoulos how she sees McCarthy managing his party if he is in control. Pelosi noted that Democrats currently maintain a five-seat majority and have been successful in passing legislation. ""It depends on their purpose. In our House, we had those kinds of numbers. But we were united,"" she said. The Republicans who spoke with ABC News for this story had said that if there is a GOP majority, McCarthy would be expected to start the new Congress with goodwill, given his financial and political support for many other members and his alliances with the prominent pro-Trump right flank. After the midterm results became clear last week, however, some GOP lawmakers began openly voicing discontent. Still, it remains unclear who else in the caucus would be able to challenge him. Others in leadership, like Steve Scalise, are seeking lesser positions in the intraparty election on Tuesday. (The official vote for speaker won't be until January.) But if he remains atop a small Republican majority, McCarthy would likely be forced to dive headlong into a spate of policy battles both with the White House and internally, GOP lawmakers and operatives said. The previous two Republican speakers, Paul Ryan and John Boehner, both retired after running the House. Boehner specifically cited a desire to avoid the ""turmoil"" of leadership jockeying. Already, a debate over Ukraine aid has risen, with McCarthy last month warning that there should be no ""blank check"" from the U.S. to support the country against Russia's invasion. He later insisted that didn't mean there'd be no assistance at all, saying on CNBC, ""Wouldn't you want a check and balance in Congress? Wouldn't you want this hardworking taxpayers' money, someone overseeing it?"" ""I'm very supportive of Ukraine,"" McCarthy told CNN last week. ""I think there has to be accountability going forward."" The issue has divided Republicans. Controversial Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene vowed earlier this month that ""under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine. Our country comes first."" Greene, a popular figure among Trump supporters, has also boasted openly of what she called her influence with Republican voters. She previously suggested to The New York Times that ""to be the best speaker of the House and to please the base, [McCarthy is] going to give me a lot of power."" McCarthy has promised to restore Greene to congressional committees after Democrats and some Republicans stripped her of her assignments last year, citing her history of inflammatory statements. On Monday, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., insisted in an appearance on Charlie Kirk's show that he and four other Republicans would try to block McCarthy in the leadership race. ""Every five people is essentially a veto now,"" he said. Elsewhere on Monday, Greene signaled on embattled former Trump political adviser Steve Bannon's podcast that she supported McCarthy and disagreed with a possible challenge to him from other conservatives in the party. She cited how few seats they may hold in total. ""I actually think that's a bad strategy when we're looking at having a very razor-thin majority with potentially 219. We're talking about one vote,"" she said. She told ABC News later Monday that ""I think Republicans need to pick our speaker and not allow the Democrats to pick our speaker."" Scalise also reiterated that McCarthy ""will be the speaker."" ""Who else would it be?"" Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw told ABC News on Monday. Domestically, McCarthy could use the federal debt ceiling -- which must be raised by Congress to cover the government's financial obligations -- as leverage to obtain concessions on spending, pleasing conservatives but risking a default on the debt. Similarly tough battles are anticipated to play out over funding the government. ""We've seen a willingness to stress test it in the past. But they'll prevent default,"" former Rep. David Jolly, R-Fla., said of the debt limit, which Democrats are expected to attempt to raise in the lame-duck session before January. ""The world markets will not allow Kevin McCarthy and the House Republicans to take us to default. But shutdown of government? Yeah, I think we can expect a couple of shutdowns over the next two years."" Jolly also predicted little legislative consensus with President Joe Biden, whom many Republicans feel they were elected to challenge. When asked if there's room for larger cooperation, Jolly replied, ""I would say only on the budget."" Biden said Wednesday that he would invite Republican leadership to the White House, and he and McCarthy spoke the same day. But White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre offered few details to reporters on areas of possible collaboration. She said Thursday that Biden would not ""renegotiate new things that have already passed."" Beyond policy, McCarthy would likely face pressure from lawmakers like Greene and others who advocate for an adversarial oversight effort into the Biden administration. Greene has been vocal about impeaching Biden over a range of policy issues, while other Republicans have foreshadowed investigations of the president's son Hunter Biden -- as well as immigration, COVID-19, outgoing medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci and more. ""I don't care whether you're a Republican or Democrat, but if there's wrongdoing there, it deserves to be looked at, and I think the American people deserve to be told the truth about that,"" said one former House GOP aide of Hunter Biden, who has said he did nothing wrong with his business dealings. This former aide said there was a risk, however, of investigations becoming their own distraction: ""That cannot be the Republicans' main priority. That cannot be one thing where we retake the House, and then we have Kevin McCarthy coming out here and saying, 'OK, well, our No. 1 priority is going to be investigating Hunter Biden.' No, because then you're going to turn a lot of people off."" A GOP pollster spoke even more bluntly. ""It would show amazing restraint to not do the stupid s---,"" they said. ""Focus on the issues, focus on taking down the administration from a policy standpoint, focus on things that matter to people. You know what doesn't matter to people? Impeaching Biden. You know what doesn't matter to people? Hunter Biden, relitigating Fauci. That kind of stuff's stupid."" McCarthy recently told CNN that ""we will never use impeachment for political purposes. That doesn't mean if something rises to the occasion, it would not be used at any other time."" Some of the Republican operatives said that McCarthy, as speaker, would also have to pay attention to House moderates. Multiple of the party's few midterm successes in Congress came in districts in reliably blue New York. One such lawmaker, Mike Lawler, struck an amenable tone in victory remarks. ""I can assure everyone that I will do the best to represent all of the people from every community, from every walk of life, whether you voted for me or not and whether or not you agree with my politics,"" he said. ""Oftentimes, the moderates who behave, they're the ones who kind of get left out in all this. It's a balancing act,"" one GOP strategist working on House races told ABC News. Still, McCarthy has relatively fewer options to clamp down on dissent if he ruffles feathers. ""Twenty years ago, you could say, 'Hey, we're gonna cut off your money or we're going to cut off your communications, your press.' But in today's media environment, you can't do that kind of stuff,"" the pollster said. They pointed to Greene: ""[She] is still gonna have a microphone."" The strategist said little was certain about the months to come, including the trajectory of a McCarthy majority. ""He will be the speaker on day one,"" they said. ""How long that lasts is anyone's guess."" ABC News' Katherine Faulders, Jay O'Brien and Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.",16
2022-11-15,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/federal-prosecutors-decline-file-charges-rudy-giuliani-fbi/story?id=93289433,Federal prosecutors decline to file charges against Rudy Giuliani following FBI raid,"Federal prosecutors in New York said Monday they have declined to file criminal charges against former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, more than a year after his apartment and office were searched by the FBI. The grand jury investigation has concluded ""and that based on information currently available to the Government, criminal charges are not forthcoming,"" prosecutors said in a letter to the court. Prosecutors asked the court to end the appointment of Barbara S. Jones, the retired federal judge who had been appointed special master in the case. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan had been deciding whether Giuliani, one of Trump's lawyers and a close adviser, violated lobbying laws when he campaigned for the ouster of then-U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from Ukraine. The FBI seized more than a dozen devices from Giuliani's home and office during a search in April 2021. Jones had been reviewing the contents. Giuliani ""was very pleased"" when he learned Monday he would face no foreign lobbying charges, his attorney told ABC News. The attorney, Bob Costello, said he informed Giuliani shortly after the U.S. attorney's office issued its letter. ""We are very pleased that they did this,"" Costello said. ""I'm not surprised that they did this because I saw the evidence, or lack thereof, and knew Rudy Giuliani didn't do anything wrong."" ""They deviated from office policy by issuing a statement like this, which is very nice, because there's a memorialization now that Rudy Giuliani didn't do anything wrong in Ukraine."" Costello added he wished prosecutors had done it sooner. ""The mayor has been completely and totally vindicated,"" Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman told ABC News in a statement. ""The grand jury failed to find even probable cause that a crime was committed, which is the basis for a search warrant."" A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment beyond the letter that was filed on the public docket. Costello had denied any wrongdoing by his client speaking to ABC News at the time Giuliani's home and office were raided last year. ""They're trying to make Rudy Giuliani look like a criminal. He has done nothing wrong,"" Costello said in April 2021. On April 28, 2021, Giuliani was awoken by federal agents at 6 a.m. at his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Costello told ABC News. Agents took electronic devices, including Giuliani's cellphone, while at his office they seized devices, including a computer belonging to longtime Giuliani assistant Jo Ann Zafonte, Costello said. Giuliani, though he is now off the hook in the Southern District of New York, he remains a target of criminal investigators in Georgia over his role in seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

2022-11-16,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-forces-republicans-awkward-choices-note/story?id=93349214,Trump forces Republicans into more awkward choices: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The first time around, Republicans in the 2016 campaign were able to act largely as if Donald Trump was someone else's problem -- until, suddenly, he was everyone's to deal with, in the primaries, as the GOP nominee and then as president. Ignoring the now-former president is no longer a viable option. He started the 2024 cycle earlier than almost everyone in his party wanted with his announcement Tuesday night -- amid an atmosphere of losing that has the party looking for answers. They're not finding many good ones while looking in Trump's direction. A growing number of Republican leaders would rather not be looking that way at all right now, as evidenced by the prominent voices calling for him not to announce or who, like former Vice President Mike Pence, are suggesting strongly that there will be stronger choices for Republicans in 2024. The details of Trump's announcement speech were mostly unsurprising. He was relatively subdued as he sought to turn a midterm election that was a repudiation into a vindication, while spreading half-truths about his endorsement record, his presidential accomplishments and his successor's policies. Trump conceded that, with disappointment swirling among Republicans for not doing better in the midterms, ""much of this blame is correct."" But he took no blame himself for his chosen candidates or messaging -- or for the way the cycle effectively began, with his efforts to overthrow the 2020 results. ""This will not be my campaign. This will be our campaign -- all together,"" Trump said. That's now going to be up to Republican voters and leaders to decide. They had chances to move to end Trump's dominance before, though the incentives may have shifted for a party that was promised winning but has endured a streak of defeats. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper For Republicans in both the House and Senate, intraparty divisions are on display as members decide who will lead the party in Congress come January. Rick Scott of Florida, the chair of Senate Republicans' campaign arm, has launched a bid to challenge Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Fresh off midterm losses that will place his party in the minority again, Scott is trying to convince his fellow Senate Republicans that he is the man for the job. ""We know that chief among our problems in races across America was a lack of Republican voter turnout. There may be many reasons for that, but after traveling the country to support our candidates, I believe voters want a plan,"" Scott wrote in a letter to his colleagues, obtained by ABC News. ""Unfortunately, we have continued to elect leadership who refuses to do that and elicits attacks on anyone that does. That is clearly not working and it's time for bold change. The voters are demanding it."" Scott might not be the change that others are looking for: North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis told reporters, ""not at all, not at all,"" when asked if Scott has a chance of ousting McConnell. In the House, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has secured enough votes to become speaker -- if Republicans take the majority. However, in the secret vote during leadership elections on Tuesday, when McCarthy won the speakership nomination, 31 GOP House members nonetheless voted for Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a former chair of the hard-line Freedom Caucus. After election night underperformance, the party appears to be at a crossroads and its members in both chambers will have to confront razor-thin margins that will require unity to further the party's agenda in the new year. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Fresh off a double-digit winning margin in last week's election, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Tuesday that his administration is busing another group of migrants to a northern city. The group Abbott referred to in his announcement will be bused to Philadelphia -- a new addition to the list of cities where the Republican governor had previously sent migrants. Unlike the preceding drop offs spanning New York City, Chicago and Washington, Abbott's office gave advance notice of the migrants' arrival at Philadelphia's William H. Gray III 30th Street Station slated for Wednesday morning. Three of the nation's largest metro regions were already receiving groups of migrants from Texas due to what Abbott calls their ""sanctuary city status."" The addition of Philadelphia to the list also expands the amount of political jabs that Texas' chief executive is directing at Democratic mayors in traditionally blue regions. As part of the announcement, Abbott's office invoked Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney as a figure who ""has long-celebrated and fought for sanctuary city status, making the city an ideal addition to Texas' list of drop-off locations."" Abbott previously traded blows with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington. Although Abbott characterizes the busings as a ""response to President Biden's open border policies overwhelming border communities in Texas,"" recent national polling indicates that immigration issues were not top of mind for voters overall. However, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post polling ahead of the midterm election, 77% of Republican voters cited immigration as a top issue in their vote.

2022-11-17,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-projected-retake-control-house-key-win-democrats/story?id=92681406,GOP projected to retake control of the House in key win after Democrats held Senate,"Republicans are projected to retake control of the House in the midterm elections, breaking Democrats' unified control of the federal government, ABC News reports. Despite other midterm disappointments, that marks a major victory for the party that's been the chamber's minority since 2019 -- and will be a blow to President Joe Biden's agenda in Congress. Democrats already won control of the Senate, securing 50 seats with the opportunity to gain one more in the Georgia runoff next month between incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock and his Republican opponent, Herschel Walker. But Republicans, who will take over in the House in January, will now be able to block White House legislative priorities, decide what bills come to the chamber floor and have the opportunity to launch committee investigations into the Biden administration. Several House Republicans have already said they intend to investigate Hunter Biden, the president's son, and look into the administration's policies on COVID-19 and the southern border. The GOP House leader, California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, was nominated by his colleagues this week to be the next speaker, the chamber's top position and second in line to the presidency. ""I'm proud to announce the era of one-party, Democrat rule in Washington is over,"" McCarthy said after the intraparty leadership vote on Tuesday. In a tweet on Wednesday night, he wrote, ""Americans are ready for a new direction, and House Republicans are ready to deliver."" Biden also released a statement on Wednesday that alluded to some Republican losses in the midterms but said: ""I congratulate Leader McCarthy on Republicans winning the House majority, and am ready to work with House Republicans to deliver results for working families."" McCarthy unveiled his party's vision for Republican rule ahead of the midterms. Their ""Commitment to America"" plan focused on four key areas: creating an ""economy that's strong,"" ""a nation that's safe,"" ""a future that's built on freedom"" and ""a government that's accountable."" The pitch to voters largely avoided specific policy, instead focusing on criticisms of and contrast with Biden's leadership -- specifically on high inflation and anxiety surrounding crime. McCarthy also vowed to bring down federal government spending and said Republicans are prepared to seek more congressional oversight for the billions in financial assistance to Ukraine as the nation defends itself from Russia's invasion. Republicans had been favored for months to win back control of the chamber, according to FiveThirtyEight's forecast. Midterms have historically been a referendum on the president's party. Just twice in the past 19 midterm cycles -- stretching back nearly 40 years -- has the president's party actually gained seats in the House. But the anticipated ""red wave"" didn't fully materialize, as Democrats kept the Senate and limited their losses in the House. Exit polling showed that voters, including independents, favored Democrats on key issues like abortion access despite the public's disapproval of economic conditions. ""We know our job will not be easy,"" McCarthy said on Tuesday. ""We know the task. We've got a close majority. We'll have to work together. We want to work with anyone who wants to make America stronger."" Biden, meanwhile, has celebrated staving off historical headwinds after casting the elections as a choice between Democratic priorities and those of far-right ""MAGA Republicans"" rather than an appraisal of his first two years as commander-in-chief. ""I'm incredibly pleased by the turnout,"" Biden told reporters when Democrats were projected to win the Senate. ""And I think it's a reflection of the quality of our candidates.""",21
2022-11-17,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainians-endure-power-outages-amid-russian-strikes-infrastructure/story?id=93493388,Ukrainians endure power outages amid Russian strikes on infrastructure,"As darkness descends on the Ukrainian capital, the consequences of the waves of Russian missile strikes against critical energy infrastructure become apparent. There's no street lighting in many places around Kyiv, with people carrying flashlights or just their mobile phones with lights on to navigate around. Even traffic lights go off from time to time -- all part of the new reality that residents are getting used to. After the first massive Russian strike on Oct. 10 on energy facilities in various regions, Ukrainians have been warned of expected blackouts and outages and urged to save as much electricity as possible. The most popular commercial to watch on TV (that's when the lights are on and the TV works, of course) is the government appeal to help stabilize the energy network: switch off as many appliances as possible, especially from 7-9 a.m. and between 7-11 p.m. As a result of Russian missile attacks on Wednesday, more than 10 million Ukrainians are currently without electricity, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Most of them are in Vinnytsia, Odesa, Sumy regions and Kyiv, he said. The governor of Kyiv region said Thursday that at least 78% of customers are affected by power outages in one way or another. Last week, 350,000 households in Kyiv alone were without electricity, roughly half of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Then there's public transport used by hundreds of thousands of residents every day with a vast network of metro, tramway and trolleybus lines -- all needing power, yet needed to save power. Hence, less services and longer intervals between them: waiting for the metro train for 10 minutes instead of 2-3 minutes is a new norm, if service hasn't been stopped altogether as it happens every time when air sirens signal the threat of another missile strike. The worst is yet to come, officials warn, saying energy companies have run out of spare parts to repair essential infrastructure and appealing to international partners for urgent technical help. But any supplies will take time and for now people are told to prepare not just for planned blackouts but for emergency outages lasting hours. This would be the best case scenario, says Dmytro Sakharukm, the CEO of DTEK, the biggest energy company in Ukraine, adding that a more realistic scenario includes having permanent blackouts with planned electricity supplies at intervals. Not many residents will take those warnings with great optimism as the weather is not on their side either. With the first snow in Kyiv overnight on Thursday and more expected by the weekend, pressure will be mounting on energy systems as plunging temperatures mean the heating network will be more and more hungry for power. The majority of households in Kyiv and the region have been affected by outages, yet it's a matter of luck. Much of it depends on where exactly you live in Kyiv and which generator and transformer facilities or power lines have been damaged. In general, residents on the left bank of Dnipro River have been affected much worse due to the higher number of industrial facilities and residences in the area that require more power. Serhiy Holichenko, a resident of Schaslyve, a town about 3 miles outside Kyiv, told ABC News that the temperature outside was not yet a major concern but he is worried about his electric stove getting power. ""You never know when you'll be able to cook or just heat your meal,"" he said.",7
2022-11-17,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wnba-star-brittney-griner-moved-penal-colony-mordovia/story?id=93508304,WNBA star Brittney Griner moved to penal colony in Russian region of Mordovia,"WNBA star Brittney Griner has been taken to penal colony IK-2 in the Russian region of Mordovia, her lawyers said in a statement Thursday. Griner is nearing her ninth month in detention after being taken into custody at a Moscow area airport in February for possessing vape cartridges with hashish oil, which is illegal in Russia. Griner pleaded guilty in July and was sentenced to 9 1/2 years in prison in August. ""We visited her early this week. Brittney is doing as well as could be expected and trying to stay strong as she adapts to a new environment,"" Griner's legal team said in a statement to ABC News. ""Considering that this is a very challenging period for her, there will be no further comments from us."" The lawyer continued, ""On behalf of Brittney, we would like to thank everyone who has expressed care for her. During the last few days, we’ve received numerous messages of support."" The U.S. government has classified Griner as ""wrongfully detained"" in Russia as it continues to negotiate for her freedom. U.S. officials have accused Russia of imposing an unusually harsh sentence on Griner and using her as a political prisoner as Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine just a week after Griner was taken into custody. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris called the WNBA player's wife, Cherelle Griner, in July to ""reassure"" her that they are working to secure Griner's release. The U.S. has publicly floated a proposal it made to the Russian government to negotiate the release of Griner and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since 2019, in exchange for convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout. Griner filed an appeal to her nine-year prison sentence, but a Russian judge rejected the appeal on Oct. 25. The 32-year-old Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and eight-time All-Star for the Phoenix Mercury, was traveling to Russia to play for her club team, UMMC Ekaterinburg, during the WNBA's offseason when she was taken into custody. Last week, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that while the U.S. did not know Griner's exact location or final destination, diplomats were already advocating for her through official channels. ""As soon as we learned of her transfer, we requested formally from the Russian government, we requested more information about her transfer,"" Price said, reacting to reports she had been transferred to a penal colony. ""We are also engaging to do all that we can to ensure that her conditions are as safe, as healthy, as can be during this time."" Price said Russia had not responded to the requests. Biden had expressed optimism that negotiations with the Russian government might be more successful now that the midterm elections were over.

2022-11-17,https://abcnews.go.com/US/republicans-push-ahead-hunter-biden-probe-warnings/story?id=93489697,Republicans say they'll push ahead with Hunter Biden probe despite some warnings from within,"Congressional Republicans say they're poised to push ahead with an investigation into President Joe Biden's family, including his son Hunter, in the coming session -- despite warnings from some in their own caucus not to pursue ""hyper-partisan"" oversight probes. Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and James Comer of Kentucky, two high-ranking members expected to helm powerful committees when Republicans take control of Congress in January, outlined their plans during a press conference on Thursday, pledging to ""pursue all avenues"" of wrongdoing and calling investigations into the president's family a ""top priority."" Beyond their interest in Hunter Biden's overseas business endeavors, which are already the subject of a Justice Department investigation, the lawmakers said their primary focus is finding out whether his father, President Biden, was more involved in those dealings than previously known. ""We're not trying to prove Hunter Biden is a bad actor. He is,"" Comer said. ""Our investigation is of Joe Biden."" But several voices from within their own party have balked at the prospect of targeting the president's family, calling it a distraction from the issues voters care about and a political miscalculation that could exacerbate growing tensions within the party after a lackluster midterm performance. Republicans had hoped to comfortably win control of the House, but instead they appear poised to take control with a razor-thin margin. Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia, said pursuing Hunter Biden and others is a losing strategy, and would signal to voters that the party has failed to learn its lessons. ""When voters deliver such a dramatic rebuke, where expectations of a 'red wave' fail to come through, it's time for humility and introspection,"" said Comstock, an ABC News contributor. ""And rabid oversight of Hunter Biden is not at all the message Republicans should take away from the midterms."" Some new arrivals in Washington echoed that sentiment. ""If parts of our party want to go into these investigations, that's their prerogative,"" said Rep.-elect George Santos, R-N.Y., during an interview on Fox News this week. ""I don't want to waste my time in Washington engaging in hyper-partisan issues, I want to deliver results."" On Thursday, Jordan, who is expected to take over the House Judiciary Committee, and Comer, the current ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, accused president's son of committing a bevy of crimes, including tax evasion, wire fraud, and human trafficking, without providing evidence. They said they ""would love"" to speak with Hunter Biden, but did not announce plans to issue a subpoena. Comer said his Oversight panel would focus on obtaining over 150 Suspicious Activities Reports, or SARs, pertaining to Hunter Biden from the Treasury Department. SARs are reports filed by financial institutions to flag questionable banking transactions, but do not amount to crimes. As part of their efforts to more closely connect President Biden to his son's business efforts, Republicans shared a copy of an email Hunter Biden purportedly wrote to a building manager seeking a spare set of keys to a new office for his ""business partners"" -- a list that included his father's name. Several of the claims leveled by Republicans on Thursday have been publicly known for years, dating back to a Senate report published ahead of the 2020 election. That report, penned by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., found Hunter Biden's overseas work ""awkward"" and ""problematic,"" but identified no wrongdoing. DOJ investigators are examining whether Hunter Biden paid adequate taxes on millions of dollars of personal income, including money he made during business pursuits in China and Ukraine. Hunter Biden has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, ethically or criminally, but has acknowledged that his family ties likely bolstered his career. He has not been charged with any crimes. A Democratic spokesperson for the current Oversight Committee called the probe a ""desperate attempt to return Trump to power,"" following former President Donald Trump's announcement on Tuesday that he is again running for president in 2024. ""Today's press conference rehashed the same tired, partisan talking points Republicans have been using for years, ignoring the clear message Americans sent that they want real solutions -- not partisan bickering,"" the spokesperson said. A lawyer for Hunter Biden declined to comment on Thursday's press conference.",16
2022-11-17,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nancy-pelosis-historic-role-female-house-speaker/story?id=93484547,Nancy Pelosi's historic role as first female House speaker,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strode into the Capitol on Thursday morning dressed in a suffragist-white pantsuit, flanked by top aides as her filmmaker daughter, Alexandra, who has for three decades documented her mother's life and career, trailed behind holding a camera, recording her latest historic moment. Now 82, the first and only woman elected as House speaker, second in line to the presidency and the highest-ranking woman in American government, commanded even more attention than usual as she slid through waves of press who bombarded her with questions about her political future -- just hours before her farewell speech after nearly two decades as the top Democratic leader. Pelosi, who in the past month has both endured the loss of a Democratic majority in the House and a violent attack of her 82-year-old husband Paul in their San Francisco home -- an assault intended for her, police said -- learned on Wednesday that she'd need to relinquish the gavel to Republicans. Now, her stepping aside to make room for new generation of House leaders is official, even though for now she will remain in Congress. ""History will note she is the most consequential Speaker of the House of Representatives in our history,"" Biden said. ""With Nancy, you see a father's daughter who learned by his side how to win and govern. With her leading the way, you never worry about whether a bill will pass,"" he said. ""If she says she has the votes, she has the votes. Every time."" In his statement, Biden credited Pelosi with being the ""singular force"" in securing ""once-in-a-generation bills that will define our nation for decades to come,"" including the Inflation Reduction Act, infrastructure investment, the CHIPS and Science Act and gun legislation, among others. Pelosi has represented California's 12th Congressional District, encompassing San Francisco, for 35 years. She was elected as first female speaker in 2007 and again in 2019 -- the only speaker in 70 years to have won the office twice, after having lost the spot when Republicans regained the House majority in 2010. She has led House Democrats for 19 years -- previously having served as House Democratic whip. She rose to Democratic prominence in 2002, after whipping the majority of the party against an Iraq War resolution that her mentor, Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, crafted with President George W. Bush's administration. She became minority leader when Gephardt stepped down to run for president. ""This is an historic moment,"" she said in a speech after accepting the speaker's gavel for the first time. ""It's an historic moment for the Congress. It's an historic moment for the women of America."" Her measured rise to power has been characterized by her steady command of inside politics and her ability unite conflicting factions of Democrats in order to achieve legislative success. Journalist Susan Page, the author of a biography about the House speaker, called Pelosi a ""master of the inside game of politics"" in an April 2021 interview with ABC News' ""Powerhouse Politics"" podcast. ""She's not so great about the public stuff. She's not great at giving a speech, she can stumble when she speaks extemporaneously -- she is a master of the inside game of politics and of being a legislative leader,"" Page said, noting that Pelosi stood up for California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters when Republicans tried to censure her. In the book, Page reveals that Pelosi originally planned to step down after the 2016 election but changed her mind after former President Donald Trump was elected. In 2019 Pelosi led the investigation that resulted in the third presidential impeachment in history, following Trump’s moves to solicit foreign intervention in the 2016 presidential election and withhold congressionally appropriated assistance to Ukraine. Pelosi again headed Trump’s second impeachment in 2021, after his supporters mounted a violent insurrection against the U.S. Capitol following the 2020 presidential election that Trump sought to overturn. She then led the House in creating a bipartisan select committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 attack. Notably, as Pelosi marked her career accomplishments during her farewell speech on Thursday, she omitted any mention of Trump while noting the other presidents whom she had ""enjoyed"" working with. ""I have enjoyed working with three presidents achieving historic investments in clean energy with president George Bush, Transformed health care reform with President Barack Obama and forging the future from infrastructure to healthcare to climate action with President Joe Biden,"" Pelosi said. On ""Powerhouse Politics,"" Page brought up another time Pelosi was thinking about stepping down -- after the 2010 election when Republicans retook the House. Pelosi has been a political fixture for decades and is the daughter of Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., who served as mayor of Baltimore for 12 years, after representing the city for five terms in Congress. For years, Pelosi has long been the subject of Republican ridicule, her image satirized more than most others for years in GOP campaign ads. It came to a head in October, when her husband of almost 60 years was subject to a targeted attack. The two met in Washington, D.C., at Georgetown University in 1961 and have five children and nine grandchildren. Pelosi raised their children in San Francisco and started a Democratic Party club at her home, until she began working for the presidential campaign of California Gov. Jerry Brown in 1976, when she was 36. By 1981, she was the Democratic Party chair for the state of California. After her youngest child left for college, Pelosi ran for Congress and was sworn in June 1978. ABC News' Allison Pecorin, Katherine Faulders and Adisa Robinson contributed to this report.",16
2022-11-18,https://abcnews.go.com/International/qatar-soccer-world-cup-controversial/story?id=93283278,Why the Qatar soccer World Cup is so controversial,"LONDON and DOHA -- The first soccer World Cup ever to be held in the Middle East begins on Sunday, but never before has the biggest tournament of the planet's most watched sport been shrouded in so much controversy. The criticism stretches back more than a decade when the decision to award this year's tournament to Qatar was made in 2010 by FIFA, soccer's global governing body. Since then, heavy scrutiny has been applied by both legal authorities and human rights groups to both the circumstances around the bid, and also the country's fitness to host soccer's premiere competition. Qatar is by no means the first controversial host of a global sporting competition. This century alone, China has played host to two Olympiads despite major human rights concerns, and the previous World Cup hosts in 2018, Russia, have also hosted the Winter Olympics, even after a series of diplomatic crises and the fallout of the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. But, by far, the most controversial was the 1936 Olympics, hosted in Nazi Germany. The term ""sportswashing"" has repeatedly been used by analysts in connection with the upcoming World Cup. Some suggest the awards of these internationally celebrated tournaments have allowed the hosts to integrate themselves into the world's conscience and become arbiters of sporting fair play despite accusations of human rights issues and abuses. Qatari officials have rejected plenty of the criticism levelled its way, insisting the event will be fair and open. Organizers have said that there have been major improvements in the rights of migrant workers in the country, and they have kept sustainability at the heart of their planning at all times. Meanwhile, Qatari officials have alluded to anti-Arab bias in the reporting of the World Cup. The controversy has centered around three major areas: allegations of corruption at the heart of FIFA, human rights in Qatar and climate concerns, despite organizers' pledge that the event be carbon neutral. At the time, the award of the World Cup to Qatar in 2010 was not without controversy. Unlike other previous hosts, the country had little soccer infrastructure in terms of stadia and training facilities, and there were concerns about the soaring temperatures for a tournament usually held in the summer. But in 2014, a report from FIFA's ethics committee found that despite allegations of bribery, there had been no wrongdoing. The report was made public three years later, stating that ""no evidence of any improper activity by the bid team or any football officials has been uncovered"" and as a result ""no further action would be taken."" But the report did not put the controversy to bed. A number of lawsuits have been filed against FIFA officials alleging corruption in recent years, including relating to the award of Qatar with the 2022 World Cup. According to charges filed by the DOJ in 2015 against several high-profile former FIFA executives, ""several executive committee members were offered or received bribes in connection with their votes"" on both Russia's 2018 and Qatar's 2022 World Cup. The current FIFA leadership have sought to distance themselves from their predecessors. The charges against the named individuals have not been resolved. Even with top former officials facing charges of corruption, FIFA was awarded $32 million as a victim of corruption by the Justice Department in 2021, meaning the organization was a victim of alleged financial wrongdoing when funds were wrongly paid to individuals. Both Qatar and FIFA have denied any wrongdoing. FIFA's president at the time of the World Cup was awarded to Qatar, Sepp Blatter, told Swiss newspaper group Tameida that picking Qatar was a ""mistake."" ""It's a country that's too small,"" he said. ""It was a bad choice. And I was responsible for that as president at the time."" Blatter did not address the allegations of corruption in the interview, but he has not been specifically accused of wrongdoing in the Qatar bid. In order to play host to the 32-nation tournament, Qatar, an energy-rich nation roughly the size of Connecticut, embarked on a major construction project. An estimated 95% of the country's labor force is made up of migrants, and Qatar has been accused of widespread abuses in how it treats its migrant workers, including those specifically working on the World Cup. An investigation by The Guardian newspaper reported that over 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh have died in Qatar since 2012. Thirty-seven of those deaths were directly linked to the construction of World Cup stadia, according to the investigation which has not independently been confirmed by ABC News. ""The mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population. However, every lost life is a tragedy, and no effort is spared in trying to prevent every death in our country,"" the Qatari government reportedly said in a statement to the Guardian. Despite the international outcry, FIFA has defended Qatar from the criticism. Gianni Infantino, the current FIFA president said that migrant workers gain ""dignity and pride"" from working on Qatari infrastructure despite migrant deaths. In May of this year, at a summit hosted by the Milen Institute, a U.S. think tank, Infantino said: ""6,000 might have died in other works and so on and of course, FIFA's not the police of the world or responsible for everything that happens around the world. But thanks to FIFA, thanks to football, we have been able to address the status of all the 1.5 million workers in Qatar."" Migrant rights are not the only human rights concerns. Same-sex relationships are criminalized in Qatar's Penal Code, and can carry a prison sentence. Human Rights Watch has also reported that authorities have erratically been arresting LGBTQ people and subjecting them to poor treatment in detention. Fans groups and human rights organizations have expressed concern about the status of LGBTQ+ fans attending the tournament. Former Qatar footballer & current Qatari World Cup Ambassador, Khalid Salman, recently called homosexuality ""damage in the mind"" and ""spiritual harm"" in an interview with German TV broadcaster ZDF which triggered outrage. Salman has since retracted the statement saying he was quoted ""out of context."" Nasser al-Khater, CEO of Qatar 22, addressed the concerns of LGBTQ fans concerns about going to Qatar in a recent interview with Al Jazeera. ""I reiterate the message of Qatar being a safe country, a hospitable country and I am confident that anybody that comes to Qatar is going to feel welcome and safe,"" he said. ""However when it comes to Qatar, we are talking about a football world cup we are talking about a sporting event… I think that the sporting event should be a sporting event and people should enjoy the sport."" The state's male guardianship laws have also been credited with severely restricting women's freedoms in the country, according to Human Rights Watch. The NGO found that women in the country required permission from male guardians in order to go about many aspects of their lives, such as marry, take certain jobs and travel abroad until a certain age, which they say is in violation of Qatari and international law. Qatar and FIFA pledged that they would deliver the world's first ""fully carbon-neutral FIFA World Cup tournament."" Nasser al-Khater, CEO of Qatar 2022, said the Gulf nation is ""very proud"" of the work they have done regarding sustainability, which includes plans for state-of-the-art air-conditioned stadiums and the planting of thousands of trees. Though the tournament is projected to emit a total of 3.6 million tons of carbon dioxide according to FIFA , they said 95% of those emissions will come from air travel, and are classified as ""indirect emissions."" However, climate researchers have cast doubt on the credibility of Qatar's claim of a ""carbon-neutral"" tournament, arguing that the Gulf nation has underestimated the event's true emission output and climate impact. Critics further point out that Qatar is utilizing purchasing carbon credits, a questionable practice, in order to claim it's meeting sustainability goals. ""This is not a harmless exercise, as it misleads players, fans, sponsors and the public into believing that their involvement in the event will come at no cost to the climate,"" said Belgian NGO Climate Market Watch. FIFA received criticism from national football associations earlier this month, after they were sent a letter telling them to ""stick to football."" The widely reported letter, signed by Infantino and Secretary General Fatma Samoura, said: ""Please, let's now focus on the football!"" They asked the 32 competing federations to ""not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists."" In an apparent response, the UEFA (European soccer's governing body) Working Group on Human Rights and Labour reiterated their commitment to human rights and a compensation fund for migrant workers. Human rights organizations have said that FIFA and Qatari should pay the compensation. The criticism may not stop when the tournament gets underway this weekend as these controversies threaten to overshadow the world's biggest sporting event. The management of several teams, such as England and Australia, have said they will not hide away from talking about the issues at hand at the controversial World Cup.",1
2022-11-18,https://abcnews.go.com/US/jack-smith-special-prosecutor-tapped-oversee-dojs-trump/story?id=93574632,"Who is Jack Smith, the special counsel tapped to oversee DOJ's Trump probes?","Attorney General Merrick Garland on Friday tapped Jack Smith, a longtime federal prosecutor and former head of the Justice Department's public integrity section, as special counsel to oversee the DOJ's investigation into former President Donald Trump's handling of classified materials after leaving office. ""Mr. Smith is the right choice to complete these manners in an evenhanded and urgent manner,"" Garland said at a press conference Friday. As special counsel, Smith will ""exercise independent prosecutorial judgment to decide whether charges should be brought,"" Garland said. The department said Smith was unable to attend the press conference because he is recovering from knee surgery after a bike accident. Smith, who will begin as special counsel immediately, said in a statement released Friday through the Justice Department that he would ""exercise independent judgment"" and work ""expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate."" ""The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch,"" Smith said. Former colleagues have characterized Smith as an aggressive prosecutor who would not shy away from taking on difficult prosecutorial judgments, with the background and temperament that make him a strong selection for the high-profile role. ""When it comes to investigating allegations of sophisticated federal criminal matters, Jack Smith is the gold standard,"" Edward J. Loya Jr., a former colleague in the public integrity section at the DOJ, told ABC News. ""He brings a tremendous amount of judgment, experience, and energy to the job and inspires those who work for him to do their best work. I am confident he will take on this role without fear or favor,"" said Loya, who is now at the law firm Epstein Becker Green. Greg Andres, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Smith for more than a decade, lauded Smith as ""uniquely qualified given his experience and his judgment."" ""It's hard for me to think of a better choice -- he's independent, thoughtful, deliberate. He's going to do what's right and he has a tremendous amount of experience,"" said Andres, who is now at the law firm Davis Polk. ""He'll turn over every stone, but he'll do it in a timely manner."" James McGovern, a former federal prosecutor with Smith in the Eastern District of New York, and now in private practice at Hogan Lovells, called Smith ""the consummate prosecutor and public servant."" ""I have no idea what his political beliefs are because he's completely apolitical,"" McGovern said. ""He's committed to doing what is right."" Smith has most recently served since 2018 as chief prosecutor in the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, where he was tasked with investigating and adjudicating war crimes in Kosovo. Prior to his time in the Hague, Smith served in multiple roles with the Justice Department, including as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York and as first assistant U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee. In 2010, Smith took the helm of the department's public integrity unit, where he oversaw high-profile cases that often targeted elected officials. His section played a role in the failed prosecution of former senator and Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards for alleged campaign finance violations aimed at hiding an extramarital affair. Smith was chief when Edwards was indicted in 2011, but the DOJ dropped the case after a trial led to a deadlocked jury. Smith has also demonstrated the capacity to drop cases when the evidence does not bear out a crime, former colleagues said, pointing to his decision to close a years-long case against former Rep. Tom Delay, R-Texas. ""If there is not a case, there will not be a case,"" said Brian Kidd, a former colleague at the Justice Department who is now a partner at Morrison Foerster. ""He is not interested in prosecuting somebody for the point of prosecuting. If it moves to that next level, it's because the facts are there and he believes a crime was committed."" In 2014, House Republicans interviewed Smith as part of their investigation into whether the Obama-era IRS may have targeted conservatives for enforcement actions. Smith also oversaw the DOJ's subpoenaing of at least one reporter for testimony and documents about their sources -- a controversial practice that Attorney General Garland recently prohibited. During his time in the Eastern District in New York, Smith prosecuted a man named Ronell Wilson for murdering two New York Police Department detectives. Wilson in 2006 became the first person sentenced to death since the reinstatement of the federal death penalty in 1988. Smith is the second special counsel to investigate Trump, after former FBI Director Robert Mueller probed the Trump campaign's ties to the Russian government during the 2016 presidential campaign. Andres, a former member of Mueller's team, said Smith will be an important figure not only in managing the investigation of Trump, but also symbolically as a figurehead for the probe. ""The most important thing is who is running the investigation -- think about it in the context of Robert Mueller,"" Andres said. ""The story is Jack Smith.""",11
2022-11-19,https://abcnews.go.com/International/world-faces-food-insecurity-crisis-global-population-reaches/story?id=93347906,World faces food insecurity crisis as global population reaches 8 billion,"The United Nations on Tuesday officially declared that the global population had reached 8 billion, highlighting massive growth in the last few decades and the decades to come, but also raising concerns about food scarcity and prices around the world. Every night around 828 million people go to bed hungry, according to the World Food Program (WFP), a United Nations organization focusing on providing food assistance globally. Since 2019, the number of people facing significant food insecurity has increased from 135 million to 345 million, according to WFP. ""We are on the way to a raging food catastrophe,"" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told world leaders at the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, this week. ""People in five separate places are facing famine."" The global population has been growing slowly since the 1950s, falling under 1% in 2020. The latest projections by the U.N. show the global population may reach 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion in 2050. It is projected to peak at around 10.4 billion during the 2080s and remain at that level until 2100. India will surpass China as the world's most populous country next year, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. The world produces enough food yearly, around 4 billion tons, to feed everyone, but around one-third of all food made, approximately 1.3 billion tons of fruit, vegetables, dairy and meat, goes to waste, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. According to the World Wildlife Fund, that's enough calories to feed every undernourished person. Experts said that other parts of the growing food insecurity problem are rising food prices and malnutrition, proving most detrimental to women and children. ""When you look at the food price crisis, it's particularly foods that are nutritious and are high in vitamins and minerals that these children need that are the most costly,"" Saskia Osendarp, executive director of the Micronutrient Forum and co-coordinator of Standing Together for Nutrition, a consortium of nutrition, economics, food and health system experts, told ABC News. Osendarp added that if women and children cannot afford or have access to healthier, vitamin-rich foods, they risk having micronutrient deficiencies. When food prices increase, households switch to cheaper staple foods and processed foods instead of buying more nutritious -- and generally more expensive-- foods, such as fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, decreasing the quality of their diets, Osendarp said in an April op-ed in Nature magazine. About one in two preschool-aged children and two in three women of reproductive age globally experience at least one micronutrient deficiency, according to a report from the Lancet Global Health. Malnutrition can also lead to significant health problems, particularly in children, who may develop cognitive and developmental issues, as well as how they perform in school, Osendarp said. ""We call this hidden hunger because you don't immediately notice it, but you do see it in individuals that lack these critical vitamins,"" she said. ""It has devastating impacts on their survival, their immunity, their health, but also on their growth and overall development. The impacts will last for a long time."" At the G20 Summit, Guterres told world leaders that if there isn't an organized action plan, then affordability issues this year will lead to food shortages in 2023. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also increased food prices, as both countries are important suppliers of wheat, barley, corn and sunflower oil. In May, Samantha Power, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos that Russia's war in Ukraine had caused global food and fertilizer shortages, resulting in increased prices for consumers and farmers around the world. ""It is just another catastrophic effect of Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,"" Power said at the time. Over half of the projected global population growth up to 2050 will happen in eight countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania. According to the U.N., food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa is at 66.2%, the highest in the world. Over half of the world's undernourished live in Asia and more than one-third live in Africa, with the situation worsening because of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a U.N report. Last month at the Committee on World Food Security, WFP executive director David Beasley said the world is facing threats of mass starvation and that global leaders must act and provide humanitarian support.

2022-11-19,https://abcnews.go.com/US/attorney-general-names-special-counsel-oversee-dojs-mar/story?id=93568451,Attorney General Garland names special counsel in Trump Mar-a-Lago and Jan. 6 probes,"Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed John L. ""Jack"" Smith as special counsel to oversee the entirety of the Justice Department's criminal investigation into the alleged unlawful retention of national defense information at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, as well as key aspects of its probe into the events of Jan 6. Trump's announcement Tuesday that is running for president for a third time created a conflict of interest and triggered the appointment of a special counsel, according to the DOJ special counsel guidelines. In his appointment order, Garland says Smith ""is authorized to conduct the ongoing investigation into whether any person or entity violated the law in connection with efforts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on January 6, 2021."" Smith is further instructed to conduct the investigation into national defense information found at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, according to the order, ""as well as any matters that arose or may arise directly"" from that investigation. Smith ""is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,"" Garland's appointment order states. ""The Special Counsel is also authorized to refer to the appropriate United States Attorney discrete prosecutions that may arise from the Special Counsel's investigation."" ""The Department of Justice has long recognized that in certain extraordinary cases. It is in the public interest to appoint a special prosecutor to independently manage an investigation and prosecution based on recent developments, including the former president's announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election and the sitting president stated intention to be a candidate as well,"" Garland told reporters on Friday. ""I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel. Such an appointment underscores the department's commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters,"" Garland said. ""It also allows prosecutors and agents to continue their work expeditiously and to make decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law."" Garland said Smith is the right choice and that the he will make sure the investigation receives all the necessary resources. ""I will ensure that the special counsel receives the resources to conduct this work quickly and completely,"" Garland said. ""Given the work to date and Mr. Smith's prosecutorial experience, I am confident this appointment will not slow the completion of these investigations."" Trump attacked newly appointed special counsel Smith as ""super radical left"" while defending himself as ""innocent."" ""This horrendous abuse of power is the latest in a long series of witch hunts that started a long time ago,"" Trump said Friday evening from Mar-a-Lago, while claiming that he thought the investigation was ""dead"" because Rep. Liz Cheney lost her election. ""I thought that put the final nail in the coffin, only to find out the corrupt and highly political Justice Department just appointed a super radical left special counsel, better referred to as a special prosecutor, to start the process all over again,"" Trump said. ""We thought it was just about dead."" Trump continued to dismiss the investigation as ""political,"" as he has done with most investigations involving him. ""They want to do bad things to the greatest movement in the history of our country, but in particular bad things to me,"" Trump said. ""But I've gotten used to it."" ""This will not be a fair investigation,"" Trump continued, while claiming that he has ""proven to be one of the most honest and innocent people in our country."" In his remarks, Trump deflected by accusing other politicians-- including previous presidents-- of crimes, without evidence. He called for a special counsel to be appointed to look into Hunter Biden-- even though Trump himself appointed David Weiss who is investigating Hunter Biden and Garland left Weiss in place. ""They're criminals,"" Trump said. ""I've done nothing wrong."" Smith, according to a senior DOJ official, is a political independent and formerly served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, and the chief of DOJ's Public Integrity Section, and, later, the first assistant U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, later becoming the acting U.S. attorney there. From 2017-18, he served as VP of litigation for the Hospital Corporation of America, and since 2018 he has served as the chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague charged with investigating war crimes in Kosovo. He will begin work as special counsel immediately. In August the FBI raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida, looking for documents that the National Archives said were marked classified and had not been returned to the National Archives, despite them having given the former president ample opportunity to do so. The FBI said it took 11,000 documents in the court-authorized seizure, including more than 100 documents with classified markings. Trump sued to obtain the appointment of a special master to identify which documents were protected by attorney-client privilege and executive privilege. The review is ongoing, and the Department of Justice is seeking a fast-track appeal of the special master ruling. There have been two special counsels in the past four years. Robert Mueller was tapped by former Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and after that investigation was concluded, John Durham was tapped by former Attorney General William Barr to be special counsel to investigate the origins of that probe.

2022-11-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/world-cup-workers-face-alleged-unfair-working-conditions/story?id=93730041,World Cup workers face alleged unfair working conditions despite Qatar promises,"As the World Cup matches are underway, human rights activists and others have been protesting the games and Qatar officials over what they say are human rights issues for the hundreds of workers who have been on the ground for the last couple of months. According to some activists, everyone from construction workers to hotel employees has been allegedly forced to work long hours in the heat with little pay and, in some cases, subtle threats. Grant Wahl, a longtime sports journalist who has covered soccer for various outlets, including ""Sports Illustrated,"" investigated some of these allegations and reported that many workers face unfair conditions. Wahl, who hosts the podcast ""Fútbol with Grant Wahl,"" spoke with ""Start Here"" Monday about what he found when he arrived in Qatar. START HERE: Grant, unlike a lot of journalists who flew to Qatar last week, you spent time there earlier this year amid these construction projects. Why were you going to look at a bunch of empty stadiums and hotels? GRANT WAHL: I knew I was going to go to the World Cup, come here and cover.. focusing entirely on the soccer once the tournament started. But before that, I wanted to do a story and do some actual reporting on the topic of migrant workers in Qatar. Nearly 90% of the workforce in Qatar is not Qatari. They're coming from East Africa, West Africa, the Indian subcontinent [and] the Far East. And they're taking on jobs of construction, working in domestic situations and houses, hotel workers [and] all sorts of things that migrant workers are doing in Qatar. But the history is that they're not paid well. They're not treated well. A lot of people have died. Human rights organizations who study this stuff very closely say that the Qataris really don't care, and they've shown they don't care by [not] trying to find out actual reasons people have died. The vast majority of deaths are just classified as natural causes. But, obviously, there's a tremendous amount of heat in Qatar year-round. There are a lot of deaths of migrant workers that have taken place due to the heat and the body's responses to that. New laws have been passed by the Qatari government under pressure. They were announced in 2019 and the Qatari government made a lot of fanfare about it, saying we have ended this ‘kafala’ system in which employers are allowed to keep the passports of their migrant workers and essentially preventing them from leaving the country, even if they're being treated badly. So there was a minimum wage established. It was no longer allowed for workers to pay recruitment fees, either in their country or in Qatar to get to Qatar and get a job there. After these new laws were announced, workers were allowed for the first time to choose to change jobs within Qatar without having to leave the country and come back. But what I was doing on the ground; I decided I was going to go to 14 FIFA hotels, and I was going to speak to at least one worker at each FIFA hotel and give them anonymity, and really find out what their experience has been like and whether these laws have been followed on the ground in Qatar. A pattern quickly emerged as I talked to more and more workers, and I talked to nearly two dozen at all of these 14 different FIFA hotels, which is that a lot of these new laws are not being followed. Some of the workers that I spoke to didn't have their passports. START HERE: They hold on to your passport as if to be like 'follow what we're telling you to do or else you don't get home'? Is that the implication there? WAHL: Correct. You literally cannot leave the country if you don't have your passport, and so there's an element of freedom attached to that. A bunch, including someone at the hotel where the U.S. team is staying in Qatar, told me that they had to pay big recruitment fees to come to the country, which puts them in debt from the moment they get there. One thing that did appear to be being followed was the new minimum wage, which I thought was interesting. But keep in mind, the new minimum wage is about $1.25 an hour. START HERE: But the question then is…what is the responsibility of everyone who’s participating? The U.S. actually held a nice friendly game with some migrant workers the other day almost to say “we see you, folks,” but what about all of us back home? I’ve seen people contemplating whether to boycott these games. Do you think people will connect the dots with, between these issues they hear about in the news and the game they love on their screen? WAHL: So the U.S. English language broadcaster of this World Cup is Fox Sports and they have said publicly we are not going to cover any of these so-called controversial issues like the migrant worker situation in Qatar or LGBTQ rights or women's rights, which are all things that U.S. soccer, by the way, is educating its players on and taking time to look into and a lot of other journalistic outlets are discussing. And so Fox has decided not just for this World Cup, but previously when the World Cup was in Russia in 2018, that they were not going to touch this. And that's certainly a decision they've made. If people, fans, in the U.S. decide they want to boycott the World Cup and not watch it, I understand that.",7
2022-11-22,https://abcnews.go.com/US/trial-begins-david-barnes-texas-man-detained-russia/story?id=93753289,"Trial begins for David Barnes, Texas man detained in Russia","A Texas father being held in Russia on accusations that were not substantiated by law enforcement in his home state of Texas is now facing trial before a Moscow judge. Ten months ago, Russian police took David Barnes into custody and alleged that between 2014 and 2018 he committed child abuse in suburban Houston. His trial began on Nov. 16. ""Their trials seem to be like a circus,"" said Margaret Aaron, Barnes' younger sister. ""I'm praying to God for a miracle."" Barnes flew to Moscow in late 2021 to attempt to argue in Russian family court for visitation rights or custody over his two sons, like he had been granted by a judge in Texas, his family and friends say. ""He was the type of dad that you would never see the kids just sitting in front of a computer or a tablet,"" Barnes' friend Chris Schiller said. ""His kids were his world."" 'Chances are thin' Svetlana Koptyaeva, Barnes' Russian ex-wife, had allegedly taken the boys out of the United States in 2019, prompting Texas authorities to charge her with felony interference with child custody. Instead of obtaining rights to see his children in Moscow, Barnes was arrested and has been held in Moscow's Detention Center 5, where Trevor Reed was also detained. Aaron said her brother is being held in a 12-person cell. Over the summer, Rep. Kevin Brady attributed Barnes' detention to ""political purposes."" U.S. officials have not announced whether they have classified Barnes' detention as wrongful, as they have in the cases of detainees Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan. The trial for Barnes is occurring on nonconsecutive days. Proceedings were previously scheduled to begin in September and October, but according to his family, they were postponed each time after reports of a transportation issue. ""I am focusing my energies on winning my case,"" Barnes wrote to relatives. ""Even though the chances are thin, I think we could and should win."" 'It tore him apart' Russian prosecutors are accusing Barnes of abusing his two sons years ago in Texas' Montgomery and Harris counties, court documents show. Similar allegations were previously reported by Koptyaeva, his ex-wife, to Texas authorities during their divorce proceedings -- but the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services closed a 2018 investigation after finding insufficient evidence to verify the claims against Barnes. Prosecutors in the counties that are now at the center of the Russian trial also did not find cause to file charges against him. ""There are still no charges in Montgomery County related to David Barnes,"" Kelly Blackburn of the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office told ABC News on Friday. A 2017 settlement signed by Barnes and Koptyaeva said in part that while not waiving legal reporting requirements, Koptyaeva was ""to refrain from making statements, either written or oral, to any third party, alleging that ... [Barnes] ... molested his minor child and/or engaged in improper sexual contact with his minor child."" Less than two years following the settlement, records show Barnes called police to ask for welfare checks on the two boys, but they were nowhere to be found. Interpol considers the children to have disappeared on March 26, 2019, the same date Koptyaeva allegedly left the U.S. with them. ""It tore him apart,"" Schiller said. ""I think his faith in God kept him grounded."" In a September email to ABC News, Koptyaeva continued maintaining that the children were abused by her ex-husband. ""We left everything, our friends, the boys' school, our house, my job, everything,"" Koptyaeva said in part. ""We were running away just to protect the boys. Do you really think that a person would take two kids and go into [the] unknown, without [a] job, without any source of income, into nothing just to hurt someone?"" Koptyaeva remains wanted in Texas on a felony interference with child custody warrant, Blackburn confirmed. 'I may not ever see my brother again' Russian judicial filings list that Barnes is due back in court Dec. 15. ""We are monitoring Mr. Barnes' case closely, and we remain in regular communication with Mr. Barnes and his family and legal team,"" a U.S. State Department spokesperson told ABC News. ""We have visited Mr. Barnes four times since his arrest in January 2022. Our last visit to Mr. Barnes in detention was on August 18, 2022."" Testimony has yet to begin in his trial, but Barnes' siblings are concerned that should he be convicted, he could end up in a Mordovia penal colony like the ones where Griner, Whelan and Reed were sent. ""He's probably better off where he is now than being shipped off to a labor camp,"" his older sister Carol Barnes said. ""I may not ever see my brother again.""

Mezhevyi had been separated from his family at a checkpoint in Mariupol as they were attempting to escape the besieged city. Officials imprisoned him because they thought he might have connections to the military. Mezhevyi's three children, Matvii, Sviatoslava and Sascha, were sent to Moscow, where they told ABC News Correspondent Britt Clennett they had been pressured to choose between being sent into the foster care system or an orphanage. Mezhevyi traveled through Russia for two days, communicating with a network of volunteers through the encrypted messaging service Telegram, and staying on strangers’ couches, before he finally reached his children. Mezhevyi's 9-year-old daughter Sviatoslava told ABC News that at the boarding house they were being spoiled with gifts and being pressured to choose whether to go to an orphanage or with a foster family. “I said to the staff, ‘No foster families,’” she said. “‘I already have a daddy and he is alive!’” According to Mezhevyi, his children were being told, “‘Your father can’t make it. You have to decide.’” Mezhevyi's children are just three of the more than 11,000 children the Ukrainian government says have been deported by Russia thus far, taken from areas it has invaded and then brought back to be raised as Russian. According to the official tally on the state-sponsored website, only 119 children have been returned to date. Last week, 52 children at an orphanage in the Kherson region, deemed “medically fragile,” were taken to an unspecified “safe” area in Russia. Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova publicized the news. Additionally, Russian officials in Zaporizhzhia announced they would soon transfer 40,000 Ukrainian children to Russia, saying that the system of care in occupied Ukraine is inadequate. “The removal of children is one of the specified acts which are necessary to be established in order to prove genocidal intent,” said Wayne Jordash, a humanitarian lawyer based in Ukraine. “This is a very clear example of that.” In May, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree making it easier for Russian families to adopt Ukrainian children. Another Ukrainian parent, Larysa Yagodynska, described to ABC News how her sons were abducted while riding their bikes through a Russian checkpoint. She said she spent an hour trekking through the forest at night to try to reach Russian soldiers, to get information from them about where her sons had gone. “I couldn’t see where I was going because I was crying so much,” she said. One of her sons, 17-year-old Slava, said that he and his brother were put into a car and taken to Chernobyl with “plastic bags over our heads.” He said they were beaten, and then taken further to Belarus. He was brought to an orphanage in Minsk, where his mother said he was beaten again, and tortured with electric shock. The Russian soldiers “threw him away like a small kitten,” she said. Although the family was eventually reunited, his mother said Slava still suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. “I just can't understand how it’s possible,” she said. “How you can treat people like that?”",22

The Ukrainian family will celebrate their first Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., gathering around the table and learning about the American tradition and foods. Susan Helms says they feel blessed they can share both cultures with her serving up a dinner at her home — pulling pockets of steamed stuffed cabbage out of a pot on a chilly night in Darien, Connecticut. ""Should we go get our plates and get our halupki?"" Susan Helms asked. Susan Helms says Liudmyla Stepnyk was up late making the dish. It is one of the Ukrainian traditions Liudmyla Stepnyk and her family find comfort in after fleeing their home in Western Ukraine when Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Liudmyla Stepnyk practices some of her English, saying the pockets of cabbage are filled with rice, meat and are boiled. Susan Helms say they look like little presents. Around the dinner table, the spirit of thanks and giving is felt with the sharing of meals. The Stepnyk family arrived in August and are still getting used to life in America. Ted Holmes says it's been a big change for he and his wife, who were empty nesters. He says both families share responsibilities in terms of cooking, which is a mix of Ukrainian and American food. Ted Helms joked to ABC News that he and Volodya Stepnyk ""just eat and show up."" Susan Helms says she was determined to help once the war began and through her search was able to find relatives in Ukraine and decided to sponsor them to come to the U.S. She and Volodya Stepnyk connected on Facebook. Under Ukraine's martial law exemption, men who are raising three children or more can receive a deferment. Volodya Stepnyk says he made the decision to go to ensure the safety of his children. Yulia Stepnyk, who is the oldest of three children says her family first fled to Poland before connecting with Susan Helms and getting approval to come to the U.S. Under the ""Uniting for Ukraine"" program, American-based citizens can financially sponsor displaced Ukrainians who are still outside the U.S. They apply to receive a temporary two-year humanitarian live and work visa and go through a vetting process. Susan Helms says once the family arrived, the kids were enrolled in school. Yulia Stepnyk is 17 years old and in her last year of high school. Her siblings are in middle school and have already celebrated their birthdays in the U.S. Volodya and Liudmyla Stepnyk say they are trying to make the best life they can for their children and are grateful they could come to America. All say they are finding peace --something they haven't felt since leaving their home but still miss the life they left behind. Yulia Stepnyk has embraced the message of this holiday and said at first it felt strange coming to a new country, but she says she is no longer fearful. ""I'm thankful to all of the people around me,"" Yulia Stepnyk told ABC News. ""Because you came to another country, in the stranger's house, and now when we have these meals. I just feel this love.""",22

The eight-tentacled icon put TV pundits to shame with an incredible string of correct World Cup winner predictions from his glass tank at the Aquarium Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen, Germany. The tentacled tipster had an incredible success rate: he correctly predicted eight world cup matches at South Africa's tournament in 2010, including Spain beating the Netherlands in the World Cup final. All did not end well for Paul’s successor, Rubio the octopus, who became an icon in Japan for his 100% success rate in predicting group stage matches, including Japan’s win against Columbia in the 2018 World Cup held in Russia. Rubio did not get the chance to make his prediction for the Round-of-16 after he was chopped up and turned into seafood, according to one local news outlet. Taiyo the otter had good news for Japanese fans at this year’s 2022 World Cup in Qatar, correctly predicting Japan’s group stage win over Germany on Wednesday. From his home at the Maxell Aqua Park Shinagawa in Japan, the Taiyo was given three buckets to choose from -- Japan (blue), draw (yellow) and Germany (Red) -- and did not hesitate in picking up his tiny football and placing his bets on Japan. He was widely praised online for his exploits. And let’s not forget another iconic star -- Marcus, the ""mystic"" pig. In the 2018 World Cup, ""Mystic Marcus"" predicted a World Cup victory for England in the after selecting apples with the England flag on British morning television. However, Mystic Marcus’ fortune-telling record was shattered when England were knocked out in the semi-finals. Nelly the elephant from Serengeti Park in Hodengagen, Germany, also meant business when she had a streak of 30 out of 33 matches correct for her predictions in the 2006 World Cup, the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 Euros, according to The Atlantic. Camilla the ""mystic"" camel from Melton Mowbray in England did have good news for England, however. She correctly predicted the Three Lion’s group-stage win over Iran at the Qatar World Cup. Her owners told the Sun newspaper in the U.K. that their clairvoyant camel is “never wrong.""",1
2022-11-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-committed-ukraine-accountability-funding-mccaul-turner/story?id=93995965,Top House Republicans support more aid for Ukraine but want 'accountability',"Reps. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Mike Turner, R-Ohio, on Sunday insisted that the incoming House Republican majority would continue to support funding and arming Ukraine in its war against Russia, downplaying critics inside the GOP's conference who have vowed to oppose future aid packages. McCaul and Turner, the likely next chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence Committees, respectively, said on ABC's ""This Week"" that Ukraine could win if it gets adequate support from the West. They also backed House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy's past statement that Congress shouldn't provide a ""blank check"" and said Republicans planned to push for greater oversight and ""accountability"" over how American support is being used overseas. ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz cited objections to Ukraine aid from some conservatives -- like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene -- and asked, ""Are you really certain that Republicans will bring this to the floor?"" ""I think the majorities on both sides of the aisle support this effort,"" McCaul said. ""I think everybody has a voice in Congress. And the fact is, we are going to provide more oversight, transparency and accountability. We're not going to write a blank check."" ""Does that diminish our will to help the Ukraine people fight? No. But we’re going to do it in a responsible way,"" McCaul said. Otherwise, he said, authoritarian countries like China and Iran could become emboldened by Russia's success. ""The issue, obviously, is we don't need to pass $40 billion, large Democrat bills that have been passed to send $8 billion to Ukraine,"" Turner told Raddatz, who recently returned from a reporting trip in Ukraine. Raddatz pushed back on Turner, noting that beyond the immediate funds for procurement, that whole aid package was focused on Ukraine including with long-term financial support for rebuilding. Both McCaul and Turner also voted for the $40 billion package in May. The lawmakers' comments come ahead of what is expected to be a brutal winter in Ukraine, with Russia, some nine months after its invasion, targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure -- limiting power and heat to major cities. McCaul and Turner said that providing Ukraine with adequate air defense systems is a top priority, and McCaul contended the federal government had ""slow-walked"" some of its lethal support. When Raddatz pressed McCaul on whether providing certain munitions could ""incite Russia"" after McCaul raised the possibility of extending Ukraine's range into Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, McCaul said: ""Crimea is not part of Russia under international law. So if they can hit into Crimea, I think that’s fair game."" But, Turner said, simply handing over U.S. equipment might not be the answer given its sophistication and how long it could take to train and ultimately use. ""Our air defense systems are so complex, we need to make certain that we work with partners and pull together an air defense system that they can put together to defend Kyiv, to defend their infrastructure,"" he said. More broadly, McCaul and Turner said that starting in January, their committees will launch investigations into the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan. Republicans could also scrutinize Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' handling of the southern border and the controversial contents of a laptop that Republicans say was owned by Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden's son. ""One thing that’s going to be very, very positive about this Congress is we’re going to get back to the committees working again,"" Turner said. McCaul also expressed confidence that McCarthy will have the votes to become speaker in the next Congress despite public criticism from several hard-right lawmakers. McCarthy will need 218 votes on the House floor on Jan. 3 to be speaker. At least four Republicans in the likely 222-seat majority have vowed to oppose him -- complicating his path to winning the gavel in the first round of voting. The entire House will continue voting for a speaker until a candidate wins a majority. Lawmakers could nominate another compromise candidate if McCarthy fails to secure enough support. ""Do you think he has the votes?"" Raddatz asked. ""Kevin has worked harder than any other candidate for speaker I've seen. I think he's got the majority of our conference,"" McCaul said. ""And the fact is, what's the alternative here?""",16
2022-11-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/congress-lame-duck-gay-marriage-bill-debt-limit/story?id=94098268,What Congress is and isn't likely to do in the lame duck session,"Lawmakers return to Washington after Thanksgiving break with a long agenda and just weeks until a new Congress begins. Come Jan. 3, Republicans will run the House, ending two years of total Democratic control of the federal government. Already, GOP members are jockeying for new leadership positions and turning their attention toward how they will mount a response to the Biden agenda. But partisan preparation aside, the next few weeks are going to require some across the aisle cooperation if Congress is to get anything done in what is known as the lame duck between the election and the end of the current term. There is a laundry list of must-pass agenda items hanging in the balance. Among them: funding the government and passing a massive military spending bill. Democrats, meanwhile, will look to maximize their final days unchecked by GOP blockades. Democrats are expected to seal a win later this week by finally passing federal legislation that would enshrine into law protections for same-sex and interracial marriages. While procedural votes still remain, the legislation cleared a key test vote in the Senate just before Thanksgiving, with 12 Republicans joining all Democrats in the chamber to prevent a filibuster. ""Let me be clear: Passing the Respect for Marriage Act is not a matter of 'if' but only of 'when,'"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said after that successful vote. Approving the legislation would be a victory for Democrats who have been seeking to codify same-sex marriage -- currently legalized by the Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges -- since the high court overturned the right to an abortion earlier this year, with Justice Clarence Thomas suggesting in a separate opinion that Obergefell should also be reversed. While the Senate's marriage bill will need to return to the House once passed, a previous version cleared the House with the support of 47 Republicans. Democrats also hope to take up legislation later this month that aims to clarify the role, as spelled out in the Electoral Count Act (ECA) of 1887, that the vice president plays in certifying election results. The new legislation is intended to head off arguments like those made by former President Donald Trump around Jan. 6, 2021: that the vice president holds the power to unilaterally reject electors presented by the states. The legislation would instead define the vice president's role in certification as purely ceremonial. ECA reform comes after months of behind-the-scenes bipartisan coalition building and has more than the requisite 10 Senate Republican co-sponsors, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But it's still not clear if or when the Senate will take it up. ""We're working on it. We want to get it done,"" Schumer said Monday when asked about the timing of a potential vote. Other priorities are likely to fall on the cutting room floor as the clock ticks down. Some Democrats had hoped to pass some sort of immigration reform to secure a pathway to citizenship for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, whose fate currently awaits a court ruling. But there's little appetite for such a measure from Republicans and at least 10 would be needed to move any proposal in the limited remaining time. A group of Democrats are also angling to reinstate their popular, pandemic-era child tax credit. Success on that front is also unlikely. Any legislation that fails to make it to the finish line come the installment of the new Congress, in January, must return to square one with the next group of lawmakers. While Democrats will look to make the most of their remaining weeks in control of both chambers of Congress, House Republicans will spend much of that time trying to figure out who will be at the helm come Jan. 3. Current House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is eying the speaker's gavel, but it remains to be seen if he'll have the votes he needs to secure it. Earlier this month, he won his party's nomination during a closed-door election. But it was far from unanimous support among his own party -- which will control at most 222 seats in the next House -- and to clench the speakership, McCarthy will need 218 votes, which means he can avoid few defections. So far, five House Republicans have said they are hard ""no"" votes for McCarthy. Meanwhile, House Democrats will elect a new, history-making generation of leaders this week during elections on Wednesday and Thursday, following Speaker Nancy Pelosi's pre-Thanksgiving announcement of her intention to step away from party leadership. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York is largely expected to ascend to Pelosi's post. Jeffries won't have to scrap for votes; he is expected to take over for Pelosi with the overwhelming -- if not unanimous -- support of his caucus, putting the 52-year-old on track to be the first Black lawmaker to lead a party in Congress. It will also be the first time in 20 years that Pelosi hasn't been in that role. The whip will be a woman -- Katherine Clark of Massachusetts -- and the No. 3, Pete Aguilar, will become the highest-ranking Latino in Congress; the Californian rose to prominence from his perch on the high-profile Jan. 6 committee. Republican leadership in the Senate has already been decided, with members meeting behind closed doors last week and overwhelmingly selecting McConnell to remain at the party helm, despite facing his first challenge for the position in 15 years. Rick Scott of Florida, the outgoing head of Senate Republicans' campaign arm, had 10 supporters back his bid to replace McConnell. Senate Democrats are expected to hold their leadership elections later this month, likely after the Dec. 6 Georgia runoff election. Schumer is largely expected to remain atop the party. One thing lawmakers must do in the coming weeks of the lame-duck session is fund the government. Current funding runs out on Dec. 16. Democrats want to try to pass a year-long funding package composed of 12 major bills rolled into one. But there's yet to be an agreement on a top-line figure for that massive package, slowing negotiations. A huge sticking point in those discussions has been a request from the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with $38 billion in additional funding -- the latest in a series of such aid -- to assist the country in its war against Russia. All along, funding for Ukraine has had strong bipartisan support. But some Republicans have recently signaled that the party would not back additional funding during the lame-duck without guarantees of what they called transparency and accountability. McCarthy has said his conference would not support writing a ""blank check"" for Ukraine if they captured the majority. He later walked back his comments, saying he is supportive of Ukraine. Reps. Michael McCaul and Mike Turner said on ""This Week"" on Sunday that the incoming House Republican majority will support Ukraine, downplaying critics inside the GOP like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. There are a few paths forward to avert an immediate shutdown. Among them is a short-term funding bill to punt the problem slightly down the road, giving lawmakers more time to make a deal. Some Republicans favor this option, figuring they'll have more negotiation power in the House come Jan. 3. It's not yet clear how Congress will maneuver through this and, before they do, senators are also set to wrangle a must-pass military appropriations bill: the National Defense Authorization Act. That must-pass legislation has cleared the chamber every year for 50 years, and this Congress is behind schedule. The federal debt limit, which allows the government to borrow money in order to pay for spending required by Congress, will need to be raised sometime next year. But previous increases of the debt limit -- as under President Barack Obama and a Republican Congress -- became politically poisonous battles. Some Democrats in this Congress want to go ahead and deal with it now, before GOP cooperation is required in the new year. Some House Republicans, meanwhile, have indicated they will use a deal over raising the debt limit to extract cuts to government spending, such as on social programs. But hiking the limit without GOP support would require use of a cumbersome fast-track budget process known as reconciliation. The process eats up an incredible amount of floor time, all but wiping Democrats' chances of using their remaining weeks in control to tackle other priorities. While Democratic leadership has signaled interest in raising the debt limit before turning the House gavel over to Republicans, it does not seem likely to happen this Congress.

2022-11-29,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-faces-fresh-tests-influence-2023-note/story?id=94098164,Biden faces fresh tests of influence before 2023: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein Between what has to get done and what the president would like to get done, the Biden White House is looking to squeeze all it can out of the waning days of united Democratic control of Congress. And what happens before 2023 begins could have significant implications for 2024 -- all while the question of President Joe Biden's own reelection candidacy remains officially unanswered. The lame-duck wish list is broad and impactful. There's government spending, defense authorization and perhaps dealing with the debt ceiling while Democrats can on their own; efforts to reform the Electoral Count Act and protect same-sex marriage; billions for COVID-19 relief and for Ukraine; a longshot effort to ban assault weapons that the president wants to pursue, plus a push to solidify legal status for the young immigrants known as ""Dreamers""; and now a new congressional effort to avert a rail strike that could hit ahead of the holidays. One upshot for Democrats from their stronger-than-expected midterms has been the quieting of chatter about the president having to worry about major primary opponents in two years. Main movements have been for the sidelines, with California Gov. Gavin Newsom telling Politico that he is pledging support for Biden's reelection, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker echoing that sentiment to The New York Times. Still, some indications of Biden's intentions -- and how clear his path to the nomination might be -- could come out of the Democratic National Committee's deliberations this week on a primary calendar for 2024. The final weeks of the year will bring an end to both a short era of full Democratic control in Washington and a longer era of House Democratic leadership under Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. The Biden era will continue for at least two years -- and possibly four beyond that. But what it looks like could be shaped by how this post-election stretch plays out. The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema The final and official tabulations of the 2022 midterms are nearing the finish line despite election certification questions lingering in counties in at least two battleground states. As of Monday, Arizona's Cochise County and Luzerne County in Pennsylvania had both failed to certify the results of this year's elections. In GOP-leaning Cochise County, election officials could face legal action from Arizona's secretary of state after voting on Monday to delay certification of the Nov. 8 election until Friday, Dec. 2. The 2-1 vote to prolong the process was made along party lines, with the Republican majority prevailing, and ignores the state's election certification deadline which required Cochise to certify the results by Monday. According to Arizona state law, the secretary of state -- who in this case is Democratic Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs -- is required to certify statewide elections on Dec. 5, which sets up a potentially tense standoff between state and county leaders in the coming days. The board of elections in Pennsylvania's Luzerne County is also facing the possibility of legal action after failing to certify the county's election results. As reported by ABC affiliate WNEP, two Republican members voted against certifying, two Democrats voted to certify and one Democratic election board member abstained, though he later said he will vote to certify at the next opportunity. According to a report from The Times Leader, those who voted against certification cited concerns over Election Day issues with paper ballots. In Arizona, meanwhile, those who objected had issues with machine certification -- though no evidence of voter disenfranchisement has emerged. The Times Leader reported that the Luzerne County elections board is going to meet again on Wednesday for another certification vote. The TIP with Oren Oppenheim ABC News has reported projections in most of this year's midterm elections in the House, but there's still one outstanding race: the matchup in California's 13th District. As of this writing, with 96% of the expected vote reporting, Republican John Duarte leads with 50.2% of the expected vote, while Democratic candidate Adam Gray follows with 49.8%. Only about 600 votes separate them. Duarte is a farmer and businessman, while Gray is a California State Assembly member. While the winner won't determine control of the House, which will be led by Republicans come January, an additional seat in their slim majority could give them a bit more flexibility on votes. What's the timeline for when this race could be projected? According to the California secretary of state's website, ""it typically takes weeks for counties to process and count all of the ballots. Elections officials have approximately one month to complete their extensive tallying, auditing, and certification work (known as the official canvass)."" Counties report results by Dec. 9 and the secretary of state certifies results by Dec. 16. A recount could happen, too -- if someone asks for one, as there are no automatic recounts in California. Any voter can request a recount ""within five days beginning on the 31st day after a statewide election, or within five days following completion of any post canvass risk-limiting audit,"" per the California secretary of state's website. The requester pays for the recount and is refunded if the recount changes the result of the election to a victory for them. Gray registered a recount fund committee with the Federal Election Commission on Nov. 14. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

2022-11-30,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gops-white-supremacist-problems-extend-trump-note/story?id=94155743,GOP's white supremacist problems extend beyond Trump: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein It's far from the first time that Republicans have had to awkwardly explain or outright condemn the actions of former President Donald Trump. And it's not likely to be the last time that they're forced to confront associations between white supremacists and members of their own party. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy was incorrect in asserting to the press on Tuesday that Trump condemned Nick Fuentes after having dinner with him. He was perhaps overly credulous in saying he believes the former president's claim not to have known who Fuentes is. But McCarthy's own condemnation of one of Trump's dinner companions -- ""I don't think anybody should be spending any time with Nick Fuentes"" -- is undercut by his pledge to restore committee assignments to two of his members who have done just that. As ABC News' Will Steakin reports, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., was the keynote speaker at Fuentes' own event in February in Florida -- where attendees applauded Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., was at a similar gathering a year earlier and was part of a video that aired at this year's America First Political Action Conference. ""There's no place in our party for any of this,"" McCarthy said after Greene and Gosar's attendance at the Fuentes events were revealed. (The two subsequently distanced themselves from Fuentes.) But there is a place in McCarthy's conference for both of them. McCarthy has not revisited his promise to place Greene and Gosar back on committees from which Democrats and some other Republicans removed them; and McCarthy is unlikely to cut them off so long as he needs their votes to become House speaker in January. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell was sharper than McCarthy in his condemnation of Trump. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, he also added a prediction that might be more wishful thinking than prognostication: ""Anyone meeting with people advocating that point of view, in my judgment, are highly unlikely to ever be elected president of the United States."" The RUNDOWN with Alisa Wiersema The House is expected to take up legislation as soon as Wednesday to avert a potential nationwide rail strike that experts say would increase inflation while costing the economy $2 billion per day. Joe Biden's support for the bill creates difficult political optics for a president who made backing unions a cornerstone policy of his administration, but the pursuit of the legislative effort to force the rail workers into a deal is opening the door to surprising crossovers in Congress. ""We will have a bill on the floor,"" outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday after a meeting between the top four congressional leaders and the president at the White House. ""I think it will pass, but it's unfortunate that this is how we're running our economy today,"" McCarthy told reporters. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said his chamber would follow suit with getting the bill on the floor, and that he and McConnell ""agreed we'd try to get it done ASAP."" It is unclear whether the bill has enough support to pass in either chamber; and as congressional leadership appears to side with the option backed by the president, some Republican lawmakers are unexpectedly echoing positions made by some progressives. ""The railways & workers should go back & negotiate a deal that the workers, not just the union bosses, will accept. But if Congress is forced to do it, I will not vote to impose a deal that doesn't have the support of the rail workers,"" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio wrote in a tweet. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz similarly lashed out at the Biden administration while saying he believes ""the demands of the workers seem very reasonable."" Republicans like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia also expressed support for the issues raised by rail workers in the negotiations -- including demands regarding scheduling and sick leave -- while questioning why Congress needed to be involved. ""It's obvious that the Biden administration put this off till after the election and I think some of the railroad workers that I've heard from have a good point about the sick leave issues, and I don't know why we should get involved. That's my initial reaction,"" Collins told ABC News' Allison Pecorin. The TIP with Oren Oppenheim A prolific defier of the election results in Arizona has been vowing action to contest her own race -- but has yet to take concrete steps. Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who is projected to lose against Democrat Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state, said in a video posted on social media on Monday night that she has been preparing a formal legal challenge against the results. Lake never conceded to Hobbs. ""I'm working with a team of patriotic, talented lawyers on a legal case ... My team and I realize how important this case is and what is at stake,"" Lake said in the video. ""We will file this case in accordance with Arizona state law. And you'll want to stay tuned for this one, trust me."" But Lake has not announced any specific filings or actions as of yet, even as legal action around the midterm election heats up elsewhere in the state. After officials in the state's Cochise County voted on Monday to delay certifying election results, in defiance of the state's deadline, Hobbs and outside groups filed suit. Experts told ABC News that they believe the likely outcome is for the courts to compel Cochise County to accept the result, and that the county has not shown concerns related to the vote in their own county but rather in larger Maricopa County, which has certified its results.

2022-11-30,https://abcnews.go.com/International/paul-whelans-family-worried-whereabouts-after-communication-stops/story?id=94210388,"Family of Paul Whelan, former Marine held in Russia, worried after communication cut off","The family of Paul Whelan, the American former Marine held hostage by Russia, say they are worried for his safety after he dropped out of contact at the prison camp where is being held last week. Whelan’s brother, David Whelan, on Tuesday said camp authorities had claimed they had abruptly moved Whelan to a prison hospital without explanation. In a statement, he said the family fear Whelan could have suffered a sudden medical emergency or that the prison authorities might be lying to conceal that Whelan was now in solitary confinement or otherwise held and not allowed to communicate. Paul Whelan has spent nearly four years in detention since he was seized in 2018 by Russia’s domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, while visiting Moscow for a friend’s wedding. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges but the United States and his family say were fabricated in order to take him as a political bargaining chip. Whelan has been held in at Correctional Colony 17 -- a prison camp in the Mordovia region around 300 miles from Moscow -- for more than two years. His family began sounding the alarm on Monday after Whelan missed scheduled calls with his parents and the U.S. embassy last week. “We're concerned that he may have either some emergency medical issue that is not being disclosed or that he is in fact still at IK-17 and has been placed in solitary as retaliation for something,” David Whelan said in an email statement. David Whelan said the prison camp claims his brother was moved to the prison hospital on Nov. 17 but Whelan had not complained of any medical issue to U.S. embassy staff that visited him a day earlier or mentioned any move to his parents in a call on Nov. 23. “Paul was not complaining of any health conditions that required hospitalization, so has there been an emergency? He appeared healthy and well to the Embassy staff,” David Whelan wrote. “If Paul's at the prison hospital, why is he being prohibited from making phone calls that every prisoner is allowed to make? Is he unable to make calls? Or is he really still at IK-17 but he's been put in solitary and the prison is hiding that fact,” he wrote. He said the prison had previously sent Whelan to the hospital against his will, sometimes as a punishment. Previously, however, Whelan noted that his brother had always told them when he was being sent to the hospital, David Whelan said. Whelan’s Russian lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, told ABC News that Whelan had a medical check up two weeks ago which suggested no issues. Zherebenkov said there were two explanations why Whelan was not making his calls -- either there are technical issues or he was being punished. Asked by ABC News on Tuesday, the spokesman for the White House National Security Council, John Kirby, said it was the first he had heard Whelan had missed a call but he expressed deep concern for Whelan’s conditions. Whelan is able to speak most weeks to his parents in the U.S. via video call from the prison, according to his family, and also has scheduled calls to the embassy. “They have a call scheduled with him on Thursdays and he failed to make it last week. It's incredibly unusual for Paul to miss trying to call home on a holiday like Thanksgiving,” David Whelan said. He said he hoped the U.S. embassy would find out Whelan’s condition. “Is his phone card out of funds? Is he in solitary? Has he been moved to a hospital camp again without his request? Transport somewhere always comes to mind because prisoner transfers always seem to happen on a Friday. And, if it's punitive, what is the prison retaliating for?"" The U.S. is seeking to negotiate Whelan’s release as well as the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner, who has been in Russian detention since February and who American officials also believe was taken by the Kremlin as a political bargaining chip. Griner arrived earlier this month at a nearby prison camp in Mordovia after she was sentenced to nine years on drug smuggling charges, the U.S. says were trumped up. Russia has signaled it wants to trade Whelan and Griner in a prisoner exchange for Russians imprisoned in the U.S., but efforts to reach a deal have stalled. The Biden administration this summer said it was prepared to trade Viktor Bout, the notorious arms trafficker who is serving a 25-year prison sentence on weapons smuggling charges and is widely suspected to have ties to Russian intelligence. But Russia has so far rejected the offer, despite publicly suggesting for years Bout was a top candidate for any swap. Russia’s deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov earlier this month said he hoped the prospect of trading Bout was “getting stronger” but that the two sides were “yet to arrive at a common denominator.” He confirmed the U.S. and Russia were negotiating on the issue via a “special channel” and that Bout was among those being discussed. A potential sticking point is Moscow may be their unwillingness to trade two Americans for one Russian citizen, even one of Bout’s importance. In new comments on Tuesday, Ryabkov said “there is always a chance” that a deal might be reached soon, but gave little suggestion one was close. “Regretfully, we have seen a number of situations where we thought a decision would be made soon. That did not happen,” Ryabkov told reporters. Ryabkov also criticized the U.S. for speaking publicly about the negotiations, accusing it of “going over the top by using megaphone diplomacy."" The acting U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Elizabeth Rood, in an interview with Russian state media this week confirmed that the U.S. was continuing to discuss Griner and Whelan through special channels. “We have already said, the United States has submitted a serious proposal for consideration. We finalized this proposal and offered alternatives. Unfortunately, the Russian Federation has not yet received a serious response to these proposals,” she told RIA Novosti.",2
2022-12-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-frances-macron-state-dinner/story?id=94226611,Biden 'prepared' to talk with Putin if serious about ending war in Ukraine,"President Joe Biden said Thursday he's open to talking with Russian President Vladimir Putin about bringing an end to the war in Ukraine but only if the Russian leader is serious about peace negotiations. ""The fact of the matter is I have no immediate plans to contact Mr. Putin,"" Biden told reporters as he stood alongside French President Emmanuel Macron at a joint news conference. ""I'm prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he's looking for a way to end the war,"" Biden said. ""He hasn't done that yet. If that's the case, in consultation with my French and my NATO friends, I'll be happy to sit down with Putin to see what he wants, has in mind. He hasn't done that yet."" Biden and Macron pledged to work together to hold Russia accountable and mitigate the war's impact on the rest of the world. ""We'll continue the strong support for the people of Ukraine as they defend their homes and families and their sovereignty and territorial integrity against Russian aggression, which has been incredibly brutal,"" Biden said. ""I knew Russia was, but didn't anticipate it to be as brutal as it was."" Macron told reporters the U.S. and France ""clearly condemn"" Russia's ""war crimes."" Speaking to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Macron said he believes negotiation is still ""possible"" with Putin to end Russia's invasion and that he was going to speak to Putin ""in the coming days."" Macron previously held a call with Putin in March, but said there was nothing reassuring about the conversation. ""A good peace is not a peace which will be imposed to the Ukrainians by others, No. 1,"" Macron told Stephanopoulos, adding, ""A good peace is not a peace which will not be accepted on the mid-to-long run by one of the two parties."" Macron's state visit this week is the first of the Biden administration, and will culminate with a dinner on the South Lawn Thursday night in a candlelit pavilion. ""The design of this dinner was inspired by the shared colors of our flags -- red, white and blue -- and our common values: liberty and democracy, equality and fellowship,"" Jill Biden said Wednesday as she previewed the event. ""These form the bedrock upon which our enduring friendship was built."" Ahead of the state dinner, the two families dined in Washington on Wednesday night before a formal meeting at the White House on Thursday morning. The diplomatic tradition, put on hold for the past several years due to COVID-19, highlights the crucial partnership between the U.S. and France, officials said. Along with Ukraine, Biden and Macron discussed the challenges posed by China, how to strengthen African economies and continuing support for the people of Iran and calling for accountability for those committing human rights abuses. They also ""outlined a shared vision to strengthen security and increase prosperity worldwide, combat climate change, build greater resilience to its effects, and advance democratic values,"" according to a joint statement following their closed-door meeting in the Oval Office. ""My administration's built our foreign policy around the strength of our alliances, and France is the very heart of that commitment,"" Biden said at the joint press conference. Still, the bilateral relationship has also been fraught at times, including last year when Australia canceled a massive, multibillion-dollar submarine deal with France in exchange for a partnership with the U.S and the U.K. More recently, French officials and other European leaders have raised concerns about climate and energy provisions included in the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act, specifically the tax subsidies for American-made technologies related to renewable energy, like components for electric vehicles. European Union leaders have said the subsidies may break the rules of the World Trade Organization and will have negative side effects for their economies. Pressed by a reporter on the issue, Biden said Thursday he makes ""no apologies"" for the Inflation Reduction Act but acknowledged there are changes they can make to ensure European companies can participate. ""I never intended to exclude folks who were cooperating with us,"" Biden said. ""That was not the intention."" Macron said the U.S. and France ""need to resynchronize"" on the issue of trade but both countries intend to create a clean energy future. ""We want to succeed together, not one against the other,"" Macron said. Macron, France's president since 2017, was also the first foreign leader that then-President Donald Trump invited for a state visit. The two at first had a cordial relationship that turned sour over policy differences on issues like the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. Macron began his U.S. visit on Tuesday by joining Vice President Harris at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., where they vowed to cooperate on space and in other realms. On Friday, Macron will travel to New Orleans to meet with state leaders and the Francophone community, participate in a cultural event, meet with local companies involved in the transition to renewable energy and promote French language instruction in under-served communities in Louisiana, French officials said.

2022-12-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/hosting-thousands-war-refugees-lviv-preps-winter-electricity/story?id=94205140,"Hosting thousands of war refugees, Lviv preps for winter without electricity and heating","LVIV, Ukraine -- Officials have warned that the city of Lviv, home to over 150,000 internally displaced people, could face a winter without power as they anticipate another surge in refugee numbers. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, told ABC News that the city, near the western border with Poland, is preparing to stay completely without power supply and natural gas supply because of Russian missile attacks which have devastated Ukrainian infrastructure in recent weeks. To cope with the coming winter, a major construction project is now underway in the city in order to facilitate a new wave of people fleeing from regions badly targeted by Russian missile strikes which involves both renovating existing modular houses and building new ones. Amongst the current refugee population, there is a mix of fear ahead of the expected drop in temperatures as well as overall hope in Ukraine’s long-term ability to secure a victory in the war. “We hope that we will move to a different location as it becomes cold in here,” Ksenia, a 17-year-old from New York -- a town in Donetsk region situated near the current frontline -- told ABC News. She has been living in Lviv since this summer, when warmer temperatures did not pose such a challenge, with her mother, grandmother, brother and two cats. Maria, 45, from Zaporizhzhia, has tried to retain her optimism. Asked by ABC News about her family’s plans for the future, she said: “Only victory and a way back home.” Both Maria’s brother and son are currently serving in the Ukrainian army and her husband, also a military serviceman, has been missing since 2015. Maria’s mother, Olga says, the conditions were different in the summer when they just moved into a temporary house designed for the families of four people. Due to the building's thin walls, it can get very wet inside the home -- the walls, doors and even their beds are covered with condensation and, sometimes, even with fungus. These modular houses were a result of an urgent decision made in the early stages of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Mayor Sadovyi, five million people have moved through the city since late February and there were days when upwards of two million refugees were staying in Lviv at once. “We were forced to come up with any decision to give these people an opportunity to sleep somewhere,” he said. Now he plans to buy more powerful diesel generators to guarantee the city's residents heating, even without complete electricity. “Every medical facility and several boarding schools are supposed to have a generator as an alternative energy source, and a solid fuel boiler as a second heating source,” Sadovyi said. A separate complex for young mothers and pregnant women was built in Lviv in about three months earlier this year -- a totally different type of accommodation that is resistant to low temperatures, is more comfortable and can house over 100 people at once. Lilia Kilchytska, head of a charity called ""Unbroken Mothers"", says that IDPs from Luhansk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and other partially occupied regions live there at the moment. To provide electricity and heating for the children and their mothers, the center has been granted a power generator by an international charity organization. It has already saved the families during the several blackouts caused by the Russian missile strikes. A large number of refugees have lost their homes because of the war. Besides temporary shelters placed at dormitories, malls, theaters, schools, hospitals and other social infrastructure facilities, the administration is actively searching for long-term housing projects for IDPs. Officials are currently considering buying, building or renovating enough square meters for the forced newcomers to the region but money is scarce, and authorities have said they require more donations and financial support if they are going to scale up their efforts. At the moment, there are only 1,733 places for refugees to stay in these renovated buildings in Lviv over the upcoming winter. That number, according to the authorities, pales in comparison to the potential flood of people who may leave their homes in other parts of Ukraine as Russian strikes continue this winter.",22

2022-12-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/lawmaker-sanctioned-russian-agent-faces-new-charges-alleged/story?id=94701329,Lawmaker sanctioned as Russian agent faces new charges over alleged purchase of condos in Beverly Hills,"A sanctioned Ukrainian politician who U.S. authorities said has ties to Russian intelligence services was hit with new criminal charges Wednesday over his alleged purchase of two condominiums in Beverly Hills, California. The charges were announced by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and the Justice Department's KleptoCapture task force against Andrii Derkach, a member of Ukraine's parliament who has been labeled by the United States as a Russian agent and who allegedly sought to influence the 2020 presidential election by meeting with and funneling disinformation about Joe Biden to Rudy Giuliani. Derkach is charged in a seven-count indictment with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, bank fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and four counts of money laundering. Derkach allegedly purchased the two California properties in violation of new U.S. sanctions imposed earlier this year and concealed his interest in the transactions. ""The conduct of this Kremlin asset, who was sanctioned for trying to poison our democracy, has shown he is ready, willing, and capable of exploiting banking system in order to advance his illicit goals. The U.S. will not be a safe haven where criminals, oligarchs or sanctioned entities can hide their ill-gotten gains or influence our elections,"" said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace in a statement announcing the charges. Derkach, who remains at large, was sanctioned for his alleged efforts to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election on behalf of the Russian intelligence services while prosecutors said he simultaneously conspired to fraudulently benefit from a comfortable life in the U.S. ""Attempting to enjoy the safety, security, and freedoms of an open society, while secretly working to undermine that very society, is a hypocrisy that runs through every sanctions charge announced by the Task Force. It is a particularly egregious hypocrisy in the case of Andrii Derkach – sanctioned for attempts to undermine American democracy, while corruptly seeking to benefit from its protections,"" said KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. Derkach, a member of a pro-Russian political party, allegedly schemed to purchase and maintain two luxury condominiums in Beverly Hills while concealing his interest in the transactions from U.S. financial institutions, according to the complaint. He faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted. Treasury officials previously said Derkach controlled two websites that helped spread disinformation about U.S. officials. Giuliani traveled to Ukraine in 2019 with OAN news anchor Chanel Rion where the two met with Derkach for an interview and took documents from him. Federal prosecutors in New York investigated Giuliani's activities in Ukraine but decided earlier this year not to file criminal charges.",0
2022-12-08,https://abcnews.go.com/International/viktor-bout-convicted-arms-dealer-held-us-prison/story?id=86543907,"Who is Viktor Bout, the convicted Russian arms dealer swapped for Brittney Griner?","Shortly after U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency officers arrested him in a hotel in Thailand in 2008, Viktor Bout turned to one of the agents escorting him and said, ""I guess the game is over."" Bout was arguably the world's best-known illegal arms trafficker and his capture was the end of a nearly decadelong hunt by the U.S. to stop him. Now, 14 years since his arrest and jailing, the U.S. has exchanged Bout for WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was detained in Russia earlier this year. News first broke about a potential prisoner swap involving an exchange of Bout for Griner and American Paul Wheelan who were both detained in Russia in July. (CNN was first to report this plan.) Bout, 55, emerged as a kingpin in the global illegal arms trade during the 1990s, accused of fueling some of the world's bloodiest conflicts, particularly in Africa. Sourcing weapons from the huge stockpiles of the collapsed Soviet Union, the Russian used a fleet of Soviet-built transport aircraft to supply vast quantities of arms, often circumventing international embargoes. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the former Soviet military officer ""was able to acquire surplus or obsolete airplanes which he used to deliver arms and ammunition,"" including large-scale military machinery and extensive stores of weapons, to any location in the world. ""Viktor Bout has been international arms trafficking enemy number one for many years, arming some of the most violent conflicts around the globe,"" said Preet Bharara, at the time the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. ""He was finally brought to justice in an American court for agreeing to provide a staggering number of military-grade weapons to an avowed terrorist organization committed to killing Americans."" Bout supplied arms to former President Charles Taylor of Liberia, to rebels in Sierra Leone and has brokered or sold weapons that fueled conflicts in Afghanistan, Angola, Congo, Rwanda and Sudan. ""There's a lot of armed traffickers out there,"" said Rob Zachariasiewicz, a now-retired DEA agent who helped lead the team that arrested Bout in Thailand. ""The difference with Mr. Bout was he owned his own fleet of private aircraft. People can argue: Was he the biggest arms trafficker? I look at him as one of the biggest arms transporters."" Bout eventually came to be seen as the world's biggest weapons smuggler. The media dubbed him the ""Merchant of Death"" and in 2006, he inspired the movie ""Lord of War,"" which starred Nicholas Cage. The U.S. government began trying to disrupt Bout's operations at the end of the 1990s by sanctioning his companies. He was finally captured in a DEA sting. Bout agreed to supply anti-aircraft missiles to undercover DEA operatives posing as members of the Columbian militant group, the FARC, that they claimed would be used against American forces. The DEA seized Bout during a meeting to discuss the phony deal in a hotel in Thailand. Bout was extradited to the U.S. on narco-terrorism charges and in 2011 was convicted of conspiring to kill Americans, to supply anti-aircraft missiles and of aiding a terrorist organization. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Bout was serving his sentence in Illinois following a conspiracy conviction in New York. From the moment of Bout's arrest, Russia began substantial efforts to free him, first trying to block his extradition and later campaigning for his release. ""He clearly was very important. And it's my understanding that President [Vladimir] Putin himself was involved in trying to get him home,"" said Zachariasiewicz, the former DEA agent. U.S. officials feared Moscow tried to corrupt Thai authorities to prevent Bout's extradition -- at one point, Zachariasiewicz learned that a Thai court had even mysteriously issued an arrest warrant for him, preventing him from traveling to the country. Zachariasiewicz said Bout later told him the warrant was ""just business."" Russia's determination to free Bout has raised questions. Both U.S. officials involved in Bout's capture and independent researchers have long believed Bout has links to the Russian security services. Some point to his education at the Military Institute of Foreign Languages, in Moscow, reputed as a training ground for spies. Bout himself denies the claims as a smear tactic. He also rejects the charges against him, saying he is the victim of a DEA entrapment plot. But Russia previously made clear it was interested in an exchange for Bout. Zachariasiewicz said he believes Russia now wants Bout back mainly to make a political statement, given his intelligence value is likely long since exhausted. But he opposes trading the man he helped arrest, saying it risks encouraging hostile governments to take more Americans hostage. But Trevor Reed, the former U.S. Marine who was freed from Russian detention in a prisoner swap in May, has called for the Biden administration to make the trade. ""Viktor Bout has already been in prison for 15 years,"" Reed told ABC in May after his release. ""He's no longer a threat."" Reed said he disagreed that freeing Bout would encourage more hostage-takings, saying governments like Russia are seizing Americans regardless. Supporters of trading Bout have pointed out the judge who jailed Bout has said she believes the sentence, which was dictated by mandatory sentencing rules, was excessive. Reed notes Bout could potentially be up for release in five years anyway. ""To leave Americans there and say, 'Well, we're not gonna negotiate. We're not gonna do exchanges with this government,' that's just completely pointless because you change nothing there. They're still gonna kidnap Americans,"" said Reed. ""I don't care if it's 100 Victor Bouts. They have to get our guys out,"" he said.",2
2022-12-08,https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-brittney-griners-detention-russia-us-vows-secure/story?id=87925739,Timeline of Brittney Griner's detention in Russia as US secures her release,"WNBA star Brittney Griner was released this week in a prisoner exchange with Russia, where she has been detained since Feb. 17 and was sentenced to nine years in Russia prison after she was found guilty of drug charges. The U.S. classified Griner as ""wrongfully detained"" in May and has been working for months to secure her freedom. In an agreement with the U.S., Russia swapped Griner for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Here's a look back at Griner's trial and major developments in her case: Feb. 17 Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native and professional basketball player for the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, is detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki as she returns to Russia to play during the WNBA's off-season. She is accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. Feb. 24 Russia invades Ukraine, unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases. March 16 After imposing a wave of new sanctions against Russia, President Joe Biden labels Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" during a press conference at the White House amid a State Department review of whether the U.S. considers Russia's attacks on Ukrainian civilians a war crime. March 17 Concerns in the U.S. over the well-being of Brittney Griner grow as Russia extends the pre-trial detention of the WNBA star until May 19. The extension of Griner's detention comes during a volatile time for U.S.-Russian relations as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates attacks on Ukraine. March 18 The U.S. State Department issues a statement demanding access to Griner. ""We are closely engaged on this case and in frequent contact with Brittney Griner's legal team. We insist the Russian government provide consular access to all U.S. citizen detainees in Russia, including those in pre-trial detention, as Brittney Griner is,"" it says. March 23 Griner meets with U.S. officials for the first time since being held in pre-trial detention in Russia for over a month. ""The consular officer who visited with Brittney Griner was able to verify that she is doing as well as can be expected under these very difficult circumstances,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price tells reporters. Griner's meeting comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken announces that the State Department has made a formal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. ""Based on information currently available, the U.S. government assesses that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Our assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources,"" Blinken said in a statement. April 27 Calls to free Griner and other Americans detained in Russia escalate following the release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed on April 27, who was freed from a Russian prison as part of a prisoner exchange. Former Marine Paul Whelan has also been detained in Russia since 2019. May 3 The U.S. State Department announces that the U.S. government has classified Griner's case as ""wrongfully detained"" in Russia. With this classification, the U.S. becomes more involved in negotiating for her freedom as opposed to waiting for her case to play out in the Russian legal system. May 6 The WNBA honors Griner with a floor decal bearing her initials and jersey number (42) on the sideline of all 12 WNBA teams as the 2022 season kicked off. May 13 Russia extends Griner's pre-trial detention until June 18 as the U.S. works to secure her release. May 25 Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, speaks with ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts about her wife's detention and urges President Joe Biden to do everything he can to bring her home. Cherelle Griner says that her wife texted her when she was first taken into custody, but Brittney's phone is taken soon after. She says she is ""grateful"" for a call from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but adds that she would also like to also speak with Biden. ""I just keep hearing that, you know, he has the power. She's a political pawn,"" she said. ""So if they're holding her because they want you to do something, then I want you to do it."" June 8 As the Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors prepare to face off in the 2022 NBA finals, players call attention to Griner's case. ""She needs to be home, she needs to be safe, she needs to be with her family,"" Warriors point guard Steph Curry tells ESPN. June 14 A Russian court extends Griner's pre-trial detention for a third time, and says that she will remain in custody until July 2. June 20 Cherelle Griner tells The Associated Press that she has lost ""trust"" in the U.S. government after a planned anniversary call between the couple didn't take place because the embassy line wasn't staffed over the weekend. ""I was distraught. I was hurt. I was done, fed up,"" Cherelle Griner said. ""We deeply regret that Brittney Griner was unable to speak with her wife because of a logistical error,"" a State Department spokesperson told ABC News, adding that the call will be rescheduled for a later date. June 27 Griner attends a preliminary hearing as her detention is extended for the fourth time and the first day of her trial is set for July 1. June 30 Friends and family members of Griner gather for a vigil outside the Russian Consulate in New York CityJuly 1 Griner's trial begins in Russia. July 4 Griner personally reaches out to President Biden, urging him to help get her out of Russian custody, in a handwritten letter delivered to the president on the 4th of July. ""As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey, or any accomplishments, I'm terrified I might be here forever,"" Griner wrote to the president. July 5 White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tells reporters during a briefing that Biden read Griner's handwritten letter and her case is a ""top priority"" for the president. July 6 Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris calls Cherelle Griner to ""reassure"" her that they are working to secure her wife's release, the White House announced. July 7 Griner pleads guilty on drug charges, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage unintentionally. She said that she had ""no intention"" of breaking Russian law and packed the cartridges by accident. During the hearing, U.S. officials who attended the trial delivered a response letter to Griner from Biden, the State Department said. July 8 Cherelle Griner speaks out at a press conference, saying that she read the letter Biden wrote to her wife and it brought both of them ""so much joy.""""I believe every word that she said to him, he understood and he sees her as a person,"" Cherelle Griner said. ""And he has not forgotten her, which was her biggest cry in her letter."" July 14 Character witnesses take the stand in Griner's trial as the U.S works to secure her release. July 15 Griner appears for the fourth day of her trial, where her attorney presents a letter from an American doctor giving Griner permission to use cannabis to reduce chronic pain. Griner is expected to testify but her testimony is delayed. July 26 Griner returns to court, where she speaks briefly with ABC News and shares a message for her wife, Cherelle, who recently graduated from law school. ""Good luck on the bar exam,"" Griner said. July 27 Griner testifies in court, saying she did not mean to leave the vape cartridges in her bag, but that she was in a hurry and was stressed after recovering from COVID-19 that month. She adds that she had permission to use medical cannabis and used a certificate to buy it in the U.S. In a sharp reversal, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced later that day that he will hold a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""in the coming days"" to discuss securing Griner and Whelan's freedom. ""We put a substantial proposal on the table weeks ago to facilitate their release,"" he said. July 29 Blinken tells reporters that he had a ""frank and direct conversation"" with Lavrov about a U.S. proposal to exchange convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout in return for Griner and Whelan's freedom. ""I pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner,"" Blinken said. ""I'm not going to characterize his responses and I can't give you an assessment of whether I think things are more or less likely, but it was important that [he] hear directly from me on that."" Aug. 4 Griner is found guilty on drug charges and sentenced to nine years in prison as her trial came to an end. Griner's attorneys, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, told reporters outside of the courthouse in Moscow on Thursday that they plan to file an appeal. Biden slammed Russia in a statement and called on Russia to ""release her immediately."" ""My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible,"" he said. Aug. 14 A senior Russian diplomat confirms that exchange talks between the U.S. and Russia are underway. ""This quite sensitive issue of the swap of convicted Russian and US citizens is being discussed through the channels defined by our presidents. These individuals are, indeed, being discussed,"" Alexander Darchiev, head of the foreign ministry's North America Department, told Russian state news agency TASS. ""The Russian side has long been seeking the release of Viktor Bout. The details should be left to professionals, proceeding from the 'do not harm' principle."" Aug. 15 Griner's attorneys file an appeal for her nine-year prison sentence, according to Blagovolina. Oct. 25 A Russian judge rejected Griner's appeal of her nine-year prison sentence after just a half hour. Griner appeared via video before the appeal was denied, saying, ""I beg that the court takes in all of the stakes that was overlooked in the first court and reassess my sentence here."" ""I want to apologize for this mistake,"" Griner said. ""I did not intend to do this but I understand the charges brought against me. It's been very stressful and traumatic [being away from my family]."" Nov. 9 Griner was transferred to a penal colony to serve out her sentence but her location was initially not known publicly, raising concerns about her well-being. ""My hope is that now that the election is over, that Mr. Putin will be able to discuss with us and be willing to talk more seriously about prisoner exchange. That is my intention,"" Biden told ABC News after Griner was transferred. Nov. 10 Sullivan told reporters that U.S. officials at the American embassy in Moscow are ""on top of Brittney Griner's condition, location and how the Russian government is treating her. She is being held unjustly. She should be released immediately."" Nov. 17 Griner's attorneys shared her location in a statement, saying that the WNBA star was transferred to a penal colony IK-2 in the Russian region of Mordovia. Nov. 18 Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian media that a prisoner exchange with the U.S. may be possible. ""The Americans are showing some external activity. We are working professionally through a special channel designed for this,"" Ryabkov said. ""Viktor Bout is among those who are being discussed and we certainly count on a positive result."" Nov. 28 U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Russia Elizabeth Rood told reporters the WNBA star has not complained about the conditions in the Russian colony. “As far as we understood from communication with her, she is healthy and feels as good as can be expected in her difficult circumstances,” Rood said. Dec. 8 After months of negotiations, the U.S. announced that Griner was released in a prisoner exchange with Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. President Biden, joined by Griner's wife at the White House, told reporters that the road to Griner’s release involved ""painstaking and intense negotiations"" and he thanked those who ""worked tirelessly to secure her release."" ""She's relieved to finally be heading home and the fact remains that she's lost months of her life, experienced a needless trauma,"" Biden said. ""She deserves space, privacy and time with her loved ones to recover and heal from her time being wrongfully detained."" Griner landed in the United Arab Emirates, which helped facilitate the transfer, Biden said. Meanwhile, Biden also vowed to ""never give up"" on securing Whelan's freedom. “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul's case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul's release, we are not giving up. We will never give up,"" he said.

""We never forgot about Brittney. We've not forgotten about Paul Whelan, who has been unjustly detained in Russia for years. This was not a choice of which American to bring home,"" Biden said from the White House. ""Sadly, or totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul's case differently than Brittney's, and while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul's release we are not giving up. We will never give up."" Elizabeth Whelan, Paul's sister, on a Zoom interview from Massachusetts in the afternoon, told ABC News the family had expected Griner might return first. ""We've always known that the Russians were treating Paul separately, and therefore, we always knew that there was a chance that this would happen, that would Brittney would be released first,"" she said. ""We're upset. We want Paul home,"" she added. ""We're angry at Russia for for playing him around like this, for playing all of us around like this, but what we need to do is look forward to the plan to get him home."" Whelan has spent four years in detention since he was seized in 2018 by Russia's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, while visiting Moscow for a friend's wedding. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges but the United States and his family say they were fabricated in order to take him as a political bargaining chip. In a phone interview with CNN on Thursday, Whelan said he was ""greatly disappointed"" to not also be returning home. ""I have to say I am greatly disappointed that more has not been done to secure my release. Especially as the four-year anniversary of my arrest is coming up. I was arrested for a crime that never occurred,"" Whelan said. ""I'm happy that Brittney is going home today and that Trevor went home when he did -- but I don't understand why I'm still sitting here,"" he added. He said he hopes officials will do everything they can to bring him home, ""regardless of the price they may have to pay at this point."" ""My bags are packed. I'm ready to go home. I just need an airplane to come and get me,"" Whelan said. Some Republicans on Capitol Hill were quick to blast the prisoner swap, including House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy. ""This is a gift to Vladimir Putin, and it endangers American lives,"" McCarthy tweeted. ""Leaving Paul Whelan behind for this is unconscionable."" Biden administration officials will remain in close contact with the Whelan family, the president said earlier. ""We'll keep negotiating in good faith for Paul's release. I guarantee that. I say that to the family. I guarantee you. I urge Russia to do the same to ensure that Paul's health and humane treatment are maintained until we are able to bring him home. I don't want any American to sit wrongfully detained one extra day if we can bring that person home,"" he said. Whelan's twin brother, David, released a statement just ahead of Biden's remarks calling the swap for Griner ""the right decision."" ""As the family member of a Russian hostage, I can literally only imagine the joy she will have, being reunited with her loved ones, and in time for the holidays. There is no greater success than for a wrongful detainee to be freed and for them to go home. The Biden Administration made the right decision to bring Ms. Griner home, and to make the deal that was possible, rather than waiting for one that wasn't going to happen,"" he said. He said officials let them know in advance ""that Paul would be left behind,"" unlike in April, when news broke of former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed's return. ""This is the event we wish for so much for our own family,"" the Whelans said in April, and again on Thursday. ""She will be reunited with her family. Brittney is free. And Paul is still a hostage."" A senior Biden administration official told reporters on a background call that another official had spoken ""at length"" with Whelan from prison to talk through the news of Griner's release. ""I want to be very clear: This was not a situation where we had a choice of which American to bring home. It was a choice between bringing home one particular American, Brittney Griner, or bringing home none,"" the official said. Griner will be back in the U.S. within 24 hours, according to officials. ""She's safe. She's on a plane. She's on her way home,"" Biden said alongside Brittney's wife, Cherelle, Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Blinken, in a written statement, praised Griner's release but lamented that Whelan and his family ""continue to suffer needlessly."" ""Despite our ceaseless efforts, the Russian Government has not yet been willing to bring a long overdue end to his wrongful detention. I wholeheartedly wish we could have brought Paul home today on the same plane with Brittney,"" Blinken said. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who for months tried to help negotiate a trade for Griner and Whelan and travelled repeatedly to Moscow for meetings, said his team is thrilled Griner is now free but called for the Biden administration to now make Whelan's return a priority.

""It's really upsetting to me."" On Thursday, the WNBA star was swapped for Bout -- a Russian convicted arms dealer who spend 15 years in U.S. prison -- in an international prisoner exchange. Griner was serving a nine-year sentence in a Russian prison for possession of vaping cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in Russia, before the exchange. Maltz, in 2008, was the special agent in charge of the DEA's special operations division which took down Bout in a sting operation in Thailand. ""DEA was asked to help take this guy down because he was such a national security threat,"" Maltz said. ""We at the DEA were just trying to step up to the plate and do the right thing for national security."" In November 2007, Bout agreed to sell DEA informants posing as FARC rebels in Colombia millions of dollars in weapons, including: 800 surface-to air-missiles; 30,000 AK-47s; 10 million rounds of ammunition; 5 tons of C4 plastic explosives; and ultra light airplanes outfitted with grenade launchers to attack U.S. helicopters in Columbia, according to Maltz. ""Viktor Bout was ready to sell a weapons arsenal that would be the envy of any small country,"" Maltz said. Maltz said he has no issue with bringing home Americans and called this ""a great day for Brittney Griner and for America"" but he said the exchange for Bout would make things less safe for Americans traveling internationally. ""To make that exchange, all Americans are at greater risk with international travel,"" Maltz said, fearing it would promote taking American citizens captive.",2
2022-12-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/brittney-griner-release-white-house-happened/story?id=94777146,Brittney Griner release: How the White House says it happened,"The White House on Thursday disclosed additional details about how President Joe Biden and administration officials were able to secure WNBA star Brittney Griner's release and return from Russia. White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the deal ""really came to fruition in the last week or so."" Biden made the call to go ahead with the swap ""last week,"" he said. But the deal was the product of months and months of a painstaking negotiation effort from across the U.S. government, including officials at the highest levels engaging directly with Russia. Here's the inside story of how it happened: Secretary of State Antony Blinken said over the summer that the U.S. had made a ""substantial offer"" to Russia for the release of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, but that Russia rejected that offer. Both sides finally reached an agreement in recent days, according to the White House, and Biden made the difficult decision to accept a deal with no Whelan exchange in order to get Griner home. A senior administration official said on Thursday morning that the release came together within the last 48 hours. ""In recent days, we were able to reach agreement on an option to secure Brittany's release. And the president, President Biden, made the difficult decision to accept that option because it resulted in a safe return home of an American,"" the official told reporters. ""Through multiple, multiple engagements, the Russians made clear that the only route to securing Britney's return was a release of a Russian national, Viktor Bout."" Bout, a Russian arms dealer, was extradited to the U.S. and convicted in 2011 of conspiring to supply weapons that could be used to kill Americans. As the exchange neared, Griner was moved from a penal colony to Moscow and then to the United Arab Emirates. ""In the last 48 hours, as this had all come together, Brittney was moved from the penal colony where she was being held to Moscow, and this morning, she was brought to the United Arab Emirates, where she was met by U.S. officials,"" the official said. Roger Carstens, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, greeted Griner on the tarmac upon her release, specifically to let her know that he was there to bring her home and was there on behalf of the president and Secretary Blinken, an official said. They described Griner as ""in an extremely upbeat mood, all smiles and extremely grateful."" From the tarmac, Griner spoke on the phone with Biden and wife, Cherelle Griner. The Saudi government on Thursday issued a joint statement with the UAE about their alleged role in the Griner prisoner swap, claiming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman led a mediation on the successful exchange, but U.S. officials have categorically denied the claim. ""This was a deal done by the U.S. government,"" Kirby repeated several times to White House reporters. ""We spoke with many different interlocutors to involve some foreign governments who had ideas and concepts and thoughts... but this deal was brokered by the United States government,"" he added. A senior administration official, on an earlier call with reporters, thanked former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who for months tried to help negotiate a trade for Griner and Whelan, but the extent of his involvement in Griner's ultimate agreement was not clear. ""I also want to thank those outside government who have engaged with us constructively and worked to improve Griner's conditions while detained and to support government efforts to reach this result, including Governor Bill Richardson, as well as a number of others who have shown a great deal of care and concern about this case,"" a senior administration official said. ""There is gratitude from the government to outside advocates who raised their voices in support of Brittney, like Governor Richardson, who tried to be constructive in keeping us informed as to how they were thinking about the matter.""",20
2022-12-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/brittney-griner-good-spirits-receiving-care-texas-whs/story?id=94950471,Griner 'in very good spirits' but US isn't doing 'backflips' over freeing Russian arms dealer: Kirby,"Brittney Griner is doing well while recovering in Texas after being freed from Russian detention and returning to the U.S. last week, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday. ""She's [in] San Antonio at the Brooke Army Medical Center getting appropriate mental health care as well as physical health care, just to make sure that she's ready for her reintegration back into American society,"" Kirby told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. ""They'll work that out with the doctors and the family as to how much longer she'll need to be there. But our initial reports are she's in very good spirits and in good health,"" Kirby said. Griner, a WNBA star who had pleaded guilty to drug charges after carrying a vape with hashish oil into Russia -- which she maintained was an inadvertent mistake -- was released as part of a prisoner exchange between Moscow and Washington. In return for Griner's freedom from a penal colony, the U.S. released Viktor Bout, a notorious former arms dealer serving a 25-year sentence in Illinois following a conspiracy conviction. The U.S. was unable to secure the release of former Marine Paul Whelan as part of the deal, too. Whelan has been in Russian captivity for nearly four years on espionage charges that the White House says are false; ABC News reported in July that a ""substantial proposal"" was originally put forward was to exchange both Americans for Bout. ""This business of getting wrongfully detained Americans home, there's nothing easy about it. ... And there are tough decisions that go into it,"" Kirby said on ""This Week."" Bout, also known as the ""Merchant of Death,"" was set to leave prison in 2029. He was initially captured in a sting operation in Thailand in 2008. At the time he was seen as the world's largest weapons smuggler, supplying arms to former President Charles Taylor of Liberia, to rebels in Sierra Leone and brokering or selling weapons that fueled conflicts in Afghanistan, Angola, Congo, Rwanda and Sudan. He was extradited to the U.S. on narco-terrorism charges and in 2011 was convicted of conspiring to kill Americans, to supply anti-aircraft missiles and of aiding a terrorist organization. Critics of Bout's swap said the U.S. gave up too much to get Griner back, rather than additional American detainees. Critics also said the deal will encourage future hostage-taking by other countries to win concessions from the U.S. When pressed by Raddatz about this on ""This Week,"" Kirby said the Biden administration was committed to assisting wrongfully detained Americans and that they did not make the decision to release Bout lightly. ""Nobody's doing backflips over there about the fact that Mr. Bout is a free man six years earlier than he would have been. But we're going to protect our national security. And if Mr. Bout decides to go back to his previous line of work, then we're going to do what we need to do to hold him accountable,"" Kirby said. Like others in the administration, he insisted that it was impossible to reach a deal that would have included Whelan's release. ""They were treating Paul very separately, very distinctly because of these sham espionage charges they levied against him,"" Kirby said. ""And then it kind of come together last week in the end game with just a Bout-for-Griner deal."" It was also last week when ""it really occurred to us that there was just no chance"" of freeing Whelan as well as Griner, Kirby said. ""I understand the criticism,"" he said of the deal's detractors. ""They weren't in the room. They weren't on the phone. They weren't watching the incredible effort and determination ... to try to get both Paul and Brittney out together. In a negotiation, you do what you can, you do as much as you can. You push and you push and you push, and we did. And this deal we got last week, that was the deal that was possible."" Nonetheless, he said, ""We are still negotiating for Paul Whelan's release."" While Kirby declined to speak more specifically in public, he said, ""We have a better sense of the context here, where the Russia's expectations are, and we're just going to keep working on it."" Kirby acknowledged ""the argument about encouraging hostage taking, we understand that argument."" But he said the administration had taken steps both to inform Americans who are considering traveling to unsafe countries and, with sanctions and visa restrictions, to deter foreign governments who may use those Americans as political prisoners. Kirby also briefly addressed the status of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, now in its 10th month. Russian President Vladimir Putin has recently shifted to attacking civilian infrastructure, which Kirby said shows Putin ""is trying to bring the Ukrainian people to their knees as winter approaches."" Responding to reporting that Ukrainian drones had struck airfields in Russia, Kirby said: ""We are certainly not encouraging or enabling Ukrainian operations inside Russia. We are trying to make sure that they can defend their territory.""",2
2022-12-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jan-6-committee-criminal-referrals-consideration-kinzinger/story?id=94950817,Rep. Kinzinger welcomes Griner's release but worries prisoner swap could encourage more hostage-taking,"Rep. Adam Kinzinger on Sunday celebrated the release of Brittney Griner from Russia but said he was worried about the future ""ramifications"" from prisoner swaps like the one that earned Griner's freedom. ""We can be glad she's home, and we are, but also recognize that we are changing our no-negotiation policy and that could have real ramifications in the future,"" Kinzinger, R-Ill., told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. In exchange for Griner's release -- after she pleaded guilty to drug charges for, she said, inadvertently bringing a vape cartridge with hashish oil into Russia -- the U.S. freed notorious former arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was convicted of conspiring to kill Americans, to supply anti-aircraft missiles and of aiding a terrorist organization. Kinzinger, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is among those criticizing that deal, in part because it did not include Marine veteran Paul Whelan, who has been in custody in Russia for some four years on espionage charges the White House says are false. After news that the WNBA star was returning to the U.S., Kinzinger tweeted a letter Whelan wrote to him in 2019 and directed a message to President Joe Biden: ""There is no place for weakness when it comes to lives of innocent Americans."" Raddatz noted that the Biden administration has defended the swap by saying that it came down to either no Americans or only Griner coming home -- that Russia would not agree to free Whelan. Raddatz asked Kinzinger whether the government should have kept pushing for Whelan, too, or left Griner behind. ""This isn't one or the other,"" Kinzinger said, adding, ""We love that Brittney's home."" But he cited both Whelan's case and that of Marc Fogel, a teacher sentenced to 14 years in a Russian penal colony on marijuana charges. ""The question is, where is he in these negotiations as well?"" Kinzinger said. ""It is a tough decision you have to make,"" he acknowledged, but he said that the Biden administration had been overly accommodating in its approach. ""If you make it clear that you're willing to take a deal no matter what, you're going to get a bad deal,"" he said. ""I do worry about the implications that could have for future hostage taking if any country decides that we have somebody in our procession that they want back, they could just, obviously, arrest anybody and think that we would negotiate them away,"" he said. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in his own appearance on ""This Week"" on Sunday that the administration acknowledges arguments similar to Kinzinger's but that President Biden has put ""accountability measures"" in place to make the act of hostage-taking more difficult. Kinzinger, though, said Griner's case could embolden bad actors. ""We have to recognize wide-eyed that right now, as Americans, we have made it clear that we are willing to do anything to bring a single American home. And there are people that are watching that,"" he said. Kinzinger was also asked on ""This Week"" about the House Jan. 6 committee, on which he is a member, which is finishing its report and weighing possible criminal referrals after some 18 months of investigation. Kinzinger said he didn't want to get ahead of the panel's decision but that any referrals related to the Capitol attack would be a way to highlight where federal law enforcement should direct their parallel investigation. ""The criminal referrals themselves aren't necessarily something that is going to wake [the Department of Justice] up to something they didn't know before,"" he said. ""But I do think it will be an important symbolic thing that the committee can do -- or even more than symbolic, just very clear that Congress thinks a crime has been committed here and the DOJ should investigate it."" The question of what referrals to potentially make to the Department of Justice has long hovered over the committee's work. Its report is set to be released on Dec. 21. ""This is all about telling the American people about what happened and leaving with them the opportunity to say, 'Democracies can have bad days, but how we come back from those bad days is how we'll be defined,'"" Kinzinger said.",7
2022-12-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/diplomat-brought-brittney-griner-home-tells-paul-whelan/story?id=95058778,Diplomat who brought Brittney Griner home tells Paul Whelan: 'We haven't forgotten you',"U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, the official who brought Brittney Griner back to the U.S., told ""Good Morning America"" on Monday that he spoke to Paul Whelan just hours after landing in Texas with Griner. ""I landed at 4:30 in the morning, and at 9:30, Paul called from the penal colony in Russia. I explained to him, I said, 'Paul, it was one or nothing, we were not going to be able to get you out. We're going to keep working on it, but I understand you're a little frustrated with that,"" Carstens told ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts. ""The president's focused. The secretary's focused. We're meeting today, Monday morning, to go through the next steps of the strategy, but Paul, we haven't forgotten you, we're coming to get you,"" Carstens added. Whelan, a former Marine, has spent about four years in detention since he was seized in 2018 by Russia's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, while visiting Moscow for a friend's wedding. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges but the U.S. and his family say that they were fabricated in order to take him as a political bargaining chip. Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said at Monday afternoon's White House press briefing that Elizabeth Whelan, Paul Whelan's sister, met with State Department officials over video that morning and called discussions with the Whelan family ""substantive."" ""They have had a number of very good questions and also a number of suggestions that they put forward, and we have been working to figure out what it is going to take to ultimately secure his freedom and how we can go about getting that and being able to sit down with the Russians and work out a deal,"" Sullivan said, adding the ""specifics"" of the discussions need to be kept in ""sensitive channels."" Pressed on what exactly the administration can do to bring home Paul Whelan and if the U.S. would be willing to change policy to get him home, Sullivan said the administration would not take a different approach to Ukraine, if that was the implication. ""The big challenge we had over the course of the past several months is that what Russia was asking for to secure Paul Whelan's release was not something that we had to be able to give. That is a problem we are trying to solve. We have various ways that we are working through solutions, and we will be endeavoring on a daily basis from the president on down to finally develop a formula that works and that's as far as I can go today,"" Sullivan said. Carstens, who was appointed to his position by former President Donald Trump in 2020, also said on ""Good Morning America"" on Monday that the work to bring Whelan home hasn't stopped and ""was ongoing while we were on the plane coming home with Brittney."" Griner, a WNBA star who had pleaded guilty to drug charges after carrying a vape with hashish oil into Russia -- which she maintained was an inadvertent mistake -- was released last Thursday as part of a prisoner exchange between Moscow and Washington. In return for Griner's freedom from a penal colony, the U.S. released Viktor Bout, a notorious former arms dealer serving a 25-year sentence in Illinois following a conspiracy conviction -- prompting criticism from some. Carstens countered on Monday to say U.S. national security experts did an assessment and determined that Bout being released was no longer a threat to U.S. security. He called decisions in a case like this ""tough,"" but said ""it's our moral obligation to get an American."" ""I kind of flip it around, to me what's unacceptable is not Viktor Bout. What's unacceptable is an American wrongfully detained and held in a foreign jail cell. We have a moral obligation. Having a blue passport means something,"" he said. ""While it's tough to make some of the decisions that we've made, we start from the premise and from the belief that it's our moral obligation to get an American."" Carstens also offered more details about the flight home with a talkative Griner following her release from a Russian penal colony last week. When he tried to show her to her seat on the plane, ""she was having none of it,"" he said. ""She said, 'Look, I've been listening to Russian for ten months. I want to speak English, I want to chat with people,'"" Carstens said. ""And then as I tried to point her to her seat, she just walked past me and went right to the crew and started introducing herself to the crew members. And also, I watched her and she connected with everyone, looked in their eyes, shook hands, got to know their names, and only when that was all done she went back.""

2022-12-13,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/post-election-democratic-wins-carry-asterisks-note/story?id=95076137,Post-election Democratic wins carry asterisks: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein There might be a touch of poetry here: President Joe Biden on Tuesday will sign a bill guaranteeing federal recognition for same-sex marriages slightly more than a decade since he famously vaulted the issue into the national conversation. Things have hardly moved in straight lines since then. This post-election governing period is no different. Democrats are squeezing what they can out of what remains of their united control of Washington. But the to-do list -- avoiding a shutdown and a debt-ceiling showdown, aid for COVID-19 relief and Ukraine, taking care of the young immigrants known as ""Dreamers"" reforming the Electoral Count Act -- will likely stay longer than the already-done list when Republicans take control of the House in three weeks. A newly developing crisis at the southern border is the latest complicating factor, tied up as it is with pandemic-era policies. Pentagon spending is on track to clear Capitol Hill only with Democrats acceding to GOP demands to lift the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for troops -- over the objections of the defense secretary as well as the commander-in-chief himself. Democrats have spent much of the past two years arguing, often internally, over what must get done and why more can't be achieved. Not long ago, many were worried that focusing on what wasn't happening at the expense of what was passed would take away from efforts to hold the House and the Senate. The House wasn't held, and the Senate was. Last week brought a cherry on top for Democrats whose worst fears of this midterm year weren't realized -- and then a quick reality check courtesy of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz. Governing from here only gets harder, in the narrowly divided Senate, the GOP-led House and with a president under reelection pressures. There aren't many wins Democrats can expect that won't involve tougher compromises than those being reached this month -- as well as fierce pushback from Republicans plus some Democrats. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The nation's highest court will hear an additional case challenging the Biden administration's plan to forgive millions of federal student loans. The case involves two borrowers who claim they have been unfairly denied relief under the program. The administration is seeking to forgive up to $20,000 in federal loans for borrowers making less than $125,000 a year. But this case and a previous one filed by six states could affect whether that will come to fruition. A Supreme Court ruling in these cases could impact some 43 million borrowers. As legal challenges mount, borrowers have been left in limbo for the long term. For now, though, the loan payment moratorium has been extended to June of next year. The Biden administration has argued that it has the authority to proceed with such a program citing the HEROES Act, which allows the for the secretary of education to reduce or eliminate the obligation to repay student loans during a national emergency, in this case the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics say the president exceeded his authority. Hearings on the cases are slated for February. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The highly anticipated testimony from FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried before the House Financial Services Committee hit a roadblock on Monday evening when authorities announced his arrest in the Bahamas. “Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement on Monday. ABC News’ Aaron Katersky reports that while the specific charges against Bankman-Fried will not be unsealed until sometime Tuesday, a source familiar with the situation describes the case as a multi-count fraud indictment. Prior to his arrest, lawmakers had hoped to press Bankman-Fried about the financial mismanagement and collapse of his two companies -- the $32 billion cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the hedge fund Alameda Research. After initially rebuffing a request from the financial committee, Bankman-Fried agreed to testify remotely with a preface about the extent, he claimed, that he could comment. ""I still do not have access to much of my data -- professional or personal. So there is a limit to what I will be able to say, and I won't be as helpful as I'd like,"" Bankman-Fried wrote in a tweet over the weekend. Prior to the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried was making a mark on politics through eye-popping sums of campaign donations. According to OpenSecrets, he contributed ""more than $990,000 to candidates plus an additional $38.8 million to outside groups” throughout the 2022 election cycle. In a May 2022 podcast appearance, Bankman-Fried also set his sights on 2024, saying he could spend $1 billion or more on the presidential cycle. Although Bankman-Fried’s prospects of following through on that idea appear slim, the fallout of the FTX collapse could bring political spending into sharper scrutiny.

2022-12-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/data-historic-number-migrants-reaching-us-borders-reasons/story?id=95198577,Where historic number of migrants is coming from and why: ANALYSIS,"MEXICO CITY -- The Biden administration is preparing for the end of Title 42 amid growing concerns about a sharp rise in migration that may overwhelm immigration authorities. The Title 42 order has been used since the Trump administration and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to immediately expel almost all migrants citing public health concerns -- even if those people attempt to claim asylum, as is allowed under U.S. and international law. President Joe Biden's Republican critics in Congress say his immigration policy has sparked the historic number of apprehensions at the southern border, while the White House says it's Republicans that have failed to work with the administration to reform immigration laws. What's clear is that far from Washington, crises across the Western Hemisphere are fueling the record migration to the U.S. In particular, data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shows that migration has recently skyrocketed from four countries: Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti -- all places where, as advocates and migrants themselves explain, people have faced crises of oppression, poverty, violence, lack of opportunity and a changing and dangerous climate. ""The Americas' ongoing migration event is not just a U.S.-Mexico border phenomenon. People are fleeing everywhere,"" Adam Isacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, a research and advocacy organization, wrote in a tweet this week. Mexico and Central America still remain major sources of migration to the U.S., too, according to the CBP data. Mexico and Guatemala were the top two countries for migration, with Honduras fourth, in fiscal year 2022, which ended Sept. 30. The so-called Northern Triangle countries alone -- El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras -- accounted for more than 541,000 migrant encounters, which was almost a quarter of the historic nearly 2.4 million total encounters at the southern border in fiscal year 2022. CBP data on ""encounters"" is not the same as counting total migrants across the border -- meaning the same migrant can have multiple run-ins with authorities and each is counted as an ""encounter."" Under Title 42 in particular, multiple run-ins have become far more common. Some migrant advocates say it's inflated the numbers and restoring regular order at the border, clearing the asylum backlog and improving immigration processing would reduce the numbers. Either way, the exoduses from these four countries have hit historic levels. There have never been so many Cubans reaching U.S. borders, for example. Between October 2021 through September, U.S. authorities have conducted nearly 225,000 apprehensions of Cubans, according to the CBP data. That's larger than the 1980 Mariel boatlift and the 1994 Cuban rafter crisis -- combined. What's different from those episodes, which sparked major headlines and U.S. policy changes, is that the majority of Cubans are now coming by land, not by sea. There were nearly 221,000 encounters at the U.S. southern border in the last fiscal year, according to the CBP data. That's not to say Cubans aren't still risking dangerous water crossings, the data shows. Since Oct. 1, nearly 3,000 Cubans have been interdicted by U.S. Coast Guard crews, the military branch reported this week. More than 6,000 Cubans were interdicted in the 2022 fiscal year -- seven times more than the previous fiscal year. By land or by sea, all of them are fleeing an island further impoverished by the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling with shortages of food and medicine, political unrest, including crackdowns on protesters, and U.S. sanctions stretching back to former President Donald Trump. As the migration numbers reached historic heights in the last year, Biden started to lift the restrictions -- critics say in large part to stop irregular migration -- allowing for remittances once again, reopening the door to some travel and resuming migration pathways like visas and family reunification. Neighboring Haiti has likewise been consumed by crises, forcing tens of thousands of its people to flee. In fiscal year 2022, more than 56,000 Haitians reached the U.S., largely at the southern border, although many tried by boat and raft -- often stranded and endangered -- like 34 Haitians rescued on Monday by the Coast Guard. In particular, there was a huge increase in September 2021 after Haiti's President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated that July and a 7.2 earthquake hit that August. But the number of Haitians leaving the country has steadily continued as the government, seen as illegitimate by many Haitians, struggles to combat rising gang influence. In Nicaragua, authoritarian President Daniel Ortega's rule -- and the resulting U.S. sanctions -- have apparently contributed to the exodus of people as well. More than 50,000 Nicaraguans reached the U.S. in fiscal year 2021, but the following year saw a staggering 325% increase to nearly 165,000 Nicaraguan migrant encounters by U.S. authorities, per CBP. October, the most recent month for which CBP has data publicly available, saw the largest single month of apprehensions yet. No country has seen more flight than Venezuela, which has been riven by political, economic and humanitarian turmoil. The government of strongman Nicolás Maduro has overseen hyperinflation and economic mismanagement, has cracked down on protests and a political opposition that claims to be the legitimate government and, as a result, has been hit with crushing U.S. sanctions intended to try and force a resolution to the stalemate. The U.N. estimates that more people have left the country than have escaped Syria amid its civil war and nearly as many as have left Ukraine since the Russian invasion -- over 7 million in total now, or nearly a quarter of Venezuela's total population. The U.S. has received a fraction of those refugees, but the numbers have been climbing to nearly 190,000 apprehensions of Venezuelans in fiscal year 2022. With so many trying to claim asylum in the U.S., the Biden administration announced in October that Venezuelans would be among the migrants barred under Title 42 -- swiftly sent back across the border to Mexico. The administration also announced a humanitarian parole program, granting entry to up to 24,000 Venezuelans -- but only those that can apply with a U.S.-based sponsor. Many Venezuelan refugees lack even basic documentation. With that October announcement, the number of Venezuelans heading north seems to have dropped precipitously. For example, those crossing the dangerous Darién Gap -- the dense jungle between Colombia and Panama -- declined 98% from 40,593 in October to just 668 in November, according to Panama's migration authority. (Without CBP data for November, it's unclear how this affected how many were apprehended at the U.S. border.) But data like that also illustrates why Biden administration officials are so concerned about the end of Title 42 -- not just because of the increase in migrants, but because of the increased chance of exploitation. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday blamed ""criminal smuggling organizations"" for the scenes in El Paso this week, telling ABC News, ""The border remains closed."" In the face of that challenge, the Biden administration reportedly is considering other ways to limit migrants' ability to claim asylum, just as Title 42 did. But that has already drawn severe criticism, especially from migrant advocates and immigration legal groups who say some of the proposals unlawfully deny people the right to request asylum. ""It's hard to comprehend that after two years, and a successful midterm election, the White House is resorting to policies they once considered illegal and cruel,"" Biden's former director for border management Andrea Flores tweeted Tuesday, condemning the administration for its ""hybrid Biden-Trump border policies."" Biden himself campaigned on a more humane approach to immigration -- an issue that has for years stymied Congress and multiple presidents. Biden decried Trump's ""detrimental asylum policies"" on his 2020 campaign website and argued that ""abandoning our deepest-held values does nothing to increase security at our border -- and everything to diminish our standing in the world."" The American Civil Liberties Union has already threatened to sue the Biden administration if he implements a ""transit ban,"" for example -- denying asylum to anyone entering the U.S. who did not first apply for asylum in Mexico or another third country that they transited through en route to the border. In 2021, the legal group successfully sued to block a similar Trump policy, which his administration called ""safe third-country agreements."" To some extent, people will still flee regardless -- pushed more by the circumstances in their local communities and home countries than they are influenced by U.S. policies.",12

ABC News followed a military convoy into the war’s grey zone just outside Zaphorizhia in southern Ukraine. A two-hour ceasefire was agreed to in the area, starting at midday local time, so that a swap involving dozens of prisoners of war could go ahead. Murekezi was brought out of Russian-controlled territory as part of that exchange. Suedi had been arrested by the Russian-controlled authorities and spent weeks in a basement, where he said he was tortured. He also spent three months in a prison in Donetsk city. He was later released by the Russians, but he was without his U.S. passport and was effectively trapped in Russian-controlled territory, living in the main city of Donetsk. In an exclusive interview with ABC News in the grey zone, just after he was brought out of Russian-controlled territory, Murekezi said he felt “trapped” in Donetsk and lived under intense uncertainty about his future and what would happen to him. He said he was relieved and happy to be back in Ukrainian-controlled territory, a free man in the country where he has lived for years. Clutching a Ukrainian flag, which he was gifted by military intelligence officers, Suedi said he had been subject to electric shocks and had been beaten by his captors earlier in the war, when he was held in a basement, which he described as a “torture chamber."" He said the Russians accused him of being a member of the CIA. He said he and the other Americans with whom he was held were given only minimal food and water. When I asked Murekezi what he was looking forward to most when he gets back to his home in Minnesota, he said “a peanut butter sandwich.""

2022-12-14,https://abcnews.go.com/International/7-charged-international-smuggling-russia/story?id=95183107,7 charged with international smuggling for Russia,"Seven people, including an Eastern European immigrant living in New Hampshire, have been charged with being part of an international smuggling ring that procured sensitive technology for Russia. The charges, unsealed Tuesday in the Eastern District of New York, revealed the ring operated since at least 2017 and unlawfully purchased and shipped to Russia millions of dollars in sensitive military technology from vendors in Brooklyn and elsewhere. According to the indictment, the intended recipients were Russian entities and individuals barred by U.S. sanctions from receiving the sophisticated testing, quantum computing and hypersonic and nuclear weapons equipment. The seven defendants are charged with facilitating the activities of the Serniya procurement network, which operated under the direction of Russia’s intelligence services to acquire sensitive military and dual use technologies for the Russian military, the defense sector and research institutions. According to the indictment, one of the Serniya Network’s primary operatives in the U.S. was Boris Livshits, a Russian national who formerly lived in Brooklyn, New York. He would interface directly with U.S. companies and purchase export-controlled items requested by the Serniya Network for Russian end users. In doing so, Livshits would misrepresent and omit material information to companies, banks and government agencies, including information about how the items would be used, the various parties involved in the transaction, and the identity of the ultimate end user. Livshits also utilized dozens of U.S.-based front companies and bank accounts that were used to obfuscate the role of Russian or sanctioned entities in transactions. Alexey Brayman was arrested in New Hampshire and Vadim Yermolenko was arrested in New Jersey. Vadim Konoshchenok has also been taken into custody in Estonia and will undergo extradition proceedings to the United States. The other defendants are believed to be in Russia.",0
2022-12-15,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mccarthys-campaign-speaker-complicate-holding-gavel-note/story?id=95269610,McCarthy's campaign for speaker could complicate his holding the gavel: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein If there's a sweet spot between the ""never Kevin"" and ""only Kevin"" forces among House Republicans, it's not likely to reward GOP leader Kevin McCarthy for helping Democrats get things done in the finals days of the current Congress. So it is that McCarthy's internal GOP campaign for House speaker is colliding with year-end goals, including some that Democrats share with other Republicans on Capitol Hill. That could come at the expense of legislating this year and well beyond -- and brings an early and telling clash with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. McCarthy has been working, in public and in private, to hold up a spending package that would avert a government shutdown and carry the status quo into what he hopes will be his speakership, starting in January. The House on Wednesday night bought itself a week to finalize a larger spending deal, with an extension passing with the support of nine Republicans and the unanimous backing of Democrats. McCarthy had called out the Senate for putting a final spending bill in the hands of two retiring legislators. That includes Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the vice chairman of the chamber's Appropriations Committee, who is working with McConnell's blessing to get the best deal Republicans can under the circumstances. McCarthy on Wednesday said it was an ""inappropriate question"" when asked about the trouble he is having in getting 218 House votes and becoming the speaker next month. But that's the biggest question lingering out of last month's midterm elections, and the difference between what McCarthy says he wants to happen and what he actually wants matters in how it ends up being answered. ""Business as usual"" may not be popular, particularly in a conference still in the minority but about to take over the majority. But it's how things get done, as any would-be House speaker knows. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is calling on state lawmakers to end the utilization of runoff elections. ""Georgia is one of the only states in the country with a General Election Runoff,"" Raffensperger, the state's top elections official, said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We're also one of the only states that always seems to have a runoff. I'm calling on the General Assembly to visit the topic of the General Election Runoff and consider reforms."" Critics of runoffs have highlighted the multimillion-dollar price tag of these elections -- calling them wasteful. The secretary of state also pointed to tight deadlines and the newly abbreviated four-week period between each Election Day and the subsequent runoff as reasons to do away with the system. ""No one wants to be dealing with politics in the middle of their family holiday,"" Raffensperger said. Another reason that the system has garnered criticism: its racist history. The brainchild of a segregationist legislator in 1964, the runoffs in Georgia were intended to dilute the influence of Black voters because they would help prevent a Black candidate from winning a race with less than 50% if the field included multiple white candidates who split the other votes. Raffensperger's call comes a little more than a week after two Black candidates competed in the state's Senate runoff, with Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock winning his reelection effort against Republican Hershel Walker. The only other state that holds runoffs in general elections is Louisiana. The TIP with Hannah Demissie Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has confirmed he is weighing a 2024 presidential run, said this week that a third presidential bid from former President Donald Trump would be the ""worst scenario"" for Republicans. During an interview with the Associated Press published Tuesday, Hutchinson said that he plans to decide early next year whether or not to run for the White House. Hutchinson's comments are the latest examples of conservatives not automatically falling in line behind another presidential run by Trump, the GOP's most prominent member, especially following the midterm elections where Republicans did not perform well relative to expectations. Senate Minority Leader McConnell separately indicated to reporters this week that he felt Trump shared the blame for the party's failure in key races this election cycle. McConnell suggested on Tuesday that Trump's mistake was involving himself in primary races and endorsing candidates who were not strong enough to win their general elections. ""Look at Arizona and New Hampshire and the challenging situation Georgia, as well … I do think we have an opportunity to relearn one more time that we have to have quality candidates to win,"" McConnell said. ""Our ability to control a primary outcome was quite limited in 2022 because the support of the former president proved to be very decisive in these primaries. So, my view was, do the best you can with the cards you're dealt,"" he said. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" podcast.

""It feels so good to be home! The last 10 months have been a battle at every turn,"" Griner wrote on Instagram. ""I dug deep to keep my faith and it was the love from so many of you that helped keep me going. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone for your help."" The U.S. swapped the WNBA star for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout on Dec. 8. Griner's post on Instagram included a photo of her stepping off a plane in Texas upon returning to the U.S. and a photo of her hugging her wife, Cherelle. Griner’s agent confirmed that she has left a San Antonio military base, where she was recuperating, and is on her way home. Griner was taken into custody at a Moscow area airport in February in possession of vaping cartridges containing hashish oil, an illegal substance in Russia. She pleaded guilty in July and was sentenced to nine years in prison on Aug. 7. She appealed the sentence, but was quickly rejected in October. The U.S. had been negotiating a prisoner swap for months. President Joe Biden finally announced on Dec. 8 that he had spoken to Griner from a plane as she flew back to the United States and shared photos of himself with Cherelle Griner and Vice President Kamala Harris in the Oval Office. Griner also specifically thanked Biden ad urged the U.S. to continue to fight to bring imprisoned ex-Marine Paul Whelan home from Russia. ""President Biden, you brought me home and I know you are committed to bringing Paul Whelan and all Americans home too,"" she wrote. ""I will use my platform to do whatever I can to help you. I also encourage everyone that played a part in bringing me home to continue their efforts to bring all Americans home. Every family deserves to be whole.""

Oksana Markarova,"With prominent Republicans in Congress calling for more scrutiny of aid to Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia's invasion, the country's ambassador to the United States said Sunday that ""we actually welcome the transparency and accountability."" ""We're working with Congress on a very strong bipartisan basis. … And there is a number of systems already in place. The NATO system on the security systems, but also the full reporting on the budget support,"" Oksana Markarova told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. ""So, we look forward to continuing doing that. And, actually, we really count on Congress continued support, especially for 2023."" The Biden administration and lawmakers have already directed nearly $50 billion in 2022 alone. Congress may add more Ukrainian support to a year-end government funding measure. GOP Rep. Michael McCaul said in a ""This Week"" appearance last month that while most members on both sides of the aisle support those efforts, Republicans ""have a voice now"" -- as the incoming House majority -- and will provide more oversight of the spending. The Biden administration maintains that efforts are already underway to make sure funds and munitions are being properly administered and Congress instructed watchdog agencies at the State Department and Pentagon to track the aid as well. Beyond what the U.S. has already provided, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has for several months asked President Joe Biden for Patriot missile defense systems for several months now. Ukrainian officials have said these advanced air defense systems are needed in response to Russia's intensified missile strike attacks, including on civilian infrastructure providing needed resources. The defense systems could be imminently transferred from the U.S. to Ukraine, pending approval, ABC News reported last week. ""During the last two months ... there is a massive attack on civilian infrastructure: 50% of the energy is destroyed of the energy grid. We have to stop it. And the only way to do it is with increased number of air defense everywhere in Ukraine,"" Markarova said on ""This Week."" Raddatz asked about the Russian embassy warning of ""unpredictable consequences"" if the U.S. agrees to send the enhanced defensive arms. ""This is very cynical of them. I mean, they have attacked a peaceful country,"" Markarova responded, claiming that Russia has been committing ""all atrocities"" and ""war crimes."" Markarova said the focus should be on winning the war and holding Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials accountable. Raddatz asked if -- despite Ukraine's successes in recent months with its counter-offensive -- she was worried about a new offensive from Russia in the winter or new year, and Markarova said she was. ""We just have to be proactive and together, with all of our friends and partners, we are thankful for all the support that we are getting to continue to stay the course, liberate the territories and defend Ukraine,"" she said. She also said Ukraine was on alert for the possible involvement of the Belarusian military to the north, supporting Russia. Last week, Belarus' president, Alexander Lukashenko, announced an unscheduled check of the army's readiness. ""The people in Belarus do not want to be part of this war. ... And, hopefully, you know, they will be able to stay away, at least from the direct involvement in this war, and stop what they're doing already,"" Markarova said. She repeated what President Zelenskyy has also vowed: to oust Russian forces from Crimea, which Putin annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and reclaim the peninsula that the Russian leader prizes. ""That seems like a clear red line for Vladimir Putin,"" Raddatz pressed. ""How do you take back Crimea?"" Markarova again attacked Russia's illegal actions, but Raddatz pushed her to respond to the difficulty of a Ukrainian military operation there. ""Everything is very difficult. And, ultimately, we are paying a higher price for liberating our land and our people,"" Markarova said. ""But there is no other option because we know what happens under Russian occupation. They are killing and torturing and destroying Ukrainians.""",7
2022-12-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/unfinished-trump-business-dominates-end-year-sprint-note/story?id=95499379,Unfinished Trump business dominates end-of-year sprint: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The waning days of united Democratic control of Washington will be filled with memories of the last time they weren't in that position. It may also have significant consequences for what comes next. Virtually every day of the final week before Christmas brings decision points for Democrats on how to handle circumstances put into motion by former President Donald Trump. Monday brings the final hearing of the House Jan. 6 committee, followed by a final written report. The committee is expected to make the fateful decision of formally referring to the Department of Justice charges against individuals including the former president himself, ABC's Katherine Faulders reports. Tuesday brings a House Ways and Means Committee that's expected to bring a vote on releasing Trump's tax returns. That would close a long chapter of public debate by opening a new one -- and setting a precedent just ahead of the GOP takeover of the House. Wednesday brings the scheduled expiration of Title 42 being applied to migrant arrivals. The Trump-era policy has stayed in place for the first 23 months of the Biden administration -- and its unwinding could bring new crises at an already strained southern border. Trump himself looks like less of a force than he has in years inside the Republican Party, despite his decision to announce another presidential run just a week after the midterms. But in tangible and relevant ways, the Trump era never really ended. That will remain the case through the rest of the year and most likely well beyond. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Leaders in Texas are bracing for a surge of migrants at the southern border as the Trump-era policy that allowed asylum-seekers to be turned away amid COVID-19 is expected to lift in the coming days. ""If the courts do not intervene and put a halt to the removal of Title 42, it's gonna be total chaos,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told ABC's ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. Title 42 has allowed the government to cite public health, more specifically the pandemic, as a reason to remove migrants who present themselves at the border without hearing their asylum claims. Despite a push from a group of Republican-led states, including Texas, a federal appeals court judge denied efforts to continue the policy. That means the policy will end Wednesday unless the Supreme Court intervenes. El Paso, Texas, Mayor Oscar Leeser has issued an emergency declaration ahead of Title 42's end, which he said will allow the city greater flexibility to care for migrants who arrive in their border community. The White House has pushed back on claims from the right, including Abbott, that the administration supports ""open borders."" Instead, these officials say, immigration laws will be enforced while the administration aims to ""expand legal pathways for migration while discouraging disorderly and unsafe migration."" ""To be clear: the lifting of the Title 42 public health order does not mean the border is open,"" White House assistant press secretary Abdullah Hasan said in a statement. ""Anyone who suggests otherwise is doing the work of smugglers spreading misinformation to make a quick buck off of vulnerable migrants."" Presidents of both parties have struggled to address the southern border and Congress has for years failed to pass comprehensive immigration reforms. Prospects for getting substantive immigration policy in a bitterly divided Congress next year are slim, too. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema Sen. Joe Manchin left the door open to potentially becoming an independent and plans to evaluate how each of the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act ""plays out"" before making a decision about his party affiliation. ""If people are trying to stop something from doing so much good because of the politics, thinking that somebody else will get credit for it, let's see how that plays out, and then I will let you know later what I decide to do. But, right now, I have no intentions of changing anything, except working for West Virginians, trying to give them more opportunities, better quality of life and basically making sure our country is energy-secured,"" Manchin said in an interview with CBS News on Sunday. The West Virginia lawmaker added that being affiliated with the Democratic Party ""does not saddle me to everything the Democrats want to do is what's right."" ""I don't think the Democrats have all the answers. I don't think the Republicans are always wrong, and vice versa,"" he said. Manchin expressed a similar stance last week on the heels of Arizona Sen. Krysten Sinema's decision to become an independent. Both moderates are up for reelection in 2024 when Democrats are likely looking at a narrow path to keeping the majority in the upper chamber given how many states they are defending that are Republican-friendly. The competitive Senate map -- as well as West Virginia's strong Republican voter base -- could provide an opportunity for more than partisan scrutiny given that Manchin could also lean into exploring possible presidential considerations.

2022-12-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/45-billion-ukraine-aid-included-17-trillion-government/story?id=95614726,$45 billion in Ukraine aid included in must-pass $1.7 trillion government funding bill,"Senate leaders on Tuesday scrambled to beat a midnight Friday deadline to avoid a government shutdown after negotiators early Tuesday unveiled the text of a massive, $1.7 trillion spending bill to keep funding going through fiscal year 2023. ""The choice is clear. We can either do our jobs and fund the government, or we can abandon our responsibilities without a real path forward,"" Senate Appropriations Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said in a statement. If it passes procedural and political hurdles in the Senate, House lawmakers must still approve the measure as well. Members on both sides of the aisle are claiming victories on the bill. Republicans are celebrating a boost in defense spending, while Democrats tout the inclusion of Ukraine aid and reforms to the Electoral Count Act to avoid a repeat of Jan. 6 and attempts to overturn the 2020 election. The bill also has a stamp of approval from the administration, despite not including everything President Joe Biden and officials wanted. ""As with any compromise, neither side got everything it wanted, but this legislation is good for our economy, our competitiveness, and our country, and I urge Congress to send it to the President's desk without delay,"" Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement after the bill's text was released. While Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he wants the bill to be passed as soon as possible given the approaching winter storm, a handful of Republicans could delay the process. Several GOP Senators including Rick Scott, Mike Braun, Ron Jonson ad Rand Paul wheeled a physical copy of the massive omnibus bill on a cart adorned with signs that read, ""Danger 1.7 trillion of hazardous Debt,"" and ""Omnibus Beware debt hazard of 1.7 trillion added to the National Dept."" The senators then each took the stand to air their grievances with the bill which they believe to be catastrophic for the American people citing inflation and national deficit concerns as well as insufficient time to properly vet the bill before a vote. Paul promised to bring several amendments to the floor for a vote. ""The American people don't want this. They're sick and tired of it,"" Paul said, adding, ""It's a terrible system. Someone needs to stand up. We're standing up and we're saying no."" There's also a handful of House Republicans calling for the caucus to punt the issue into the new Congress, when they take over the chamber. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy went so far as to threaten any future bill from Senate Republicans to be ""dead on arrival in the House if this nearly $2T monstrosity is allowed to move forward."" Here's a look at some of the measures in the bill and what didn't make it into the text. Overall, the omnibus bill would allocate $858 billion in defense-related spending -- a $76 billion increase from fiscal year 2022. It also allocates $772.5 billion for non-defense discretionary programs, which is a $68 billion increase from last year. Appropriators set aside $45 billion in aid for Ukraine and NATO allies amid Russia's ongoing invasion, which is $7 billion more than what the Biden administration had requested. The bill also includes a pay raise for American troops and civilian federal employees. The bill also includes $118 billion for medical services for veterans, which includes funding for recently passed legislation that aids veterans suffering from exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances. The bill provides $40 billion to assist communities impacted by wildfires, hurricanes, flooding and other natural disasters. It includes $1 billion for Puerto Rico's electrical grid, which has been beaten down by hurricanes and other storms, and $600 million to address the water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi. Among the measures unrelated to spending in the omnibus bill is reform to the Electoral Count Act, the centuries-old law former President Donald Trump and his allies tried to exploit in the failed effort to overturn the 2020 election. The changes to the law were made in response to the Jan. 6 attack. Also included is a measure to ban the use of the social media app TikTok on government-issued devices. The measure mirrors state-level bans on the app passed in recent weeks in Texas, Georgia and other areas. What the $1.7 trillion spending bill doesn't include is the COVID-19 funding that the White House requested to help boost vaccine and treatment supplies and fund next-generation research. Cannabis banking legislation was also left on the cutting room floor. The SAFE Banking Act, which passed with bipartisan support in the House last year, would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in states where it is legal. The expanded Child Tax Credit was left out of the bill despite Democrats' push to renew the benefit that was credited with a decline in child poverty. Legislation legislation to narrow the sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine offenses, a priority for criminal justice advocates, was also not included in the spending package. Also on the chopping block was a measure that would have provided a citizenship path to ""Dreamer"" immigrants, those who came to the U.S. illegally as children, and the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would allow refugees who were resettled when U.S. troops pulled out of Afghanistan to be on a path to permanent residency. Both Schumer and McConnell noted there were things not included that they would have liked to see included in the bill that were omitted. ""There were many things, one could argue, that were important that didn't make it into bill,"" McConnell said Tuesday. -ABC News' Noah Minnie contributed to this report.",26
2022-12-21,https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-woman-speaks-after-release-russian-captivity-same/story?id=95670746,US woman speaks out after release from Russian captivity on the same day as Brittney Griner,"An American woman held in Russia for over a year is speaking about her ordeal after her release on Dec. 8, the same day as WNBA star Brittney Griner. Sarah Krivanek, 46, told ABC News she moved to Russia in 2017 to teach English. Fluent in Russian, she enjoyed a successful career teaching at elite schools in Moscow. After a fight with a roommate who she said was violent, Krivanek was arrested in December 2021 for using a knife during the altercation, an act she says was self-defense. A trial in February without a jury resulted in a year-long sentence to a Russian penal colony, a verdict even her attorney told her was extreme for the circumstances, she says. Krivanek said she learned it coincided with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Watch the interview with Sarah Krivanek on ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday ""I just fell into the system as a sacrifice, just at the wrong time. And because they were preparing to go to war with Ukraine, I became somebody on their radar,"" she said. ""If this situation would have happened at an earlier time or a different time in history, I wouldn't have been sentenced at all. But because it came on the heels of starting a war with Ukraine, they used this as leverage."" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters Dec. 9 that while he was aware of Krivanek's departure, he did not have details on the circumstances of her deportation or whether she left with Griner, according to Radio Free Europe. Krivanek says she was assaulted in the Russian penal colony by another inmate. The State Department provided a statement to ABC News noting, in part, ""The U.S. Department of State and our embassies and consulates abroad have no greater priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas."" The statement added, ""U.S. Embassy Moscow provided assistance on the case of U.S. citizen Sarah Krivanek for more than a year. We monitored the case throughout the process, including attending deportation hearings. We coordinated with Russian authorities to facilitate Ms. Krivanek's safe return to the United States."" Krivanek said she is suffering PTSD from the assault she endured and malnourishment and had to check herself into a local hospital upon arrival in the U.S. She is currently working with a trauma specialist.",20
2022-12-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-address-congress-house-republicans-grow-skeptical-aid/story?id=95659008,Zelenskyy to address Congress as House Republicans grow skeptical about more aid,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's surprise trip to Washington and address to Congress comes as pressure mounts from House Republicans to audit or even cut aid to Ukraine as they prepare to take majority control just days away in January. Some conservative House Republicans have made it clear they would even oppose any additional funding as Congress votes on a must-pass $1.7 trillion government funding bill that includes $45 billion in aid to Ukraine. When asked how much of Zelenskyy's visit is about President Joe Biden pressuring the incoming GOP-controlled House to keep U.S. aid for Ukraine flowing, a senior administration official told ABC News that the visit was not about politics. ""This isn't about sending a message to a particular political party, this is about sending a message to Putin and sending a message to the world that America will be there for Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" the official said. Current House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy -- needing to win over conservatives to back his bid for speaker -- has signaled he could oppose more funding. He has warned that Republicans will not write a ""blank check"" for Ukraine when they assume the majority. ""I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,"" McCarthy told Punchbowl News. ""They just won't do it. … It's not a free blank check."" McCarthy later doubled down on his comments, telling CNN that he supported Ukraine but didn't close the door in opposing funding. ""I am very supportive of Ukraine. It means no blank checks for anything ... I think there has to be accountability brought forth,"" he said. He confirmed to ABC News on Wednesday that he would attend Zelenskyy's address to lawmakers. Some of most conservative House Republicans, including GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Andrew Clyde, Barry Moore, Thomas Massie, and incoming Florida Rep. Cory Mills, have claimed the funding shelled out for Ukraine should be spent domestically instead. ""American taxpayers are literally paying to prop up many countries all over the world in foreign aid, but America is virtually crumbling before our eyes,"" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene argued in a series of tweets on Wednesday after Zelenskyy's visit was announced. ""Of course the shadow president has to come to Congress and explain why he needs billions of American's taxpayer dollars for the 51st state, Ukraine.This is absurd. Put America First!!!"" She tweeted. At a Nov. 17 news conference, the group introduced resolution, later defeated, urging the Biden administration to provide a full audit of how U.S. aid to Ukraine is being spent. ""I will note vote for one more dollar to Ukraine,"" Gaetz said. Meanwhile, more moderate Republican Reps. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Mike Turner, R-Ohio, last month on ABC News' ""This Week"" while backing McCarthy's comments about no ""blank check,"" also insisted that the incoming House Republican majority would continue to support funding and arming Ukraine. At the same time, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has made the case for more military aid for Ukraine -- arguing for it on Wednesday just before Zelenskyy arrived. ""Continuing our support for Ukraine is morally right, but its not only that, its also a direct investment in cold hard American interest,"" McConnell said. ""The reason that a big bipartisan majority of the American people and a big bipartisan majority in Congress support continuing to assist Ukraine is not primarily about inspiring speeches or desire to engage in philanthropy,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""The most basic reasons for continuing to help Ukraine degrade and defeat the Russian invaders are cold, hard, practical, American interests,"" he continued. ""Helping equip our friends in eastern Europe defeat this world is also a direct investment in reducing Putin's future capabilities to menace America, threaten our allies and contest our core interests."" Latest polling found a near-even split of American opinion on Biden's handling of the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Forty-five percent approve while 46% disapprove of his actions, according to a Dec. 14 Quinnipiac Poll. Democrats have called out House Republicans for their growing skepticism about sending more aid to Kyiv.. ""I hope that Donald Trump's friendship with Putin is not motivating Republicans to turn a blind eye to Ukraine's suffering and desperate need for help,"" Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Wednesday morning. ""Because the so-called friendship between Putin and Trump was a sour relationship that was deeply damaging to our country and to the international order.""

2022-12-21,https://abcnews.go.com/US/biggest-stories-2022-headlines-forgotten/story?id=94723645,Top stories of 2022 you may have forgotten about,"This past year has seen war break out in Ukraine, the death of Britain's longest-reigning monarch, tragedy in Uvalde, Texas, and the first case of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) detected in the U.S. amid a global outbreak of the rare, highly infectious disease. Coverage of those events dominated much of the news cycle in 2022. Here's a look back at the other stories that caught our attention that might have flown under the radar. An 11-day, multistate manhunt for an escaped inmate and the corrections officer authorities said helped him escape an Alabama jail came to an end on May 9, when jail employee Vicky White was apprehended along with murder suspect Casey White in Indiana. Vicky White died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and Casey White has since been charged with murder in connection with her death. An unidentified couple was found beaten and strangled in a wooded area in Houston in 1981. Decades later, it was unclear what happened to the couple's baby daughter, who came to be known as Baby Holly. With the help of genetic genealogy, investigators were able to solve the mystery by identifying the couple. This year, Baby Holly -- 42-year-old Holly Miller, a mother of five living in Oklahoma -- was found and reunited with some of her biological family. The parking problems of one San Francisco couple made headlines after they were fined $1,542 for parking in their own driveway due to the enforcement of a decades-old city code. The fine was eventually dropped in July and the lot legalized for parking after a 1938 photo helped them prove that the lot has historically been used for parking. More than 5,000 pounds of methamphetamine was seized from a box truck that had just crossed the border between the United States and Mexico on July 7, in what authorities believe was one of the largest meth seizures ever in San Diego County, California. A 23-year-old American tourist captured attention after he fell into Mount Vesuvius, an active volcano in Italy, while trespassing to take a selfie on July 9, officials said. He sustained only minor injuries. A Long Island shoe repair shop was actually an illegal gambling operation, federal prosecutors alleged. Several purported members and associates of the Genovese and Bonanno organized crime families were arrested on Aug. 16 and charged with racketeering and illegal gambling offenses for allegedly running gambling parlors out of other legitimate-seeming New York establishments, including a coffee bar. Eliza Fletcher, a 34-year-old Memphis mother of two young sons, was abducted while out for her regular 4 a.m. run on Sept. 2. She was found murdered days later in a horrifying case that cast a spotlight on women's safety while running. Police were searching for a Michigan family of four that disappeared in October after the father showed ""paranoid behaviors,"" leaving behind their pets and a family member requiring full-time care. A week later, the family was found safe in a neighboring state. The case was closed in what police said may have been sparked by a misunderstanding. After a delayed drawing, a single ticket claimed a record $2.04 billion jackpot on Nov. 8 in Powerball's biggest drawing ever.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre issued a statement early Wednesday morning, saying the president invited Zelenskyy to visit Washington ""to underscore the United States' enduring commitment to Ukraine."" ""President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Zelenskyy today, December 21, at the White House, after which President Zelenskyy will address the joint meeting of Congress, demonstrating the strong, bipartisan support for Ukraine,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""Three hundred days ago, Russia launched a brutal assault against Ukraine. In response, President Biden rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Zelenskyy confirmed early Wednesday that he was on his way to the U.S. and will have discussions with Biden, adding: ""I will also have a speech at the Congress and a number of bilateral meetings."" The trip will be his first travel outside of his country since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began 10 months ago. ""During the visit, President Biden will announce a significant new package of security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""The visit will underscore the United States' steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes, including through the provision of economic, humanitarian and military assistance."" Sources on Tuesday confirmed to ABC News that plans were underway for Zelenskyy to visit the Capitol on Wednesday to address Congress. The trip comes as Congress is considering $45 billion in funding for Ukraine. Earlier Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged all members to be present at votes ""for a very special focus on Democracy Wednesday night."" Zelenskyy, who enjoys broad bipartisan support on the Hill despite some Republican calls for more oversight of U.S. aid, has addressed Congress before -- remotely -- on March 16, some three weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the time, he thanked Congress but called on the U.S. to do more for his country. He invoked the words of Martin Luther King Jr. -- ""I have a dream"" -- and said ""I have a need"" to protect Ukraine. At the end of the roughly 16-minute speech, he addressed Biden directly: ""You are the leader of the nation … I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace."" ABC News' Justin Gomez and Lauren Minore contributed to this report.",15
2022-12-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338,"Zelenskyy’s security in Washington being treated as 'mini-state visit,' sources say","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's trip to Washington is being treated as a mini state visit – one with extraordinary security implications, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans. Hundreds of law enforcement and intelligence officials have been activated and the U.S. Secret Service will be the lead agency as he heads to the White House and speaks to Congress Wednesday. ""From the moment he lands and walks down those stairs of his plane, he will have a Secret Service security detail,"" one official told ABC News. ""He will have that detail until he gets on the plane to leave,"" the official said. The Secret Service will provide the vehicles for his motorcade and will be assisted with the motorcade by Prince George's County police and Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police. Zelenskyy will have his own Ukrainian security detail with him as well. Don Mihalek, a former United States Secret Service agent told ABC News the Secret Service protects all foreign heads of state while on U.S. soil. ""The Secret Service is responsible for the protection of all visiting foreign heads of state,"" he said. ""They will mobilize a multi-agency security umbrella to ensure his visit is kept safe."" Security officials at the most senior levels of government are ""very"" concerned about the prospect of something happening during the visit and when he returns home, domestically or abroad, one source told ABC News. Zelenskyy's trip to Capitol Hill will be similar to State of the Union security preparations because of the high level nature of the address, the official said. ""Being that they are at war with the Russians, not only is there threats potentially from Russian agents, and Russian collaborators, but there will also be threats from those that oppose Ukraine's independence and other nations that might have a vested interest in seeing that Ukraine is not successful,"" Mihalek, an ABC News contributor said. According to an email sent to staff at the Capitol and obtained by ABC News, security measures will be ""significant."" The email says only staff and members will be allowed in the House wing past a certain time. The Secret Service also is consulting with the Capitol Police, CIA, FBI and other intelligence agencies about the security environment. Every Capitol Police officer will be on standby, according to one law enforcement official. ""We are very cognizant that Russia has assets in this country and might try to do something,"" one senior official said. ""We know what is at stake."" The U.S. is aware that early on in the conflict the Russians apparently plotted to kill Zelenskyy and the official expressed concern that news of Zelensky's visit broke so early about him coming to the United States. It would have been much better, he said, if our adversaries had less time, not more time, to think about doing something and to move assets and operatives around. The official went on to say he is concerned about Zelensky's security once he leaves the country. ""Putin and the Kremlin know he has to get back to home,"" the official said.",12
2022-12-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-delivers-final-press-conference-ahead-departure-speaker/story?id=95714763,Pelosi delivers final press conference ahead of departure as speaker: 'Thank you',"Fresh from presiding over Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's joint address to Congress and flanked by a vintage photo of Winston Churchill's 1941 speech to the chamber, Nancy Pelosi on Thursday delivered her last news conference as House speaker before Republicans retake control on Jan. 3. The 82-year-old outgoing Democratic leader from California weighed the historic events which surround her exit -- Zelenskyy's speech, updates on the final report from the Jan. 6 select committee, the $1.7 trillion omnibus bill -- and, when asked, reflected upon her own barrier-breaking time as speaker and what her future role will be as just one of 435 representatives in the House. While relinquishing the gavel, the first and only woman elected to lead the House and, for a time, the highest-ranking woman in the U.S. government said she would maintain ""strong influence"" and back a new era of female leaders in support of the ""integrity of the institution."" In announcing last month that she would be stepping down from leadership, Pelosi also said she intends to serve her next term as a lawmaker representing San Francisco. ""As speaker of the House, I have awesome power. As I'm transitioning to a different, new role, I expect to have strong influence. But not on my members but just in terms of encouraging more women, for example, to run ... The speaker of the House is a very big job and just wrapping it up will take time,"" Pelosi said on Thursday. ""I'm not going to be the mother-in-law, comes in and say, 'This is the way my son likes his turkey stuffing, his scrambled eggs, or anything else,'"" she added about her future relationship with incoming Democratic leadership. Pelosi also said that while she has not had any formal conversations with GOP leader Kevin McCarthy -- her presumed successor, who is currently embroiled in a quest for speaker votes -- she hopes that a new speaker will be swiftly selected in early January so congressional duties quickly resume. ""We interact, and I'm just hoping that on Jan. 3 that they'll be expeditiously able to elect a speaker so that we can get on with the work of the Congress,"" she said. ""I think they'll have a speaker. My interest... [is] the integrity of the institution, the strength of and respect that the institution commands."" Pelosi remarked on her own entrance to Congress in 1987, when few women occupied such seats, let alone leadership posts, and her hope to encourage further diversity in future Congresses. ""Some of us just made a decision: We have to change this, we have to recruit, we have to fund, we have to encourage women to run, give confidence to them,"" she said. ""I say the best advice I ever had that I extend to you is: Be yourself. You're the only person in the history of the world who was you … I get overwhelmed by women telling me how I've given them confidence or a role model … and I said, 'Don't worry about any role model. Be yourself.'"" Pelosi began her weekly press conference, which occurred routinely over her time as a Democratic leader, by looking back on recent days at the Capitol. ""It's been a momentous week for our democracy,"" she said. ""Yesterday was … my high honor to welcome President Zelenskyy of Ukraine here in the United States Capitol."" Pelosi has described Zelenskyy's U.S. trip with great reverence since it was first reported on Tuesday evening, repeatedly linking the wartime president's visit to Churchill's past address, when her father, the late Maryland Rep. Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., was a member of the House. On Wednesday, before what was likely the last time she would preside over a joint meeting of Congress before stepping down, Pelosi talked about on the significance of the Ukrainian president's speech while appearing with him during a photo opportunity on the Hill. ""When Winston Churchill came here in 1941, the day after Christmas, really within a week and 81 years of today, and he made the case for calling upon America to help fight tyranny and your -- he said at that time: 'We are doing the noblest work in the world, not only defending hearth and homes but the cause of freedom in every land,'"" she said. ""Eight decades later, it is my official honor ... now to welcome President Zelenskyy to make a joint address to a joint session,"" she said. Pelosi, who assumed the speakership for a second time when Democrats won the House in the 2018 midterm elections, sat at the helm of Congress during the Jan. 6 insurrection, an event she said during Thursday's press conference was an assault on democracy itself. ""The world will see the final report of the bipartisan select committee to investigate Jan. 6 after 18 months of tirelessly defending democracy,"" she said, thanking the committee's chairman, Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, and Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., for their leadership. ""The 117th Congress began with a violent assault on our democracy. And now we're here at its conclusions. We have a vital roadmap and ensuring justice will be done and that this won't happen again,"" Pelosi said. Near the end of her time at the podium, Pelosi expressed gratitude for everyone whom she had encountered over her 19 years leading her party in the House. ""I think that probably the most overwhelming thing I'll be doing forever is saying 'thank you,'"" she said. ""Thank you to my members, thank you to the intellectual resources that have helped us with policy. Thank you for those who have helped us politically to attain our majorities and our strength in the Congress,"" she continued. ""I think my life will be about accountability, to the record, the history, and thank you to those who made all that possible.""",16
2022-12-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-deliver-christmas-address-white-house/story?id=95712024,Biden delivers 'Christmas address' from White House: 'We have become too divided',"President Joe Biden delivered what the White House called a ""Christmas address"" Thursday afternoon where he emphasized unity, reflection and kindness as 2022 comes to end. Biden said he hopes ""this holiday season will drain the poison that has infected our politics and set us against one another"" and mark ""a fresh start for our nation -- because there's so much that unites us as Americans, so much more that unites us than divides us."" ""Our politics has gotten so angry, so mean, so partisan, and too often we see each other as enemies, not as neighbors, as Democrats or Republicans, not as fellow Americans. We have become too divided,"" he said. ""But as tough as these times have been, if we look a little closer, we see bright spots all across the country. The strength and determination, the resilience that’s long defined America. We’re surely making progress."" ""Things are getting better. COVID no longer controls our lives. Our kids are back in school. People are back to work,"" he continued. ""So, my hope this Christmas season is that we take a few moments of quiet reflection, find that stillness in the heart of Christmas, that’s at the heart of Christmas, and look, really look at each other not as Democrats or Republicans, not as members of Team Red or Team Blue, but as who we really are."" Biden acknowledged the holidays can be a time of ""great pain and terrible loneliness"" for many Americans, reminding that 50 years ago this week he lost his first wife, Neilia, and infant daughter, Naomi, in a car accident while his family was out shopping for a Christmas tree. ""Here's what I learned long ago: No one can ever know what someone else is going through,"" he said. ""That's why sometimes the smallest act of kindness can mean so much. A simple smile. A hug. An unexpected phone call. A quiet cup of coffee. Simple acts of kindness that can lift a spirit, provide comfort, and perhaps, maybe even save a life."" The speech was teased as focusing ""on what unites us as Americans, his optimism for the year ahead, and wishing Americans joy in the coming year,"" the White House said. ""We are truly blessed to live in this nation. And I truly hope we take the time to look out for one another -- not at one another -- look out for one another,"" Biden said. ""So this Christmas, let's spread a little kindness,"" he added. Biden's address follows a powerful address from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Congress where the wartime leader invoked the Battle of the Bulge at Christmastime during World War II and reminded Americans of shared values during the holidays as Russian continues its violent invasion of Ukraine. ""Just like the brave American soldiers which held their lines and fought back Hitler’s forces during the Christmas of 1944, brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing the same to Putin’s forces this Christmas,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Ladies and gentlemen, Americans, in two days we will celebrate Christmas. Maybe candlelit. Not because it’s more romantic, no, but because there will not be, there will be no electricity,"" he continued. ""We’ll celebrate Christmas. Celebrate Christmas and, even if there is no electricity, the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out."" The speech has drawn comparisons to Winston Churchill's address to Congress 81 years ago -- seeking U.S. help to repel the German invasion of Europe. ""On this special Christmastime, I want to thank you, all of you. I thank every American family which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to other people,"" Zelenskyy said. Biden's remarks Thursday also came as Senate lawmakers reach a deal on the massive $1.7 trillion government funding bill, which includes $45 billion to Ukraine. That funding has faced resistance from House Republicans, days before they take control of the chamber. The president spoke earlier in the day from the Oval Office with a warning on ""dangerous"" winter weather conditions impacting the country and encouraged anyone planning on traveling for the holidays to ""leave now"" before it gets worse.",7
2022-12-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-helps-biden-lay-markers-ukraine-support-note/story?id=95656752,Zelenskyy helps Biden lay down markers for Ukraine support: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The flurry of action by Democrats in the waning days of their united control of Washington could go down as a series of challenges to Republicans -- precedent-busting referrals and revelations that practically dare the GOP to take similar steps when they run the House. The scene Wednesday at the White House and the Capitol -- capping a surprise and dramatic trip by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- might amount to the most audacious and highest-stakes challenge yet to the incoming majority. With Zelenskyy by his side, President Joe Biden guaranteed the Ukrainian people directly: ""You will never stand alone."" Zelenskyy himself referred to the shifting political climate in Washington to offer his own assurance: ""Regardless of changes in the Congress, I believe that there will be bipartisan and bicameral support."" Beyond the triumphant and bipartisan welcome Zelenskyy received on Capitol Hill Wednesday night are raw Republican dynamics surrounding support for Ukraine. A scattered but growing group of Republicans object to continued financial help against Russia on either policy or fiscal grounds. Shortly before the midterm election, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy drew swift condemnation -- and offered some swift clarification -- when he said a GOP majority wouldn't provide a ""blank check"" to Ukraine. In his bid to secure the speakership, McCarthy needs the support of House members who agree with his original notion more than any clarification. ""No more blank checks to Ukraine,"" Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz. -- the main alternative to McCarthy putting himself forward for the speaker's job -- tweeted in advance of Zelenskyy's arrival. Questions of support for Ukraine are caught up in MAGA dynamics -- and the mere mention of ""Ukraine"" or ""Russia"" draws strong reactions from some based on the impeachment battle that preceded the current war. Among those criticizing Zelenskyy around his visit were Donald Trump Jr. and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who likened foreign aid to the American people being ""raped every day."" Support for Ukraine is stronger among Senate GOP leaders and key incoming House chairmen. Still, even the nearly $45 billion in additional Ukraine funding Biden touted on Wednesday is part of a year-end spending bill that McCarthy and House Republican leaders are rallying their side to oppose -- offering a hint of the new reality both Biden and Zelenskyy know is coming. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper New York congressman-elect George Santos has remained silent as questions continue to swirl about the validity of his life story. Now House Democrats say they will ""target"" that seat next cycle as they aim to win back the majority in 2024. Incoming Democratic House leadership slammed Santos during a press conference on Wednesday. ""Right now, George Santos appears to be in the witness protection program. No one can find him,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. ""He's hiding from legitimate questions that his constituents are asking."" Santos, a Republican, was elected in November to represent New York's 3rd Congressional District. He claimed to have been employed by Citigroup and Goldman Sachs and to have attended Baruch College and New York University. But those institutions told ABC News they couldn't confirm Santos' employment or attendance. The discrepancies were first reported by The New York Times as Santos' attorney accused the paper of a ""smear"" campaign. Jeffries on Wednesday suggested that Santos might not be seated while acknowledging that any such effort would need the buy-in of Republicans, namely Rep. McCarthy who is likely to lead the GOP's new majority. ""It's an open question to me as to whether this is the type of individual that the incoming majority should welcome to Congress. That's a question from Kevin McCarthy at this point in time,"" Jeffries said. House Republican leadership has, so far, remained silent on the issue. Santos' win, which flipped a seat red, helped the GOP clinch their narrow control of the House. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema After a short respite over the holidays, 2023 will usher in a new -- albeit smaller -- wave of campaigns that include three gubernatorial races across Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi. Kentucky and Mississippi will see more imminent political action as candidate filing deadlines fall on Jan. 6 and Feb. 1, respectively. Louisiana's deadline comes later in the year, on Aug. 10. Incumbent Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear already filed to run for reelection in what could be a challenging statewide environment for a red state Democrat. Beshear's 2019 victory over Republican Matt Bevin came down to less than half a percentage point while other Kentucky Democrats have floundered in subsequent elections. In 2020, Trump won Kentucky with 62% of the vote, then in November Sen. Rand Paul won reelection by a nearly identical margin. Ahead of the May 16 gubernatorial primary, a crowded Republican field is shaping up with at least six contenders joining the race hoping to face Beshear. Louisiana's Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards overcame similar political hurdles in his 2019 victory but is term-limited in 2023, which leaves the door open for Republican candidates to capitalize on an environment that favors their party. Republican state Attorney General Jeff Landry has already entered the race, and more contenders are sure to follow. Meanwhile in Mississippi, incumbent Republican Gov. Tate Reeves -- who won his 2019 election by only about 5 points -- has yet to announce a reelection bid. The uncertainty among the GOP there could offer Democrats the opportunity to consider trying to contest the race. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" podcast.

2022-12-22,https://abcnews.go.com/US/american-woman-released-same-day-griner-recounts-horror/story?id=95675778,'Nobody ever came': American woman released same day as Griner recounts horror of Russian captivity,"An American woman held in captivity in a Russian prison for most of this year says she was assaulted by an inmate and left without contact to the outside world. ""Nobody ever came,"" Sarah Krivanek said. Krivanek, who spoke to ABC News in an exclusive sit-down interview this week, was released Dec. 8, the same day that WNBA star Brittney Griner was released from Russian captivity. She said she is suffering PTSD and malnourishment she endured but had to check herself into a local hospital upon arrival back home. She is currently working with a trauma specialist. Watch the interview with Sarah Krivanek on ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday In a statement to ABC News, the State Department said, ""The U.S. Department of State and our embassies and consulates abroad have no greater priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas."" The statement added, ""U.S. Embassy Moscow provided assistance on the case of U.S. citizen Sarah Krivanek for more than a year. We monitored the case throughout the process, including attending deportation hearings. We coordinated with Russian authorities to facilitate Ms. Krivanek's safe return to the United States."" Krivanek disputes that claim and says that she was put on a commercial flight by deportation center agents from Russia and had to sign paperwork that required her to repay the U.S. government for the travel costs. She said she was given only $100 in cash and was forced to travel alone. She said she didn’t hear from anyone from the U.S. government during her imprisonment, except for a brief call that she made on a prison phone to a U.S. official who said they were working on her case and would send someone to visit her, but that visit did not occur. She only met with U.S. officials during her single deportation hearing. Krivanek, 46, had moved to Russia in 2017 to teach English. Fluent in both languages, she said she ended up enjoying a successful career teaching at elite schools in Moscow. Following a broken wedding engagement, she briefly lived with roommates, one of whom was a man who Krivanek said beat her. In December 2021, she was arrested and detained for attacking him with a knife that she said she used to defend herself. A trial in February without a jury resulted in a 15-month sentence to a Russian penal colony, a verdict even her attorney told her was extreme for the circumstances, she said. Krivanek said she believes she became ""a sacrifice"" for the Russians to use to send a warning to the U.S. about intervening in the conflict. ""I just fell into the system... at the wrong time,"" she said. ""Because it came on the heels of starting a war with Ukraine, they used this as leverage."" In the penal colony, located in the remote Oblast region of Russia, Krivanek said she faced harsh conditions: The colony consisted of ""old, run-down buildings from the Stalin era"" where she said she was forced to work in an asbestos-laden factory. There, she sewed fake flowers for use in cemeteries. Because the factory lacked air conditioning, a guard broke windows for ventilation in the summer. A small heater warmed the workers in the fall and winter months. She subsisted on a diet of cabbage and bread, she said. Being an American, she said, often made her a target among prison officials and other inmates. She said she witnessed sex trafficking, drug use and gambling throughout her entire stay. Blocked from using the official prison phone system at first, Krivanek said she initially used a smuggled cell phone to call the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. She said her seven-minute call was redirected to Washington where she told an operator her name and where she was located. The signal was lost immediately afterward. ""After that, I just had to pray and just hope that I had given them enough information to find me,"" she said. ""I didn't have anybody. No phone calls. No nothing. I'm left completely alone,"" he said. Krivanek's situation eventually earned the attention of Russia Behind Bars, an activist group based in Moscow that attempted to deliver items like clothing, toothpaste, and soap; representatives from the group tried to visit her, and during both visits, they were not allowed to see Krivanek in person, she said. Connecting the organization to Krivanek was Anita Martinez, whose friendship with Krivanek dates to 2008. Martinez, who lives outside Fresno, was also the last person to talk with her friend, having watched Krivanek get arrested on camera by Russian authorities when both women were on a FaceTime conversation together. ""I froze. I didn't know what to do. I was literally in a store in Fresno... and I'm standing in the store in shock,"" Martinez said. ""I thought, 'did she just get kidnapped? Like, what did I just see?'"" Martinez said she then began a long and difficult effort to get her friend released, which included contacting the embassy in Moscow, the State Department, and activist and media organizations. She said a State Department official told her that they were aware of Krivanek's location and were working on her release, but that they could not give her details because she didn't have permission from Krivanek to allow them to speak to her. ""No one would tell me anything,"" she said. The adjustment back to life in the U.S. has been difficult for both women. Krivanek said she is suffering from PTSD and is also dealing with the loss of her father who died when she was in Russia. She is now living with Martinez who said she was unprepared, financially and emotionally, to help her friend make the successful transition she needs to move forward in her life. A GoFundMe account has been established to help Krivanek pay back the U.S. government loan, and Martinez has been helping her get medical care and therapy. Krivanek said she owes her friend her freedom: ""Anita's just tough as nails. I knew that nobody could walk all over her and that if she had her mind set to something, she was going to get it."" Nine months after her arrest, on Sept. 1, Krivanek received an email in prison that changed her life. It was from Martinez, asking about her condition. ""I was just about to give up,"" Krivanek said. ""And I got that letter and freaked out. I'm like, 'they found me. They found me.'""",22

The U.S. swapped the WNBA star for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout on Dec. 8. Griner on Wednesday thanked all the families who ""supported the We are BG Campaign to bring me home,"" adding that now ""it's our turn to support"" other Americans wrongly detained in Russia. Whelan, a former marine, has been held in Russia since 2018, when he was detained in Moscow by Russia's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service. ""I hope you'll join me in writing to Paul Whelan and continuing to advocate for other Americans to be rescued and returned to their families,"" Griner wrote. She included a mailing address for Whelan, care of the Department of State in Washington. Griner finished her letter: ""Thank you again from the bottom of my heart.

2022-12-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-17t-spending-bill-including-ukraine-aid/story?id=95708550,"Senate passes $1.7T spending bill, including Ukraine aid, getting one step closer to averting shutdown","The Senate on Thursday reached a last-minute deal on a sprawling $1.7 trillion package to keep the government funded through the next fiscal year -- and send more aid to Ukraine -- while getting one step closer to averting a shutdown just before Christmas. The chamber voted 68-29 to pass the omnibus spending bill after speeding through votes on 17 amendments. Eighteen Republicans joined Democrats in approving the bill that would keep federal agencies operational through Sept. 30, 2023. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, in a news conference after the vote, said it took ""a lot of hard work, a lot of compromise, but we funded the government with an aggressive investment in American families, American workers, American national defense."" ""It is one of the most significant appropriations packages we've done in a really long time,"" Schumer said. The legislation will now go to the House for approval before making its way to President Joe Biden's desk. The administration has signed off on the package despite it not including everything White House officials requested, such as more COVID-19 funding. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had said at her weekly press conference that the ""hope"" was the House could pass the bill on Thursday night but noted it takes several hours for it to pass between chambers. But later Thursday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the chamber will vote on the omnibus bill Friday, giving members enough time to go through the text. The House will reconvene as early as 9 a.m. ET. Lawmakers have been scrambling to get the bill across the finish line both before Friday's midnight deadline and before a powerful winter storm unleashes blizzard conditions and severe cold, making their travel home difficult. The legislation includes disaster relief, medical services for military veterans, a ban of the use of TikTok on government-issued devices and reforms to the Electoral Count Act to avoid a repeat of the Jan. 6 attack. Also included is $45 billion in humanitarian, economic and security assistance for Ukraine amid Russia's ongoing invasion. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a historic visit to Washington on Wednesday to make the case for continued aid, amid some calls from Republicans for more oversight, telling U.S. lawmakers the money ""isn't charity."" ""It's an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,"" Zelenskyy said. Schumer announced Thursday morning an agreement had been struck to expedite the process of passing the omnibus spending bill. ""I would say that the omnibus was an appropriate metaphor for the last two years ... a lot of ups and downs but in the end a great result that really helped the American people,"" Schumer said after the bill was passed. Negotiations had hit a snag over an amendment from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, that would have reinstated Title 42 -- the Trump-era order used to rapidly expel migrants since the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak on the basis of public health concerns. A federal judge had ordered Title 42 to expire earlier this week, but Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily paused that ruling as the justices considers a request from Republican-led states to keep the policy in place. Enough Democratic senators supported Lee's Title 42 amendment that it likely would have passed -- and doomed the whole bill to fail in the House, where the amendment doesn't have the same backing. To push the legislation forward, Democratic leadership crafted a workaround by voting on two amendments related to Title 42. One brought forward by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester would've preserved Title 42 but included money for humanitarian assistance and border security and required 60 votes to pass. The other, brought forward by Lee, required 51 votes to pass. Neither Title 42-related amendment passed. But several of the other proposed amendments did pass and will be included in the version of the omnibus bill being sent to the House. Those amendments include the PUMP Act, which expands breastfeeding accommodations in the workplace, and the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which ensures people with limitations related to pregnancy or childbirth are not forced out of the workplace. Senators also approved an amendment that will allow states and local jurisdictions to repurpose COVID-19 relief money for infrastructure, disaster relief or other issues. A measure known as 9/11 Responder and Survivor Health Funding Correction Act that funds a shortfall in the 9/11 first responder fund called the World Trade Center Healthcare Program was also passed as an amendment to the omnibus bill, as was a bill to authorize $2.7 billion in compensation payments to the families of victims of the 9/11 terror attacks, the Beirut Marine barracks bombing and all victims of terrorism.

2022-12-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-passes-17t-spending-bill-sending-measure-biden/story?id=95747819,"House passes $1.7T spending bill, sending measure to Biden, averting shutdown","The House on Friday passed a sweeping $1.7 trillion spending bill that will keep the government from running out of money at midnight and send an additional $45 billion to Ukraine. The measure now goes to President Joe Biden for his signature. The bill passed 225-201 with nine Republicans -- Reps. John Katko of New York, Chris Jacobs of New York, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Fred Upton of Michigan, Rodney Davis of Illinois, Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington and Steve Womack of Arkansas -- supporting the bill. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York voted 'no' and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., voted 'present.' ""This bill is a critically important piece of legislation not only to keep our government funded, keep our people being served but also to show that the United States of America's government works,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said ahead of the vote. ""I ask all my colleagues to join me in voting 'yes,' showing the world that we will never remain idle in the face of those who believe they can terrorize civilians, devour our territory and commit more crimes with impunity,"" he said, countering skepticism some Republicans have voiced about continued high-levels of funding to support Ukraine. President Biden, who said in a statement just after passage that he'd sign the bill into law ""as soon as it reaches my desk,"" applauded its bipartisan support. ""This bill is further proof that Republicans and Democrats can come together to deliver for the American people, and I’m looking forward to continued bipartisan progress in the year ahead,"" he said. Biden signed a short-term funding bill into law later on Friday, officially averting a government shutdown ahead of the midnight deadline and giving legislators on Capitol Hill enough time to get the spending bill processed and ready for his signature sometime in the coming days. House Republican leaders had told GOP members to vote against the bill. As the last bill Democrats will pass while controlling the House before the GOP takes control of the House on Jan. 3, it was considered in a mostly empty chamber -- over half of House members filed proxy letters -- allowing them to vote remotely -- after making it home ahead of treacherous winter storms set to disrupt travel before the holidays. Some House Republicans, including current House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy R-Calif., had called for punting the issue to the new Congress. ""This is a monstrosity that is one of the most shameful acts I've seen in this body. The appropriations process failed the American public, and there's no greater example of the nail in the coffin of the greatest failure of a one-party rule,"" McCarthy said in a nearly 25-minute floor speech Friday, telling the body he would be a 'no' vote. He said the omnibus spends ""too much, increasing the deficit and fueling more inflation,"" adding, ""Why is the majority of Democrats not even here if it's so good?"" As he finished, he said, ""In eleven days this all changes. We are going to reclaim this body's integrity and service to the American people. After this institution covers itself in disgrace, disgrace one last time under Democrat one-party rule. A new direction is coming. In eleven days, Republicans will deliver."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in her final floor speech, called out McCarthy for his remarks. ""It was sad to hear the Minority Leader earlier say that this legislation is the most shameful thing to be seen on the House floor in this Congress,"" she said. ""I can't help but wonder -- has he forgotten about January 6?"" Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday she was hopeful the bill could pass that night, before lawmaker absences due to weather and the Christmas holiday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had announced earlier on Thursday an accelerated process for passing the spending bill. The House vote was pushed back to early on Friday, according to Hoyer, in order for members to get a chance to dissect the wide-ranging package. Still, McCarthy said on the House floor on Friday, members had little time to read the bill. The vote came after the Senate struck a last-hour deal on Thursday to pass a version of the sprawling spending package, speeding through votes on 17 amendments that included both victories and compromises from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. It also came two days behind Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's historic appeal to a joint meeting of Congress, imploring lawmakers for the $45 billion in military, humanitarian and security money he claimed wasn't ""charity"" but a contribution to the success of democracy abroad. The bill keeps doors open for federal agencies through Sept. 30, 2023, and is set to head to President Joe Biden's desk upon its expected passage despite some anticipated repudiation from a handful of GOP House members. ""Over two thirds and the United States Senate stood and said it is time to do our duty. And they did not because each and every one of those senators thought that this bill was perfect, it is not,"" Hoyer said. The legislation includes an increase in defense spending and military and civilian federal employee pay, disaster relief, medical services for military veterans, a ban of the use of TikTok on government-issued devices and reforms to the Electoral Count Act to avoid a repeat of Jan. 6 and attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Senate passage of the bill did not include all requests from White House officials, such as additional COVID funding and an expanded Child Tax Credit. It also did not include an amendment from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, that would have kept in place Title 42, a pandemic-era policy which allows the expulsion of migrants on public health grounds that expired this week despite legal challenges waged by Republicans against its rollback. Another Title 42 amendment, introduced by Sen. Krysten Sinema, I-Ariz., and Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., also failed. Still, Biden praised the legislation in his statement on Friday, highlighting it's advancement of cancer and other disease research through his ARPA-H initiative, investment in community policing and further funding the Violence Against Women Act, among other tenants of the bill, like relief aid, Ukraine funding and veteran health care expansion. ""The bipartisan funding bill advances key priorities for our country and caps off a year of historic bipartisan progress for the American people,"" he said. ""I want to thank Senator Leahy, Senator Shelby, and Chairwoman DeLauro for their tireless work to get this done. Neither side got everything it wanted in this agreement – that’s what happens in a negotiation."" Several additional amendments did pass, including two that expand pregnancy and breastfeeding accommodations and security in the workplace as well as a measure known as the 9/11 Responder and Survivor Health Funding Correction Act that funds a shortfall in the 9/11 first responder fund called the World Trade Center Healthcare Program. The amendment funds the program for another five years and authorizes $2.7 billion in compensation payments to the families of 9/11 victims, the Beirut Marine barracks bombing and other acts of terrorism. –ABC News' Alexandra Hutzler, Mariam Khan, Trish Turner and Allie Pecorin contributed to this report.",26
2022-12-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/title-42-contributes-increased-migration-numbers-data-suggests/story?id=95616742,"Title 42 actually contributes to increased migration numbers, data suggests","Authorities at the southern border have been arresting, detaining and removing migrants at the border more times in the past year than ever before in U.S. history. Much of that work has been done under the Title 42 public health order, implemented in the early days of COVID-19, which allows for the rapid expulsion of migrants without opportunities to apply for asylum. While Republicans have insisted Title 42 should remain in place as a means of handling the record numbers, mounting evidence indicates the protocol actually contributes to that very issue. Over the past several years, a groundswell of migration has built up throughout Central and South America with many people waiting for the end of pandemic-era restrictions like Title 42. Legal battles between mostly GOP-led states, the federal government and civil liberties advocates have delayed the end of Title 42. Changing demographics of those seeking to cross -- with more coming from countries that do not accept U.S. migrant removal flights -- have also limited the effectiveness of Title 42. ABC contributor John Cohen served as the head of intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security as the Biden administration was preparing its plan earlier this year for the end of Title 42. At the time, Cohen said, the department estimated there were 4 to 6 million people migrating throughout Central and South America. Based on the latest Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, only a fraction of those have attempted to cross into the U.S. so far. ""Over the course of the last four years, this population of people seeking to come to the United States has formed south of the border and they are going to come right whether Title 42 remains in place or not,"" Cohen said. Republicans and federal law enforcement officials alike, however, have warned of a massive increase in migration upon the lifting of the Title 42 order, which could strain -- and potentially exhaust -- the Border Patrol and the communities where migrants choose to settle. The elimination of the hardline measure, they say, would invite unprecedented numbers of people to seek refuge in the U.S. regardless of the validity of their claims. However, a rare in-depth look at Border Patrol data reveals evidence that the end of Title 42 could in fact reduce border crossings long-term and ease the burden on the immigration system while allowing migrants to make legally authorized humanitarian claims. CBP measures unauthorized migration at the southern border with a monthly tally of encounters, which includes arrests made by Border Patrol and people who voluntarily give themselves up to immigration authorities. These records represent interactions CBP officials have with migrants. Under Title 42, there have been more than ever before in U.S. history. The numbers of encounters are often misconstrued as a record of individual migrants. But the tally of encounters doesn't account for migrants who illegally cross multiple times -- one person could be counted as multiple encounters. And since Title 42 is not an immigration policy, there are no legal consequences for getting expelled, unlike for those processed under long-standing U.S. immigration law. Nearly half of all people processed under Title 42 in budget year 2021 – the first full year the policy was in effect -- had previously tried to cross into the U.S., according to Border Patrol data obtained by ABC News. By comparison, those processed under Title 8, the standard immigration authority which has consequences for repeat offenses, had a recidivist rate of just 3%. The disproportionate amount of recidivism appears to have continued into this year, when 44% of those processed under Title 42 had a prior crossing attempt on record, according to the latest available data reviewed by ABC News. However, the number of migrants who were arrested and turned themselves in was significantly higher, at 914,588 in budget year 2021, compared to pre-pandemic years when that number topped out at 608,000, according to Border Patrol numbers. Now contending with a war in Ukraine, concerns about crime and instability in Latin America that continues to drive people north, the Biden administration has run into a resource crunch with little wiggle room to handle the growing diaspora arriving in the southwest, observers said. ""It is a massive problem that requires a comprehensive approach involving federal, state, local governments and non-government entities,"" Cohen said. ""And the challenge is that it's such a politically polarized issue."" While a viable solution from the White House and Congress hasn't materialized -- given the policy divisions -- the Department of Homeland Security has been working on overdrive to process the record number of those apprehended along the southwest this past year. During budget year 2022, DHS deported or expelled 1.4 million migrants under both Title 42 and the primary immigration process of Title 8. Thousands of new staff, nearly a dozen new semi-permanent facilities, a doubling of transportation capacity and a request for Congress to provide additional security funding are all components of the department's multi-pronged approach to handle a historic level of migration. CBP can comfortably handle around 3,500 unauthorized migrant encounters per day, one current and one former official told ABC News. But the El Paso region alone saw more than two-thirds that rate in the recent surge that began earlier this month. The strain on authorities and humanitarian aid workers was apparent. A video released by Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales showed an overcrowded processing facility where migrants were huddled with mylar blankets side by side on the floor. CBP countered the migration by transferring people out of the area while bringing in staff from less impacted regions. Overall, nearly 10,000 migrants were moved out of the El Paso area in a matter of days, including roughly 3,400 who were deported or expelled. The situation in El Paso has been extreme, especially for local officials who continue to struggle with providing aid to those who remain in the city. But the El Paso Border Patrol sector is just one part of a nearly 2,000-mile stretch that will serve as the destination for many who are part of current intercontinental migration trends across Central and South America. Migration patterns have been changing, creating added challenges in the efforts to deport those who do not qualify for humanitarian protection. In fiscal year 2022, for the first time in history, U.S. authorities saw more unauthorized crossings by people from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela than from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Two-decade inflation highs in Columbia and Peru, where more than 3.5 million Venezuelans live, contributed to their migration, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank. Disputed elections in Nicaragua and the targeting of political candidates drove people out of that country and across Central America, MPI said in a recent report. ""There is just this huge number of people -- displaced people -- who are in this region,"" Cohen said. ""So it's not just a U.S. issue. While they may want to come to the U.S., it's an issue that's going to impact other countries, particularly Mexico, and Central American countries and so they need to be a part of the solution as well."" And that's where Title 42 has shortcomings, too. Even if a home country agrees to accept the swift return of their citizens from the U.S., many have already been displaced elsewhere in Central and South America for years. These populations are often prime targets for smugglers who make false promises and exploit those in vulnerable situations. Collaborations between Homeland Security, the Justice Department and international partners have resulted in more than 6,500 arrests related to human smuggling, government officials said. Human smuggling cases require hundreds of hours to investigate and a deep dive into what are often vast networks of organized criminals seeking to exploit migrants, San Antonio Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agent in Charge Craig Larrabee told ABC News on Tuesday. ""So we sometimes start in the middle -- sometimes you start at the top -- sometimes you start all around. But regardless, the idea is to create a process, an investigative strategy, to identify everybody,"" Larrabee said. HSI, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is the country's principal agency for tracking down smugglers and helping those who find themselves in the throes of illicit operations run by transnational criminal organizations with immense resources. The government believes the stakes have never been higher for ICE HSI as the Biden administration attempts to reign in illegal migration across the southwest while protecting victims fleeing persecution. The scope and sophistication of smuggling operations has ramped up exponentially in recent years. Fifteen to 20 years ago, it was common to find family-operated smuggling rings charging $2,000-3,000 per migrant, Larrabee said. But now, much larger organizations are charging upwards of $8,000. ""That's a huge amount of money,"" Larrabee said. ""Now, that money is spread out among many different people in the organization -- but those numbers continue to go up depending on where you're coming from too."" The organizations that run human smuggling rings operate across borders and are tied to criminal groups that can freely move through Mexican border towns, Larrabee said. In areas where the U.S.-Mexico border is impossible to block with a physical barrier -- including the middle of the Rio Grande -- migrants are able to attempt dangerous repeat crossings when they are sent back under Title 42. The same conditions that allow smugglers to operate freely along the Mexican side also expose migrants to extortion, assault and sexual abuse, according to government officials. The State Department urges people to avoid or reconsider travel to most of the Mexican border region and human rights groups have for years documented exceptionally high rates of violence with migrants as the targets.",12

2022-12-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/whelan-family-biden-officials-mark-anniversary-former-marines/story?id=95891725,"Whelan family, Biden officials mark anniversary of former Marine's detention in Russia","Marking the four-year anniversary of Paul Whelan's detention in Russia, the Biden administration vowed on Wednesday to continue efforts to bring the former Marine home. Whelan is serving a 16-year sentence at a Russian penal colony for espionage charges that the United States and his family say are baseless. ""His detention remains unacceptable, and we continue to press for his immediate release at every opportunity,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Wednesday. ""I am committed to bringing home Paul and all U.S. hostages and wrongful detainees held around the world. As the President said directly to the Whelan family, our efforts to secure Paul's release will not cease until he is back home with his family where he belongs."" The White House's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, similarly said Wednesday that officials ""will not stop, we will not relent, we will not cease until all Americans can celebrate Paul's return."" The administration faced some criticism for failing to secure Whelan's release after WNBA star Brittney Griner -- who had been detained in Russia since February on drug charges -- was freed earlier this month in a prisoner swap for the convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was serving a prison sentence in the U.S. U.S. officials had said they tried to trade Bout for both Griner and Whelan but Russia was not negotiating in good faith when it came to Whelan, who went on to work in corporate security after the Marines and who was arrested in a Moscow hotel in 2018 while visiting the country for a wedding. ""Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul's case differently than Brittney's,"" President Joe Biden said as he announced Griner's release in remarks delivered from the Roosevelt Room on Dec. 8. It was either bring Griner home or no one, Biden said then. Griner returned to the U.S. and was reunited with her wife, Cherelle, on Dec. 9. Griner later asked her supporters to advocate for Whelan's release, saying their efforts made an impact on her case. ""Together, we can do hard things. I am living proof of that,"" Griner wrote in a handwritten note posted to her Instagram account. At the time of Griner's release, the Whelan family expressed support for the basketball star but said they were worried about his future and angry at Russia for, in their view, using him as a bargaining chip. On Wednesday, Whelan's brother, David Whelan, also spoke out about the four-year anniversary of his detention. ""How do you mark such an awful milestone when there is no resolution in sight?"" he said. ""It is both awful and mundane, just another day that Paul has to suffer in a Russian labor colony for being in the wrong place at the wrong time."" ""Another day that our parents have to suffer without being able to see or be with their son. It is both a culmination of lost life -- four years of missed birthdays, Christmases, and other experiences -- and also not an end point. It's merely a marker of their suffering, not an indicator that the suffering will come to an end before another milestone, another year passes,"" he continued. David Whelan expressed gratitude for the government's continued efforts to bring Paul Whelan home. ""Hopefully these efforts will be successful,"" he said. ""Hopefully Paul will be able to stop by our parent's home and visit them, free at last, before another milestone passes. On milestones, sometimes all you have is hope.""

2022-12-29,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-signs-17t-government-spending-bill-ensuring-funding/story?id=95934378,"Biden signs $1.7T government spending bill, ensuring funding for most of 2023","President Joe Biden Thursday signed the omnibus spending bill into law while on vacation, extending funding for the government into next year. Biden, on vacation in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, signed the $1.7 trillion into law to avoid a government shutdown and provide funding for the federal government through September. The legislation, which provides $773 billion for non-defense discretionary spending and $858 billion for defense spending, marks victories for both parties. ""Today, I signed the bipartisan omnibus bill, ending a year of historic progress,"" Biden tweeted. ""It'll invest in medical research, safety, veteran health care, disaster recovery, VAWA funding – and gets crucial assistance to Ukraine. Looking forward to more in 2023."" Democrats were able to move the bill over the finish line despite near universal opposition by House Republicans, who are set to retake the chamber next month. And Republicans can tout the fact that defense outweighs non-defense spending after Democrats had pushed for parity. ""In eleven days this all changes. We are going to reclaim this body's integrity and service to the American people. After this institution covers itself in disgrace, disgrace one last time under Democrat one-party rule. A new direction is coming. In eleven days, Republicans will deliver,"" House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California, who is seeking to become speaker in the next Congress, said just before the House considered the spending bill. ""This bill is further proof that Republicans and Democrats can come together to deliver for the American people, and I’m looking forward to continued bipartisan progress in the year ahead,"" Biden said in his own statement after the House passed the bill in a 225-201 vote last week. Democratic and Republican appropriators faced a rocky process to craft the omnibus in the final days before the winter holiday recess, and Congress was forced to pass multiple stopgap spending bills to prevent a government shutdown. Disagreements over several issues, including immigration, funding to Ukraine and even the location of the FBI's new headquarters, snarled the negotiations, but ultimately the two parties came to the $1.7 trillion compromise. Included within the bill are $40 billion in funding to support Ukraine against Russia's invasion, $38 billion in emergency disaster assistance, a ban on TikTok on federal government phones and the Electoral Count Reform Act, which makes it more difficult for members of Congress to challenge the results of a presidential election.",26
