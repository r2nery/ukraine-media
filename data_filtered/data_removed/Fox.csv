It’s an American tradition: Overdo it ringing in the new year and wake up a splitting headache. And if you behaved responsibly? No need to feel left out. The big bad world out there promises to give us all plenty of headaches throughout 2022. There are the carry-over hot spots of course: the Korean , Crimea, Taiwan. Things could explode there almost any time. But trouble is brewing elsewhere, too, and not always in the places we’d most expect. Here are five problem areas to keep an eye on throughout the new year. 5 2021 Latin America, Leaning Left Peru, Honduras and now Chile have elected governments intent on making a hard left turn. For those countries, that can open the gates to economic malaise, Chinese encroachment and terrorism. And it could create a lot of headaches here, as well: increased drug smuggling, illegal immigration and crime. And, with national elections coming up in Brazil and Colombia, things could get worse. Russia’s bad boy is like a Vegas gambler playing a dozen slots at the same time. Unfortunately, the Southern Hemisphere’s lurch to the left comes at a time of weak leadership in Washington. The Biden administration has thus far proven inept at everything in Latin America, except insulting and degrading the few friendly and supportive regimes like Guatemala. Over the next year, adversarial regimes around the world will look at Latin America and Biden’s wide-open border and see a tempting and exposed flank ready to be exploited. Terminator Terrorists In places like Afghanistan, transnational terrorists have more and larger sanctuaries than they did in 2021. Afghanistan is but Exhibit A. And conciliatory moves by the Biden administration have only strengthened and emboldened the world’s number one sponsor of terrorism. Throw in that previously mentioned wide-open border, and it’s easy to see how another 9/11 can be in our not-so-distant future. Also be on the lookout for a new wrinkle in terrorist attacks: drones. They are now common coin in conflict zones everywhere. It’s only a matter of time before terrorists use them to target innocents. Out of Africa Thanks to its Belt and Road Initiative, China is already firmly established throughout Africa. Beijing’s malignant influence is exacerbating the continent’s long-standing problems of poor governance, lack of economic freedom and deteriorating public safety. All of this leads to oppression and instability. Mass migration, often triggered by the desire to escape armed conflict, is greater than ever. And the mass migration creates even more space and opportunity for terrorists, extremists and sophisticated criminal networks. This vicious cycle is not an ""over there"" problem. What is coming out of Africa is already impacting Europe, the Middle East and the Western Hemisphere. Putin Poker Russia’s bad boy is like a Vegas gambler playing a dozen slots at the same time. Everyone is watching Ukraine today, but Putin has chaos and mayhem in play in Moldova, Georgia, the Balkans and several other places as well. Odds are that Putin will wait until after the Beijing Olympics in February before rolling the dice on another serious assault on solidarity. But it’s a sucker’s bet to think we’ll go an entire year without Putin kicking up dust somewhere. White House Wilt How long can Biden limp along with the lethargic, inept team he has running national security and foreign policy? So far, the only personnel shake-ups he has made involve the Oval Office dog and a cat. With a domestic agenda on life support, a looming midterm election massacre and global problems galore, can Biden really afford to keep this lame team on the roster? Changes are well in order. But that raises the question: If Biden does bring in new people, will U.S. polices get better or worse?",22
2022-01-12,https://www.foxnews.com/world/senate-democrats-bill-sanctions-russian-aggression-ukraine-pipeline,Senate Democrats introduce bill with sanctions on Russian aggression against Ukraine,"Fox News reporter Amy Kellogg on U.S.-Russia talks as tensions grow over Ukraine Senate Democrats on Wednesday unveiled a bill to sanction Russia should it take any action over Ukraine in an effort to counter Sen. Ted Cruz’s own measure on the issue. The Biden administration has backed the newest bill, which includes measures to strengthen Ukraine’s border security and sanction top Russian officials – even President Vladimir Putin. ""This legislation makes it absolutely clear that the U.S. Senate will not stand idly by as the Kremlin threatens a re-invasion of Ukraine,"" Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who introduced the bill, said in a statement. Committee chairman Sen. Bob Menendez, D-, questions Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Tuesday, Sept. 14, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington. Blinken was questioned about the Biden administration's handling of the U.S. withdraw from Afghanistan. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., praised the measure as a way to ensure that Russia understands ""any further aggression against Ukraine will be met by severe penalties."" ""This bill makes crystal clear in advance that Putin and Russia will face punishing consequences if he makes the drastic miscalculation to invade Ukraine and further infringe on its sovereignty,"" Hollen said in a statement. The Washington Post wrote that the bill would impose ""sweeping"" sanctions against top Russian officials as well as key banking institutions if Russia attempted any hostile action against Ukraine. The bill would also target Russian companies that offer secure messaging systems, potentially compromising financial institutions even further. ""Putin need not collapse his entire economy nor does he need to sacrifice the lives of his own people in a futile attempt to rewrite the map of Europe,"" Menendez said. : Russian President Vladimir Putin gives a thumbs-up as he attends a foundation-laying ceremony for the third reactor of the Akkuyu nuclear plant in Turkey, via a video link in Moscow, Russia March 10, 2021. But the bill’s true purpose would be to serve as an alternative to Texas Senator Cruz’s bill, which would punish Russia over the activation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Critics of the pipeline argue that it would lead to a greater European reliance on Russian resources, providing Putin with a stronger hand in any future negotiations. The Cruz bill would aim to punish companies linked to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which carries gas from Russia to Germany. Cruz agreed to release several Biden nominees in exchange for a vote on his bill, but some senators said that the administration made a persuasive argument that the Cruz bill could harm relations with a fledgling German administration at a critical time. , : ‘ ,’ German officials remain divided over the matter of the pipeline, with one official in December warning Russia of ""severe consequences"" to the pipeline if Russia attacked Ukraine while another official this week urged politicians to ""leave the behind us."" Kevin Keuhnert, the Secretary General of the Social Democratic Party , said discussion of any sanctions against Russia needed to remain separate from any issue regarding Nord Stream 2, according to Reuters. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivers a speech during a meeting of the German federal parliament, Bundestag, at the Reichstag building in Berlin, Germany, Wednesday, Dec. 15, 2021. ""Everything in me resists the idea of conflicts being conjured up just to bury a controversial project,"" Kuehnert said. Nord Stream 2’s activation appears a foregone conclusion after the Biden administration waived sanctions against the pipeline early in 2021. - ""These sanctions would do more harm than good,"" James Roberts, research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. ""The Biden administration already capitulated to Russia a year ago when they allowed the Nord Stream 2 to go forward, which the Trump administration had blocked. That was the leverage that counted."" Roberts argued that as soon as the German public grows reliant on the pipeline, any attempt to shut it down will only prove damaging. And the sanctions aren’t likely to put Russia in any tight spot, despite the ongoing situation in Kazakhstan. ""In terms of that being something that would tie Putin’s hands? I don’t think so,"" Roberts said. ""Putin’s made real threats of war on the European continent for the first time since 1945, and he’s getting the attention that he’s apparently been seeking.""",13
2022-01-13,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chief-of-naval-operations-says-continuing-resolutions-leave-force-less-ready-to-deal-with-threats-from-abroad,Chief of Naval Operations says continuing resolutions and inflation are damaging readiness,"Chief Of Naval Operations Admiral Michael M. Gilday issued a stark warning to lawmakers about the dangers of funding the military under continuing resolutions, testifying that the lack of a stable and predictable budget will harm the Navy's ability to confront adversaries, such as China and Russia. Part of the issue with continuing resolutions is inflation, which chips away at the Department of Defense's budget if spending levels fail to keep pace. That problem is even more pronounced this year, with the latest numbers showing inflation jumped to a nearly 40-year high last month. ""Back here, there is little evidence that we have grasped the reality that our security and way of life are being threatened, as we come before you four months into another to plead for steady, predictable funding,"" Gilday said in testimony to the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense Wednesday. The U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer Lassen. -19 Gilday told lawmakers that it is ""critical time for our country,"" pointing to the advances made by China and Russia and warning that the Navy will have a hard time keeping pace and could soon ""turn incremental gains into long-term strategic advantages."" At issue is the growing trend for Congress to pass continuing resolutions, a short-term measure that continues to temporarily fund the government at previous spending levels, instead of coming to an agreement on a full-year appropriations bill. While Congress passed and President Biden signed the fiscal 2022 Defense Authorization Act, that money must now be authorized by a full appropriations bill. But leaders in Washington have not been able to come to an agreement on a fiscal year 2022 budget, with Biden signing the second continuing resolution of the fiscal year to avoid a government shutdown last month. That continuing resolution funded the government through Feb. 18, but some worry that differences in Congress could open up the prospect of funding the government through continuing resolutions for the entire fiscal year. Such an approach would severely hamper military readiness, Department of Defense leaders such as Gilday have warned, effectively freezing funding levels and making it more difficult for the military to invest in future projects vital to national defense. U.S. Capitol building. /Jason Reed s -19 Association of the U.S. Navy Director Jason Beardsley told Fox News Wednesday that inflation and other rising costs make it difficult for the Navy to focus on long-term projects and training, saying that operating under continuing resolutions will undermine the Navy's ability to compete with ""near-peer"" rivals, such as China and Russia. Beardsley pointed to the Navy's goal of reaching 355 ships, a number Congress passed into law because it was identified as the amount needed to ""contain or compete"" with China. Yet operating under continuing resolutions means the Navy has to allocate its resources sparingly, leading to an inability to invest in future equipment and training. ""We're falling even further behind,"" Beardsley said. ""So that doesn't just stop us from investing forward, but it makes us compromise to keep up. So now we're keeping up with last year's mission, but we've lost more money."" Beardsley pointed to a spate of events that have plagued the Navy in recent years, including back-to-back incidents in 2017 that saw Navy ships collide with commercial vessels, arguing that training will continue to suffer if the Navy does not receive stable funding. Meantime, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Brown, Jr. warned lawmakers that another continuing resolution ""would stall much of the progress we are making towards today’s readiness and tomorrow’s modernization."" An Air Force Joint Strike Fighter is towed back to its hangar at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla. Brown also warned that money was not the only issue at hand, noting that the Air Force will never get back the time that could have been spent keeping pace with the country's military rivals. ""As much as a year-long Continuing Resolution affects our Air Force fiscally, the impact it has to our rate of change is more shattering,"" Brown said in his testimony. ""All the money in the world cannot buy more time; time is irrecoverable, and when you are working to keep pace against well-resourced and focused competitors, time matters.""",22
2022-01-18,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-democrats-mcconnell-fake-hysteria-jim-crow-relic-filibuster-flip-flops,McConnell accuses Dems of 'fake hysteria' over 'Jim Crow relic' filibuster they used last week,"Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton explains that Republicans are defending the Constitution and the voices of all Americans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Tuesday accused Democrats of pushing ""fake hysteria"" over the allegedly racist ""Jim Crow relic"" filibuster, which they defended for years and used as recently as last week. ""Let's spell this out,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said. ""Democrats want the American people to believe the filibuster was not a Jim Crow relic in 2005, was not even a Jim Crow relic in 2020, just miraculously became a Jim Crow relic in 2021, just briefly stopped being a Jim Crow relic last Thursday, but it's now back to being a Jim Crow relic this week."" McConnell was the first Republican to speak after Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., opened floor debate on two major Democrat-backed election bills. Republicans are expected to oppose block those bills using the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold for legislation. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, walks to the Senate floor at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, on Tuesday, Jan. 18, 2022. : ‘ ’ Schumer says he'll force a vote to change the filibuster if that happens. He says it's not fair Republicans can pass election laws via a simple majority on the state level but Democrats can't do the same in the Senate. But McConnell detailed several instances in which Democrats supported and used the Senate filibuster over a period of nearly two decades. He cited a letter from a conglomeration of left-leaning activist groups supporting the filibuster in 2005 – the same year Schumer himself made an impassioned defense of the practice. ‘ ’ : McConnell also said that Democrats used the filibuster repeatedly during former President Donald Trump's term, including on the 2020 police reform bill from Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., before denouncing it last year, and then suddenly taking advantage of a 60-vote threshold to block a bill for sanctions against Russia last week. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., is seated before a Senate Rules and Administration Committee oversight hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 5, 2022, in Washington. Schumer is going to push a vote to change the Senate filibuster that is almost guaranteed to fail. ""There were 55 votes to pass the bill,"" McConnell said of the legislation to impose sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The bill had the support of 49 Republicans and six Democrats. ""But Democrats blocked it by denying 60,"" McConnell said. ""Many of the same colleagues have spent weeks thundering… that the Senate's 60-vote threshold is an offensive tool of obstruction, a Jim Crow relic, declaring that simple majorities should always get their way. But late last week they literally wielded the 60-vote threshold themselves,"" McConnell said. ""A useful reminder of just how fake, fake, the hysteria has been."" The Nord Stream 2 bill did not come up under the Senate's normal filibuster, which requires 60 votes to start or end debate on a bill before a simple-majority vote on passage. , Democrats agreed to allow a fast-track final passage vote on the bill, pushed by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in exchange for Cruz's cooperation in confirming some presidential nominees. But Democrats set the threshold for Cruz's bill to pass at 60-votes, creating the same effect as a traditional filibuster. And they took advantage of it to block the legislation with a minority of senators. McConnell also attacked the election bills underlying Schumer's filibuster push as ""not in any way successors of the civil rights legislation from the mid-twentieth century."" Pipes for the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline are stored on the premises of the port of Mukran near Sassnitz, Germany, on Dec. 4, 2020. Democrats filibustered a bill to sanction individuals associated with the pipeline last week. ""Targeting Americans' online speech and sending government money to political campaigns is not about civil rights. It's about tilting the playing field,"" McConnell said Tuesday. ""Weakening wildly popular voter laws and making it harder to produce accurate voter rolls is not about making voting easier. It's about making cheating easier."" Schumer, meanwhile, says Republicans' votes on the election bills will mark their choice of ""which side they stand on: Protecting democracy or offering their implicit endorsement of Donald Trump's big lie."" And on the filibuster vote, which is almost certain to fail because Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., oppose changing it, Schumer said he'll call the vote anyway. ""When this chamber confronts a question this important... you don't slide it off the table and say, ‘nevermind,’"" he said. ""Win, lose or draw members of this chamber were elected to debate and to vote... And the public is entitled to know where each senator stands on an issue as sacrosanct as defending our democracy.""",13

A bipartisan group of senators concluded a trip to Ukraine Tuesday after meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other top officials to reaffirm U.S. support of the former Soviet nation following stalled talks with Russia last week. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, led the delegation to show that the U.S. is ""united across party lines in support of Ukraine against Putin’s belligerence,"" Shaheen said Tuesday. Shaheen said lawmakers will look to forge a ""path forward in Congress to respond to the political situation in Ukraine and Eastern Europe that safeguards Ukraine’s territorial integrity, Europe’s energy security and broader regional stability."" ""Efforts are underway to enhance our laws that will empower the Biden administration with tools to work with our allies to prepare penalties for Putin amid his provocations, and increase aid to Ukraine,"" she said in a statement shared with Fox News. Though lawmakers appear united in their opposition to Russian aggression against Ukraine, achieving a bipartisan method to counter the Kremlin already has senators divided. The Senate failed to pass a bill led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, last week that would have slapped sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline – which is set to run oil from Russia into Europe through Germany. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen speaks during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. A separate bill led by Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., has instead garnered sweeping support in his party. It would impose sanctions on the Russian banking system and top officials in the government and military should Putin violate Ukrainian sovereignty. Shaheen, who had previously backed sanctions on the major Russian pipeline, voted against Cruz’s bill and instead has backed Menendez’s Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act. ""I’ve led action over the years to stop the pipeline, including my partnership with Sen. Cruz on sanctions that were included in the fiscal year 2021 defense bill and led to a halt in construction of the pipeline,"" she said following her vote Thursday. : '- ' But the subcommittee chair said Cruz’s latest legislation would ""undermine diplomacy at work and risk obstructing Senate business."" It is unclear if Menendez’s bill – which received backing from Connecticut Democrats Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who also traveled to Kyiv – will garner enough support to push it through the upper chamber. Sen. Richard Blumenthal gives a briefing after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, Ukraine, Monday, Jan. 17, 2022. But senators from across the aisle said the trip to Ukraine showed their resolve to assist Ukraine as Russia continues to mount an aggressive front on their border. Portman said the recent passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2022 increased its support for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative from $250 million in 2021 to $300 million this year – $75 million of which was ""specifically designated for lethal assistance."" ""America should be encouraged by Ukraine’s determination to remain free and independent,"" the Republican senator said. ""A sovereign and democratic Ukraine is not just good for the people of Ukraine, it is important to the stability of Europe and provides a beacon of hope to millions of others who wish for that same freedom."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., echoed Portman’s comments in a statement to Fox News and said, ""We stand with the brave people of Ukraine."" ""At a moment of political division in Washington, we instead chose to travel to Ukraine in unity,"" she said. ""The U.S. administration – from the Secretary of State to the President himself – has pledged to help this country. Our message is that there will be consequences if Vladimir Putin chooses to violate the sanctity of this democracy.""",13

""I think the alliance, our friends in and a bipartisan majority are prepared to assist Ukraine in making sure that if it happens this time Vladimir Putin will get a bloody nose,"" he added. Sen.

Lawmakers struck a hard tone in their calls on the administration to enforce sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and aid Ukraine with defensive military aid ahead of any Russian invasion. However, they remain divided on whether sanctions on the pipeline should be enforced as a warning to Putin now or after an invasion of its former soviet nation has already been carried out. The calls for assertive action have come after talks with Russia stalled last week and Russia continues to amass troops along Ukraine’s border. Putin has argued the troop buildup is a security precaution and claimed that permitting Ukraine membership would allow the 30-nation alliance strike weapons systems and bases in the former Soviet nation.

""I don’t think we surprised the president or Mr. Sullivan or anybody in the administration with what we said. Quite honestly we listened as much as we spoke,"" he told Fox News Digital.

Todd Young, John Cornyn, Kevin Cramer and Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Jim Risch listen while Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee speak. Cramer said Biden ""raised an important point"" and argued that sanctions are not as simple as slapping a fine on Russia; there will be a spill-over effect that will impact U.S. allies and exporters. ""We have to be thoughtful about it, we have to be committed to it, we have to be clear about it,"" Cramer said. Cramer along with several of his colleagues told reporters that party disagreements about sanctions should not be interpreted by Putin as ""disunity in our resolve to stand with the people of Ukraine and to stand with freedom.""",13

The Republican Study Committee graded Biden on China, Russia, Iran and Afghanistan, awarding Biden failing grades on all fronts and one F- for his deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan. ’S ‘’ ""The world is more chaotic and dangerous today than one year ago when President Trump held office,"" the Republican Study Committee report states. The report is the latest effort by Republicans to draw attention to Biden's one-year anniversary in office and to criticize what they say are a series of foreign policy blunders that have empowered adversaries and abandoned U.S. interests and security. President Joe Biden gestures during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, on Jan. 19, 2022, in Washington.

Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas., on how the Biden administration failed to de-escalate growing tensions as a Russian invasion into Ukraine becomes more likely Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas., joined ‘Fox & Friends’ Thursday to discuss what he sees as the failure of the Biden administration in handling the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The White House clarified its position Wednesday night after Biden made a comment about a ""minor incursion"" by Russia that critics interpreted as a potential green light for Russia to invade. 'S . : To prevent war, you need deterrence. You need clear costs and consequences for actions. You do not prevent war by allowing authoritarians to take one bite at a time, keep poking you until you'll give in just a little bit more, just a little bit more. We've seen the consequences of that over the centuries. This is just the most recent of a long list of failures to engage in that deterrence properly. I mean, the last example was in Afghanistan, of course, because Biden proved to the world, we weren't willing to stand up for our allies. We were willing to abandon them. We weren't even willing to stand up for our interests, even at a low cost. And over the last few years, by the way, we've been we've been decreasing our numbers in Germany, our troop numbers. So there's less and less deterrence. We have European allies that won't invest in their own security. The only one who stood up to them was Donald Trump. And guess what? There were no incursions in any territories during Donald Trump's presidency. There's a reason for that. Very simple elements of deterrence were actually enforced. And on top of that, Europeans are not willing to commit to the sanctions and economic retaliation necessary against Russia. Should they do this incursion, at least our administration is talking about that. But you also need the Europeans on board. So I hope Secretary Blinken can go there this week and make that happen. There needs to be clear consequences for what they do because we've failed to deter and now you're inviting conflict. It's a very bad situation and we've left ourselves without many options as a result.",0

2022-01-20,https://www.foxnews.com/media/mcconnell-biden-press-conference-russia-ukraine-trump-midterm-elections,McConnell: Biden 'got it wrong again' when he claimed GOP can't say 'what they're for',"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., joins 'Special Report' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell responded Thursday to President Biden's repeated claim that Republicans cannot verbalize ""what they are for"" to the American people. McConnell, R-Ky., told Fox News the has been vocal about what Republicans view as the most pressing issues in the country. During his Wednesday press conference, Biden said the ""fundamental question is 'what's Mitch for?'"" before claiming the Senate minority leader would do ""anything to prevent Biden from being a success."" McConnell strongly disagreed with Biden's claim, telling ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier, ""my good friend the president got it wrong once again."" ""I helped him pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill, I supported in the Senate a bill to deal with China and the computer chip shortage,"" he recalled. ""If the president starts acting like a moderate like he campaigned, we can do business. The reason we've not been speaking recently this year is because he adopted the Bernie Sanders prescription for America. He did that even though he got no mandate for it, a 50-50 Senate and a couple of seats' majority in the House, and they couldn't get it through."" McConnell added that the American people, like himself, do not want the socialistic transformation of America that people like Sanders, a Vermont senator, envision. - , - ‘’ ‘ ’ Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, President Joe Biden ""If the president wants to reinvent himself and come back to the middle, we have things to talk about that we can work on together,"" McConnell proffered. He added that the American people also are not fans of the Build Back Better package, whether it is broken into pieces or not. ""They want us to tackle all the problems that they are concerned about inflation at the top of the list, and a wide-open border."" McConnell also dismissed claims from Biden and Democrats that voting rights are still an issue in the U.S. almost 60 years after the Voting Rights Act was enacted. The senator, 79, recalled being a young Hill staffer in 1965 when Congress passed the landmark legislation. He cited the record turnout by American voters in 2020, remarking that it was the highest rate of such since 1900. During the interview, McConnell also reacted to Biden's comments on the Russia-Ukraine situation, telling Baier he hopes President Vladimir Putin doesn't misunderstand the American message: ""No incursion into Ukraine is acceptable. What should we be doing about it right now? Well, first we ought to be sending anti-tank weapons to the Ukrainians, helping them learn how to use them, and ground-to-air missiles to go after the helicopters that might be a part, obviously of any Russian incursion, as well as being ready to levy a level of sanctions the Russians have never experienced before,"" he said. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin In closing the interview, Baier pressed McConnell on former President Donald Trump's role or prominence in the 2022 midterm elections. ""Do you think that former President Donald Trump will be a help to you in the midterm elections?"" Baier asked. ""I think the midterm election almost certainly is going to be a referendum on the party in power,"" McConnell replied. ""This is an entirely Democratic government: Democratic President, House and Senate, they are in charge of governing. And these midterm elections are always a report card on the performance of those who are in charge, those who are governing. I think the American people are about to send this administration a pretty big message that they do not approve of all the things that are going wrong."" President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell talk to reporters in the Rose Garden following a lunch meeting at the White House Oct. 16, 2017. In recent months, Trump and McConnell have shared an icy relationship, with the former president dubbing McConnell ""the Broken Old Crow"". Baier pressed again as to his thoughts on the 45th president, playing a clip of Graham telling Fox News that the ""doesn't have to kiss Trump's ass but [has] to have a working relationship with him for us to be successful."" ""Well, I appreciated Lindsey Graham's tweet last night, commenting on my closing speech before we saved the Senate from the Democrats who were trying to break the Senate last night,"" McConnell replied, referring to an attempt by Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to eradicate the chamber's 60-vote threshold precedent. ""[A]ll Republicans, believe me of all stripes, will be together voting to send this administration a strong message this November,"" McConnell said, never mentioning Trump.

Levin told ""Hannity"" that Biden's comments about a potential Russian incursion or invasion of Ukraine were ""incredibly provocative"" and problematic. : ‘’ ‘ ’ President Biden. ""What he said about Russia — how Putin might act and so forth. That was an incredibly provocative statement,"" Levin said, comparing Biden to a fellow Pennsylvania native often ranked as the worst president. ""It was outrageous. Putin's watching this, too."" ""[Biden] says he's made enormous progress more than any president in history of this time. What the Hell is he talking about? He's the John Tyler of our time, the James Buchanan of our time,"" Levin said of the 15th president, whose estate stands outside Lancaster. Buchanan, a Democrat who directly preceded Republican Abraham Lincoln, is often regarded as an ineffective leader in the lead up to the United States plunging into the stark divisions of the Civil War. Former President James Buchanan. Photo by: Vintage/Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Regarded as a Northerner with Southern sympathies, Buchanan called slavery a ""matter of but little practical importance"" in his 1857 inaugural address. Later on, Buchanan believed the potential for states like South Carolina to secede was illegal, but that the federal government had little power to intercede. Biden doubled down on divisive rhetoric regarding voting rights, race, and the legitimacy of federal elections, Levin said. ""He seemed to suggest if the Democrats lose in the midterm election, then it's not legitimate. He was specifically asked if the upcoming election won't be fair, fairly conducted, quote unquote, ‘Without passing the voting rights bill.' This is not a voting rights bill,"" Levin said, referring to the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. ""Can anybody tell me a single provision that actually protects voting rights?""

2022-01-20,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-ukraine-russia-chinese-government,Tucker Carlson: Our attention to Ukraine drives Russia into alliance with the Chinese government,"Tucker Carlson discusses how Washington is reacting to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. There’s nothing more tiresome or predictable than a cable news host who makes the show about himself. Narcissism is to people what black lung is to coal miners, and we do our best to avoid catching it. But we're going to break our rule and tell you about something pretty interesting that happened to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" a couple of days ago. On Tuesday, we did a segment about the nation of Ukraine. Now, Ukraine may be a perfectly nice place to visit, but you wouldn't think it would get a lot of attention from a superpower like this one. Ukraine is a pretty small country, really. It's in Eastern Europe. It's 5,000 miles from Washington. It's got a population about the size of the state of California. So hugely significant? Not really. And yet we never seem to stop talking about Ukraine. As the Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden himself spent an enormous amount of his time meddling in the internal affairs of Ukraine and because of his influence in that country, his son Hunter got a job at a Ukrainian company and got rich from that. Then Donald Trump was impeached for speaking on the phone to an official from, yes, Ukraine. - And now, as of tonight, we're moving closer to a war over Ukraine. In the coming days, Russia may violate Ukraine's eastern border, and this, we are told, cannot stand. In Washington, the territorial integrity of the United States means precisely nothing. Walls are racist. We're a nation of immigrants. But the territorial integrity of Ukraine? That is something we must fight for. A remarkably broad spectrum of political figures appeared on all three cable networks to explain that if Russians crossed the Ukrainian border in an undocumented caravan, we have a moral obligation to use force immediately. , : We will move more 's assets closer to Russia, not further away if they once again bring war to Ukraine. , : It's just not going to be that simple. I think we should be doing a lot more and we, we shouldn't be just considering a diplomatic track. . , : There needs to be clear consequences for what they do because we've failed to deter and now you're inviting conflict. It's a, it's a very bad situation and we've left ourselves without many options as a result. . , : I don't think we're providing the deterrence necessary to stop Putin from invading Ukraine, the breadbasket of Russia. , : And it's time for the Biden White House to start speaking more clearly and more aggressively and telling us how they're going to stop this invasion from happening. Secretary of State of U.S. Antony Blinken speaks as he greets embassy staff at the U.S. embassy, in Kyiv, Ukraine, January 19, 2022. Alex Brandon/Pool via Oh, they're all red in the face, but it's not the usual partisan chorus. This is the entire choir. You just saw representatives from every faction in Washington, from Adam Schiff to Dan Crenshaw, not as different as they seem, and all the dummies in between. And all of them are promoting war against Russia on behalf of our new and deeply beloved ally, the government of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is our most dangerous enemy, they scream. We can't let him hurt Ukraine. So it turns out Russiagate was actually more effective even than we'd realize. The Steele dossier has been debunked. But in Washington, the theme remains in force: Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia is bad. What is this about, exactly? Well, obviously it's the usual collection of children falling for the usual collection of lies, but why this specific lie? On Tuesday, we tried to get to the bottom of this because it seems like it matters. We spoke to a man called Clint Ehrlich. As Ehrlich pointed out, there are a lot of factors here driving us toward war over Ukraine. But one of them, a central one, is . So what is and what is the purpose of since the fall of the Soviet Union 30 years ago that was designed as a bulwark against? Well, no one can answer that question. Not one person and yet the same people who cooked up the Iraq War are now insisting that Ukraine must join anyway. That would mean putting American military hardware right on Russia's border, and Russia doesn't want that any more than we would want Russian missiles in Tijuana. Hence, the tension. Now the irony, as Clint Ehrlich pointed out, is that doesn't even want Ukraine to join. In other words, the whole thing is nuts. It serves no American interest whatsoever. It is yet another manufactured crisis, this one devised by restless, power-hungry neocons in Washington looking for another war. Here's part of what Clint Ehrlich told us. ‘ ’: ‘’ ‘ ’ : Here we have people who are arguing that even if the Russians don't invade Ukraine, that we need to invade and kick the Russians out of Crimea, that was an op-ed from a senior Obama administration official this week. And so I would say that it's even simpler than that. We're dealing with our warmongers, unserious people whose policy prescriptions could have deadly serious consequences. … The deeper irony is that doesn't even want Ukraine, that it's a corrupt country. It's more of a liability than it would be a military asset. And the people who are pushing this simply argue that it needs to happen because Russia shouldn't have a veto over who's in . In other words, even when it's in our mutual interest to not have a state in , we have to insist that there will be added just to spite the Russians. Well, that was an interesting conversation, and those seem like fair points. If they're wrong, go ahead and explain how they're wrong. We'll listen. But official Washington is done explaining anything, as you may have noticed. So instead, the very same foreign policy geniuses who brought slave markets to Libya went insane with rage. Not since we made fun of pregnant flight suits have they been this mad. ""Fox host unabashedly makes Putin's case,"" barked 's White House correspondent. ""Unabashedly,"" ""shows how the disinformation successes of Russian intelligence extend way beyond Trump."" ""Tucker is all-in for Putin,"" noted Bill Kristol, a man who couldn't even run a small circulation magazine, but imagines he should run our country's foreign policy. And then a former contractor called Alexandra Chalupa announced that this shows opinions violated the law. ""This isn't journalism,"" she wrote. ""It's an ongoing violation. Tucker Carlson needs to be prosecuted as an unregistered agent of the Russian Federation and treason under Article 3, Section 3, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution for aiding an enemy in hybrid warfare against the United States."" , A death penalty offense! What Alexandra Chalupa didn't mention, speaking of violations, is that she herself has extensive personal ties to the Ukrainian government. In 2016, Chalupa contacted Ukraine's embassy looking for dirt on Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Now, she says that anyone who doesn't believe Americans should die for Ukraine must be sent to prison. Virginia Congressman Gerry Connolly didn't go that far, but close. He called us ""right-wing agitator spewing Russian propaganda into millions of American homes."" Like a virus. And then Congressman Eric Swalwell of California, a man who literally had sex with a Chinese spy, apparently multiple times in very strange ways, agreed with this. ""Carrying Putin's water again,"" he wrote on Twitter. And then one of Barack Obama's speechwriters accused us of being ""on the side of ethno-nationalist authoritarianism."" Ethno-nationalism. So if you don't support fighting a war on behalf of all White Ukraine against all White Russia, you my friend are a racist and so on. So what's so interesting here is that there was not a single argument, not a single idea in any of it. These aren't just Twitter trolls, these are people who imagine themselves, foreign policy heavyweights, deep thinkers, statesmen. But when challenged, all they could muster was name-calling. They went ad hominem immediately because they had nothing else. They're pathetic. U.S. President Joe Biden holds a formal news conference in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 19, 2022. /Kevin Lamarque That ought to worry you, though, because they may be pathetic. They're also very powerful. So in the end, it fell to poor Kamala Harris to explain why we need to fight for the honor of Ukraine. And she did it on The Today Show, the Biden administration's forum for deep thoughts on foreign policy. Here's what she said. : And on the subject of Ukraine, I will tell you that the president has been very clear and we, as the United States are very clear. If Putin takes aggressive action, we are prepared to levy serious and severe costs. Period. And I will tell you that part of the posture that we have taken is grounded in the respect and the value we place in sovereignty and territorial integrity. Reading her little talking points as vehemently as she can. But the best? The emphasis we place, the value we place, on territorial integrity. Borders. Sovereignty. The right to determine who comes into your country and when. That's the word from Kamala Harris, the lifelong open borders activist. So how should Putin handle this? Well, Putin had a better imagination, apparently he doesn't. He'd paint the Russian tanks now massed on the Ukrainian border with the slogan, ""No person is illegal."" What would Kamala Harris say to that? On what grounds would she tell Russians who just want a better life with their families in Ukraine that they can't come to Ukraine? If the Russians just quoted Emma Lazarus, Kamala Harris would have to back off and support them and their voting rights in Ukraine. But unfortunately for them, the Russians are just too literal for this. When they invade a country, just go ahead and call it an invasion. But you still have to wonder, invasion or not, why is any of this a profound concern of ours? Why would you even consider risking American lives or sending billions of dollars to stop it? There are multiple border wars underway around the world. Multiple just on the continent of Africa, right now. There always have been. Many are dying in those wars. And yet Kamala Harris is not agitating for American troops to Congo. How come? We can only speculate about that What we do know is that the administration's Russia policy would only make sense if your goal was to gravely hurt the United States of America. Already, we have spent nearly $4 billion in aid to Ukraine over the last few years, much of it for weapons. The point of this is to tweak Russia and, if necessary, to kill Russians. Our leads feel very superior about this, morally. They brag about it constantly. So it's an up, it's a win for them. But what about the cost to the rest of us and to our country? China is the preeminent threat to the United States. Nothing comes close to the threat that China poses. Here's the truth: The U.S. military, impressive as it is, is not big enough to engage meaningfully simultaneously in Europe and in Asia. Can't do both at the same time. So our attention to Ukraine, by definition, detracts from our attention to China. But worse and more dangerous than that, more dangerous than anything, it drives the Russians into an alliance of convenience of necessity with the Chinese government. So here you have our two biggest rivals, united. United not simply against our military, but against our currency. When the U.S. dollar is displaced as the world's reserve currency, this country will become poor overnight. This, what you're watching now, will be one of the reasons why it happened. So it's hard to imagine anything more significant or destructive than what these people are doing right now. It's not just about Ukraine, it's about our future.",0
2022-01-21,https://www.foxnews.com/media/china-xi-jinping-taiwan-russia-ukraine-putin-biden,Why China is closely watching Biden's handling of Russia-Ukraine tension - and what it could mean for the US,"Robert O'Brien weighs in on the possible implications of a Russian invasion of Ukraine on 'The Story.' America's rivals and enemies are watching Presidents Biden's and Putin's moves in the Ukraine-Russia conflict very carefully, and a Russian invasion could leave to further aggressive actions that threaten the American homeland, former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien warned Friday on Fox News. Biden was roundly criticized for his ""minor incursion"" remark about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, and O'Brien told ""The Story"" that Chinese Communist leader Xi Jinping is monitoring exactly how the current conflict is fleshing out. If Xi deduces that it is worth causing international turmoil to invade Taiwan – which China views as a breakaway province but which allies believe is sovereign – it could open a maritime avenue to confront Alaska, the closest state to Russia and China. . ‘ , ’ - Chinese President Xi Jinping stands in front of national flags of China and Republic of Congo during a meeting ""The answer to our primary national security interest in Europe is making sure that is defended, and so we don't want to have Russia overrunning non- friends and putting more pressure on our allies. That's number one,"" O'Brien said. ""Number two, the Chinese are watching this very carefully. Xi Jinping is watching every move Vladimir Putin takes and is considering that as he decides whether to invade Taiwan after the Olympics or not."" He noted that the United States has substantial national security and diplomatic interests in Taiwan. If Taiwan was to come under control, the Chinese People's Liberation Army could be at America's western portico in a short amount of time. ""[Taiwan] is the cork in the Pacific,"" O'Brien said. ""If Taiwan falls, the Navy flows out into the Pacific, threatens Hawaii, threatens California [or] the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. In Anchorage, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson is a sprawling, strategic installation with an eye on U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific region, while 300 miles northward at Fort Greely in Fairbanks, as many as 40 anti-ballistic missiles are present in the dire case of an attack on the West Coast. ‘ ’: The coastline of Honolulu, Hawaii including the base of Diamond Head crater. O'Brien told Fox News that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could also cut off U.S.-allied Japan, as well as other treaty allies New Zealand, Australia and the Philippines. ""So we need to make sure that the idea that nation-states can invade their neighbors and take them over by conquest is not the new norm in international relations because it's going to have consequences far beyond Ukraine,"" he concluded. O'Brien said Biden gave Putin the Berlin-connected Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline ""for nothing"" and watched as in return, the ex- agent ""put a gun to the head of the West"" via his current threats to Ukraine. ""So he's developed an appetite for U.S. concessions and the time for appeasement to the Russians is over,"" he said. ""They're looking at our words carefully, but they're also going to look at actions."" Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

2022-01-21,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-war-russia-ukraine,Tucker Carlson: We're moving closer to war with Russia,"Tucker Carlson discusses the Russia-Ukraine conflict and how the U.S. is moving closer to a 'devastating' war. Yesterday we talked about a kind of dark topic on the looming war between Russia and Ukraine. A bipartisan coalition of neocons in Washington has been recklessly stoking conflict between those two countries for years now. Our foreign policy establishment, in fact, has sent hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to one of the most volatile regions in the world, hoping for some kind of explosion. And now their wish seems to be coming true. That explosion looks like it's on its way, and it could very easily suck the United States into the center of it. That's what we said last night. But honestly, as we read those words, they seemed hard to believe. We're really going to fight a war over some corrupt Eastern European country that is strategically irrelevant to us? With everything else that's going on right now in our own country? No normal person would ever want to do anything like that. How can it really happen? We're still not sure how it could happen, but nevertheless, it does seem to be happening right now. The Biden administration has begun evacuating American civilians from Ukraine. The Pentagon has announced it is prepared to use force in the region. So this country is now closer to a legitimate war than we have been in decades. And to be clear, we're talking about an actual war here. Not a protracted series of airstrikes against some impoverished dirt patch they're telling you is an existential threat to the nation. : Russia is not a rock. Russia has nuclear weapons and a real army. A war with Russia is not a joke. It won't be over in a week. So you'd think right now might be the time the president of the United States could explain what's going on here? What exactly are we doing in Eastern Europe and why are we doing it? But no. In an exchange with reporters today, Joe Biden explained that he wasn't going to take any questions at all for fear that someone might ask him about Russia. : By the way, the reason we're not going to have any time for questions now is these guys are going to get quickly on a plane and go out and do a major announcement in Ohio. And you guys will ask me all about Russia. You guys will ask me all about Russia and Joe Biden's not falling for that one again, you can see why a couple of days ago he tried to talk about Russia during a press conference, and he got the talking points so mangled that his staff had to issue statements afterward, informing us that Joe Biden has no idea what he's talking about. Biden's mistake at the press conference was suggesting that maybe war with Russia is not inevitable. In Washington, you're absolutely not allowed to say that. Donald Trump said it repeatedly. They impeached him for it. In this image taken from footage provided by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service, a Ukrainian soldiers use a launcher with U.S. Javelin missiles during military exercises in Donetsk region, Ukraine. In Joe Biden's case, his handlers just stepped in and told us a brand-new story. Here's White House chief of staff and amateur comedian, Ron Klain, explaining that actually, this is what Joe Biden meant to say. And as you read to it, you may notice that it's the opposite of what Biden actually said. . ' : : I think it's fair to say the White House has pretty aggressively walked back or clarified or whatever you want to call it, the president's comments about Ukraine and Russia and whether the president was signaling that a minor incursion might be viewed through a different lens. Whether the president meant to say that at the time or maybe he was being inarticulate, can you afford any gaffes given the stakes right now in all this? : Well, I think the president was quite clear and reiterated his point of view this morning. Very clearly, President Putin should have no doubt any move by the Russian assembled military across the border of Ukraine is an invasion. It will be met with a very severe economic response from the United States and our allies. So this guy called Ron Klain, whoever that is, gets to overrule the president of the United States on matters of foreign policy. Since when is he allowed to do that? Well, whenever he feels like it, that's the real answer. Joe Biden is the weakest leader this country has seen since Woodrow Wilson had a stroke in office. That's a problem, but it's not the core problem. The core problem is that in America, elected officials no longer decide when we go to war, as in, say, a democracy. Instead, bureaucrats, generals and defense contractors make those decisions, sometimes unilaterally. Here's failed rock star and hilariously inept Secretary of State Tony Blinken threatening severe action against Russia. : The discussion today with Mr. Lavrov was frank and substantive. I conveyed the position of the United States and our European allies and partners that we stand firmly with Ukraine in support of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We've been clear if any Russian military forces move across Ukraine's border, that's a renewed invasion. It will be met with swift, severe and a united response from the United States and our partners and allies. So the president in states is not allowed to talk in public about Russia, he just admitted that today. He might say something that averts war. So instead, the same people who have lost the last five wars get to speak for him. Do you feel safer? . . You've got to wonder what voters think of this. We don't need to wonder what they think. Polls show that most Americans are completely opposed to fighting Russia over Ukraine because they're not demented. But you know who's very much in favor of it? Well, defense contractors, including Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin's former employer, Raytheon. For defense contractors, war means massive profits by definition. In just the last few years, the U.S. has spent more than $2 billion on military aid to this nation called Ukraine that most people couldn't identify on a map. Just the other day, the administration announced $200 million more. So the Ukrainians love this, obviously, this is the whole reason they once employed Joe Biden's otherwise unemployable son. To keep the cash flowing to them. So when Biden hinted this week that war might not be coming right away, the Ukrainians were highly distressed. In fact, they were so distressed, they said so out loud. : The big concern expressed by one Ukrainian official I spoke to last night is that this offers Vladimir Putin a green light, in his words, to enter Ukraine at his pleasure. So the Ukrainians are complaining about American foreign policy, about what the president said at a press conference. The government of someplace called Ukraine is demanding that we fight the Russian army on their behalf. , I mean, it's not crazy. You could kind of see why they would want that. It's a lot easier than doing it themselves. The question is, we're the United States, so why are we obeying them?",0

2022-01-22,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-putin-ukraine-russia-rebekah-koffler,Biden's weakness on Ukraine makes Putin feel free to act up,"National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest from the Pentagon on 'The Story. Russia President Vladimir Putin is on the march in Eurasia. From Ukraine to Kazakhstan to Belarus and beyond, Moscow’s spymaster is waging what his strategists term ""new generation warfare."" Having deployed cyberhackers who attacked America’s burgers and gas stations and stole secrets from government agencies, Russia presses on with generating ""controlled chaos"" in Europe. Putin mobilized a massive contingent of combat-ready troops and weaponry that are encircling Ukraine. Russian forces are flowing into Belarus to conduct joint wargames, but potentially be used in an invasion of Ukraine. 'T 'S ‘ ’ , President Biden gestures as he speaks during a news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 19, 2022. Last week, several Ukrainian government agencies were hit with cyberattacks likely executed by Russian or Belarussian intelligence operatives or proxies. The week before, Putin tested out a potential model for attacking Ukraine in Kazakhstan, deploying ""peacekeeping"" forces to quell protests against the country’s Kremlin-backed leaders. Why is Putin acting up? Why now? It is not by chance that Putin chose Joe Biden’s presidency as a window of opportunity to consummate his imperial ambitions and secure his legacy as a mighty leader. The Russians have profiled President Biden as unable to mount a serious challenge to Putin and Russia’s aggressive foreign policy. For decades, based on a bipartisan policy, the U.S. was able to check Russia, precluding Moscow from reclaiming its perceived sphere of influence and dominating its post-Soviet neighbors. Biden’s inept policies and his infirmity as a leader have convinced Putin that he can run circles around the commander in chief. What the Russians see in Biden is a deteriorating decision-making ability, a naïve predisposition for friendly relations with Russia, and compromising links between Russian oligarchs and Biden’s son Hunter. On Biden’s inauguration day, the Russian language version of Forbes magazine ran a profile of the new president. The author reminded that it was Vice President Biden, under the Obama Administration, who initiated efforts to establish working relations with Russia, having dispatched Secretary of State Hilary Clinton to Moscow with a mistranslated ""reset"" button. The profile cited a 2009 New York Times article which concluded that Biden’s tone during a speech at a security conference was more conciliatory than the Bush administration’s with regard to Russia. It also noted that Biden wanted compromise with Moscow on missile defense, which Russia views as threatening their security. The Russians suspect that Biden is cognitively impaired. They mock Biden’s verbal gaffes. Last March, the former head of Russia’s ruling party, Andrej Turchak, accused Biden of having age-related dementia. The Russian press criticized Biden for calling Putin a ""killer"" in an interview, characterizing Biden as having had a temper tantrum. The Russians frequently characterize Biden’s verbal threats of sanctions and retaliation against Russian cyberattacks as signs of frustration and helplessness. Russian spy services have followed closely the Hunter Biden’s laptop debacle, which revealed President Biden’s secret involvement in his son’s business shenanigans. The Russian press has written about Hunter Biden’s corrupt dealings, saying he received millions of dollars from foreigners, including from the Ukrainian company Burisma and from the super wealthy widow of a former Moscow Mayor, Yuriy Luzhkov, Elena Baturina. Having no respect for the U.S. chief executive, it is no wonder that Putin feels free to issue ultimatums to Biden, to menace Ukraine, and to threaten to deploy troops and weapon systems in Cuba and Venezuela. Putin has already finagled a promise from Biden that the will not intervene militarily if Russia attacks Ukraine. Most disturbingly, last week, U.S. diplomats serving in Europe were struck again by the bizarre neurological ailment called the Havana Syndrome. Russia is the most likely culprit behind these horrendous attacks, which cause debilitating health problems, including brain damage. The timing and the place of the attack, coinciding with the -Russian meetings in Europe to deescalate the crisis in Ukraine, further point to Putin’s hand trying to intimidate meek Biden. The Russians, who watch U.S. domestic politics very closely, are keenly aware that Biden’s approval ratings are sliding into the abyss as the faces problems like inflation, crime, illegal immigration, and foreign policy fiascos like the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Biden’s incompetence and declining stature on the world stage has convinced Putin the timing is right for him to reorder the chess pieces in Europe before a strong U.S. leader comes to power and upsets the Russian’s scheme.",9

During his first address to a global audience upon entering office he touted that ""America is back,"" but after occupying the executive post for one year steep geopolitical challenges remain.

""That raised expectations that the administration would be different and better, not just than the Trump administration but than other recent American administrations, and I think that was an arrogant mistake."" Biden’s domestic approval rating hovered in the low- to mid-50s during his first six months in the White House. But the president’s numbers started sagging in August in the wake of Biden's much criticized handling of the turbulent U.S. exit from Afghanistan and following a surge in -19 cases this summer among mainly unvaccinated people.

""This national security threat is the worst I've seen in my lifetime."" McCaul predicted Russia will invade Ukraine within the next month. Republican Conference Chairwoman Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y., echoed his comments saying, ""This president has brought us to the brink of war through weakness.""

""I don’t share the premise that the administration has taken no preemptive action,"" Schake added, pointing to arms shipments the U.S. has supplied Kyiv, early intelligence sharing on Russian troop action and the administration's efforts to bolster unity. 'S Biden caused international confusion this week when he suggested that the size of a Russian invasion could dictate how the U.S. and respond. The White House released a statement almost immediately following the president’s comments clarifying that the U.S. and will respond to ""any"" military invasion of Ukraine. But Republicans have argued action needs to be taken before Putin invades and have called for sanctions to be slapped on the Kremlin as a warning.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., argues President Biden bears a lot of the blame for Russia moving to bring tens of thousands of troops at the border with Ukraine, leading to fears of an invasion. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., argued on Sunday that President Biden is responsible for Russia's deployment of troops to Ukraine's border. During an exclusive interview on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" the Republican senator also argued that Biden has been ""appeasing"" Russian President Vladimir Putin for one year. He made the comments shortly after the State Department ordered families of U.S. Embassy personnel in Ukraine to begin evacuating the country as soon as Monday, U.S. officials told Fox News. Next week, the State Department is also expected to encourage Americans to begin leaving Ukraine by commercial flights, ""while those are still available,"" one official said. , ‘’ ‘’ , Moscow has massed tens of thousands of troops at the border with Ukraine, leading to fears of an invasion. ""He [Biden] gave him [Putin] a very one-sided nuclear arms control treaty the very first month of his presidency,"" Cotton told host Maria Bartiromo explaining why he believes the U.S. president ""bears a lot of the blame"" for the current situation. ""He removed sanctions from the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which his own party opposed."" Senator Cotton, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, went on to say that Biden ""really did nothing about the Colonial Pipeline hack."" ""And then, of course, in August, Vladimir Putin, like the rest of the world, saw Joe Biden's debacle in Afghanistan - so that's why Vladimir Putin thinks the timing is right here and why this matters for the American people,"" he continued. Senator Cotton then warned ""it is very dangerous when you allow our adversaries like Russia and China and Iran to try to upend the status quo.""""And all we do is have strongly worded speeches or some mealy-mouthed sanctions,"" he lamented. A Biden spokesperson did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment on Sunday. Senator Cotton suggested that, if Putin ""can get away"" with invading Ukraine, it doesn't send a good message to other world leaders:""What does that say to [Chinese Communist leader Xi] Jinping about what he can do in Taiwan, or what he can do to threaten our military positions in the western Pacific? What he can do to continue to cheat on trade deals to take jobs and wealth away from this country?""

The Pentagon is concerned that Ukraine's capital is ""now in the cross-hairs,"" another official told Fox News. The West has rejected Moscow's main demands – promises from that Ukraine will never be added as a member, that no alliance weapons will be deployed near Russian borders, and that it will pull back its forces from Central and Eastern Europe. The U.S. government is planning to move ""a ton"" of weapons and ammunition into Ukraine in the coming days, officials said. Talks between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday yielded no breakthroughs, though both sides agreed to continue negotiating diplomatically. The two diplomats will speak again after the U.S. submits a formal response to Russian demands next week. Senator Cotton stressed on Sunday that he believes Putin has the mentality that the ""timing is right"" to achieve his goal to ""reassemble"" the Greater Soviet Empire given Biden is in office, suggesting how the president has handled other foreign situations thus far presents an opportunity for Russia. The senator warned that, resultantly, an invasion ""could happen at any moment."" ""This is why it's so important that we be clear about the kind of sanctions we would impose on Russia's oil and gas and mining and minerals industries, how we'd cut them off from the international banking system, and that we all continue to try to provide the weapons that Ukraine needs to defend itself,"" he added.",9
2022-01-23,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pompeo-russia-dont-see-president-biden-credible,Pompeo on Russia: ‘They don’t see President Biden as credible’,"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says Russia is watching ‘very closely’ to see if the Biden administration has the resolve to defend Ukraine’s sovereignty. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that the Biden administration needs to take action to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin takes the U.S. seriously with Russian forces amassed outside Ukraine. Asked during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday"" how the Biden administration can de-escalate a situation that looks to be on the brink of a Russian invasion of its neighbor, Pompeo said the proper time for the U.S. to act passed long ago. 'S - ‘ ,’ ""The real hard work of deterrence would have happened a long time ago, a year ago,"" Pompeo said. ""When President Putin demanded that we give him a New treaty extension, we gave it to him for nothing. When they had Russian cyberattacks and they shut down the Colonial Pipeline, we told them you can only attack certain sectors but 16 are off limits. When we left Afghanistan the way we did. Those were the places where the administration had the chance to establish deterrence. Putin saw this. ""I think they don’t see President Biden as credible,"" Pompeo added. Pompeo also criticized the president for his recent remarks in which he differentiated between a Russian ""minor incursion"" in Ukraine versus a full-scale invasion in terms of the consequences Russia would face. Biden later clarified and removed any distinction, but Pompeo said he is still not satisfied with how Biden worded his latest statement. ""If you listen closely, even to President Biden’s attempt to clean it up, he said if there’s any ‘assembled units,'"" Pompeo noted. ""We need to be unequivocal when one speaks in diplomacy, especially in the age of cyber and space and true capabilities that exceed what we had seen during the time of World War . If there’s room for doubt, if there’s space, Vladimir Putin will drive a truck through that gap."" Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a news conference after his meeting with U.S President Joe Biden at the Villa la Grange in Geneva, Switzerland, June 16, 2021. , , Pompeo explained how Putin could use Biden's words against him. ""He’ll say, ‘Well we didn’t send an assembled unit, it was disorganized.’ These are the kinds of things that are listened to very closely,"" Pompeo said. Pompeo was then informed that current Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier in the day that ""if one more Russian force goes into Ukraine in an aggressive way, that would trigger a significant U.S. response."" Pompeo admitted this was ""a much stronger"" statement than what Biden had said. ""I hope they’re serious about this,"" Pompeo said, adding that he hopes the Biden administration is ""prepared to actually do this"" with a plan to carry out a swift response. Pompeo later warned that the rest of the world is paying attention to how the Biden administration deals with the situation. ""They’re watching very closely,"" Pompeo said, noting the world watched the Trump administration when it showed strength with a strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani after Pompeo said Soleimani threatened the United States ""So they’re watching very closely. They’re watching to see if this administration has the resolve and the steel to use all of its tools to preserve sovereignty for a nation like Ukraine,"" Pompeo said. ""I promise you not only are Xi Jinping and Chairman Kim and the Ayatollah watching, but so are the people of Taiwan, the Iranian people and the Chinese people as well. The whole world watches how America leads, and when we fail to do so we create instability."" ""We have to get this right,"" Pompeo added.",9

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday that President Biden’s response to Russia could embolden ""dictators"" around the world, including China. Gingrich said the world is watching whether Biden ""flinches"" against Vladimir Putin. : '' : First of all, the Obama-Biden administration was going to put sanctions on after Putin seized Crimea. I don’t think that had any effect at all. In fact, if anything, they convinced Putin that he could ignore those kinds of threats. Putin now controls Germany because they made a series of bad decisions as a result of which the German economy has to have Russian natural gas. The Germans would be going into a cold winter, collapsing economically and collapsing in quality of life if the Russians actually cut it off. So the Germans are very much against taking too strong a role. Meanwhile, the Russians have sort of expanded the playing field. They have now announced that they want to have military maneuvers off of Ireland, which the Irish have protested about. At the same time, their ally, China is flying 23 aircraft over Taiwan. I think everybody is watching to see what the United States does. If we flinch, and if we convince the dictators that we can be pushed around, they are going to push very hard because Biden may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rip off our allies and have nothing done. And I think it’s very, very dangerous.",0

As inflation and crime soars, coronavirus continues and polls tank, Biden's political and media allies are desperate to change the subject, she said. ""More than a month ago, President Biden assured a very war-weary nation that putting troops in or around Ukraine was not on the table. Well, now it looks like that's right up there with the other promises he made, like if you get vaxxed, you can go back to normal and just 100 days of masking,"" she said. ""Anyone paying attention to Biden's presser last week heard the sounds of the war-drums beating [as] the media desperately wants to get off the raging crime, raging , raging inflation story that's driven Biden to another new low in the polls today."" Ingraham added that some of Biden's media allies couldn't do a better job of trashing and undermining the United States if it were Vladimir Putin himself. : Russian President Vladimir Putin gives a thumbs-up as he attends a foundation-laying ceremony for the third reactor of the Akkuyu nuclear plant in Turkey. ""Putin doesn't even need to spend money crippling Washington, D.C. when our own press corps does it for free,"" Ingraham remarked. ""The media has helped Putin by supporting policies to increase the price of oil and gas. Now, most Americans understand that cheap energy is bad for Russia. But the media doesn't want Americans to have cheap energy. They've done everything possible to stop drilling and to smear the fracking revolution that promises energy independence."" ""Soaring energy prices are helping Putin buy more weapons. The media have undermined our military readiness now for years, we suffered disaster after disaster in Afghanistan, capped by the utter failure to successfully end that war,"" she continued. She warned that Democrats and Republican neoconservatives are helping take the U.S. down the same path as the costly and protracted war in Afghanistan that concluded with a deadly withdrawal. ""America cannot and must not dilute the strength she has left on another hopeless crusade urged on by the same people who screwed up in Afghanistan,"" she said. ""Our real threat militarily and economically is the [Chinese Communist Party], which loves it when we squander our resources on pointless foreign ventures and quagmires – it makes them thrilled,"" she said. ""Of course, the can always count on the America haters, though, to downplay the threat they pose. Two days ago, the New York Times published what can only be described as a fawning personal tribute to President Xi."" She further warned that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and many of the other Republican leaders lean toward a hawkish perspective. ""If he wants to avoid being thrown out by another populist uprising in 2024, he needs to resist the war machine's temptation,"" Ingraham said. ""We have enough failed war baggage in the .

Graham on 'Kilmeade Show': Biden has been a 'wrecking ball' on national security his whole career,"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on the U.S. sending troops to eastern Europe region amid the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told ""The Brian Kilmeade Show"" that President Biden's has been a ""wrecking ball when it comes to national security"" policies during his career, warning that the commander-in-chief is being ""taken advantage of"" by Russian President Vladimir Putin. : : Joe Biden has been a wrecking ball when it comes to national security, all of his friggin life. Now he's commander in chief. He does a two-hour rambling news conference, incoherent mostly, and he makes an odd statement: A minor invasion with be will be met one way, a minor incursion, versus a full-on invasion. But what did they say in Ukraine? One inch is too much. So Biden is being taken advantage of. So you've got 's members, particularly the Baltic states, that are yearning to have a more robust response from the president. This isolationist movement will exist until the end of time. This happened in the thirties in Europe. You know, Hitler just wants this part of this country because it's German-speaking, we had the Neutrality Act, he doesn't really want to kill all the Jews. Well guess what? The Iranians really do want to kill all the Jews, if they get a nuclear weapon, they'll share it with radical Islamists, who want a master religion. We live in a dangerous world. So here's what Congress is going to do. Congress, I think in a bipartisan fashion, is going to sanction Putin for the disruption to the world order by the military buildup, not invasion, that we're going to agree to send more weapons not less to Ukraine. And there'll be a lot of Republicans like me supporting beefing up the American- presence in the Baltic regions to let Putin know he's not going to get what he wants. So that's the world in which we live in. And China is watching.",0
2022-01-25,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-america-russia-ukraine,Tucker Carlson: China is wondering how America could be this stupid and destructive,"Tucker Carlson gives his take on escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' When permanent Washington pushes for war with Russia, who benefits? We don't ask that question enough. The United States certainly doesn't benefit. That's obvious to anyone who thinks about it for a second. It's so glaringly obvious, in fact, that the people pushing this war immediately denounce you as a traitor if you point that out. They're betraying our country's interests, but somehow you're the one who's disloyal. Ukraine's borders are sacred. Our borders are racist. Shut up, Putin stooge. But wait a second. Why is it disloyal to side with Russia but loyal to side with Ukraine? They're both foreign countries that don't care anything about the United States. Kind of strange. It's all an absurd performance, but it's all they've got in the end. The fact is, Ukraine is strategically irrelevant to the United States. No rational person could defend a war with Russia over Ukraine. Nobody thinks a war like that would make America safer or stronger or more prosperous. Have you taken a look at our economy recently? Dangerous levels of inflation, a workforce in disarray. Wildly chaotic swings in financial markets, in case you ever noticed. : Well, joining a conflict in Eastern Europe fix any of that? Come on. Of course not. It'll make it worse. If the neocons aren't restrained, and soon, Americans are going to be a lot poorer. So why are they doing this? That's a complex question. Hubris, stupidity, the damage, psychological makeup of our leaders. Massive lobbying campaigns by Ukrainian politicians and American defense contractors. All of those factors play a role in this. No tragedy has a single cause. But what's not at all complicated is who benefits from our conflict with Russia. China benefits, period. The Chinese government is the only certain winner here. We can give you many examples to illustrate this, but consider the latest economic sanctions the White House has proposed against Russia. The Biden administration may use something called the foreign direct product rule to cut off Russia's supply of semiconductors made with American technology. This would, in the hopeful assessment of The Washington Post ""Potentially deprive Russian citizens of some smartphones, tablets and video game consoles."" So depriving Russian citizens is good, we're told, because Russian citizens are bad. , but what are the long-term effects on us? Russians are still going to have smartphones. They'll just get their components somewhere else, meaning from China. The Chinese have already pledged to help, and they have every incentive to make good on that promise. In other words, the Biden administration will succeed in continuing to drive our two main global rivals closer to a permanent alliance with one another. How does that help America? Well, it doesn't. Over time, it's dangerous, and not just militarily. 'S ? The only reason the U.S. government can enforce international sanctions is that the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency. Russia and China don't like this, obviously. So let's say they convinced other global powers that the government was abusing its monopoly on monetary control. If they do it to us, they might do it to you, they would say. And then other countries decided to drop the U.S. dollar in favor of a new currency. Where would that leave us? Well, suddenly the United States would no longer be able to run an economy based on debt. We would be impoverished immediately overnight. Has no one in Washington thought of this? Apparently not. Imposing tough new sanctions every few months feeds their moral vanity. It makes them feel like good people. What fools they are. Both parties, by the way, participate in this. Preening about sanctions on television is a lot easier than improving the lives of people in your own country. So that's what they do. Here's Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa telling you that protecting Ukraine's sacred borders is much more important than, say, saving Americans in Des Moines from overdosing on drugs. : So we do need to go ahead and impose sanctions on Russia. Now we need to show them that we mean business and we will be there for Ukraine should they invade. Certainly, we need to make sure that any defensive aid is in the hands of the Ukrainians, as well as much lethal aid as we can provide at this time. Those are our leaders, totally ignorant, just reading the script. It’d be nice to hear someone in the press corps, because it's their job, ask the obvious follow up, which would be: Why exactly, Sen. Ernst, do you believe it's so vital to send more lethal aid to Ukraine and to ""go ahead and impose"" more sanctions on Russia? Why? How would she answer that question? We'll never know how she'd answer, because no one in the media would ever ask her. Reporters are the most bovine of the herd animals. If the other kids say it's a good idea, they assume that it is. Journalists feel that way about everything, but especially about armed conflict. - : ‘ A ’ The longest war in American history just ended this fall when we left Afghanistan. The new consensus in Washington is: We need another war, now. And that view is especially prevalent in news. This Teleprompter jockey tried to push our Russia hating secretary of state into hating Russia even more. : We are proceeding on both pass at the same time. We'll be ready. Either way, the choice is Vladimir Putin's book. : But what are you negotiating? If Russia's demands are nonstarters, I mean President Biden has already said Ukraine is not going to join anytime soon, you've made this offer of reciprocal military exercises, what's left to talk about? What's left to talk about? Too much diplomacy, Mr. Secretary, not enough killing. That's her position, apparently. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a news conference after his meeting with U.S President Joe Biden at the 'Villa la Grange' in Geneva, Switzerland in Geneva, Switzerland, Wednesday, June 16, 2021. ) Max Boot of The Washington Post fervently agrees with this. At this point, every project in Max Boot's life has collapsed into disaster, from his personal affairs to the war in Iraq, which he promoted endlessly. Having come to middle age, Max Boot is unequivocally a failure. But he's looking for one last war to redeem at all. He's thinking conflict with nuclear-armed Russia could be that war. : We should be arming the Ukrainians like crazy. We should be preparing for guerrilla warfare. If the Russians go in and I think the most important thing we can do right now is to lay out a menu of sanctions so that Putin knows exactly what's going to happen to him if he goes over the line. Because right now, with these vague threats, he can be left with a feeling, well, maybe the U.S. and the Europeans, maybe we're not. We're not really going to do anything. Again, you have to ask yourself, why is it more patriotic to take one country's side than the other country's side? We have no obligation to defend any country, either one of these countries. Neither one is American. Neither one has the same interests as we do. Why is it wrong to support one and not the other? What's wrong is to support either one of them. Their interests are not the same as ours. They're very different. Max Boot doesn't care. Arm the Ukrainians, prepare for guerrilla warfare. Only a man completely insulated from the consequences of his bloodlust could talk like that. There will always be another think tank job for Max Boot and people like Max Boot. ‘ ’ : But what's Politico's excuse? The fashionably liberal political blog has been pushing for war in Ukraine for months now. Why? What's in it for them? Well, let's see. A few days ago, Politico published this terrifying headline ""Psaki: Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine."" The piece goes on to promise that ""experts and policymakers are now preparing for a range of escalatory measures."" Well, that sounds scary. We better send billions more in military hardware to Ukraine right away. Beneath the headline, you learn why Politico is interested. Because the story is ""presented by Lockheed Martin."" Aha! In other words, defense contractors think it is high time to spend much more on defense contracting in Ukraine. Politico is happy to make their case in exchange for money. Over at The Washington Post, you may have seen an oped with this headline: ""Biden must show that the United States stands ready to support Ukraine militarily if necessary."" Now, that piece was written by a man called Michael Vickers, who's Michael Vickers, among other things. Michael Vickers sits on the board of the weapons contractor Systems. That would seem relevant because war with Russia would be potentially, in any case, highly profitable for systems. But somehow, the Washington Post didn't bother to tell readers about this. It remained undisclosed. So how does this look from across the world? Well, the Chinese must be watching this happen with their jaws open, completely delighted. They can't believe their good fortune. They watch as the entire political leadership class of the United States runs at full speed in the wrong direction. Away from Asia, which is so clearly the future and toward the murky past on the fringes of Eastern Europe. Ukraine. Russia. The Chinese must be wondering how could these people be so stupid and so self-destructive?",0

As Russia amasses hundreds of thousands of troops along the Ukraine border, prompting fears of an imminent invasion, Democrats are left to contemplate years they spent downplaying the threat that Russia poses to the West and acting as if the Kremlin could be tamed. During his third presidential debate with then- candidate Mitt Romney in October 2012, former President Obama scoffed at his opponent for naming Russia as the primary adversary of the United States. During a back-and-forth regarding foreign policy, Romney had expressed concern that al Qaeda and other radical Islamist groups are ""rushing in"" amid revolutions that were sweeping the Muslim world. ""Gov. Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al Qaeda is a threat,"" Obama said. ""Because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia."" ""The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War's been over for 20 years,"" Obama added. Former President Obama speaks as Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and moderator Bob Schieffer listen during the third presidential debate at Lynn University, Monday, Oct. 22, 2012, in Boca Raton, Florida. John Kerry, who later became secretary of state, said at the time that Romney’s opinion regarding Russia was a ""preposterous notion,"" and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the candidate had ""little understanding of what is actually going on in the 21st century."" : - 'S Their sentiments were echoed by Obama's then-Vice President Joe Biden, who tweeted, ""These debates have exposed that Gov. Romney and Paul Ryan have a foreign policy right out of the ’80s, a social policy out of the ’50s."" Just months before, in March 2012, Obama was caught on a hot mic during what he thought was a private conversation about arms control with then-Russian President Dmitri Medvedev. Obama assured Medvedev that he would ""have more flexibility"" after his re-election, which the Russian president said he would ""transmit to Vladimir."" Other members of the Obama administration claimed the U.S. can work with Russia and ""reset"" its relationship with the former Cold War adversary. In March 2009, shortly after Obama was first elected, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a red button emblazoned with what she thought was the Russian word for ""reset,"" in a symbolic gesture of diplomacy. The translation was wrong, and the ""reset"" has not taken hold. A ?

Following the election of Donald Trump in 2016, Democrats began to blame Russia for meddling in the presidential election. Trump's presidency was plagued with constant accusations of having colluded with Russian President Vladimir Putin and not being hard enough on the country. In June, Biden met with Putin in Geneva hoping for a ""predictable and rational"" relationship. ""I think it’s always better to meet face to face, try to determine where we have mutual interest, cooperate,"" Biden said.

During a marathon press conference last week, Biden raised eyebrows when he said action by following a Russian incursion ""depends"" on the size of the invasion. ""It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion, and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera,"" he said.

""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" host Tucker Carlson joined ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday to highlight the Biden administration's border policy hypocrisy as it weighs sending U.S. troops to Ukraine amid the ongoing crisis at the southern border. Carlson told Ainsley Earhardt, Steve Doocy, and Brian Kilmeade ""this is the behavior of a failed state"" after Fox News obtained video showing the mass release of migrants into the United States. , ‘ ’: : This is the behavior of a failed state. You have no control over your borders. Therefore, you're not really a country in the most basic sense. And if you don't believe it, take a look at the legislation that Nancy Pelosi is pushing right now. She's demanded an early vote on it that describes Ukraine's borders as essential to sovereignty and nationhood. If Ukraine can't control its borders, if people are coming across unauthorized, if undocumented Russians are coming across in caravans into Ukraine, then it's not really a country and the United States needs to step in and stop that. Well, she's actually right. I personally don't care that much about Ukraine because I'm not Ukrainian, I'm American. But if you're going to apply the same standards to this country, what would you call it? You would say we obviously lost a war, we've been invaded, and that's not an attack on the people coming across. Every one of them might be a future Nobel Prize winner. It's an attack on our leaders because this is not the way an actual country maintains its sovereignty. It's how it loses its sovereignty, and they're doing it on purpose. And I don't know why nobody in Congress seems as outraged about this as they do about what's happening in Ukraine. I honestly don't know.",0
2022-01-26,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-ukraine-tensions-escalate-congress-weigh-in,"Reporter’s Notebook: Russia-Ukraine tensions escalate, and Congress may weigh in","The 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host joined 'Fox & Friends,' arguing our leaders should maintain American sovereignty at the southern border as a potential Ukraine deployment looms. – When war drums sound in Europe, they reverberate inside the Washington Beltway. The Biden administration says it won’t allow the threat by Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine go unchallenged. The Pentagon is shifting 8,500 troops to ""heightened alert"" to deter a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""Missions have not been assigned,"" said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. ""There is not a mission, per se."" The U.S. will measure any response. ""There not going to be any American forces moving into Ukraine,"" said President Biden. President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin arrive to meet at the Villa la Grange in Geneva, Switzerland, June 16, 2021. ‘ ’ ' 'T The administration is still reeling from what is perhaps the most significant debacle of Biden’s 53 weeks in office: the botched withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan. Moreover, the U.S. must tread carefully when directly infusing itself into a conflict with Russia. A fraught, Cold War history lingers more than three decades after the Soviet Union dissolved. A miscalculation or mistaken provocation holds dire consequences. The U.S. is dispatching American forces to the easternmost reaches of : Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. This is both a threat and a deterrence. But we’ve been down this road before. Putin invaded Crimea – a portion of Ukraine – shortly after Russia hosted the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014. Then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko came to Washington a few months later to address a Joint Session of Congress. Poroshenko pleaded with U.S. lawmakers to aid Ukraine. ""They need more military equipment, both lethal and nonlethal,"" said Poroshenko to lawmakers. ""Blankets and night-vision goggles are also important. But one cannot win the war with blankets."" Ukraine finally scored $70 million in nonlethal aid from the U.S. and tens of millions to help the nation harden its borders. But Poroshenko indicated that in 2014, former President Obama wasn’t willing to do much else. Poroshenko made an ominous prediction to lawmakers. ""These threats now challenge Europe,"" Poroshenko said at the Capitol. ""If are not stopped now, they will cross European borders and spread, absolutely, throughout the world."" So the U.S. is trying to decide what to do about Ukraine. Congress usually wades into these affairs at some point. Kirby said he was ""not aware"" of any provision that would require congressional sign-off to justify any engagement of American forces in a defensive posture outside of Ukraine. But those who study congressional ""war powers"" always pay attention once any administration begins moving around forces abroad in anticipation of a potential conflict. Let’s start with the basics. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution requires an authorization of Congress to ""declare war."" Article , Section 2 of the Constitution says that ""the president shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States."" These two passages reflect the inherent tension embedded in the Constitution over which branch of government actually controls the military when it comes to conflict. Certainly the U.S. is not at ""war"" with Russia. And, Congress hasn’t actually ""declared war"" since it did so with Romania in 1942. But Congress routinely approves resolutions giving its blessing for the use of the military overseas. Lawmakers approved the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, authorizing U.S. intervention in Vietnam. Congress 'd ""Authorizations for Use of Military Force"" to justify combat in Afghanistan, and, more broadly, global counterterrorism operations in 2001. Congress also 'd an in 2002 for the war in Iraq in 2003. The administrations of Presidents George W. Bush, Obama, Trump and, to a lesser degree, Biden, have all relied on the 2001 and 2002 s as rationale for a litany of overseas military engagements. Some are close to the original, congressional intent. Others stray further afield. That calls into question the constitutionality of such operations. Members of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, volunteer military units of the Armed Forces, train in a city park in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Jan. 22, 2022. Dozens of civilians have been joining Ukraine's army reserves in recent weeks amid fears about Russian invasion. 'S ‘ ’ , Overall, the U.S. has leaned on the 2001 as pretext for military efforts in Djibouti, assistance in Niger, and varying degrees of combat or support in Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Libya and Iraq. This is why some lawmakers of both parties question the legitimacy of the U.S. repeatedly recycling an authorization that is now more than two decades old and approved while Ground Zero and the Pentagon still smoldered after 9/11. Congress actually came close to repealing the 2002 . The House voted last year 268-161 to repeal that measure. Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Todd Young, R-Ind., crafted a repeal plan for the Senate. The Senate expected to vote in December to formally repeal the 2002 . But that vote got lost in the December chaos of Capitol Hill. So Kirby says an isn’t required for any current operations linked to Ukraine. And, even if it was clear an was necessary, it’s apparent that repurposing the 2001 and 2002 s for any engagements are bridges too far. But Congress could infuse itself into this subject with various debates on resolutions regarding U.S. policy toward Russia, Ukraine or the use of troops. The U.S. and engaged in the Balkans as the former Yugoslavia splintered in the 1990s. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, right, speaks with Croatia's Foreign Minister Gordan Grlic Radman during a meeting of foreign ministers at the European Council building in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday. : , 'S Congress sent mixed messages about U.S. military activity in the Balkans back then. President Clinton decided to send troops to help enforce peace in Bosnia after the former Yugoslavia devolved into civil war. The Senate approved a measure saying it supported the troops involved in the mission. But senators voted specifically against the fact that Clinton elected to send troops overseas. Then, in the ultimate fig leaf, the House rejected the president’s decision to send troops. But the in the same resolution, the House indicated it would be supportive of forces overseas. The president sought the support of Congress to boost ""the morale of our troops."" In 1999, the Senate voted 58-41 to back the U.S. working with to bomb Serbia as the Balkan wars continued. The leadership in Belgrade oppressed Kosovo. That prompted to act. But the House shocked the Clinton White House. On a 213-213 vote, the House defeated the Senate resolution to endorse the airstrikes. By rule, tie votes fail. The House and Senate are both out of session this week. But Congress historically makes noise about such military deployments and requests information about the goals of the mission. Lawmakers on the left and right form an odd coalition about presidential war powers and congressional authority to keep watch over the executive branch. This is augmented by the fact that Congress granted President George W. Bush a blank check with the 2001 . Moreover, one could see a scenario where Congress weighs in on potential military action overseas in an upcoming omnibus spending bill to fund the government by Feb. 18. Control of the purse strings represents the ultimate power in Congress. Lawmakers could either tack on money for Ukraine aid – or place strictures on what the U.S. is allowed to do militarily. The war drums overseas always echo inside the halls of Capitol Hill. It’s unclear what may unfold in Ukraine and what that means for the U.S. military. But Congress usually sends a legislative signal indicating its agreement or dissent.",13
2022-01-26,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-democrats-border-security,"Tucker Carlson: Democrats suddenly value border security, just not the US border","‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host slams the administration for prioritizing the safety of Ukraine’s borders over the southern border. News Alert for you: Nancy Pelosi is even more agitated tonight than usual. On a conference call just hours ago, Pelosi demanded that her members vote immediately on a piece of legislation she says is critical to our national security. The bill she's talking about, among other things, affirms the central importance of national borders. Well, of course, it does. Without a border, you can't have a country. And Nancy Pelosi firmly believes that. In fact, she believes it so strongly she's directing the Biden administration to develop an urgent new plan to keep the border secure. In fact, not simply secure, but in the words of the new legislation, Section 208, inviolable, meaning impossible to breach. Walled up and buttoned-down. Bulletproof. That's quite a border. But why wouldn't it be? When it comes to borders, Nancy Pelosi isn't messing around. Are you surprised to hear this? Well, you may have misunderstood. Pelosi isn't talking about the U.S. border, the one that's currently open. She's talking about the Ukrainian border, the one that actually matters. 'S ‘ ’ , The bill Pelosi is promoting is called the Defending Ukraine's Sovereignty Act. Its purpose is to guarantee, ""Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity."" These are the things that all countries need. We'd love to have them here. But no, we're going to have to wait. Ukraine is ahead of us in the queue for secure borders, and honestly, you can see why. As we used to say when we were kids growing up in the United States, ""What's good for the lightly populated Russian colony of Ukraine is good for us."" As our oldest and most cherished ally yoked tightly to the American people by the ancient bonds of friendship, shared culture and Burisma, Ukraine comes first. It has to come first. When caravans of undocumented Russians appear on the Ukrainian border, the United States doesn't sit idly by. The United States swoops in with deadly weapons to push these people back. We'll send missiles to Ukraine if we have to. In fact, we already have — billions of dollars worth. But wait a second, you ask, isn’t undocumented immigration a good thing? Doesn't immigration increase diversity, the blessed source of all beauty, power and strength? Well, sure, most of the time it does, but not in Ukraine. Ukraine exists for the exclusive presence of Ukrainians. People who look or speak differently, people from other places with, say, different religions are not allowed in Ukraine, period. That's Nancy Pelosi's position. Ukraine is the one place Nancy Pelosi very much wants to keep racially pure. She's willing to use lethal force to do that. Virtually everyone in Congress agrees with Pelosi. So does the White House. Here's Joe Biden's deputy national security adviser explaining that when undocumented foreign nationals arrive in Ukraine, they'll be killed. : Why should Americans care about what's happening in Ukraine? : Because it goes to a very fundamental principle of all nations, which is that our borders should be inviolate, that our sovereignty should be respected. Our borders should be inviolate. Our sovereignty should be respected, meaning Ukraine's. That man was Jonathan Finer. He's Biden's deputy national security adviser. It's interesting to note that Jonathan Finer has no relevant experience for the job he currently holds. At one point, he was a Washington Post reporter. That's reassuring. Most recently, he was cashing in at a private equity firm, paying approximately half the federal tax rate. Good for him. : , 'S But one thing Jonathan Finer has learned along the way is that Ukrainian borders matter. If you cross without permission, you'll be droned into the next life. Kamala Harris strongly agrees with that. Here's Harris threatening would-be Russian immigrants: : The bottom line is that we have been clear and consistent for quite some time that we respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, and we expect that Russia would do the same and any aggressive action taken by Vladimir Putin will be met with severe consequences. Severe consequences. The understatement is chilling. That woman is bloodthirsty. That’s our border czar. Try to cross the border, and we'll take out your entire caravan. Claim asylum? What’s asylum? I don't think so. One toe over the line and you're dead. Russian president Vladimir Putin Those are strong words, but Kamala Harris appears to mean them. She probably does mean them. But again, you should know that Kamala Harris is not talking about our border here in the U.S. She's talking about the Ukrainian border. Now, what's the difference between the two? Well, the Ukrainian border, by contrast, is a place the Pentagon is willing to defend. : Eight-thousand, five-hundred U.S. military personnel on heightened alert. Is this the ceiling of military personnel that the administration will be committing to this conflict, do you see? : Well, it's what we're talking about today is about 8,500 on heightened alert. But as I said yesterday, we're certainly not going to rule out other options. Our job is to provide options to the president and the commander-in-chief, and we're going to continue to do that. And so I would, I certainly would not rule out the possibility that we could be putting additional forces on heightened alert in the coming days and weeks, and maybe even moving troops around Europe. They’re already there, to bolster and to reassure some of our allies on the ground on the continent. Wait, we're only sending 8,500 American troops to protect the Ukrainian border, asked the teleprompter. Well, says John Kirby, actually, we could send a lot more. They're all poised to secure the sacred Ukrainian border. So you may be wondering, how does that commitment compare to what the Pentagon is willing to deploy to our southern border? Well, let's see, a little back-of-the-envelope math here. It's exactly 8,500 more because there are no troops, no American troops heading to our southern border. That may seem distressing to you, but in a way it makes sense. Ukraine needs the troops. Ukraine hasn't been invaded yet. We have been invaded, and we lost. We've been defeated. And like all vanquished nations, we're being treated with humiliating contempt by world leaders, in this case, by our own leaders. Customs and Border Protection just released the latest statistics on the invasion ongoing into this country. In the month of December, last month, the feds encountered close to 180,000 illegal immigrants, foreign nationals whose identities we can't know, on the southwest border. Here, all living here now. How many people is that? Well, for perspective, that's more than the three previous December's combined. In the last calendar year, more than 2 million foreign nationals swept across the Mexican border unimpeded into this country and now live here. That's a lot of people. Many times the population of Boston, Atlanta, Denver, pick a city. In one year. But you know what it's more than? It's a lot more than the Russian Army has amassed on the Ukrainian border, something we're all hysterical about. And of course, it's not just people coming illegally into this country. It's the drugs they are bringing. Record amounts of narcotics, narcotics which are driving the single-most deadly drug epidemic in the history of this country. : . You probably know someone who's had a loved one die. Not just habitual drug users, but people using drugs recreationally. They're mixed with fentanyl, and they're dead. Thousands and thousands, more than 100,000 in one year. Who's doing this? The cartels. They're killing far more Americans than Vladimir Putin ever could. And they're doing it with the help of the Biden administration. But in the meantime, we've got 2 million more new people living in this country. Who are they? Well, we can't say for sure. No one really knows who they are. That's part of the problem. In an age when the rest of us are followed and surveilled and ""show your medical papers or some facial recognition software,"" we're letting in too many people. We can't prove who they are. We have no way of doing that. Don't let them lie to you. We do know they're coming from all over the world. Fox's Bill Melugin has been virtually the only person in American media to keep track of what is happening here. Here's part of what he found: : Video from a law enforcement source shows a single, massive group of about 400 migrants who crossed illegally into Eagle Pass, Texas, on Wednesday night. Border Patrol photos show the size of that group, with the sector chief himself saying this was no coincidence. It was orchestrated by criminal elements for money. The night before, the exact same thing happened. Photos from Border Patrol show another group of 400 after they crossed illegally into Eagle Pass Tuesday night. … Here in the Rio Grande Valley, we embedded with Texas as they track down runners in the brush looking to evade near La Hoya, Texas. Two men in this group were from China. That was Bill Melugin on the border, he's still there. This is an ongoing assault on our national sovereignty, on our territorial integrity, the things we've been hearing for the last month or so vitally important in Ukraine. How does this happen? Who's the Vladimir Putin in this morality tale? Well, that would be Joe Biden. This is all been allowed, enabled, encouraged by Joe Biden, with the help of big corporations and left-wing nonprofits. 'S Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who really should be charged with the crime but hasn't been yet recently, bragged to News that ""We have fundamentally changed immigration enforcement in the interior. For the first time ever, our policy explicitly states that a non-citizen's unlawful presence in the United States will not by itself be a basis for the initiation of an enforcement action."" So what does that mean exactly? This is the guy charged with enforcing immigration laws, laws that he did not create, he's in the executive branch, they don't create laws. But here's the guy in charge of enforcing them, bragging that he's decided to ignore federal law. These are all laws that our Congress was elected to pass. Oh, thwarting democracy, anyone? Pay no attention. Vladimir Putin is the one who threatens democracy. Everything is fine in this country. We're doing what you elected us to do. They're not even trying. Facebook's not a threat to democracy, how could it be? Mark Zuckerberg funds the Democratic Party. He's a good guy. But Facebook is encouraging this invasion too. Facebook helps its users share information on how to cross the border illegally and how to break our laws. Do they encourage users to cook meth? Here's how you make fentanyl. Here's how child-trafficking can make you millions. Those are crimes to. We can't say that they're doing that, they're encouraging the breaking of federal immigration law. We're not guessing about this. Facebook admitted it recently to the attorney general of the state of Arizona. We're quoting: ""We do allow people to share information about how to enter a country illegally or request information about how to be smuggled."" About how to be smuggled? Facebook is helping people who ""want to be smuggled?"" In addition to being totally evil, these people have no self-awareness. Imagine saying something like that. Uber does it too. Uber drivers are picking up illegal migrants from the border. We know because Fox News spoke to one driver in Arizona who said, ""I just will get a notification of a pickup, head down to the location. There will be a group of 20-plus immigrants standing on the corner waiting for Ubers."" 300 ‘ ’ So again, if Facebook and Uber were abetting child-trafficking, which on some level they are because child-trafficking is an integral part of illegal immigration, so is drug-trafficking, maybe someone will wake up and do something about it. You're seeing people rotting in solitary because they trespass in the Capitol, but Uber and Facebook are helping people violate federal law, and we don't care? No one in Congress is investigating any of this. Sounds like sedition to us. But they're busy. They're sending hundreds of millions of dollars of lethal weapons to Ukraine to help with their border. The Pentagon is not sending troops to our border, they're sending them to Ukraine’s border. So that's the Biden administration's approach. That approach is virtually uncontested in Washington. Here's Mitch McConnell, who poses by day as leader of the opposition in the Senate. : What I’ve been hearing since that is encouraging that they're prepared to take steps before an incursion, not afterward. I've not been near the news this morning, so I'm not sure what additionally may have occurred, but it appears to me the administration is moving in the right direction. Yeah, it appears that way. If the direction you want to move is to completely change the population of the country for political reasons. Let 2 million people in in one year. People whose identities you can't confirm, whose intentions you don't know who are bringing with them record amounts of narcotics that killed over 100,000 Americans. If that's the goal, then Mitch McConnell, you're on to something moving in the right direction. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell But if the goal is to have a first-world country where laws mean something, probably not the right direction. So why are you telling us otherwise, Mitch McConnell? Who are you working for, exactly? Whose side are you on? I think we know. Who's paying for all this stuff? Well, you are. American citizens are paying for it. The United Nations, which takes billions in U.S. tax dollars, is paying for it too. They're giving out cash to illegal migrants heading to our border. An investigation by the Center for Immigration Studies found the U.N. has been handing out cash debit cards to U.S.-bound illegal aliens and giving them advice on how to claim asylum in our country, on how to game our system, on how to make a mockery of our laws. They don't respect us. We don't respect ourselves enough to stop this. Once these migrants get here, authorities do everything possible to make sure they stay, the Biden administration attempted on day one to pause all deportations. That moratorium, thank God, was blocked by a federal judge, but it hardly matters. The administration is continuing to abet criminal behavior, they're allowing illegals to use their arrest warrants as I.D. in airports. You try that. Sorry, I don’t have my I.D., but I do have my arrest warrant. Can I get housing subsidies, food stamps, free health care and a flight? Sure, you can. You're from another country. Americans don't get that. Here's another report from Bill Melugin: : confirms to Fox News that the agency is allowing illegal immigrants to use arrest warrants as I.D. at security checkpoints in airports, telling us in part, quote, ""For non-citizens and non-U.S. nationals who do not otherwise have acceptable forms of I.D. for presentation at security checkpoints, may also accept certain -issued forms, including Form I-200 ."" You just can't repeat this enough, and again, we're doing this not because we think it's going to change anything. It won't. This is just a show. But we want a record of what's happening right now. History is rewritten, unfortunately, by the victors. And the details disappear, but we think the details are important. We think we all should be allowed to know why this is happening and how it's happening. So just to restate, we're allowing foreigners who came here illegally in violation of our laws, which are unenforced by our current government, which is undermining democracy by its refusal to enforce those laws, those people get to use their arrest warrants to get on airplanes while you have to show I.D. Meanwhile, again, you can't say this enough, we'll stop after this Congress is doing everything it can, pulling out all the stops to send more money to Eastern Europe to protect the borders of Ukraine. It's like it's not even real, but it is real.",0
2022-01-27,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-russia-ukraine-war-china-taiwan-scott-franklin,Biden's weakness with Russia risks war in Ukraine—and elsewhere,"Former deputy national security adviser reacts to Biden saying Putin will face 'enormous consequences' if Russia invades Ukraine. One year into the Joe Biden presidency, critics have justifiably focused on his failed economic, border, and policies. Let’s face it: those are low-hanging fruit and the consequences for Americans are significant. But with Russian forces poised to invade Ukraine, Beijing forcing its will on the world, and rogue nations provoking the international community, Biden’s weakness on the world stage risks drawing the U.S. into a hurricane of international security crises with massive implications. , - 19: U.S. President Joe Biden answers questions during a news conference in the East Room of the White House on January 19, 2022 in Washington, . With his approval rating hovering around 42-percent, Biden is approaching the end of his first year in the Oval Office with inflation rising, -19 surging and his legislative agenda stalled on Capitol Hill. President Biden was asleep at the wheel on national security policy in 2021. It began with his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and continued during his recent press conference where he practically gave Russia the green light to begin its pending invasion of Ukraine. This wasn’t just a typical slip-up, it was a dangerous diplomatic disaster that prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to remind Biden that there are no such things as ""minor incursions"" for those under attack. While it may be fun to joke about Biden’s verbal gaffes, he is the commander-in-chief and leader of the Free World. His words carry tremendous weight, and any misunderstanding of his comments could jeopardize the lives of millions. While the U.S. is not treaty-bound to defend Ukraine, an invasion still poses a serious risk to American citizens and interests. There are thousands of Americans as well as significant business interests in Ukraine. In the short term, we face the possibility of having Americans trapped behind enemy lines or killed by Russian attacks. In the long run, we can’t expect Russia to stop with Ukraine, based on its track record. Should Russian President Vladimir Putin choose to attack members in Eastern Europe, the U.S. would be required to come to their defense. Vladimir President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Jan. 25, 2022. As they did in Afghanistan, our global adversaries will take note of how the Biden administration responds to this latest Russian aggression. Should the U.S. stand by and watch passively while Ukraine falls into Russian hands, it is reasonable to expect China would make a similar move on Taiwan, anticipating little resistance from Biden. The same could be said for the Iranian regime’s schemes in the Middle East and North Korea’s belligerence in East Asia. The Biden administration’s failure to deter Russia now will sound the alarm for the world’s worst actors to strike. If President Biden does not radically alter his national security strategy from one of appeasement, these foreign threats will snowball and eventually impact U.S. interests at home. As Winston Churchill said, ""An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last."" When Republicans retake the House in November, Congress must exercise its oversight authority to ensure the Biden administration pursues a national security strategy of peace through strength. Americans might ask why they should be concerned with conflicts happening thousands of miles away while domestic issues plague our own country. It’s a fair question. As the primary defender of freedom in the world, the U.S. does not have the luxury of ignoring threats abroad. Left alone, it may not be long before the blood of America’s sons and daughters is once again spilled on foreign soil.",22

If you've been following the news at all recently, you know that Vladimir Putin is just seconds away from invading our ancient ally, our closest friend on the world stage, that would be the sovereign nation of Ukraine. In response to this news, lovers of democracy everywhere are horrified. This is a slow-motion disaster. In effect, it's the first domino. First, the Russians come for Ukraine. Next, it's Bangor, Boise, Bakersfield. What Vladimir Putin plans next will make Red Dawn look like a documentary. So, of course, defenders of democracy everywhere are horrified by this, and they're ready to fight. Now, , whose job it apparently is to contain Russia, has not yet committed to defending Ukraine for some reason. But patriotic Americans are not waiting for . That's not their way. According to a piece in BuzzFeed, American citizens are joining the fight on their own. It's their Spanish Civil War. They're paying their way to Ukraine to defend the noble Ukrainian people against the dastardly Russian hordes on the frozen steppe. But strangely, and this is weird, we have no confirmation tonight that David Frum, Max Boot and Liz Cheney have left yet for Kyiv, and maybe they're still oiling their rifles and gathering their kit, or maybe they've decided to man the cable news barricades. Just because they're technically behind the lines doesn't make their service less perilous or important, and someday they're all going to get medals for the sacrifices they're now making in Studios in New York City. And we plan to cover that ceremony live. But in the meantime, Joe Biden seems most worried of all. Joe Biden is so panicked about what's about to happen to Ukraine, he makes Bill Kristol seem understated and restrained. And that's not really surprising, because Joe Biden is the president of the United States. He's got access to all the latest intel. It's delivered to him daily by the weapons of mass destruction division at . Those guys are on it. This week, Biden got so concerned after reading what the delivered him, he's so worried about what's about to happen to Ukraine, that Joe Biden called the president of Ukraine to warn him about his fate. And then someone in the intel community leaked the transcript of that call to , not for the first time. : We have breaking news for you and our world lead, a senior Ukrainian official tells that today's phone call between President Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky quote ‘did not go well.’ Our source tells that the two disagreed about the immediacy of the threat of a Russian attack on Ukraine. The White House and Pentagon have been emphatic that they believe an attack could be imminent. We should note the White House just released its own readout of that call, and there was no mention of President Biden's warnings or the two president’s disagreements. Woah. First, we should note that is perfectly capable of taking spin-filled propaganda calls from agents of the Ukrainian government, but you can't talk to Russia because that's treason. But here's the headline: It looks like there is daylight between the world's two closest leaders - brothers, really. And that suggests there might be a breach in the unbreakable bond forged over centuries between Ukraine and the United States. This is from 's Natasha Bertrand. She did this reporting: ""Per a senior Ukrainian official … Biden told President Zelensky that a Russian invasion of Ukraine is now virtually certain and that Kyiv could be sacked. Prepare for impact. Biden reportedly said President Zelensky disagreed and, as I reported, asked him to tone down the rhetoric."" What? Joe Biden is more worried about Russia than the president of Ukraine is? It looks that way. Because not long after that reporting, said Natasha Bertrand deleted that tweet. Oh, and then an hour later, 's Jim Sciutto contradicted 's own previous reporting. He tweeted out this White House statement, which qualifies as reporting, a statement from the White House. Here's what it said: "" on Biden-Zelensky call: ‘Anonymous sources are ’leaking' falsehoods. President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February. He has said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months…Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false. … Also this: ""Also, no one said ‘sacked.’ The only person who should be ‘sacked’ is the anonymous source who is circulating an inaccurate portrayal of this conversation."" Not an actual denial, therefore it's true. It's an amazing sequence, really, if you think about it. So Biden tells the Ukrainian president that his capital city is about to be sacked like Rome in the fifth century, blood and screams, fire, spears and swords, seizures and trebuchet, a horrible scene. And Ukrainians, in response to this, ""calm down, dude, you're freaking me out. Toughen up, you sound like a terrified old woman."" : . . Now, the White House claims that conversation never happened, but clearly, it did happen because at a press conference today, President Zelensky said virtually the same thing to the media. : We've talked to the president, we've talked about this, we think that it has to be there has to be a balanced approach. I'm not saying that they, he's influencing American media, the independent, but the media policy there has to be very well-balanced if they want to know what the situation is that they can come to Kyiv. Do we have tanks on the street? No. The image that mass media creates this, that we have troops on the road, so we have mobilization. People are leaving for places. That's not the case. We don't need this panic. So David Frum and Joe Biden have gotten Americans so whipped into a frenzy over the future of Ukraine that they're flying to Ukraine to risk their lives in defense of that sacred nation's sovereignty. And there's the president of Ukraine saying ""We're not that concerned."" Russian President Vladimir Putin So what can we infer from this? Well, it's simple. If you're not terrified about the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the question is whose side are you on here? Whose side are you on? And we know the answer to that question. You're on Vladimir Putin's side. So it looks like the president of Ukraine himself has been compromised by Russian misinformation. The Ukrainian president is what we on cable news refer to as an agent of Putin, and that means the Russians are so diabolically effective they've recruited the guy they're preparing war against. How clever is that? It would take a Slavic mind to pull that off? And by the way, yes, we are calling the president of Ukraine an agent of Putin, but we're not judging him. In fact, we can relate. We can empathize because, as you know, if you watch the media where agents are put in to. , : Fox's chief propagandist Tucker Carlson, saying that the U.S. should be siding with Russia over Ukraine. What you may say? , : Members of Congress are actually getting phone calls encouraging them to side with Russia because they're watching right-wing media and people like Tucker Carlson… , : It is striking how neatly Kremlin propaganda seems to dovetail with Carlson's talking points. . , : When Tucker Carlson delivers this message, it’s dangerous. , : Now Tucker seems to have a larger pattern here with tyrants who lean to the right. , : But why is he so committed and why is Fox News on his behalf so committed to tearing down the American embrace and support and alignment with the world’s democracies? , : Tucker is utterly shameless. If he had any capacity to feel any shame, he should be embarrassed by what he just said, because he is basically repeating rank Russian propaganda. Mr. Max Boot, Ladies and gentlemen in his final domestic television appearance before he heads to Ukraine to defend that nation himself, its territorial integrity, from the aggression of Vladimir Putin. Watch him while you can. , 5K But let's be clear about what the terms are. In the United States - and this does not apply to Ukraine, where they have probably the more sane view of it, or maybe just more Russian influence - but in the United States, if you raise any questions about the wisdom of siding, in a war in Eastern Europe, with one country over another, you are by definition, an agent of the single greatest threat to democracy on this globe, Mr. Vladimir Putin himself. You're treasonous. Russian President Vladimir Putin Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey is claiming that viewers of this show, Russian Robots to a man, reached out to his office and did something horrifying, something they probably should be legal, they said ""maybe we shouldn't go to war over Ukraine."" : Can you just tell us about these phone calls that your office is getting? . : This yeah, sure, it really started yesterday, I was in my district office in New Jersey and phones were ringing and my district director came to me and said I just spent an hour on the phone with, like, four people telling me that they'd watch Tucker Carlson last night. And why are we going to be going to war for Ukraine? Russia's making reasonable proposals for peace, and we should just do what Russia wants. Yeah. A lot of people said, Tom Malinowski, you know, is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, right? Even by the standards in New Jersey. However, he makes a really good point. There are people out there who look around and decide, maybe, I don't know, homelessness - close to a million people living on the street in the United States – 100,000 Americans dying of drug overdoses, inflation, the fact our schools haven't taught anything in over two years, maybe these are more important concerns in the territorial integrity of a country we can't find on a map. Maybe our own territorial integrity is more important than Ukraine's. And the question Rep. Malinowski raises is why would they ever think that? Where would they get the idea that their stupid, parochial domestic concerns are more important than Ukraine's eastern border? And the answer, of course, is Vladimir Putin. They've obviously fallen for the Russian propaganda. That would be us doing Vladimir Putin's bidding. Like the president of Ukraine, we're guilty.",0
2022-01-30,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-putin-weakness-ukraine-soviet-union-reconstruct-empire-tom-cotton,"With Biden, Putin knows 'weakness is provocative' as he seeks to reconstruct pre-Soviet 'empire': Cotton","Arkansas lawmaker and China expert join 'Life, Liberty & Levin' Russian President Vladimir Putin potentially sees an opportunity to continue his alleged goal of reconstructing the Russian Empire, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told Fox News. From the 1700s through World War I, the Russian Empire consisted of many more states than the already sprawling country of Russia. In an interview on ""Life, Liberty & Levin,"" Cotton told host Mark Levin that recouping as much former landmass as he can remains Putin's aim. ""Weakness is provocative, and Joe Biden has given our adversaries like Vladimir Putin every reason to believe that he will respond to a crisis with weakness — that's what he did for 50 years as a senator and vice president,"" Cotton said. Putin, in the wake of Biden's comments, says Russia knows ""how to defend our own interests."" ""But it counts now that he's president,"" he continued. ""So if you look at how we got into this situation, I think it frames the question well: Vladimir Putin has been talking about pretexts, red herrings. He can't let 's include Ukraine. Well, there's no plan for Ukraine to join . He can't tolerate military exercises in Ukraine. We don't conduct military exercises in Ukraine."" ""The real reasons why Vladimir Putin has sparked this crisis is he wants to fulfill his long-held ambitions. First, he wants to reassemble the Greater Russian Empire."" Many of the former empire lands as well as states of the defunct Soviet Union, including Ukraine, are today independent nations with sovereign governments. Putin previously invaded Ukraine to annex its eastern Crimea region, which essentially gave him valuable access to the Black Sea. Many of the Baltic States and those in the Caucasus region like Azerbaijan and Georgia were once part of the Russian Empire. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko speaks in Minsk on May 28, 2021. Cotton referenced how one of the former Soviet states, Belarus, can already be viewed as a ""puppet government"" friendly to Putin by way of its authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko. Part of Putin's vision is to have Kremlin-friendly ""buffer"" countries between it and member-nations, Cotton said, adding that invading Ukraine would further that goal. ""He doesn't want any successful democracy on his borders because he's afraid his own people will look at democracies in places like Ukraine and Georgia and say, 'Well, why can't we have that here in Russia?'"" Cotton said, as Putin has been in high office since 1999, save for a few years when he was prime minister under his political ally, former President Dmitry Medvedev. ""So why has [Putin] sparked this crisis now?"" Cotton asked. ""It's because Joe Biden has projected weakness to him for the last year and appeased him."" ""[Biden] gave away the store in his first week in office on a one-sided nuclear arms control treaty. He waived sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. He basically looked the other way on the Colonial Pipeline hack. He released a Russian cyber criminal early at the request of Russia. And then, of course, the Afghanistan debacle exposed Joe Biden's inept and incompetent military leadership as commander-in-chief."" ""It's that series of appeasement and weakness over the last year that has caused Vladimir Putin to think now is the time to go for the jugular in Ukraine."" Cotton reminded Levin that ex-Defense Secretary Robert Gates once said Biden had been ""wrong about nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the last 40 years."" ""Now you can make it 50 years as well,"" Cotton said. ""I think Vladimir Putin's view of Joe Biden is central to what's happening in Eastern Europe right now.""

2022-01-30,https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-handicap-strategy-ukraine-russia-conflict,China will impede vital US strategy to stop Ukraine-Russia conflict: Former defense official,"Fox News senior strategic analyst says officials need to give 100% effort and not minimize the threat if America is going to help defend Ukraine. Any economic sanctions imposes against Russia will have minimal impact since China would provide relief in an effort to embarrass the U.S., a former defense official told Fox News Digital. Diplomatic discussions stalled this week after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken provided a handwritten response to Russian demands. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that the response offered ""little ground for optimism"" but acknowledged ""prospects for continuing dialogue."" The U.S. has threatened to hit Russia with sanctions – both on the state itself and against individuals, including President Vladimir Putin – should it proceed to invade Ukraine. Robert Wilkie, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, holds a briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S. November 8, 2019. But Robert L. Wilkie, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness during the Trump administration and Visiting Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said that any such economic punishments would not provide the kind of impact American officials believe it will due to Russia's strong bond with China. ""A lot of the talk about economic sanctions is really a pie in the sky because China is now Russia’s banker,"" Wilkie argued. ""Xi Jinping will back Putin if sanctions from the West come."" , 5K ""That’s a safety net he probably didn’t have 10, 15 years ago, and China probably wasn’t capable of buttressing the Russian state as it is now,"" he added. U.S. sanctions on Russia - which might include cutting off Moscow's access to and related world banking funds - might simply push Russia to instead increase sales of oil and gas to China: Russia in 2020 accounted for 15.5% of China's imported crude oil, according to Worlds Top Exports. That currently makes Russia the second-biggest oil and gas exporter to China. Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, June 5, 2019. /Evgenia Novozhenina/Pool ""[China] would start buying a lot more energy from Russia,"" Wilkie explained. ""If we went to move on the loan system that gives Russia access to western capital, China would pick up the slack with that."" ""Even if the Germans were to do an about-face on the Nord Stream 2, China would pick up the slack - they need the energy as much if not more than Europe does. That's how I would see that playing out,"" he said. Xi just this week said that China's ambitions of hitting low-carbon goals should not come at the expense of ""normal life,"" claiming that such energy cuts might risk food and other everyday securities. Xi told party leaders late on Monday that China needed to ""overcome the notion of rapid success,"" The Guardian reported. 'S - ""We must stick to the overall planning and ensure energy security, industrial supply chain security and food security at the same time as cutting carbon emissions,"" Xi said, indicating the reliance on gas and oil will not go away - providing Russia its much-needed backdoor. The dynamic between Russia and China has evolved considerably over the past 50 years: They remained tenuous allies at best following World War , and tensions between the two nations reached a boiling point during the Nixon administration, which then-President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger exploited to bust up the union. Residents walk past the Beijing Winter Olympics logo near the central business district in Beijing, China, Friday, Jan. 21, 2022. China is limiting the torch relay for the Winter Olympics to only three days amid coronavirus worries, organizers said Friday. But that ""ancient animosity"" has been ""buried,"" according to Wilkie, with Putin now the ""junior partner in the arrangement"" due to China’s economic might. ""China is willing to help anyone as long as that diminishes the United States in the eyes of the world,"" Wilkie said. , Wilkie argued that the U.S. did not take the steps necessary to bring Russia into the western fold following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the same way it did with Germany and Japan after World War . Officials instead did a ""victory dance"" for two decades, creating a very bitter attitude that allowed Putin to push forth a very aggressive agenda to overhaul the military and state. Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping hold regular calls now, with the most recent meeting occurring on Dec. 15 last year looking for ""mutual support"" in their conflicts with west, according to The New York Times. That dynamic may even impact Putin’s plans for invasion: Recent intelligence suggests that Russia may take military action by mid-February, but some have pushed back on those suggestions in the belief that Putin would not want to upset China by doing so during the Beijing Winter Olympics. China has jumped through a number of hoops and gone to great lengths – including mass isolations to stamp down the possibility of a -19 outbreak in Beijing – to ensure the games move forward.",5

Nigel Farage, former leader of the Brexit Party, warned that America's leadership role on the world stage is in question as Russia continues to threaten Ukraine. On ""Fox & Friends First"" Monday, Farage explained that President Biden's decision to unilaterally withdraw troops from Afghanistan has caused U.S. allies to lose trust. , ‘ ’ : The U.S.'s leadership role in the Western world is very much in doubt at the moment. What happened with the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and not just the Taliban taking over again after 20 years, not just the atrocities that have taken place, but the fact the withdrawal happened from the Americans unilaterally without consulting their colleagues who fought beside them for 20 years now opens up a question of trust. Can we trust Joe Biden to actually work with allies? It's all very ironic, isn't it really? Because he said, ‘America is back.’ Well actually, America now is really quite isolated. We're not sure whether we can trust them, but I've got one idea of what could come out of this. The continued expansion of and the European Union to the East has genuinely been seen by Putin as a provocative encroachment act. And I was very surprised when Antony Blinken the other day basically hinted that if Ukraine wants to join , that's fine. Well, all that would do is inflame tensions, and I would very much like them to say today, 'no, Ukraine won't be joining . But if you do, after us putting forward this act, this genuine act of goodwill, if you do then invade, then we'll take very tough penalties indeed.' And I think strategically that would put us in a more coherent position. But whether the Americans can win the trust in the room remains to be seen.",0

Looming over everything is the Ukraine issue, which already appears to be straining relations between Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Last week as Zelenskyy sought to project stability in the face of the Russian military buildup on his border, the White House directly refuted him and said it's very likely Russia launches a full-scale attack. ""We understand the difficult position President Zelenskyy is in and the pressure he’s under,"" a White House official told Fox News Saturday. ""But at the same time he’s downplaying the risk of invasion, he’s asking for hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to defend against one. We think it’s important to be open and candid about that threat."" Russia also moved medical units to the Ukrainian border, a defense official confirmed to Fox News – yet more evidence an invasion could be imminent. Members of Ukraine's volunteer Territorial Defense Forces train in a park in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Jan. 22, 2022. Dozens of civilians have been joining Ukraine's army reserves in recent weeks amid fears about a Russian invasion. , : That means Congress may have little time to ready a sanctions package against Russia as retaliation for any invasion. It also means Biden is likely to be on the defensive over his handling of Russia, whether the invasion could have been prevented and whether his handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin. Republicans are already attacking him for it. ""If Vladimir Putin has seen what Joe Biden has done over the last year and then he saw his fecklessness in Afghanistan, and I'm afraid that he thinks now is the time to go for the jugular in Ukraine,"" Sen. Tom Cotton. R-Ark., said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is pushing Congress to counter the United States' other major geopolitical foe and send a China competition bill to Biden's desk. The Senate passed a bipartisan competition bill last year, but it stalled over differences with the House's version. President Joe Biden and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are at odds over the likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. ) : ‘ ’ Raimondo last week lauded a new bill introduced by House Democrats as able to ""create good jobs, rebuild American manufacturing, and strengthen our supply chains here at home for years ahead."" But House Republicans are already attacking it, and it's not clear the bill could make it through the Senate. House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said the House Democrats' bill ""torpedo[es] the chance of a bipartisan, bicameral bill to confront the generational threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party."" Also coming up is a Senate confirmation process for a nominee to replace the retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Biden said he will nominate a Black woman to fill Breyer's seat by the end of February. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer announces his retirement at the White House, Thursday, Jan. 27, 2022. Finding a replacement is just one more item on Biden's plate. . ‘ ’ J. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on 's ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that he ""cannot say anything bad"" about J. Michelle Childs, one of the rumored front-runners for the nomination. And with favorable Senate conditions for Biden's eventual nominee, whether or not it is Childs, the confirmation process could be Biden's best chance to score a big political win. But that process will eat up time as Congress tries to deal with a bevy of other issues. They include funding the government, potential Electoral Count Act reforms, and continued calls by progressives for Democrats to pass the Build Back Better social spending bill amid increasing frustration from the party base with their leaders. reform would target perceived loopholes in the law former President Donald Trump tried to take advantage of to remain in office as he falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen. 'S : , It is being spearheaded by moderates like Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine. Many Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., say they are for it. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said passing Electoral Count Act reform without broader election bills would be insufficient. That bill will have to overcome some political hurdles, however, including progressives who are upset Republicans filibustered Democrats' sprawling election reform bills and say reform isn't enough. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called only reforming the ""unacceptably insufficient"" earlier this month. Schumer appears to be walking back that stance, Politico reported. It remains to be seen whether progressives will do the same. Trump also put out a statement Sunday attacking the reform efforts that may motivate some Republicans aligned with him to oppose any such bill. On top of all that, the government is set to run out of funding on Feb. 18 after Congress passed a stopgap spending bill last year. Thile the risk of a shutdown is not very high, the effort to come to a long-term budget deal will steal yet more of lawmakers' attention. If a deal is not reached, another short-term government funding bill may be necessary. And even as talks remain stalled with few if any signs of life, the Congressional Progressive Caucus is demanding Senate Democrats pass it by March 1, the date of Biden's State of the Union address.

The State Department on Thursday warned that, if Russia invades Ukraine, any attempts to offset harsh sanctions against the Kremlin by bolstering the Russia-China alliance will be insufficient.

' ,' ' ,’ Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, June 5, 2019. Reports surfaced Thursday alleging that Russia may be looking to expand its trade deals with China, particularly in the energy sector, as it evaluates the potential inability to use its coveted Nord Stream 2 Pipeline to funnel natural gas into Europe. ""If Russia thinks that it will be in a position to make up some of those consequences … by a closer relationship with the [People’s Republic of China], that is not the case,"" State Department press secretary Ned Price said. ""It will actually make the Russian economy in many ways more brittle,"" he continued. ""If you deny yourself the ability to transact with the West … you are going to significantly degrade your productive capacity and your innovative potential. ""Putin knows that this would be a massive consequence to his country and to his economy,"" he added. Price said the attempt to use China as an economic lifeline would make it more dependent on a singular economic powerhouse. , Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Chinese President Xi Jinping via videoconference in Moscow, Russia. ""This is a recipe for catastrophe for the Russia economy. No partnership can account for the massive economic toll that we’ve talked about,"" he said.

China appeared to land on the side of Russia during a heated meeting at the U.N. Security Council this week when it voted in line with Moscow and attempted to block action regarding Ukraine.

As the U.S. scrambles to solve rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Fox Nation looks back on how former President Ronald Reagan bravely worked to establish peace and see an end to the Cold War. Fox Nation’s documentary, ""Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars,"" explores the negotiation tactics of the former president in a world where many feared nuclear war. -: '' ' ' : When President Reagan came into office, the Soviet Union had tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. The world powers abided by the doctrine of , or mutually assured destruction, Former White House speechwriter Peter Robinson explained. This meant that ""if one side launched a first strike, the other side would have enough nuclear weapons to launch a devastating second strike,"" killing millions of innocent people. Reagan, who deeply respected life after saving 79 people as a lifeguard, sought another alternative. ""All of us working with him knew Ronald Reagan as a hard-liner, both in policy and in defense issues."" Ken Adelman, Reagan’s Arms Control director, told Fox Nation. ""The dirty, little secret was that he was a nuclear abolitionist. He wanted to eliminate all nuclear weapons."" The turning point came after Reagan’s assassination attempt, when he felt he was saved to solve this world crisis. Scientist Edward Teller told the president about a strategic defense as an option to protect the country from incoming ballistic missiles. Reagan ran with the idea, delivering a speech in an attempt to share ""a vision of the future that offers hope."" ""I call upon the scientific community in our country, those who gave us nuclear weapons, to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and world peace, to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete,"" he said on March 30, 1983. The speech, which the cabinet was made aware of only briefly before it took place, shocked the defense and scientific community. Many mocked the idea, calling it ""Star Wars."" However, the Soviet Union was rattled by Reagan’s confidence. ""Reagan was willing obviously to sit down with the Soviets, but he was... just as willing to stand up to the Soviets."" A second turning point occurred when Mikhail Gorbachev proposed a meeting between the powers. Negotiators stayed up all night after the leader had many proposals to reduce nuclear weapons. Gorbachev tried to trap Reagan by asking the U.S. to limit the strategic defense initiative to laboratory testing and no deployment. That is when Reagan walked out of the meeting, standing up for what he believed in. ""Reagan was willing obviously to sit down with the Soviets, but he was... just as willing to stand up to the Soviets,"" Adelman explained. In 1987, Gorbachev signed the agreement and the leaders worked to eliminate a whole class of nuclear weapons. Reagan’s hard work led to great success. Not long after, the Berlin Wall was torn down, Europe was reunified, and the Soviet Union disintegrated, resulting in a new era of peace.

2022-02-05,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-ukraine-policies-washington-priorities,Tucker Carlson: Biden's Ukraine policies reveal how grotesque Washington's priorities are,"'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host examines White House claims of a potential Russian false flag operation. There aren’t a lot of amazing stories left in ""The New York Times,"" they are all so predictable and self-righteous, but if you read the paper yesterday you did see one. ""U.S. Exposes What It Says Is Russian Effort to Fabricate Pretext for Invasion."" That was the headline. The story explained that at some point very soon, Vladimir Putin plans to stage a fake military attack on his own citizens. Putin will use actors to portray Ukrainian soldiers and Intel operatives committing atrocities against Russians. Then he’s going to videotape the whole thing and secretly release to the world. When people in the West see the clips of that on Facebook they will understand why Putin was justified in invading Ukraine. So it's a Psyop. Pretty diabolical. : You may be wondering how exactly how do we know that Vladimir Putin is actually planning to do something like this. Because in real life, the global intelligence world is a very complicated place. People in it rarely tell straightforward truths. So actually, if you are devising propaganda for the Ukrainian government, this might be exactly the kind of story you would place in ""The New York Times,"" which of course is compliant. They're on your side. A story like this would give you a way to plausibly deny attacking Russian citizens. Is that what happened here? We don’t know. We have no idea if ""The New York Times"" account is true or not. Then again, neither does ""The New York Times."" Right in a story, they conceded that the Biden officials ""would not release any direct evidence of the Russian plan or specify how they learned of it,"" saying to do so would ""compromise their sources and methods."" Those must be the same sources and methods the is protecting by continuing to hide thousands of documents from 911 two decades ago, or the Kennedy assassination 60 years ago. If you live in Washington you recognize that that is the all-purpose justification for everything. State Department spokesman Ned price knows exactly how this works because Price began his career at the . Here's what he said at a briefing: : We have previously noted our strong concerns regarding Russian disinformation and the likelihood that Moscow might create a false flag operation to initiate military activity. Now we can say that the United States has information that Russia is planning to stage fabricated attacks by Ukrainian military or intelligence forces as a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine. Wait a second, what was that? A false flag operation? Really? That is a jarring term to hear from a Joe Biden employee much less an official. Because until yesterday we were under the impression false flag operations didn’t exist. And if they did exist it was only within the diseased imagination of conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and his minions in non. That’s what they told us. But now they are telling us that false flag operations are entirely real, except they never happen here. Never in the United States, never in Washington, only in Russia. We will let that digest just for a minute. veteran Ned Price assures us that it is true. Normally that would be the end of it. Reporters would’ve scurried back to the cubicles to write their breathless little stories about Vladimir Putin's false flag operation. And by and large that is exactly what did happen. The stenographers wrote Ned Price’s story. But one of them didn’t. That man’s name is Matt Lee. He’s a State Department reporter for the Associated Press. We know nothing about Matt Lee other than he appears to be a middle-aged man who has been around long enough to ask a skeptical follow-up question or two. In Washington that makes them virtually unique. Lee noticed that Ned Price actually hadn’t said anything that could be checked or even described in meaningful detail. So Lee asked Ned Price, ""What are you actually talking about?"" Here's the exchange that followed. 'T , : , well, that's quite a mouthful there. So you said actions such as these suggest otherwise. Suggest meaning that they suggest they're not interested in talks and they're going to go ahead with some kind. What action are you talking about? : One, the actions I just pointed to. : What actions? : The fact that Russia continues to engage in disinformation. : You made an allegation that they might do that. Have they actually done it? : What we know, Matt, is what I have just said. That they have engaged in this activity. : Hold on a second, what activity? What activity? : This is not the first time we’ve made these reports public. Hold on a second. What are you talking about? That was the question. It was a good question. You wish you heard it more in official briefings, you wish you heard it more in everyday life in this country. It is usually the essential question in the first step towards finding out what the truth is. Ned Price didn’t want to answer that question, but Lee kept pressing him. Why didn’t Matt Lee just take Ned Price’s word for it like everybody else? Maybe because this is the very same Ned Price who has a documented history of lying to reporters in the briefing room. Here is Ned Price promising that Kabul would not fall to the Taliban not long before it did fall to the Taliban: - : ‘I , ’T ' : The president from the day he announced that the U.S. military would be withdrawing, except for the troops necessary to protect our diplomatic compounds, was very clear that we have partnered with the Afghan people and with the Afghan government over the course of some 20 years now. That partnership would not diminish in any way with the military withdrawal from Afghanistan. Again, we retain a diplomatic compound in Kabul. That is what we intend to retain going forward. An Obama administration adviser called on President Biden to ""shake up his national security team"" after the Taliban seizing control of Afghanistan proved the current group has failed to keep America safe. ""Our partnership will not diminish in any way with the military withdrawal from Afghanistan."" Days after Ned Price said that, the Biden back president of Afghanistan through millions of U.S. dollars into a duffel bag and fled to the United Aram Emirates in a private plane. So actually, the partnership did diminish, pretty quickly in fact. Matt Lee has been around long enough to remember that. He probably also remembers the time Colin Powell promised the country there were s in Iraq. He probably remembers when Hillary Clinton claimed our ambassador in Benghazi was murdered over an Islamic-phobic YouTube video. He probably remembers those two separate occasions, not too long ago, when the entire foreign policy establishment in Washington assured us that evil Bashar al-Assad had gassed his own people with poison gas and deserved to be bombed, but at the same time forgot to show us any evidence that it actually happened. We are still waiting on that evidence, by the way. Matt Lee remembers stuff like that and he mentioned it yesterday. : Ned, I’ve been doing this for a while. : You have been doing this for quite a while. You know that when we declassify intelligence we do so with an eye to protecting sources and methods. : I remember a lot of things. So where is the declassified information other than you coming out here and saying? Best question ever: ""Where’s the declassified information other than you coming out here and saying it?"" How thrilling to watch someone ask something so simple. Imagine if the entire press corps acted like that? We might have a decent government. Ned Price seemed completely unprepared for any of this and highly annoyed by it. Nothing in his training had suggested he might encounter disobedient reporters in the White House. So he stuck with what he had which was, ""I said it, therefore it’s true."" Members of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, volunteer military units of the Armed Forces, train in a city park in Kyiv, Ukraine. : We told you a few weeks ago that we have information indicating Russia also has propositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false flag operation in Eastern Ukraine. So that Matt is an action that Russia has already taken. : No. It is an action that you say that they have taken. But you’ve shown no evidence to confirm that. It went on and on like this. If you really want to dislike your government, you can look it up for yourself online. We can tell you Ned Price’s superciliousness gets more nauseating as it goes on. It does make you wonder about the . Do they hire people oily on this purpose? Where do they find people like this? Well, The Georgetown School of Foreign Service, of course. We tell you just one more portion of this exchange in which Matt Lee flips the usual script and accuses Ned Price of sounding like a crazed conspiracy nut. It’s beautiful. : This is like crisis actors, really? This is like Alex Jones territory you're getting into now. What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some propaganda film in the making? : This is derived from information known to the U.S. Government, intelligence information that we have declassified. : Where is it? Where is this information? : It is intelligence information that we have declassified. : Where is the declassified information? : I just delivered it. : No. You made a series of allegations. One correction, Alex Jones lies far less and is far more credible than Ned Price is. You see the point. Ned Price lost that exchange. He claimed to have information that he did not have, and Matt Lee persistently called him out on it. So Ned Price ran out of B.S. The B.S. barrel was empty. So what did Ned Price do then? Ned Price did what they all do when they are cornered. He went right to the lowest personal attack. He didn’t call Matt Lee racist, he’s probably saving that for next week, but he did suggest Matt Lee is more sympathetic to Russia than he is to his own country, the United States. He implied Matt Lee is a shill for Vladimir Putin. : If you doubt the credibility of the U.S. government, the British government, of other governments and want to find solace and information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do. : I'm asking what the Russian government is putting out, and what is that supposed to mean? 'S - At an earlier age, this is the point where Matt Lee would’ve gone to the podium and punched him right in the face. There was a time in this country when calling a man disloyal was a grave and serious charge. You could not let that stand. That’s not true anymore, we’re so used to it now. We hear it constantly. On Wednesday, two days ago, during a closed-door briefing in Congress on Russia, Jim Cooper of Tennessee, a Democrat, asked an intelligence briefer to find out if this show is tied to Russia. We are not tied to Russia, of course. It’s a cable television program. We are not a diplomatic mission. Jim Cooper knows that. But that is not the point. The point is: We have criticized the Biden administration’s Ukraine policy. So in retaliation for that, Jim Cooper has asked the intel agencies to dig up dirt on us. To be clear, that is not allowed. It is illegal to use the U.S. Government to settle partisan scores or to silence opposition journalists. It is also, by the way, illegal to secretly monitor their electronic communications. But Joe Biden’s did that to this show this summer. That happened. We are not speculating about it. The admitted it. And congressman Cooper admitted what he did today when we asked him, though he was too cowardly to come on tonight to explain how he could justify that. This is scary behavior. It is also revealing. . After a full year of governing, all the Biden Administration could muster when challenged are ad hominem attacks and more spying from the intel agents. Let’s put the intel agencies on. What they can’t do is explain themselves. They don’t even try. That is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of rot, it’s a sign of weakness. And yet they are doing it and getting away with it. How are they getting away with it? Very simple, they are getting away with it because Republicans are allowing them to get away with it. Screaming about Russia, even as we ignore China, is now a bipartisan effort. You remember Russia-gate. You thought Republicans would never fall for that again? No, they internalize the whole thing. They now believe Russia is our greatest enemy. They are the existential threat. All eyes on Putin. They could stop this tomorrow. If Mitch McConnell criticized the build-up to the war with Putin, it would end immediately. If five Republicans held a press conference tomorrow to declare that the territorial integrity of the United States is more important than the territorial integrity of Ukraine, this couldn’t continue. The lunacy would end. But they are not doing that. Instead, Republicans are every bit as hysterical about Russia as Adam Schiff ever was. Russian President Vladimir Putin. . : We need to impose sanctions on Russia now. We need to show them that we mean business and we will be there for Ukraine. : Do you think President Biden should send U.S. troops to Eastern Europe? . : Without delay. : It appears the administration is moving in the right direction. : There needs to be clear consequences for what they do. We failed to deter, and now you are inviting conflict. It is a very bad situation and we left ourselves without many options as a result. . : We are not providing the deterrence necessary to stop Putin from invading Ukraine. . : As Putin looks to dismantle , and divide , I support President Biden’s decision to send more groups to reinforce . , Lindsey Graham just admits I’m on Biden’s inside, but most of them are too clever to do that. They are doing something you may not notice at first. They are attacking Joe Biden for being weak. His weaknesses is inviting aggression. And on the basis of that, they are in fact agreeing with Biden and supporting his Russia policy. Got that? We are against Biden. That is why we are backing him up and his Russian policy. Pretty clever. Is that what Republican voters want? Let’s see. If you ask them, they probably say why don’t we send as much military equipment to the Texas border as we did to the Russian border? If someone says it out loud, that may be the entire country could assess how grotesque Washington’s priorities are. Speaking of grotesque priorities, Senator John Cornyn represents Texas. Texas is a state that’s had well over 1 million foreign nationals pour into it illegally over the last year. Right over the border. That is a far bigger invasion than anything Vladimir Putin is planning in Ukraine. And yet when John Cornyn talks about border security, he’s not talking about his own state or even his own country. He’s talking about Ukrainian border security. : Make no mistake, an attack on Ukraine is also an attack on America’s global security interests and on world peace. And could have cascading consequences that right now are too horrible to contemplate. This is an existential threat to our leadership in the world. And to the global order we underwrite. And to our way of life and the way of life for freedom loving democracies around the world. These are people who sit in committee meetings often with closed doors. What are they doing? Well they are apparently sicking the intel agencies on anyone who criticizes them. But are they getting unfiltered information from those intel agencies? Are they making wise decisions on the basis of it? Do have any idea what they are talking about? No, of course not. They cloak their ignorance in the usual cliches. Freedom-loging democracies like Ukraine. But the truth is, their interests, their beliefs are so far out of alignment with the interests and beliefs of the average person in this country, including their own voters, that once that is exposed to light, they are in trouble. Last point, this is only happening because there is no credible opposition to it in the Congress.",0

Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., on Tuesday introduced legislation that would block security and military assistance to Ukraine until the U.S. southern border is secured -- the latest example of Republican concern that Ukraine’s border security is being prioritized over American border security. The Secure America’s Border First Act would prohibit the expenditure or obligation of military and security assistance to Kyiv until there is ""operation control"" of the U.S.-Mexico border – where the border crisis is moving into its second year. ' ‘ ,' There is growing concern in Washington D.C. about the Russian buildup of forces at the Ukrainian border. U.S. combat forces have arrived in Poland this week amid fears that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could see Kyiv fall within days. But Rosendale’s bill seeks to bring attention back to the southern border, where there were 178,840 migrant apprehensions in December alone, capping a year that saw massive migrant numbers as well as drugs such as fentanyl pouring into the U.S. 2.8 Secure Americas Borders First Act by Fox News on Scribd ""I think it's quite hypocritical if someone in the U.S. Congress is willing to expend funds to secure a border overseas thousands of miles away while they're not willing to secure our own border,"" Rosendale told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""And we are witnessing not a threat, but we are witnessing an absolute invasion that is taking place right now."" He said that the U.S. ""has no legal or moral authority to come to Ukraine's aid."" Jan 4, 2021: Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., is seen during a group photo with freshmen members of the House Republican Conference on the House steps of the Capitol. ""And we have war hawks on both sides of the aisle willing to go over there and spend American blood and treasure in Ukraine and what I'm saying is we’re not obligated and so at least the minimum we can do is secure our own border first if you are going to go over there and spend money."" Rosendale’s bill would hold funds back until the border wall system, which was halted by the Biden administration, is completed, and ""operational control"" as defined by the 2006 Secure Fence Act is achieved. The wall system is defined as a 30-foot-high steel bollard barrier, with all-weather access and patrol roads, perimeter lighting, cameras and detection tech. ""We witnessed an invasion over the last year of two million individuals trying to get into the country, we’re not even sure how many of them have been successful, so lets build the border wall system, let's gain operational control of our southern border, and then we might be able to have a conversation about what we’re going to do overseas about securing someone else’s border,"" Rosendale said. Rosendale’s bill is the latest Republican contrast between the focus on Ukraine and the situation at the southern border, although assistance for Ukraine does retain broad bipartisan support. 72 : Rep. Madison Cawthorne, R-N.C., said in December that ""until we get our own southern border secured, I don't give a damn about the border conflict in Ukraine,."" This month, Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., used the comparison to make the case for sanctions on Russia instead. ""Biden is unwilling to defend our southern border, yet he's willing to send troops overseas to protect another nation's border,"" Hagerty tweeted. ""We need to demonstrate our resolve & take action, & that sort of action needs to be in the form of sanctions—sanctions now."" Cosponsors on the bill include Reps. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., Bob Good, R-Va., Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., Jody Hice, R-Ga., Mary Miller, R-Ill., Ralph Norman, R-S.C., and Bill Posey, R-Fla. Rosendale said the prioritizing of the southern border reflects what he believes are the priorities of his constituents, who are concerned about things like the flood of fentanyl coming into Montana and other states. He also rejected the idea that Washington could both secure the border and protect Ukraine. ""They’ve spent several years trying to secure that southern border and haven't been able to accomplish that prior to having any discussions about Ukraine so I find it hard to believe now that they're going to do both,"" he said.

2022-02-08,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-ukraine-invasion-us-troops-tucker-carlson,Tucker Carlson: What happens to our troops in Ukraine if Russia invades?,"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host slams the Biden administration for not being honest with the public over the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Joe Biden, you may recall, spent a lot of his time as vice president meddling in the internal affairs of Ukraine. And you may wonder, why Ukraine as opposed to say, Denmark or Senegal or any of the world's other 195 countries. Simple. Because the Ukrainians were paying Joe Biden's family a million dollars a year in exchange for the work that he did. And as president, you may have noticed, Biden has continued to represent Ukrainian interests. Most recently in their dispute with Russia. Biden talks constantly about all the scary things he'll do if embattled Vladimir Putin dares to offend the territorial sovereignty of Biden's close friends, the Ukrainians. But one thing Joe Biden will not do, he has assured us repeatedly, is send American troops to Ukraine. Polls show Americans do not want that at all and Biden claims he's heard the message. 2 : This would be the largest, if he were to move in, with all those forces would be the largest invasion since World War . It would change the world. : What about military consequences? : There's not going to be any American forces moving into Ukraine. There are not going to be any American forces moving into Ukraine. That's what Joe Biden told us, and it's reassuring to hear that. But wait. It's not true. It's yet another lie from the mannequin, in case you're still bothering to keep track of them all. Fox News has just learned that there are already more than 300 American troops in Ukraine. Now, Joe Biden is calling them ""military advisers,"" just like we did back in Vietnam. Troops, advisers, it's really a distinction without a difference. Just last week, we were told there are only 150 American troops in Ukraine. As far as we know, the force has more than doubled in recent days, and that's assuming the new number is even real. And by the way, why would we assume that number is real? These people lie about everything. The truth is, we have no idea how many American troops are in Ukraine right now; only that the total is a lot more than they said it was because again, they lie all the time.",0
2022-02-09,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/desantis-interview-biden-weakness-china-big-tech-genocide-olympics,"DeSantis slams Big Tech and media for 'whitewashing' the 'genocide Olympics,' says Biden is weak on China",", Fla. – : Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., dove into numerous foreign policy matters involving the U.S., from heightening tensions between Russia and Ukraine, which has the Florida National Guard caught in the middle, to Big Tech and the Biden administration's handling of China and the controversial Beijing Olympics. During an interview with Fox News Digital in Tallahassee, Florida, on Monday, the governor said that it is a ""mistake"" that American athletes are competing in the 2020 Winter Olympic Games, underway in Beijing, China. The Biden administration and its international allies are enacting a diplomatic boycott of the games over the genocide of Uyghur Muslims by the Chinese Communist Party . But DeSantis said it does not go far enough to stand up to America's ""number-one geopolitical foe."" ' ': 'S 'A ' ""I've said previously that I would boycott [the Beijing Olympics]. I mean, I think it's a mistake. I mean, China is our number-one geopolitical foe. If you look at what they're doing, they're amassing huge amounts of power. And it's not just that they're building up their military, they are, they command huge influence within the United States,"" DeSantis told Fox News Digital. Ron DeSantis sat down with Fox News Digital in Tallahassee. DeSantis noted the role of , the news outlet carrying the games in the U.S., saying it is ""whitewashing"" what he calls the ""genocide Olympics."" 's broadcast of the opening ceremonies last week saw a historic low and was down 43% from previous Games. ""This is a genocide Olympics. And the thing is you see these, the broadcast on , where they're whitewashing this stuff. You look at these corporate sponsors that are signing up on that. You know, they will blow, these corporations in America, and they'll blow a gasket, you know, for these small issues in the United States. But yet they're willing to underwrite games of the country that's committing genocide. I think it's a disgrace what's going on."" Corporate sponsors of the Games, including Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, have been silent on the ongoing genocide of the Uyghurs in China but extremely vocal about their opposition to Republican states' election laws and other human rights issues in the U.S. In addition to China, the U.S. is facing aggression from Russia. Tensions between Russia and America's partner Ukraine have increased to the point of near-war, and the Department of Defense confirmed last week it is moving approximately 3,000 troops to Germany, Poland and Romania. Florida is uniquely positioned in this crisis due to the fact that there are about 150 Florida National Guard inside of Western Ukraine on a previously scheduled training rotation. DeSantis slammed President Biden for keeping Floridians stationed in the middle of the Ukraine crisis on a federal deployment. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at the opening of a monoclonal antibody site, Aug. 18, 2021, in Pembroke Pines, Florida. ""That would have been Joe Biden’s doing, not ours. You know my view is I don’t want to see American troops in Ukraine. I think that we have a lot of problems here in the United States. We’ve given Ukraine a lot of support over the years under the Trump administration we provided huge amounts of lethal aid, and so I think that they’ve been equipped to defend themselves, but to put American troops in the midst of that is not something that I want to see, particularly with Floridians."" The governor recently announced that he will be re-establishing the Florida State Guard, for which he has garnered pushback from state Democrats who are calling him a ""wannabe dictator."" DeSantis responded that the reason he is planning to reinstate the State Guard is because Florida doesn't have enough National Guardsmen, and the new guard would be free from the ""whims of the federal government."" ""And so this will give us more people to be able to do things like respond if there's disorder, like respond to disasters and all those other things. It also gives us the ability to have people who are not subject to federal requirements. So, for example, [the federal government] wouldn't be able to mobilize and deploy people who are in the State Guard,"" DeSantis told Fox News Digital. ""They also wouldn't be able to impose mandates on people in the State Guard. They are trying to do that with the federal guard. And so I think it will help us complete our mission and will also allow us to do in a way which is not subject to the whims of the federal government."" , , : ' . ' DeSantis also dove into criticism of America's Big Tech companies, who he says ""bend the knee"" to the , along with Biden, who he says has worked to ""empower Beijing."" ""A lot of these corporations, the Apples of the world, the Facebooks, they will not buck the Communist Party of China. I mean, they will bend the knee. Hollywood bends the knee to these people. Our financial institutions bend the knee. So they have an inordinate amount of influence over our domestic situation, which is much different than, say, the Soviet Union back during the Cold War. So they are a very formidable adversary. They do not have our best interests at heart."" DeSantis praised former President Trump for being the first leader to call out the tight ties between American businesses and China. ""And I think President Trump was really the first one to really call that out. A lot of administrations have really helped to elevate and empower Beijing, including Biden. And I think the best policy for America is to understand that they're an adversary, and we should want to weaken their grip over our economy and over our political system."" The Florida governor went further in his criticism of Big Tech, saying that these companies are controlling so much political speech in the U.S. that they are trying to ""impose an orthodoxy."" He pointed specifically to the censorship of online speech on , as many online platforms have censored or blocked speech that is not in line with statements put out by White House chief medical adviser Dr. Antony Fauci. ""I think at the end of the day, you can't have a situation in which a handful of companies control so much of the political speech in this country, and they are censoring, and they are and trying to impose an orthodoxy,"" said DeSantis. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci. ""If you put something out on that Fauci disagrees with, they will censor you, even though Fauci has been wrong on a lot. If you dissent from the , they will censor you well. When you're acting as an arm of the government, then the First Amendment does apply."" The governor also mentioned the ongoing controversy with GoFundMe, an online fundraising platform that came under fire recently for attempting to divert funds intended for Canadian truckers protesting the government’s vaccine mandate. DeSantis has pledged to investigate the matter further. ""But I think Big Tech, I mean, it's almost like they're cutting off the nose to spite their face. They're so ideological, they're in this bubble, and they take these actions that alienate so many of their potential customers that they're going to end up, I think, really hurting what they're trying to accomplish.""",0

Tulsi Gabbard why no one has been able to explain why Americans should want Ukraine to join on ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight.’ : I've looked at this carefully, Tucker, and I have yet to find any benefit that a political leader has used or could use to justify this to the American people. All you hear is like, 'well we have to defend democracy. We have to defend this democratic country of Ukraine.' But as you know, very well, this current [Ukranian] president, you know, shuts down, arrests political opposition, throws them in jail, shuts down stations that are critical to him. I have a hard time seeing how President Biden or anyone can say with an honest face, ‘we are defending democracy.’ And the reason is because our own government has publicly supported these authoritarian actions by the Ukrainian president in shutting down their own political opposition, and it begs the question. This sounds familiar to some of the things that unfortunately, we're seeing play out right here at home.",0

""First of all, it’s shocking because it should have never happened, it would not have happened"" Trump said on ""Fox & Friends."" -: : Trump was reacting to the growing tensions on the Ukraine-Russia border amid fears of an imminent Russian invasion. Earlier Saturday the State Department ordered non-emergency personnel at the Embassy in Kyiv to evacuate, hours after White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan urged Americans to get out of the country. ""As we’ve said before, we are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time, should Vladimir Putin decide to order it,"" Sullivan said at a White House news briefing. A diplomatic car drives out of the territory of the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine Feb. 12, 2022.

""How we got here is when they watched Afghanistan, and they watched the most incompetent withdrawal in the history of probably any army let alone just us, and President Xi [Jinping] and President Putin – watch what happens with China very soon with Taiwan – and they watched that, and they said: ‘What’s going on? They don't know what they're doing.’ And all of a sudden I think they got a lot more ambitious."" ""I think Putin really wanted to negotiate for a period of time, but when he watched Afghanistan when he watched that unbelievably bad withdrawal, incompetent, where they took the Military out first, where they left $85 billion worth of equipment behind for the Taliban to have and to use and of course the deaths that happened – when they watched all of that I think they got emboldened.""

The monster truck wasn't a tank or armored personnel carrier, however, but an amphibious vehicle called the Sherp that's built in Ukraine. The Sherp is built in Ukraine.

The 4x4 is technically an , not a street legal truck, and has a top speed of just 18.6 mph on land and 3.7 mph on water. The Sherp rides on 5-foot-tall tires. The Sherp is designed for commercial, rescue and recreational use in extreme environments, especially soggy ones, and plenty capable, despite being powered by a 55 hp diesel engine. The Sherp is amphibious and can travel at speeds up to 6 mph on water.

2022-02-14,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-ukraine-troop-buildup-intentions-reporters-notebook,Reporter's Notebook: Russia's intentions emerge with Ukraine troop buildup,"Dmitry Suslov, deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at University, says Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to ""create tension"" by positioning troops at the Ukrainian border. Many in the West have opined that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely must be doing ""something"" of significance. After all, he didn't mass all those troops on Ukraine's borders for a little exercise. Or even a big exercise. But according to Russian foreign policy insider Dmitry Suslov, Russia's moves are going according to plan. ""The whole reason behind the concentration of troops by Russia at the Ukrainian border is to create tension, to accompany the Russian political demands with the demonstration of military force, which has already brought some significant positive results to Russia,"" Suslov, who is deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at University, told Fox News. ""From the Russian perspective, and this is the predominant opinion really widespread in Moscow, without the concentration of the Russian troops, without belligerent rhetoric, without speculation about the ‘military-technical’ response by Russia, Russian security guarantee demands would have gone directly to the dustbins everywhere in the West."" Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Feb. 1. Suslov explained that Russia considered escalation a ""tool of diplomacy,"" so Ukraine shouldn't count on seeing the back of its tanks until Moscow's demands are met. Those demands, well-known to many by now, are a pledge that Ukraine will not join and that an East European buffer zone of some sort between the alliance and Russia is configured. Also key: that Donbas, comprising those eastern Ukrainian regions now controlled by Russian-backed separatists, is given a significant degree of autonomy as spelled out by the as-yet unfulfilled Minsk agreements. ""The implementation of the Minsk agreements would both deliver the kind of Ukraine which Russia wants: a decentralized Ukraine, a Ukraine which, by definition, cannot be consolidated on an anti-Russian basis, or on the basis of Ukrainian ethnic nationalism, as it is today with Ukrainian language, Ukrainian nationalist ideology and so on and so forth, being the basis of their national identity."" Suslov continued, adding that Russia didn't want Ukraine to be ""a Western fortress at the edge of the Russian border."" A Ukrainian marine border guard after a patrol in the Sea of Azov, waters near Mariupol, Donetsk region, in eastern Ukraine, on Feb. 2. But, to Ukrainians aspiring to a future hitched to Europe, Russia's wants haven't been their concern. They've worried about losing more territory to Russia after what happened to Crimea in 2014. The West has stood by their rights to choose the security alliances or arrangements they wanted, and their self-determination. ‘ ’ Suslov claimed a full invasion of Ukraine would not serve Russia's interests. Instead, he said it would ""result in enormous costs – economic, social, political, foreign policy, military. It will not be kind of a parade. It will be a very difficult military operation, followed by a guerrilla war, because there will be insurgency from different places in Ukraine and so on and so forth. And I don't think that anyone in the world would among the great powers, including China, would explicitly support Russia in such an endeavor."" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby says 'good sources' and intel point to a Russian invasion 'in plain sight.' Suslov added, ""Russia, I think, will continue to look as if it is preparing for invasion unless the Russian demands are addressed."" I asked Suslov if the crippling energy costs hurting Europe were part of this pressure campaign. He said no; he saw Europe's problems as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the slower-than-expected transition to green energy on the continent. But, he added, Russia certainly was not running to the rescue by voluntarily opening the taps. ""It is weird for the European Union to be surprised with this Russian refusal because Russia would have certainly increased its volumes of supplies to the European Union if we were friends, if the relations were based on partnership. But come on, we perceive each other as adversaries. So, you expect a friendly behavior from the party, which the European Union has made its adversary against, which the European Union has adopted sanctions and continues to promise new and new sanctions?

If I do these various things, Russia is still in many ways, you know, it's a weaker nation. It is the one dependent on gas prices that the line goes over and over again, that Putin is playing a weak hand or playing it very well. But why is he doing that? It's because he's confident that China has his back and that they're going to be the dominant force in the world today and to come and not the United States, that we are headed toward a period of diminishment and retrenchment and that he doesn't have any respect for the kind of things that the Biden administration is doing.

You may have asked yourself: When will Joe Biden ever stop talking about Russia? Well, very soon, actually. In fact, he seems to be losing his train of thought right now. But don't worry, he'll be back to it. Russia is a very comfortable topic for Joe Biden. He enjoys talking about it much more than talking about, say, inflation, or crime, or fentanyl deaths or about how half the population of Haiti appears to be showing up in Florida in leaky boats. Those subjects may interest you since you live in this country, but not Joe Biden, despite appearances, Biden doesn't actually live here. In his head, Joe Biden is floating high above the Sea of Azoff, swooping in over south-eastern Ukraine like a Botox superhero just to make sure everything's with his little buddies, the Ukrainians. Joe Biden is a protector that way. : 'S But he's also, at the same time, a scholar and a teacher, not a credentialed educator like the doctor he's married to. Joe Biden didn't go to community college in Delaware for a doctorate in diversity studies. He's just a civilian. But Biden can still lecture with the best of them. If you signed up for his ""Intro to Russia is Bad"" class this semester, you will not be disappointed. Professor Biden knows that material cold. So what have we learned so far? Well, first and foremost, Russia is bad. That's the name of the course. It's the entire syllabus, actually. It may be the only fact you will come away with after months of heavy coursework. Russia is bad. Learn that and you will ace the exam. U.S. President Joe Biden arrives to speak on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law at the Shipyards in Lorain, Ohio. President Biden removes his protective face mask before speaking during a meeting with the Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in the Oval Office of the White House. President Biden speaks at an event to discuss gun violence strategies, at police headquarters, Thursday, Feb. 3, 2022, in New York. Now, to be clear, we're talking about Russia here. We're not talking about the Soviet Union. There's a difference, and Joe Biden's been around long enough to know what that difference is. He's seen it firsthand. The Soviets wanted peace. Joe Biden told us that repeatedly in the 70s and 80s. Russia, by contrast, just wants war. The Russians are warlike people. It's inherent. Russians are driven by bloodlust. They have tiny brains. Their breath smells like herring. They're always drunk, often on aftershave or household cleaning products. On Sunday mornings, when good people are still asleep at home with their families, your average Russian will still be lurking through the dark streets, leering through bloodshot eyes, trying to subvert somebody else's democracy or conquer a peace-loving neighbor. That's just who Russians are. It's what they do. But if there's one thing you absolutely must know about Russia, if you're going to navigate this world, that thing is that on February 16th, 2022, Vladimir Putin is going to invade our closest ally in the world, Ukraine. So write that down February 16, 2022. Ukraine invasion begins. That's the day. ‘ ’ , Joe Biden has been very clear about that. So the intel agencies and of course, their stenographers in the news media. As Politico put it, ""Russia will start a physical assault on Ukraine as soon as February 16, multiple U.S. officials confirmed"" A physical assault. But this won't be your typical physical assault like the kind you've experienced in the New York City subway. No. According to Politico, this physical assault ""could be preceded by a barrage of missile strikes and cyber-attacks."" So these aren't just gang members, they're Russians. The Daily Mail confirmed Politico's reporting. ""Putin has decided to invade Ukraine on Wednesday,"" read the headline. ""Brits and Americans told to get out now."" That same day, The Mirror in London, let us know they had seen Vladimir Putin's planning documents and operation snuff out Ukrainian democracy was already in motion. ""Russian invasion of Ukraine set for 3:00 a.m. tomorrow with missiles and tank attack."" So February 16, 2022 was definitely the day the music was going to die in Ukraine. Everybody knew that. But weirdly, nobody thought to tell the president of Ukraine, who, as an obedient puppet of the Biden State Department, you might think would have heard the news. But no, he hadn't. He was baffled by it. He said this, ""We are told that February 16th will be the day of the attack. We will make it a day of unity. The relevant decree has already been signed. On this day, we will hang national flags, wear blue and yellow ribbons and show the world our unity."" That was President Zelinsky. 'S ‘ ’ ‘’: . Now, keep in mind that in addition to being a puppet of the Biden administration, President Zelensky of Ukraine was also at one point a low-grade comic of some kind. So he was kidding. That was a joke. But in the American news media, there are no jokes. Humor has been banned for several years now. In fact, at this point, we're likely to hear a joke on a Russian news broadcast that on American television, which is pretty amazing. If you think about it, things have changed. Now, the readers of a teleprompter on our channels did not get this joke at all. So here's the coverage they produced: : This is breaking news : We’re back with more on the breaking news just out of Ukraine. President Zelensky saying Ukraine has been informed that this Wednesday, the 16, will be the day of the attack. : Ukraine’s President Zelensky, addressing his nation today about reports intelligence picked up that actual date for an attack of Wednesday… : Telling them that he is told that Feb 16 will be the day of the attack. : President Zelensky saying that his government has been told that Feb 16 will be the day of a possible attack. : Today, defiant Ukrainians celebrated a day of unity. There had been reports and intelligence warnings that today Feb 16, might be the day of the invasion. Of course that’s up to Vladimir Putin. Will Ukraine be ready? Well, if that was up to Vladimir Putin. They didn't get it was a joke. So it put us in a very weird position where suddenly we were being lectured on humor by eastern Europeans. Think about that for a minute. Zelensky’s staff issued a statement explaining that actually, he was kidding. So some news outlets had to update the reporting, but they were clearly annoyed with Zelensky. ""Ukrainian leader makes a confusing joke about Russian invasion,"" harrumphed New York Magazine. In this photo taken from video provided by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Wednesday, Feb. 16, 2022, Russian army tanks are loaded onto railway platforms to move back to their permanent base after drills in Russia. ) Ukrainian soldiers examine their tanks at a military unit close to Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Monday. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a wreath laying commemoration ceremony at the Piskaryovskoye Cemetery where most of the Leningrad Siege victims were buried during World War , in St. Petersburg, Russia. ) A participant of an open civil defence exercise aims at a target, Uzhhorod, western Ukraine. ) But here's the funniest part of all: There was no invasion Feb. 16, 2022 was yesterday. Nothing happened. Vladimir Putin did not invade Ukraine. Now, if Joe Biden noticed the lack of an invasion, he didn't acknowledge that. He didn't say a word. Today, he was back on television, assuring us once again, the invasion is coming. : How high is the threat of a Russian invasion right now? : It's very high. : Why? : It's very high because they have not moved any of their troops out. They've moved more troops in, number one. Number two, we have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in. Every indication we have that they're prepared to go is to Ukraine, attack Ukraine. : Are you going to call Putin? : I am not calling Putin, I have no plans to call Putin. So here's a guy who's literally wearing a mask outside, assuring us that he's sane and on the ball enough to know when Putin is going to invade Ukraine. But of course, he's gotten it wrong. - - What's going on here? Well, the most obvious explanation is the most obvious one. Doddering old Joe Biden, who even before he was senile, was widely considered a moron in Washington, has been played by Vladimir Putin, who may be evil but definitely is not stupid. If Putin bluffed an invasion of Ukraine to make Biden look ridiculous, it worked. Maybe there was something else going on. Maybe Putin still plans to invade Ukraine. It's hard to know, but as you just heard, Joe Biden doesn't know because he refuses to talk to the Russians. The Russians are too immoral for Joe Biden. That's saying a lot coming from a former credit card lobbyist who helped run America's most corrupt state. But according to Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin is not someone you can ever talk to because he put bounties on the lives of American troops in Afghanistan. How does Joe Biden know that happened? Well, he got it from the very same people who spent all last month telling us that Putin was going to invade Ukraine on February 16. Here they are: , 2020: A new report says that Russia offered Afgahn militants bounties to kill U.S. soldiers and the administration’s non-reaction … , 2020: A matching the reporting, cited a source asserting that the cash rewards did lead to coalition casualties. , 2021: Not so long ago, in a land not so far away, there was a Republican party that would have confronted Russia for putting bounties on the heads of U.S. soldiers. , 2020: : To say nothing of putting bounties on American troops. : It’s unbelievable, Joy I mean, he is still yet to say anything, as the president of the United States, about bounties on American troops. So the most discredited people in the world, weighing in with total certainty on the most important topics. If you were to sum up the moment we're living in, that's how you describe it. Everything that is told you turned out to be untrue. They were lying. Why were they lying about that? Well, of course, to keep us in Afghanistan forever. Why would they want to do that, you ask? We weren't achieving anything. Obviously. The second we left, the Taliban took over and became one of the best-armed militaries in the entire region. So what we were doing wasn't working, but they didn't want us to leave. In fact, they were willing to lie to keep us there. Why? Well, we don't have any special intel, but we're thinking maybe the defense industry profligate campaign donors may have had something to do with it. Here's Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut explaining that actually, Ukraine needs a lot more lethal weapons from Raytheon: : I was so deeply impressed with how resolute and determined people of Ukraine are, they are courageous, they are steadfast and they’re going to fight in the streets, their neighborhoods, the fields, if we give them the arms that they need. And that’s why I’ve also urged the javelin missiles and the stinger missiles in combat, their tanks and their aircraft So that guy who lied about his own war service is pretty excited at the thought of Ukrainians fighting and dying in the streets. These people are so ghoulish. -: ‘’ And of course, they're promoting war, not to maintain the democracy that is Ukraine. Ukraine is not a democracy. It has never been a democracy in its history and it's not now. It's a client state of the Biden administration. It's a place in which opposition media and opposition political candidates are completely shut down by the government. Is not a democracy at all. And it's insulting they would suggest otherwise. But people like that and many people in Washington are pushing Ukraine toward war. So we're sending them weapons and then making it very easy for them to use them. They told us now for months that any preemptive attack by Ukraine actually isn't real. If you see Ukraine using these weapons, ‘no,’ says Tony Blinken. That's not aggression. It's a false flag attack by Russia. : Russia plans to manufacture a pretext for its attack. This could be a violent event that Russia will blame on Ukraine, or an outrageous accusation that Russia will level against the Ukrainian government. We don't know exactly the form it will take. It could be a fabricated so-called terrorist bombing inside Russia. The inventive discovery of a mass grave, a staged drone strike against civilians or a fake, even a real attack using chemical weapons. So if they're going to use chemical weapons, but it won't actually be them, it'll be those diabolical Russians drunk on aftershave. Once again, there's zero evidence that any of this is true. This is clearly some sort of intel operation that's being filtered through the State Department and the media. But yet, for months now, they told us Russia is definitely to manufacture a pretext for a Ukraine invasion. So finally, a lone reporter bravely asked ""How do you know this?"" And they immediately accused him of working for Putin. He's pretty much the only reporter who asked a question like that, and there's a depressing irony to that. Matt Taibbi put it very nicely this morning in a piece on Substack. ""A big reason we're supposed to be an improvement over Putin's Russia,"" Taibbi wrote, ""is that we don't use the news media as an instrument of information warfare. At least Russian reporters don't have much choice in being conscripted for this duty. What's the excuse of Westerners who broadcast gibberish on command?"" Well, that's a very good question, and the answer is they have no excuse.",0

Vice President Kamala Harris is in Germany this weekend to attend the Munich Security Conference – her fifth foreign trip as vice president – amid escalating warnings of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, which Biden administration officials have said is possible in the ""next several days."" Administration officials previewing Harris’ trip said the conference comes at a ""very decisive moment,"" saying the vice president’s leadership will serve as a ""resounding signal that engagement with our allies and partners is an absolutely critical part of our overall diplomacy and our approach"" to the situation between Ukraine and Russia. : ' ' Harris delivered remarks Friday ahead of a bilateral meeting with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, stressing the United States’ ""enduring"" commitment to . ""I am here to ensure that through our discussions and the discussions I will have with other of our allies that we continue, as these hours and days progress, to stay in close contact,"" Harris said. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a meeting with Estonia Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, Latvian President Egils Levits and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda during the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Friday, Feb. 18, 2022. ""We understand this is a dynamic moment in time,"" Harris said. ""And so, the work that we are doing on a daily basis and sometimes on an hourly basis — to strengthen the relationship; to check in, in terms of our strategic imperative — is critically important. And that is one of the reasons that I am here."" Harris stressed that the United States remains ""open to and desirous of diplomacy as it relates to the dialogue and discussions we have had with Russia."" ""But we are also committed if Russia takes aggressive action to ensuring there will be severe consequences in terms of the economic sanctions we have discussed,"" Harris said. Harris added that she knows is ""strong in that regard,"" and thanked Stoltenberg for his partnership in that effort. Vice President Kamala Harris meets with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, left, during the Munich Security Conference, Friday, Feb. 18, 2022, in Munich. Harris’ comments come just a day after President Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States had reason to believe Russia is ""engaged in a false flag operation,"" and warned that an invasion ""will happen in the next several days."" Senior administration officials said Harris, throughout her time at the conference, will discuss the ""unity"" the United States has achieved with European allies, which they say they are ""determined to maintain."" She will also discuss the economic measures the Biden administration has prepared and ""may need to deploy depending on how things play out."" The vice president is set to deliver a formal speech on Saturday, where, officials said, she will address the threat of Russian aggression and the latest state of play and underscore how unity between Western allies is a ""source of strength that will allow us to respond swiftly and severely to any further Russian aggression."" During her trip, Harris will also meet with Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelenskyy, which officials said will be ""a real opportunity to underscore our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and to further coordinate the diplomatic efforts that have been underway to provide economic and defensive security assistance for Ukraine."" From left, Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, Latvian President Egils Levits, Vice President Kamala Harris and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, pose for photographs during the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Friday, Feb. 18, 2022. Harris is also expected to meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who visited President Biden at the White House earlier this month. Officials said Harris will convey this weekend that the Biden administration is ""prepared for every contingency."" ' ' , Some, though, have been critical of the Biden administration’s decision to send Harris to the conference during such a pivotal time on the world stage, citing her limited foreign policy experience and her portfolio thus far. Harris had been tasked by the president with handling efforts to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration to the U.S. southern border, as well as the administration’s push to get a voting rights bill approved through Congress. Former Bush administration official and Fox News contributor Karl Rove said before Harris’ trip it might be ""a successful conference and a successful message"" that the Biden administration will convey, but he said the success would not be due to Harris’ presence. ""The Munich Security Conference will be attended by a large number of U.S. government officials, including leading members of the Senate and House,"" Rove said this week. ""And my sense is that both Republicans and Democrats alike are going to be going to our allies saying, 'We're all in this together, we need to stay strong, and we need to provide a united front against Putin and make certain that he understands there are huge consequences for him. ""He's got a fragile economy, a difficult political position back at home, and we in the United States and our European allies stand ready to sanction him and sanction him hard and to support the Ukrainians in their efforts to maintain their independence. ""And if so, then it might be a successful conference and a successful message,"" Rove added. ""But it's not going to be because of the presence of Kamala Harris. It’s going to be because of the presence of a large number of U.S. government officials and particularly members of Congress showing a united front."" ""Putin is a bully who responds to strength,"" former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Halley told Fox News. ""Sending Harris to Europe for meetings and speeches will only amuse him. President Biden needs to act now and hit him with sanctions."" And former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called it ""deeply troubling that Joe Biden is delegating our nation's foreign policy to the vice president,"" in a statement to Fox News. ""Kamala Harris can't even find our own southern border, let alone address the national security threat that is flowing across it,"" Pompeo said. ""How can anyone in the world, especially Russia, take her seriously? Russian aggression of Ukraine's borders and sovereignty demands better than this amateur approach."" James Anderson, president of the Institute of World Politics and former deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, told Fox News that Harris ""will attempt to convey a message of unity and resolve among the allies, which is always important in an international crisis."" ""The fact that she will be delivering this message as the senior U.S. official in Munich is unlikely to carry any extra weight, however,"" Anderson told Fox News. ""She is relatively unknown among allied leaders and diplomats who will gather in Munich."" Anderson said, however, that the Biden administration's ""foreign policy record, to include its disastrous mishandling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, undermines its credibility to convey resolve at the very moment that it is needed the most."" Harris previously traveled to Guatemala, Mexico, Singapore, Vietnam, France and, most recently, Honduras. The Associated Press contributed tot his report.",9

Brett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a foreign service officer in the State Department, penned an opinion piece in about effectively turning the tables on Putin. ‘ ’ ""When is the crisis in Ukraine going to end? According to the White House, it's largely up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. I fail to understand why we are letting him decide the timeline, let alone the terms and trajectory of the security situation in Europe,"" Bruen began the piece on Thursday. ""The United States and our allies need to start imposing some of our own deadlines. Congress is currently considering a series of preemptive punishments against Russia.

Bruen proposed giving Russia a March 1 deadline to roll back its troops and negotiate the Minsk agreement leading up to it and draw a ""big red line"" when it comes to meddling in the upcoming midterm elections. ""Sanctions and some other serious steps would be triggered if any of these timelines or terms are violated,"" Bruen wrote.

We will begin by dropping a new batch of intelligence about the Kremlin's corruption and mismanagement each month.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joined 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the latest on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the latest in the Durham probe, and Biden's commitment to nominating a woman of color for the Supreme Court. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said President Biden's ""fecklessness"" is to blame for why Europe is on the ""verge of war."" ""Tragically, Europe is on the verge of war because of the weakness, the fecklessness of Joe Biden,"" Cruz told Fox News’ Bill Hemmer on ""Fox News Sunday.""

""At the time [of the withdrawal from Afghanistan], I said as a result of this incredible weakness, all of our enemies across the globe are looking to Washington. They are taking the measure of the man in the Oval Office. And as a result, as I said back in August, the chances of Russia invading Ukraine have just risen tenfold.

""The reason he's building the pipeline is that it skips Ukraine. It goes right around Ukraine. Why?

Voters tend to vote on domestic issues, the strategists said, and while Biden could receive positive marks if he helps to avert disaster in Ukraine, it's unlikely his party would be able to translate it into electoral gains. ""It would be a good thing for him and a good thing for the country, but it’s not going to flip the fundamentals,"" Fox News contributor Karl Rove explained to Fox News Digital.

Watters noted that if an invasion roils the oil market, the clearest immediate response to help the American people would be to expedite drilling and exploration stateside to fill the sudden gap in supply. That, he said, is just another example of Biden's obvious personal preference: ""So, they waited about two months to trot Harris out in Germany with a mask on to say, 'Yeah, this situation in Ukraine is going to make gas more expensive.

2022-02-22,https://www.foxnews.com/media/flashback-romney-russia-foe-2012,Flashback: Romney calling Russia 'our number one geopolitical foe' prompted media onslaught in 2012,"In media news today, Chris Rufo thanks John Oliver for ‘unintentional favor’ following critical race theory monologue, The Washington Post editorial board voices support for federal no-fly list for passengers who disobey mask mandates, and ’s Beijing Olympics ratings are called a ‘disaster’ for the network. Nearly 10 years ago, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney scolded his future opponent for telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he'd have more ""flexibility"" toward the country after his election. ""This is to Russia, this is, without question, our number one geopolitical foe,"" he told 's Wolf Blitzer on March 26, 2012. ""They fight every cause for the world’s worst actors. The idea that [President Barack Obama] has some more flexibility in mind for Russia is very, very troubling, indeed."" Pressed by Blitzer, Romney then said the ""greatest threat"" America faced was a nuclear-armed Iran. But the perceived damage was done. While the Russia comment was ripped by Democrats and the media as a gaffe underscoring Romney's foreign policy inexperience at the time, it's viewed now as prescient. It's also seen by critics as a stark example of the mainstream press echoing Democratic talking points, particularly in light of subsequent years of fervent Russiagate media coverage and bellicose actions by autocratic Russian leader Vladimir Putin, like this week's invasion of Ukraine. , 'S ‘’T ' ""It looks more like a signature [bias] moment in retrospect, that everyone can recognize Romney was right … just as they now recognize Romney was a much more decent chap than they painted him,"" Tim Graham of the conservative Media Research Center told Fox News Digital. ""But in the ardor of battle, in reelecting Obama, demonizing was king."" Mitt Romney and President Obama are shown campaigning in Virginia Sept. 27, 2012. Obama, then-Vice President Joe Biden, and top officials like Secretary of State John Kerry and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton blasted Romney for the comments at the time, when Romney was heading towards clinching the nomination and facing Obama in the general election. ""You don't call Russia our No. 1 enemy unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp,"" Obama said that year. ""Governor Romney is mired in a Cold War mindset,"" Biden said. Kerry called it ""preposterous,"" while Clinton said it was ""dated to be looking backwards."" The Obama team cut a video with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright saying it showed Romney was unprepared for the job. Albright apologized in 2019. : ‘, , !' Liberal and mainstream outlets piled on as well. The New York Times editorial board said Romney's ""comments display either a shocking lack of knowledge about international affairs or just craven politics."" ""Either way, they are reckless and unworthy of a major presidential contender,"" the Times wrote at the time. It would go on to endorse Obama in the general election; the Times has not endorsed a Republican for president since 1956. In 2017, in the midst of fervent Russiagate coverage in the mainstream media, the same editorial board savaged then-President Donald Trump for not doing enough to counter the ""rival foreign power"" of Russia and its election engineering efforts abroad. ""A throwback to the Cold War,"" 's Andrea Mitchell said of Romney's comments in 2012. ""I mean, we work with Russia all the time."" Former host Chris Matthews criticized Romney and praised Medvedev's comeback that the Republican should ""look at [your] watch: We are in 2012 and not the mid-1970s."" ""Is he trying to play Ronald Reagan here or what?"" he asked his panel on ""Hardball."" ""He's not a dumb man, but he said something that was clearly dumb,"" liberal columnist Cynthia Tucker told Matthews. Vladimir President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Jan. 25, 2022. The Huffington Post's Sam Stein, now with Politico, said it was an ""antiquated worldview."" 'S ‘ A ’ , 'S ""Mitt Romney rather unproductively distracted everyone from focusing on the critique he was making of President Obama,"" Eric Randall wrote in The Atlantic. The Boston Globe said that Romney ""seems intent on screaming ‘fire’ in a crowded theater, even if his audience doesn't seem to be responding. He should choose his words more wisely. Diplomacy, far more than campaigning, requires finesse."" A former Romney campaign staffer said his old boss had been proven ""100% correct."" ""The mainstream media in 2012 were shills for the Obama-Biden campaign and the Democratic Party just like they are today,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Former President Obama's failed leadership and the mainstream media's mockery of Romney's comments and failure to hold the Biden administration accountable are as much to blame for the situation currently unfolding in Ukraine as President Biden's repeated weakness on the world stage."" ""Remember, they were so energetic to ‘get Romney' that they tried to make ‘binders full of women’ an atrocious sexist thing,"" Graham said. Obama was prepared with a zinger at the final presidential debate that year, telling Romney, ""I’m glad that you recognize that al-Qaeda is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaeda. And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War’s been over for 20 years."" As the Washington Post put it, that moment generated ""approving headlines."" Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist and now a contributor, considered it a devastating burn at the time, saying he ""nails Mitt … Bam!"" Shortly after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 and in the midst of what would be years of fervent Russiagate coverage, Begala tweeted, ""Mitt was right."" Romney's remarks have often been revisited in the years since, such as in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea, and throughout Russian collusion coverage and the sprawling Robert Mueller investigation. Romney campaign strategist Stuart Stevens told Fox News' Howard Kurtz in 2014 that the Democratic spin about Romney's remarks ""gets amplified by and unfortunately it drives a narrative for many editors and reporters … It's an effective spin machine."" Stevens, who's become a fierce critic and advises the disgraced Lincoln Project, now claims both the ""left & right"" went after Romney for the line. He frequently appears on . Former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau of the left-wing podcast Pod Save America also felt remorse about criticizing Romney so fervently. -: 2 ""Look, I'm willing to say that in 2012 when we all scoffed at Mitt for saying that, gee, Russia was our No. 1 geopolitical foe, think we were a little off there,"" he said in 2017. 's Chris Cillizza called Obama's quip a ""mic drop"" moment and the best line of the three debates in 2012. Nearly 10 years later, he's eating crow too. ""At the time, the attack worked,"" Cillizza admitted on Tuesday. ""Obama cast himself as the candidate who understood the current threats -- led by al Qaeda. Romney was the candidate still stuck in the Cold War age, a black-and-white figure in a colorful -- and complex -- world."" Cillizza said Romney's comments were ""widely perceived as a major mistake"" at the time. ""What looked like a major flub during the 2012 campaign -- and was used as a political cudgel by Obama -- now looks very, very different,"" he wrote. Demonstrators hold placards during an anti-war protest in front of the Russian embassy in Berlin, Germany, February 22, 2022. To say much has changed politically in the U.S. regarding the stance toward Russia is an understatement. After Romney was defeated, Republicans nominated Donald Trump in 2016, and the storyline of Russian interference to boost him in 2016 and accusations of ""collusion"" with the Kremlin dominated in the media for nearly his entire campaign and presidency. Biden recast himself during his successful bid in 2020 as the only candidate who could properly counter Putin.",9

2022-02-23,https://www.foxnews.com/world/are-russians-on-board-with-putin,Are Russians On Board With Putin?,"Former Director Gen. David Petraeus on tensions being high as the threat of a Russian war looms over Ukraine. A former advisor to the Russian president says he couldn't even listen to Vladimir Putin's address to the nation Monday night. He had to read it after the fact. ""This is the speech of a delusional person who is no longer connected with the surrounding reality,"" Gleb Pavlovsky told Fox News. The National Security Council Meeting that played out before cameras earlier in the day for Pavlovsky was another disappointing spectacle made worse by the simple fact nobody dared challenge Putin on his plans to redraw the map of Europe and to potentially start a full-blown war. ""If you compare the decision of the Politburo with Brezhnev about Afghanistan and the introduction of troops back then, there were more discussions. Then people argued and expressed doubts, and here you've got a bunch of mannequins and these are the people responsible for security. It's disgusting."" Pavlovsky says he blames the security chiefs as much as Putin for taking a path that may in fact make Russia much less secure when the argument has been all along that Russia simply needs its security concerns properly addressed, and if that is sorted out, then all will be alright. Pavlovsky said ""nobody would have been killed"" for questioning Putin about his controversial and provocative decision to recognize parts of Ukraine as independent entities or playing devil's advocate. He sensed that some of them, in fact, the real security men in the room, had serious reservations. - , This is Pavlovsky's sense, and admittedly he has been out of the inner circle for a decade. But he is far from alone in his conclusions. Putin's speech to the nation is remarkable, many say, for its tone and content. Subsequent statements and movements equally have shaken people in Russia into wondering what tomorrow may bring. Many of them are afraid. Map depicting Ukraine, Russia, Crimea, the Donbas region held by pro-Russian forces, and nearby countries. Ian Jopson, Fox Digital Russia is a vast country and it is hard to know how these latest moves are going down overall. No doubt a significant share of the 68% or so Russians who polls here say give the president their approval would have also approved of his speech and perhaps also his plan, but others are openly questioning what is to be gained for Russia. Oleg Ignatov has worked with Putin's political party United Russia. He points to the contradictions in Putin's argument about the need to protect Russia and Russians by recognizing the two breakaway republics and making Russians safer at home. 'S , ""Ukraine will move more toward the West and the Western countries will give more support to Ukraine, in terms of military cooperation and economic too. So Ukraine will look like an enemy for us. And for Russia this looks like a grave risk,"" Ignatov says. ""I don't think Russia is getting more secure."" Ignatov admits it will be hard to tell if Russians could turn on their president should the situation escalates into full-blown conflict. ""The media here is under control of the government and the election process is under control of the government and frankly speaking, we don't have a good understanding of Russian society, because, for example, we don't have good polls. Yes. And that's a big problem here."" Nobody claims to know Putin's endgame. Pavlovsky worries his steps so far have been taken with little objective input. He says Putin's been increasingly cloistered and the pandemic just exacerbated that. 'S 40%: ""His isolation is some kind of change, a profound personality change. Everything in the Kremlin used to be built on constant communication, on conversation,"" Pavlovsky says. ""He's in some kind of abnormal situation now, but I think that even if we compare it the situation of recent years with Stalin, Stalin also isolated himself. He almost never came to the Kremlin, he lived in his dacha, but still members of the Politburo came to him, children came and so on, that is, there was some kind of normality. Putin, in my opinion, has this quarantine system that he has surrounded himself with - it somehow destroys him."" The Independence Monument is seen over Kyiv's Maidan Square in front of a Ukrainian national flag that was displayed on the occasion of the Day of Unity, in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Wednesday. And there is one particular interlocutor whose presence is particularly missed. ""Angela Merkel spoke with him often,"" Pavlovsky posits. ""She was almost like therapy or something like that for him. She may have balanced him psychologically. It's hard to prove, of course, but it seems to me that her way of communicating was somehow medicinal for him, some kind of psychological medicine."" Pavlovsky's parting words are a push for further dialogue with the man he suggests is cut off from reality, and for that, Pavlovsky concludes, dialogue is now more important than ever. ""This is not a question of treating Putin well or badly. This is a crisis issue that we all want to get out of except for a small batch of crazy people. So we need to talk. It is necessary to talk. That is what he himself is afraid of. He is afraid to discuss problems.""",0
2022-02-23,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-ukraine-crisis-biden-putin-david-marcus,Russia-Ukraine crisis -- It's time for Biden to surprise Putin,"Then-candidate Joe Biden boasts in 2019 that he would stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from taking intimidating actions toward Eastern Europe. Under three of the last four presidents, including now Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin has chosen to take military action against Russia’s neighbors. There has been only one exception, namely Donald Trump. A big part of Biden’s pitch to voters in 2020 was that he would bring a return to foreign relation norms. America would be back, the adults would be in charge, etc., etc. Well, here we are, norms and all, and yet Putin is still on the verge of an incursion into a U.S. ally, Ukraine. President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 Summit on July 7, 2017, in Hamburg. Another way of saying normal is predictable. Norms are after all a set of tried and tested approaches to a problem. For the past several months this predictability has been at the core of the Biden administration’s approach to Putin. Biden has made clear that U.S. troops will not fight in Ukraine. He has also laid out the basic parameters of sanctions he will use to punish Russia. 'S As a result, Putin has a clear blueprint of the consequences of invading Ukraine, and unfortunately, he seems fine with them. Contrast this with the foreign policy approach of Donald Trump. In January 2020, for example, Trump ordered an attack on Iranian terrorist Qasem Soleimani, which killed him. The world was shocked. Warnings flew that Trump may have just started another Middle East war or at least a greater conflict. In fact, none of that happened. Trump didn’t spend months talking about what he might do, he just did it. There is good reason to believe that this unpredictability from Trump was a big part of the reason Putin did not engage in any invasions under his presidency. Some of Trump’s own citizens thought he was a crazy man who wasn’t afraid of nuclear war; why would Putin be any different? It is time for Biden to talk a little less and act a little more. Some Biden supporters have attempted to explain why Putin didn’t act aggressively under Trump by suggesting Trump was Putin’s puppet, a favorite fevered fantasy on the left. But let's be honest, this explanation makes absolutely no sense and flies in the face of credulity. Are we really supposed to believe that Putin held off on invading Ukraine because Trump was too nice to him? Biden’s norms-based approach is an example of cultural lag from the post-Cold War period in which much of his career took place. A hegemonic superpower, which the U.S. was, can be predictable, it can afford to show its hand since its power and influence are nearly unchecked. But with the rise of both China, and to a lesser extent, Russia, as competing powers, that rubric simply makes no sense anymore. There were certainly downsides to Trump’s bull in a china shop approach to foreign policy. It often left allies confused, or feeling left out; it could appear random and haphazard. And yet, first in the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, where Biden obeyed all the supposedly smart people, and now in Ukraine, the results of Biden’s cool and steady, predictable course have diminished, not enhanced, America’s role as a global leader. The norms have not produced normal results. By taking so much, especially potential military action, off the table, Biden has handed Putin a geopolitical tasting menu. The Russian dictator knows that Biden is playing by ""The Rules,"" while everyone knows Putin is not. So far, the Russian leader has satisfied himself with the appetizers of separatist-held regions of Ukraine. In response, sanctions that will hurt both Russia and the West will be enacted, as was the plan. But why should we expect that those sanctions will blunt Putin’s appetite for further conquest? And what aspect of the predictable norms will stand in his way? It is time for Biden to talk a little less and act a little more. It is time for Biden to surprise Putin, even if that means our allies get a little nervous. Norms are all well and good if your goal is to maintain the status quo, to keep things moving in their present direction. But the present direction of foreign affairs is trending much better for Russia and China than it is for the West. If it isn’t time to abandon norms, it's certainly time to adjust them. Sadly, neither Biden, nor his top officials, appear to have the courage or foresight to understand this.",22
2022-02-23,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-hate-putin-americans-suffer,"Tucker Carlson: Americans have been trained to hate Putin, and will suffer because of it","'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host weighs in on the Biden admin's foreign policy response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Since the day that Donald Trump became president, Democrats in Washington have told you it's your patriotic duty to hate Vladimir Putin. It's not a suggestion. It's a mandate. Anything less than hatred for Putin is treason. Many Americans have obeyed this directive. They now dutifully hate Vladimir Putin. Maybe you're one of them. Hating Putin has become the central purpose of America's foreign policy. It's the main thing that we talk about. Entire cable channels are now devoted to it. Very soon, that hatred of Vladimir Putin could bring the United States into a conflict in Eastern Europe. Before that happens, it might be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious: What is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs? : 'S ‘ ’ ? These are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is no. Vladimir Putin didn't do any of that. So why does permanent Washington hate him so much? If you've been watching the news, you know that Putin is having a border dispute with a nation called Ukraine. Now, the main thing to know about Ukraine for our purposes is that its leaders once sent millions of dollars to Joe Biden's family. Not surprisingly, Ukraine is now one of Biden's favorite countries. Biden has pledged to defend Ukraine's borders even as he opens our borders to the world. That's how it works. Invading America is called equity. Invading Ukraine is a war crime. So with every day, we move closer to some kind of conflict with Russia, a conflict that could easily spin out of control given that the people running us have no fine motor skills, the administration assures us this has nothing at all to do with ripping Joe Biden's personal debts to Ukrainian oligarchs. Not at all. It's completely and totally unrelated. The point here is to defend democracy, not that Ukraine is a democracy. It is not a democracy. Ukraine's president has arrested his main political opponent. He has shut down newspapers and television stations that have dared to criticize him. So in American terms, you would call Ukraine a tyranny. But Joe Biden likes Ukraine. So Putin bad, war good. How will this conflict affect you? Will affect you quite a bit, actually. Energy prices in the United States are about to go way up, and that means that everything you buy will become much more expensive, from the food you eat to the car you drive to the tickets you need to take your family on vacation this summer, assuming you can still afford a vacation by then. You're about to become measurably poorer. That's not a guess. Joe Biden has admitted this. A Ukrainian serviceman is reflected in a mirror as he smokes a cigarette on a position at the line of separation between Ukraine-held territory and rebel-held territory near Zolote, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. 19, 2022. On the other hand, you're going to win an important moral victory against dastardly old Vladimir Putin, who is much, much worse than Justin Trudeau. Just so you know. So you can feel good about that because…because…let's see, come to think of it, why would you feel good about that? It seems like a pretty terrible deal for you and for the United States. Hunter Biden gets a million dollars a year from Ukraine, but you can no longer afford to go out to dinner. That's not a bargain. So what are we missing here? What we're missing is the big picture, and that's why Joe Biden has dispatched Kamala Harris to explain that picture to us. Kamala Harris’ old job was to open America's border. She did that. Her new job is to keep Ukraine's borders closed. Kamala Harris was in Europe the other day to explain the whole thing. She began with a history lesson, letting the European peoples know about their recent past, which she assumes they've forgotten since so few of them speak English. She opened with a traditional salutation, ""listen, guys,"" because that's the way real historians and states people talk. This is Kamala educating: : I mean, listen, guys, we're talking about the potential for war in Europe. I mean, let's really take a moment to understand the significance of what we're talking about. It's been over 70 years and through those 70 years, as I mentioned yesterday, there has been peace and security. We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe. Listen, guys, you may be Europeans who live in Europe, but you don't fully understand the ramifications of war in Europe. That's your problem. The thing about Europe, you've had peace and security for more than 70 years. Kamala Harris just told the Europeans that. - ‘ ’ And that, by the way, is true, if you don't count the breakup of Yugoslavia, which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in the 1990s or the Soviet occupation of half of the landmass, which you manage the enslavement of hundreds of millions. But apart from that, Mrs. Lincoln, it's all been peace and security in Europe. Until now. The Soviets were fine. Vladimir Putin is bad. What do we do about that? Kamala Harris explains that too. : And the allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because, remember also, we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment and within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening, although open, although it is absolutely narrowing, but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect we believe has merit. Got that. Take a breath and let it sink in. Here it is again: ""we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because, remember also, we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment and within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening, although open, although it is absolutely narrowing, but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect we believe has merit."" Well, of course it has merit. The only question is what the hell are you talking about? And the answer is, Kamala Harris has no real idea what she's talking about. She can't even point to the direction of what she's talking about. Her mouth opens and predigested chunks of language come tumbling out in no particular order. It's soothing to listen to until you try to understand what it means. As Kamala Harris told us just last month, ""It is time for us to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day."" To which we'd respond: That's right, Miss Vice President Person, today is the first day of the rest of your life. Learn it. Love it. Live it. And while you're at it, eat, pray, love. You could just imagine Vladimir Putin's reaction to all of this when an aide drops a translated transcript of Kamala Harris remarks on his desk. The Slovic mind is a hall of mirrors. It sees traps at every intersection. Clearly, Kamala Harris must be setting some sort of trap for the Russians here. Her words don't make sense, but she can't possibly be dim and childish. America is a superpower. It would never put a senile man and an imbecile in charge of the country. : ‘ ’ On the other hand, maybe so. And by the way, it's not just our country. A few weeks ago, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, met with his British counterpart, Liz Truss. Lavrov asked Truss if her country recognized Russian sovereignty over Rostov and Varonis, both of which are actually parts of Russia. So it was a trick question. But Liz Truss, who used to work in sales, had no idea. So she replied that Great Britain would never recognize these regions as Russian, despite the fact they already are Russian. So Liz Truss has no idea what she's talking about, either. But here's the thing: She wasn't embarrassed about that. None of them are embarrassed about that. John Bolton knows a lot. On the other hand, he spent decades weakening America with terrible foreign policy ideas and getting a lot of decent people killed for no good reason at all. So you think at this point, if justice were real, John Bolton would be living in isolation and shame somewhere, spending his days in atonement. That's what you would do. But that's not what he's doing. No. John Bolton went on demanding yet another war, this one with the nuclear-armed power. : Do you forces should go in to defend Ukraine? : Well, I think it's probably too late for that now, but I would say this the red line between being a treaty ally of the United States and not being one is significant. But the issue, as in all issues like this is would a Russian invasion and takeover of Ukraine adversely affect American national security and that of its 's allies? The answer that absolutely yes. … We did not act appropriately early. I think we should have had more American forces in Ukraine not to fight the Russians, but to train with the Ukrainians and to show those Russian generals looking across the border and seeing American flags, I wonder what that means. Biden took that off the table, saying there would be no American forces involved and he got nothing for it. So, the only problem with Joe Biden's Ukraine policy, says John Bolton, is that it's too weak. Your kids aren't fighting there right now, hunkered down in February, shooting at Putin. Let's try a winter war in Russia. No one's done it before, but we have high hopes. Russian President Vladimir Putin ) Alexander Vindman is, in fact, demanding it. Unlike the British Foreign Secretary, Alexander Vindman knows quite a bit about Ukraine. In fact, he was born there. Alexander Vindman believes you have a moral obligation to defend his homeland, and if you don't, you're a murderer. He said so on . : I think these folks, these right-wing pundits and the that supports them really frankly have blood on their hands because they're encouraging and enticing this kind of opportunism from Putin. And it's not what, it's not just kind of plain rhetoric like you could say something without consequences, like too often happens in here in the United States. This has real consequences. And people are going to die because of this. Yeah, they're going to die. So your job is to take up arms in defense of Alexander Vindman's home country or else you're evil, your blood on your hands and that's effectively our policy. Ok, Alexander Vindman. You got us. It’s a compelling argument. We're in. What's this going to cost us to defend the country you were born in? Well, in fact, Joe Biden addressed that question today. ""Defending freedom will have cost for us here at home,"" Biden said. ""We need to be honest about it."" Really. Biden went on to outline what he called the pain of our sanctions. - : ‘’ ‘ ’ : We're implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions, and their military bank. We're implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russia's sovereign debt. That means we've cut off Russia's government from Western financing. It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade and its new debt and our markets or Europe markets, either. Starting tomorrow and continuing in the days ahead. We'll also impose sanctions on Russia's elites and their family members they share and the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies, and should share the pain as well. And because of Russia's actions, we’ve work with Germany to ensure Nord Stream two will not, as I promised, will not move forward. So let's put aside the question of why you would ever want to shut down any energy pipeline anywhere, ever, especially now crude oil is nearing $100 a barrel, it's the highest price since 2014. That's not a small thing because you need energy to live. It's not negotiable. So how does having less energy help the United States? Joe Biden didn't even hint at an answer to that. He didn't answer any questions. He ran away the second he had finished reading the script. Back in real life, every person knows nothing will tank our economy faster than cutting off the supply of fossil fuels, because despite what you may have heard from noted energy experts like Sandy Cortez, a country of 340 million people can't run on windmills and solar panels. And even if we had enough of those, which we don't, we don't have the transmission lines to get that power to your house, and we won't for a long time. So that's all a lie. But don't worry, says Kamala Harris. The administration has ways of fixing the spike in energy prices. They've got it under control because it turns out Kamala Harris is secretly in charge of global energy markets. : No, just kidding. Harris has no idea what a barrel of oil costs. She doesn't know how natural gas is measured. What she knows about is diversity, and that's pretty much it. Though she does sense that everything is about to get a lot more expensive for you. And so to warn you, she mentioned it today. : The president has already said Americans will be facing some economic fallout or some hardships. Can you explain to Americans what exactly will they face if this happened? : Sure, as the president talked about in his speech, we are aware that, again, when America stands for her principles and all of the things that we hold dear, it requires sometimes for, for us to put ourselves out there in a way that maybe we will incur some cost. And in this situation that may relate to energy costs, for example. So, what are the principles were defending here? We're defending a regime that has arrested their main rival and shut down opposition media. What principles are at stake here, apart from rewarding the Biden family's patron? But at least she's honest enough to say what's happening in Eastern Europe quote may relate to energy costs. That's a euphemism for: Good luck filling your truck this August. Does that bother Kamala Harris? Maybe it does in the short term. Voters aren't going to like it in November. The party will be punished. But they're doing it anyway. They're shutting down domestic energy pipelines here. They're picking a fight with Europe's biggest gas supplier. So maybe there's something bigger at work here. Maybe they're thinking long-term. Maybe they're not against rising oil and gas prices. Maybe there for them. Maybe expensive energy would be good for the many renewable deals their friends and donors are invested in. We don't know the answer. We do know that all of us are about to suffer. So we hope that hating Vladimir Putin was worth it.",0

Democrat Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego criticized former President Obama on Wednesday for the way he handled situations with Russia during his presidency and concluded that some of his actions contributed to the problems we're seeing today as turmoil in Ukraine intensifies. Gallego made the remarks during the final day of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in America conference at Arizona State University's Beus Center for Law and Society.

The back-and-forth came between Republican candidates Jane Timken, Mike Gibbons and J.D. Vance. The exchange, in statements and on social media, underscored the differences between some Republicans who say the U.S. should make domestic issues its main focus and those who advocate a robust foreign policy against competitors like Russia. Vance accused the other two candidates of ""jumping on the America last bandwagon."" Timken, meanwhile, said Americans want leaders to ""stand up to our enemies"" and Gibbons' campaign said Vance is ""choosing to sling false accusations."" - After Russia sent troops into Ukraine Monday, Timken slammed President Biden's ""weak and feckless leadership"" that ""emboldened Russia"" with a series of bad policies. ""While I am 100% opposed to sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and believe intervening militarily would be a mistake, Biden must immediately impose sanctions and respond with strength,"" Timken said. ""I believe ‘America First’ means protecting American security interests at home and abroad, and a Russian-controlled Ukraine will directly impact energy prices, causing Ohioans to pay more at the gas pump, fuel food inflation, and further disrupt supply chains while sending a blaring signal to China, North Korea and Iran that America and our allies are vulnerable,"" Timken added. Gibbons also said Russia needs to ""be isolated politically and economically and face tough economic sanctions."" He added that President Biden's ""policy of appeasement has failed. His statement in January telegraphing a non-response to a 'minor incursion' by Russia into Ukraine sent a clear message of weakness to Vladimir Putin."" 'S But Vance shot back that the candidates are focusing on an issue that doesn't really affect Americans at home but may lead to lost blood and treasure thousands of miles away. [T]he Russia-Ukraine border dispute has nothing to do with our national security, no American interest is served by intervention. ""Vladimir Putin is an evil man, who has done a number of evil things during his time in government,"" Vance said. ""But spare me the performative affection for the Ukraine, a corrupt nation run by oligarchs, that is as close to a functional democracy in 2022 as Afghanistan was when Joe Biden handed it over to the Taliban in 2021."" Vance said he is praying for innocent Ukrainians, but that it's not the United States' job to get involved. ""[T]he Russia-Ukraine border dispute has nothing to do with our national security, no American interest is served by intervention, and… the obsession with Ukraine from our idiot leaders serves no function except to distract us from our actual problems,"" he added. Vance said the statements from Gibbons and Timken reflect the foreign policy of Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., rather than former President Donald Trump. And he added that politicians should be focused on the border crisis and the drug crisis instead. - , But the campaigns of Timken and Gibbons shot back that neither candidate wants to send troops to Ukraine and that they are simply advocating for the U.S. to stand up for its interests.

President Biden has attracted more media scrutiny with his administration's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, marking the second major foreign policy dilemma of his presidency. The White House is dealing with media pressure as they take steps to respond to Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine. After withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and leaving many Americans behind, the media was very critical of Biden as he originally promised to keep troops on the ground until every American had left.

""Probably not, I think what he's trying to do is tit-for-tat here,"" Clapper said.

""For the third or fourth time, I am calling it an invasion,"" Finer replied. ""We are taking a severe response, including sanctions on Russia that we’ll be rolling out in a matter of hours… And we will have additional sanction steps to announce in response to this Russian invasion of Ukraine.""

Biden did not take questions Tuesday after announcing sanctions. Biden also did not take questions in August 2021 when the administration was dealing with the crisis in Afghanistan. 's Kasie Hunt also became one of the seemingly few who did defend Biden after his walkout Wednesday. Other media were accused of giving Biden a pass on domestic issues in light of the overseas turmoil, such as News, which suggested on Twitter that the Ukraine crisis can explain the economic one. ""The U.S. economy has been hit with increased gas prices, inflation, and supply-chain issues due to the Ukraine crisis,"" the tweet read. ""Inflation has been a major issue in this country since early last summer, and the Russian buildup only began three months ago, so of course Americans are feeling what they're feeling because of Putin's aggression,"" Fox News contributor Joe Concha told Fox News Digital. ""This is all an effort to shield the president and this administration from responsibility around our current economic state regarding inflation and gas prices and supply chain ,"" he continued.

Defenders of President Biden scolded critics of his decision not to take questions following Tuesday’s remarks on sanctions imposed by the White House against Russia, evoking the mantra that ""politics stops at the water's edge,"" but the decorum was largely ignored during the previous administration. ""So weird that the ‘Trump is Putin’s puppet’ folks have rediscovered the importance of ‘politics stops at the water's edge’ in the Biden era lol,"" Cavalry founding partner and podcaster Michael Duncan observed. The Twitter account for House Republicans captioned a photo of Biden turning his back on reporters and walking away without taking questions by writing, ""This is what weakness on the world stage looks like."" The tweet was hit with immediate backlash, including one observer who asked, ""Whatever happened to, ‘Politics stops at the water's edge?’"" -: , : Another critic responded, ""Just add 'politics stops at the water's edge' to the list of American principles jettisoned to own libs."" Many other pundits have scolded critics of Biden’s Tuesday remarks. ’s Kasie Hunt even suggested Republicans were the ""enemy"" for criticizing Biden as the U.S. ""works to keep alliances strong."" ’s Joy Reid agreed with the notion that domestic political beef shouldn’t affect foreign policy. ""’Politics ends at the water's edge’ used to be a thing,"" Reid wrote in response to the tweet. Biden, however, was not abroad, but in the White House. ’s Joy Reid declared, ""’Politics ends at the water's edge’ used to be a thing."" The phrase, attributed to Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican from Michigan who supported Democratic President Harry Truman during the aftermath of World War , is being used to scold Republicans as the Ukraine-Russia crisis escalates. However, liberals didn’t exactly live by that mantra when former President Trump was in office. Trump going abroad didn’t slow down his outspoken critics. The Washington Times once rounded up criticism following his July 2018 summit in Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir Putin, where he was pilloried for saying he took Putin's denial of meddling in U.S. elections at face value. Among his fierce critics was the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ""A former Obama official deemed it ‘treason.’ A ‘analyst’ called for a ‘shadow government’ to take him out. An contributor said Trump’s performance will ‘live in infamy’ as much as Pearl Harbor or Kristallnacht. Former Director James B. Comey said, ‘Patriots need to stand up and reject the behavior of this president,’"" the Washington Times pointed out, adding that ’s Rachel Maddow took criticism of Trump even further. NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck blasted the hypocrisy of Reid and other liberal pundits. ""I'm old enough to remember when it was seen as patriotic to criticize a president over their foreign policy decisions. It's quite illuminating that this has been the tactic that so many in the press have gone with. Sure, we've seen plenty of attempts to blame Trump, but to suggest it's treasonous or anti-American to state the facts of what's happening is some grade-A spin,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. ""The media have either played the role of stenographer for the Biden administration in claiming they will do this or that to make it seem as though they're decisive, or made him a passive character in this global crisis,"" Houck continued. ""In other words, it's a throwback to the Obama playbook. Joy Reid is too busy constructing strawmen the size of Mount Everest about education and how conservatives want to teach history to correctly understand foreign policy."" Reid’s own colleague Jonathan Allen penned a piece in June 2018 headlined, ""With Trump, politics no longer stops at the water's edge."" Among Trump's critics for withdrawing from a G-7 communiqué while he was in Canada were McCain, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""Washington’s political class has long observed the maxim that politics should end at the water’s edge,"" Allen wrote. Former President Trump was regularly criticized when dealing with issues overseas. ) ""But it wasn’t just the G-7 communiqué that prompted rebukes of Trump during his foreign travels. Even before that, he roiled the foreign policy establishment by calling for Russia to be readmitted to the G-7, and he’s gotten pushback from both parties in Congress over his decision to lift sanctions on the Chinese telecommunications company ,"" Allen added. ""American political battles seem sure to follow Trump wherever he goes."" Trump isn’t the only president that has taken heat from domestic rivals amid international crisis. In 2014, author and Georgetown University professor Robert J. Lieber penned a Washington Post piece headlined, ""Politics stops at the water’s edge? Not recently,"" which explained that ""politics can be delayed at the water’s edge, but it certainly doesn’t stop for long"" in modern times. Liber noted that the polarizing Iraq war was a key example, as Democrats openly objected to President George W. Bush, while reaction to President Obama’s handling of Syria proved both sides have taken part. ""In short, politics does not stop at the water’s edge,"" Lieber wrote.

Swalwell responded, ""I think this is the largest invasion in Europe since World War , and these are the harshest sanctions that any country has experienced since World War … There will be more to come."" The Biden administration responded with some sanctions against Russian oligarchs and banks, technology exports, and re-activated sanctions he had lifted on Nord Stream 2 , whose Russian parent company is Gazprom.

Ted Cruz speaks with Fox News Digital from about the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and how energy should play a key role. , Fla. – Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is urging Congress to take action to make permanent sanctions targeting the company behind a controversial pipeline that’s front and center amid Russian attacks on neighboring Ukraine. President Biden on Wednesday – hours before Russian leader Vladimir Putin launched a military assault on Ukraine – moved ahead with sanctions on the company that overseeing the building of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 project, providing a major blow to the pipeline from Russia to Germany. The penalty against Moscow was one of a series of steps the U.S. and its allies have slapped on Russia after it recognized separatist territories in eastern Ukraine ahead of sending in troops. 'S ‘’ ""I'll tell you what Congress needs to do next week. We need to come back and pass my legislation to make the sanctions on Nord Stream 2 permanent,"" Cruz said Thursday evening in an interview with Fox News minutes after delivering a speech in Orlando, Florida at the Conservative Political Action Conference , the largest and oldest annual gathering of conservative leaders and activists. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022, in Orlando, Fla. Cruz once again charged that ""the reason that Russia is invading Ukraine right now is because of repeated mistakes made by the Biden White House."" He argued that one of the mistakes was what he called the ""catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan, the weakness that projected to every enemy of America that emboldened our enemies."" And the senator claimed that ""the specific reason we saw Ukraine invaded is because the Biden White House surrendered on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Nord Stream 2 is the pipeline that Putin was building to get his energy straight to Europe without having to go through Ukraine. And the reason he wants the pipeline is so that he doesn't need Ukrainian pipelines to get his gas to market."" The move is part of a series of penalties the and its allies have imposed on Russia this week in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's recognition of separatist territories in eastern Ukraine as independent. Cruz authored bipartisan legislation signed into law by then-President Donald Trump to stop the development of the pipeline before Biden reversed the effort. ""Just this week, after the Russian invasion, Biden finally, finally, finally, did the right thing and put sanctions in place,"" Cruz said. President Joe Biden speaks about Ukraine in the East Room of the White House The senator argued that making the sanctions permanent would ""take away Joe Biden's ability to waive them in the future…Every Republican, every Democrat should come together on legislation that says Nord Stream 2 will never, ever, ever, go online. That would be the right thing to do. And by the way, it's the only thing that has any real potential of stopping this invasion of Ukraine."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday the Biden administration had ""never supported"" the Nord Stream 2 pipeline despite previously waiving sanctions and lobbying Congress against sanctioning it. The pipeline’s parent company, Nord Stream 2 , is a firm registered in Switzerland whose parent company is the Russian gas giant Gazprom. Trump has repeatedly argued this week that Putin would not have launched the attack on Ukraine if he were still in the White House. And Trump, in comments that sparked controversy, used the words ""savvy"" and ""genius"" to describe the Russian leader’s moves. Asked about those comments, Cruz defended the former president, telling Fox News ""I think what President Trump said is that Putin is running circles around Joe Biden, that that's not a good thing. It is unfortunately true."" And he charged that ""Biden refuses to stand up and lead."" Fox Nation is the Featuring Sponsor of 2022. Watch speeches live and on-demand on Fox Nation.

2022-02-24,https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-watching-us-weakness-russia-ukraine-invasion-experts-warn,"China 'watching' for US weakness amid Russia invasion of Ukraine, experts warn","Top foreign policy experts told Fox News Digital Thursday that China is ""watching"" to see how the U.S. and its Western allies handle Russian aggression against Ukraine and whether there is ""any sign of weakness."" ""They have done the calculus as to what this would ‘cost them’ if they were to move against Taiwan. And they are getting more data points now looking at what the West is doing now vis-à-vis Russia,"" said Heino Klinck, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia during the Trump administration. ""It will inform and potentially shape Chinese decision-making,"" he continued in reference to the U.S. response in Eastern Europe. ""Any sign of weakness…will be taken into account by the Chinese."" : Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, June 5, 2019. - , Moscow’s aggression toward Kyiv prompted the U.S. and its Western allies to respond with severe sanctions and the deployment of Western forces to -member nations that surround Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Critics of the Biden administration, like former President Trump, have claimed the inability to deter a Russian invasion will ""embolden"" China to act more aggressively toward Taiwan. But Isaac Stone Fish, of Strategy Risks, a China-focused risk firm, told Fox News he disagrees with this calculus. ""I think in some ways it’s the opposite,"" Stone Fish, who focuses on issues involving U.S.-China national security, said, adding that China could interpret increased military involvement in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict as opportune timing. ""They would calculate that the United States is unlikely to go to war with Russia over Ukraine and China over Taiwan at the same time. The more involved the United States gets in the Ukraine crisis from a military perspective, the more it incentivizes China to act now,"" he added. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin have expressed nostalgic desires to rebuild previous empires that were broken up during the 20th century – but experts argue this is where the parallel between the Russian-Ukraine conflict and Beijing’s desire for dominance over Taiwan ends. The Chinese Communist Party has long sought to reunify Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China , with mainland China, but this goal has been met with opposition from Western nations like the U.S., the U.K. and Australia. Taiwan has been described by Western allies as the beacon of democracy in Asia and identifies as a sovereign nation. But Taiwan is officially recognized by China, the United Nations and the U.S. as part of the one-China policy. Chinese Air Force personnel march past the Chinese military's J10C fighter and -7A2 fighter bomber during 13th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, also known as Airshow China 2021, Wednesday, Sept. 29, 2021, in Zhuhai in southern China's Guangdong province. The Chinese government has repeatedly pushed back on questions linking Ukraine with Taiwan and on Wednesday Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, ""Taiwan for sure is not Ukraine."" ""Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China. This is an indisputable legal and historical fact,"" she added. The experts agreed that pushing a strategy of economic deterrence as witnessed in Europe by would prove much more difficult with an adversary like China. ""What we see now in Europe demonstrates a failure of deterrence,"" Klinck said. ""The West, in essence, used the threat of sanctions to try to push back on Putin’s military aggression, and it hasn’t worked."" ""And the stakes, with respect to economic sanctions in a Ukraine-Russia scenario, are a lot less than they would be with China,"" he added. Klinck, who also previously served as a military attaché in China, pointed to the challenge the U.S. encountered when convincing Germany to block the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the face of Russia’s violation of international law. ""Could you imagine what it would be like to try and put together an international coalition that would be willing to levy meaningful economic sanctions against China when the Chinese economy is literally at least 10 times the size of the Russian economy?"" he questioned. ""It demonstrates the limited value that sanctions can have in deterring an authoritarian regime,"" Klinck added. In this handout photo taken from video released by Ukrainian Police Department Press Service, Military helicopters apparently Russian, fly over the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022. Stone Fish told Fox News Digital that it comes down to how China wants to be perceived on the global scale and not necessarily how its economy could be impacted by an international conflict over Taiwan. ""It’s less [about] its economy and more the perception of China in the eyes to the world as a responsible global player – a reputation that I would argue it doesn’t deserve – but China and Chinese companies and Chinese actors are far more integrated into the international system than Russia’s are,"" he said. But Taiwan appears to remain concerned that China could seek an opportunity to take advantage of the current distraction in Eastern Europe by making a move on Taipei. In a meeting with a working group regarding the Ukraine crisis this week, the Taiwanese president said military and security units ""must raise their surveillance and early warning of military developments around the Taiwan Strait,"" according to a report by Reuters. Former strategist at the Pentagon Matthew Kroenig, who also sits as a Vandenberg Coalition Advisory Board member, told Fox News Digital that fending off a Chinese invasion of Taiwan comes down to strategy. ""What we need is a defense strategy to defend our interests and peace and stability in both Europe and Asia,"" he said. ""China should be the priority as it’s the biggest long-term threat, but the United States is still a global power we still have interest in Europe and the Middle East, and we can walk and chew gum at the same time."" Kroenig argued the best way to deter China from taking military action is to increase the U.S. naval presence in the region, beef up Taiwan’s missile striking abilities and encourage allies to do the same. The former Pentagon official also said the issue of nuclear deterrence needs to be leaned on more heavily if the U.S. is serious in preserving Taiwan’s autonomy from a Beijing aggression. ""I think we need to be prepared to deal with Russia in Europe and China in Asia at the same time,"" he added. ""I think if Xi perceives a weak response in Ukraine he might take that as a green light.""",5

The hosts of the ""Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show"" criticized a column from the blog of the ""Rachel Maddow Show"" on Wednesday. The two hosts said the article exemplified how the media is trying to deflect any blame from President Biden and his weakness on the world stage for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sexton, a former analyst, read from a post by Steve Benen, a producer for Maddow's program, which claimed Russia chose to wait to invade Ukraine because former President Trump was giving the Kremlin what it wanted. ""Why didn’t Russia invade Ukraine during Trump’s term? Perhaps because Putin was so pleased to see Trump pursuing goals in line with Moscow’s agenda,"" Sexton read from the blog post. ""Let me say this is intellectually indefensible,"" Sexton said. ""This is moron stuff here."" Co-host Travis added that the blog was the latest example of trying to ""give Biden cover"" from domestic political fallout as a full-scale invasion threatens to tank the U.S. economy in part because of the president's decisions on energy policy -- as well as present the potential for a larger-scale military action in the East.

""And so, as a result it’s not as bad as trying to take over Kyiv or trying to take over the entire country, and so he’s able to add those eastern Ukraine regions to his own overall footprint of Russia."" Travis said Trump told him Russian President Vladimir Putin was never willing to take such actions while he was in the White House, with the host adding that arguments to the contrary are ""fundamentally dishonest."" Sexton went on to note how Trump was lambasted for describing Putin's strategy as ""savvy,"" clarifying that the former real estate mogul was speaking to the ""efficacy of Putin's tactics"" rather than the merit or rightfulness of them. Travis later added that the media used very tiny pieces of their interview with Trump to further the efforts like those in the Maddow blog to deflect blame from Biden and return to their favorite political foil in the former president. ""So what you are seeing by the way that they reacted to a clip -- not even a full couple of minutes of a discussion surrounding Ukraine [as] a desperate attempt to try and make it look like it’s not Joe Biden's fault,"" he said.

Benen wrote how Putin targeted several former territories of the Soviet Union during the last four presidents' terms except for Trump -- and that, given the impeachment-eliciting controversy over Trump's overtures with Ukraine, an invasion ""risked"" interrupting something Putin apparently wanted.

And then the last one is they're going to facilitate a regime change and eventually that we will see that unfold before our eyes. He's got a lot of options to deal with that. I'm sure he's got a set plan in play and how he intends to accomplish that. But he can call audibles in relation to that. That's what we see in front of us. And certainly the consequences of this for Europe, for the world writ large because nothing happens in isolation anymore. Obviously, as we have said so many times, the result of the Afghan debacle. It had residual effects, emboldened our adversaries. We've seen it here with this incursion, and military all full-out invasion is more accurate description. And this will have that kind of residual impact to and embolden the Iranians, for sure, as they're going forward. … And certainly President Xi is looking at. While he publicly has not endorsed what Putin is doing, he hasn't condemned it either. They're talking about negotiations, a middle road approach.

One of the things most remarkable about this is what you are not allowed to say now is something that people at the highest levels of the U.S. Government have said for many years. For example, the idea that it is incredibly provocative … to expand up to Russian borders is something that if you say now, both to identify the cause of the tensions, but also as a way out of this war … you get accused of being a Putin spokesman. … This is an incredibly dangerous war.

It's an incredibly dangerous situation. We should have done everything we could to avert the war and should do everything now to try and diffuse it. And so, if all we have to do … is promise that will never expand to Ukraine … why aren't we doing that?",0
2022-02-24,https://www.foxnews.com/media/media-trump-russia-ukraine,"MSNBC, WaPo speculate on how Trump would have handled Russia-Ukraine as crisis unfolds under Biden","Former Director Gen. David Petraeus on tensions being high as the threat of a Russian war looms over Ukraine. President Biden has held office for more than 13 months, but former President Trump still occupies a significant space in media coverage of the unfolding Russia-Ukraine crisis. Analysis of what he would or wouldn't have done as president, and explanations of why Russia didn't invade Ukraine while the man accused for years of collusion with the Kremlin held office, have been prevalent in recent days. Trump also drew fierce criticism this week for praising ""savvy"" Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""genius"" declaration that two east Ukrainian territories controlled by pro-Russian separatists were ""independent,"" while also claiming Putin wouldn't have done it if he was still in office. Even before Trump's pronouncements on Putin drove a news cycle, some journalists strained to make Biden's handling of the situation about Trump. Criticized for being passive and enabling Russia with his energy policies, Biden has imposed sanctions and moved U.S. troops to Poland in response to Russian troops entering Ukraine. Europe, and the world, are on high alert. The Russia-Ukraine crisis has President Biden imposing sanctions intended to send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, in a piece headlined, ""With Biden standing firm, Putin must wonder: Where’s Trump when I need him?"", argued Putin had miscalculated by not invading when Trump was in office. , 'S 'T ' ""If Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to gobble up another chunk of Ukraine at little or no cost to his own interests, he should have done it while Donald Trump was still president,"" Robinson wrote. ""If Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to gobble up another chunk of Ukraine at little or no cost to his own interests, he should have done it while Donald Trump was still president."" Eugene Robinson, columnist, Washington Post. Senior writer at Real Clear Investigations Mark Hemingway responded that Putin had also invaded Ukraine in 2014, when Biden was vice president: ""I don't think Biden is a deterrent."" ""Why Putin didn’t invade Ukraine during the last U.S. administration,"" ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" producer Steve Benen wrote for , theorizing that Trump's actions in office were enough to advance Putin's anti-West goals. The piece charged Trump had hurt the European Union by expressing ""disdain"" for it, undermined , and weakened the U.S. political system. ""Why didn’t the Russian leader deploy troops into Ukraine during Trump’s term? Perhaps because Putin was so pleased with an American president who pursued goals in line with Moscow’s agenda,"" Benen wrote. ""Had Putin launched an invasion, it risked upsetting the course he was already delighted to see. Why would the Russian leader get in the way of the progress Trump was already delivering?"" The Atlantic's Anne Applebaum told the invasion was delayed because Trump was ""weakening Ukraine."" ""If you remember, the argument over Trump’s first impeachment was about Trump refusing to give military aid to Ukraine because he imagined he could get some dirt on Joe Biden from the Ukrainians,"" she said. ""So why didn’t Putin do this during the Trump administration? Because he thought Trump was weakening Ukraine, especially on this ground. The problem of Ukraine being unfortified goes back several years and much of the fault lies in the Trump administration."" Journalist Drew Holden doesn't buy that notion. ""I think President Trump had some real serious issues in his Russia policy - the Helsinki Summit didn't portray America in a positive light, and Trump drew inaccurate moral equivalencies between the U.S. and Russia repeatedly - but I think the 'Russian Collusion' hoax overshadows his presidency in an unfair way,"" he told Fox News Digital. President Donald Trump, right, shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Friday, June 28, 2019. Trump's warm rhetoric at times toward Putin and his public 2018 acceptance of Putin's denial of U.S. election meddling – directly contradicted by U.S. intelligence conclusions – went neatly with feverish media coverage of alleged Russia collusion and even speculation he was a Russian ""asset."" But Trump also signed off on anti-tank missile sales to Ukraine, successfully urged more members to meet defense spending responsibilities, and approved sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. ""The reason people are talking about Trump is because everyone knows that Putin didn't dare move on Ukraine when he was in power for a reason,"" The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway told Fox News Digital. ""Trump was tougher on Russia where it mattered, including bolstering our energy production and reducing Russian leverage over Western Europe, but not needlessly provocative such as by pushing expansion to Russia's border. Biden has done the opposite of Trump in foreign policy and the result is that in less than a year, Putin felt empowered to do what he's doing now."" ""The reason people are talking about Trump is because everyone knows that Putin didn't dare move on Ukraine when he was in power for a reason."" Mollie Hemingway. National Review's Rich Lowry theorized Trump's unpredictability and willingness at times to use force made Putin more wary of him, such as when he ordered the strike that killed Iranian Quds leader Qassem Soleimani, a key figure in the Russian-allied Islamic Republic. : ‘ ' Hemingway expressed similar sentiments. ""[He] sought departure from nation-building, [but] he was a hawk on American interests and use of military to achieve political goals,"" Hemingway told Fox News Digital. ""When Trump iced Iran's top general while he was driving around in Iraq, he sent a message to every other world leader that America, under Trump, was not to be messed with."" Left-wing national security analyst Malcolm Nance, who has repeatedly dabbled in conspiracy theories, suggested Ukraine had been extorted out of anti-tank missiles by Trump and said he would be responsible for the conflict becoming ""bloody."" Trump did approve missile sales to Ukraine multiple times but was accused of dangling an already approved $400 million in military aid to Ukraine in 2019 in exchange for investigating Hunter Biden, which ultimately led to his first impeachment. The aid was ultimately released. ""Look, this is going to get bloody,"" Nance said on Tuesday. ""Donald Trump is going to be responsible for a lot of it. I mean, he extorted this country with the anti-tank missiles they need now to defend themselves. All I know is, we haven’t given Ukraine enough missiles here to really stop what’s coming. But if we do, well, maybe this whole thing can be reversed a bit."" ""Look, this is going to get bloody. Donald Trump is going to be responsible for a lot of it."" intelligence analyst Malcolm Nance. : ‘ ’ Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, a loyal Biden booster, tweeted Tuesday, ""We won't have to guess what Trump would have done – he would have praised Putin and rolled out the red carpet to the rest of Europe."" Holden, whose threads on media hypocrisies and cold takes often go viral on Twitter, said it was likely more of a comfort zone to discuss Trump than critically assess Biden, who repeatedly said he was the only candidate running in 2020 who could take on Putin. ""I don't think hypothesizing about how Trump may or may not have reacted is relevant or helpful as Russian troops seemingly get ready to invade Ukraine,"" Holden told Fox News Digital. ""I think the reality is that the [Biden administration] doesn't have any answers to the crisis and that, for a lot of voices in the media, it's a lot more comfortable to wax poetic about how things supposedly would have played out under Trump rather than confront that reality, especially where President Biden ran on a platform of having all the answers."" Smoke billows from a power and heating plant after it was shelled in Shchastya, in the Luhansk region, eastern Ukraine, Tuesday, Feb. 22, 2022. Partisan rancor about how Biden is handling the conflict has led to some pundits and former government officials demanding loyalty to the president, or at least silence. A House Republicans tweet calling Biden weak on the world stage this week drew media outrage, with 's Kasie Hunt saying the sounded like the ""enemy,"" former Director John Brennan declaring the party had no soul, and 's Joy Reid mourning the end of the ""water's edge"" mantra that presidents abroad shouldn't be criticized domestically. Hemingway, a critic of the sprawling Russia probe, wasn't having any of it. ""The corrupt corporate media and other Democrats spent every second of Trump's presidency calling him a Russian traitor,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""It is absolutely absurd to turn around after that and say that criticism of Biden's feckless foreign policy is now somehow off limits from reasonable and measured criticism.""",9

The ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee said it's time for the ""big stick"" to be used as the ""worst-case scenario"" plays out in Ukraine. ‘' : We knew about this plan months ago. I was a very harsh critic of the administration not providing enough deterrence before an invasion. They always talked about after an invasion what to do. And so, like Teddy Roosevelt said, it's time to carry the big stick. It's time for the big stick now. And I think that's something we will rally around, both Republicans and Democrats. But it's unfortunate that this had to happen, and we didn't provide the sanctions that I thought would be helpful prior to the invasion. This is the most massive invasion in Europe since World War , since Hitler invaded Poland to put it in perspective. … We would game out the options right here is not what's the worst-case scenario?

2022-02-24,https://www.foxnews.com/media/reporters-biden-claiming-sanctions-russian-aggression,Reporters call out Biden for claiming no one expected sanctions to prevent Russian aggression,"White House correspondent Peter Doocy asks President Biden at his address to the nation how 'economically painful' Russia's invasion of Ukraine will be for Americans.

2022-02-24,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-america-top-three-goals-russia-ukraine-war,Tucker Carlson: These should be America's top three goals amid Russia-Ukraine war,"Fox News host reacts to Russia waging war on Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' What's happening in Ukraine, whatever its scale, and it's not totally clear right now, but whatever it is, it's a tragedy because war always is a tragedy and the closer you get to it, the more horrifying it seems. It's the ugliest thing that men do. Ever. Vladimir Putin started this war so whatever the context of the decision that he made, he did it. He fired the first shots. He is to blame for what we're seeing tonight in Ukraine. The question is, once we've established that and it's obvious, how should the United States respond to what he has done? So, within minutes of the outbreak of the war last night, the usual liars on television began leveraging this tragedy for partisan political gain. If you ever watch the aftermath of the school shooting, you're familiar with how they behave. It's contemptible, but we're going to ignore it tonight because there is too much else going on that actually matters and the main thing that matters in any crisis is deciding what's most important, creating a hierarchy of concern. : Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures while speaking to the media during a joint news conference with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban following their talks in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Feb. 1, 2022. So, until last night, the main purpose of our foreign policy was to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine. Obviously, that failed. At some point, we should figure out why. But what's our top goal now? Well, there are several of them. Here are the first three: First and most obviously: avoid a full-scale war with a nuclear-armed adversary and to be fair, very few people in Washington want anything like that. War with Russia is so obviously a bad idea. But that doesn't mean we won't have one. Wars often break out accidentally or more often incrementally. Things escalate and the next thing you know, you've got Verdun with many thousands dead. Now that shooting has started in Ukraine, it is entirely possible, no matter what they assure you, that Americans could wind up getting hurt in eastern Europe. We should prevent that, but preventing it will require wisdom and farsightedness and emotional control—all of which are never in abundant supply in Washington—and especially now that everyone is justifiably upset. Again, what Russia has done is awful, but we can still make it worse. Mark Warner, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, just announced that Russia could be potentially close to triggering what's known as Article Five of the Alliance. That's a collective defense principle. So if Russia were to launch a cyberattack on Ukraine, Warner explained, an attack that affects nearby members like Poland or Lithuania, then possibly every country, including ours, the United States, would be obligated to declare war on Russia. Here he is explaining: . : One of the things that I'm gravely concerned about is if Russia unleashes its full cyber power against Ukraine. Once you put malware into the wild, in a sense, it knows no geographic boundaries. So, if the Russians decide they're going to try to turn off the power, turn off all the electricity all across Ukraine, very likely that may turn off the power in eastern Poland and eastern Romania. That could affect our troops if suddenly hospitals are shut down. If those troops, American troops, somehow have a car accident because the stoplights don't work, we are suddenly in an area of hypothetically an Article Five where one country is attacked, we all have to come to each other's aid. So Warner's certainly right. That hypothetical that he outlined could happen in the cyberattack on Ukraine could well affect the infrastructure of the eastern European countries. That would be bad. It would be a crime. The civilized world would deplore it. But Article Five is not a mechanical mechanism. Human beings have to decide to invoke it and the question is: Is what the senator just described something that is worth risking a nuclear conflict over? And that is something we should pause very deeply to think about in the most sober possible way, and we hope that our leaders are. But not all of them seem sober right now. Some of them seem reckless and, as usual, ignorant. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, for example, spends a lot of time on cable television talking about world affairs. He seems like an expert. And yet, by temperament, he's certainly the last person you want anywhere near a nuclear button. Today, Kinzinger informed us that Russia's seizure of the defunct Chernobyl plant might ""trigger Article Five."" , it could be interpreted that way, and then what happens? Clearly, Adam Kinzinger hasn't thought about that. Not for a moment. ’S So, you see the problem here. The question is not: Who's at fault? We can say that Vladimir Putin is at fault. But then what? And that's the larger problem. Once conflict starts, especially when that conflict is televised, it's really hard to know what happens next. So, anyone who thinks the invasion of Ukraine couldn't become a world war either lacks imagination or is lying to you. It certainly could become a world war. So that's the first goal: not making a terrible thing much, much worse. Here's the second goal: keep the energy flowing. Cheap energy, we take it for granted, but it is the basis of all we have. No energy, no civilization. Unfortunately, a huge percentage of Europe's energy now comes from Russia and Ukraine. The European Union relies on Russia for roughly 40% of its natural gas. In Germany, which is one of the biggest economies in the world, that percentage is over half. Most of its energy, in the form of natural gas comes from Russia and Ukraine. You don't hear that very often on television. This debate is framed exclusively in moral terms, and those are important. We shouldn't ignore them, but they're not the only terms we should consider. The fact is that Vladimir Putin has the power to send Europe and, for that matter, potentially the United States, into an economic depression. Putin has the power to turn off the lights. So where did Vladimir Putin get this power? Well, there are a lot of reasons, but a big reason is the climate people gave him this power. Thanks to pressure from zealots like John Kerry, Europe has been shutting down nuclear power plants for years and that's a very confusing strategy. If you're worried about climate, nuclear energy is not the problem. Nuclear energy is the solution. It's reliable. It's domestically produced. It emits no carbon. So, if you were genuinely worried about temperature rises, global warming, you would embrace nuclear energy. But our leaders, and not just ours, globally across the West, have done the opposite. Why? Maybe their donors and families are invested in so-called renewable technologies? Who knows! Whatever the reason, because of a series of very specific decisions made over time, the West is now dangerously dependent on Vladimir Putin for energy. Now, our leaders may act like this is not a big deal. It is definitely a big deal and we ought to make decisions based on that fact. A Ukrainian soldier passes by houses in the village of Novoluhanske, Luhansk region. Militants of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic stand in front of an apartment building. A woman walks past the debris in the aftermath of Russian shelling, in Mariupol, Ukraine. And finally, a topic no one ever brings up. We must protect the U.S. dollar. America's power derives from its wealth. Rich countries get to do what they want. Poor countries must obey their masters, or they get invaded. We just saw that happen. That is the unchanging rule. In this country, control of the U.S. dollar is the key to our wealth. Our entire financialized debt-based economy rests on the unique privilege of issuing the world's reserve currency. If the U.S. dollar is ever replaced, we are in legitimate trouble. Our debt will come due. Our government will go bankrupt and millions of Americans will become poor immediately. So, this is the main thing we ought to be worried about, and it is a greater risk now than ever before. Sanctions are an emotionally satisfying way to punish someone like Vladimir Putin, who clearly does deserve to be punished. No one's really against sanctions, but the question is: Do they work? Clearly, multiple sanctions did not prevent the invasion of Ukraine. Let's start there. At the same time, sanctions give Russia and many other countries across the world a strong incentive to dump the U.S. dollar, which is the means by which we enforce sanctions. So last summer, for example, in a story that most people didn't pay enough attention to, Russia, in response to sanctions, completely removed the U.S. dollar, its assets from its sovereign wealth fund, its national wealth fund. The Chinese noticed. They understand exactly how this works and in their effort to displace the United States, they are strongly in favor of it. China is trying to become the first major country in the world to central bank-issued sovereign digital currency. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu at the Kremlin, in Moscow on February 14, 2022. If that works, and many efforts like it, it would be a huge loss for the United States, an irreplaceable loss that would change this country forever, much more than an invasion of Ukraine. So, we should be watching attacks on the primacy of the U.S dollar globally every bit as intently as we watched the coverage currently on television of the hot war. If at the end of this conflict, whenever that is, countries around the world have come to see the Chinese Yuan as a stronger, more stable currency than the U.S. dollar, then this country will have lost more than we understand. Somebody needs to be paying attention to this. Let's fervently hope that somebody is.",0

That was the time to begin sanctions, economic sanctions, continued sanctions on Nord Stream, sanction their oligarchs, sanction their energy sector, deal with their banking systems, and the [Biden] administration didn't want to do that,"" she said. ""They felt like they could kind of talk their way through it. And I think Joe Biden has realized 'old buddy old pal,' is not going to work."" , : Blackburn said Putin’s decision to fully invade Ukraine is a direct result of his perception that Biden is ""weak"" after the U.S. rolled back sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline last year, handing Putin what he wanted. President Biden delivers remarks on Russia's attack on Ukraine, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Feb. 24, 2022. ""So what does [Putin] do? He looks at this, and he says Joe Biden is weak. He's not paying attention. He's not sending a strong, coordinated diplomatic message,"" Blackburn said. ""So I've got a clear runway, and off I go, and I think we're all frightened for Ukraine."" Early Friday, it was reported that Russians entered the Obolon district of Kyiv, the capital. Ukrainian citizens have been advised to make Molotov cocktails as the Russian forces advance deeper in the country. Blackburn told Fox News Digital that she is concerned that we ""do not know"" how many Americans remain inside Ukraine, as the Russian troops advance. She noted that Tennessee’s many religious organizations and churches throughout the state have active ministries in Ukraine, so there are definitely U.S. citizens remaining in the war-torn state. ""We do not know how many Tennesseans are there. … We've got so many of the religious organizations and churches in our state that are very active in ministries in Ukraine, and we wanted to get that information in their hands so that people that they are supporting that these congregations are supporting and people that have relatives that are there would be able to quickly get that information in case you had an advance like you had [Wednesday] night in Ukraine."" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022, in Orlando, Florida. She told Fox News Digital that her office had about 2,000 cases of Tennesseans wanting to evacuate during the botched U.S. troop withdrawal out of Afghanistan and that many of those cases remain open. The senator plans to call on the State Department to ask for numbers of Americans, and specifically Tennesseans, inside Ukraine so as not to repeat the issues of evacuating U.S. citizens during the Afghanistan exit. In addition, the senator said that especially in light of recent events, topping the list of most important issues for Republicans going into the 2022 midterm elections are national security, crime and inflation. ""You know, we're hearing a lot about three issues the border crime in the streets, and we're hearing a lot about inflation,"" she said. ""I would couple with that the security issue, national security issues, and that's really the border is where your foreign policy and your domestic security issues can meet. And people are quite concerned about crime and gangs and human trafficking, sex trafficking and drug trafficking. Every town is a border town."" Blackburn also didn’t directly rule out a potential 2024 presidential run in response to a question from Fox News Digital about speculation swirling due to her planned headliner fundraisers in early voting states Iowa and New Hampshire in the coming months. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., questions head of Instagram Adam Mosseri during a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee hearing. ""I am working for the people of Tennessee, and I'm working to make certain we take the majority back in 2022. And in Iowa, I will be there to help and support Sen. Grassley and the members of Congress,"" Blackburn said in response. ""We've got great female members there. We're really proud of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who will give the Republican response to the State of the Union. And in New Hampshire, we're going in to help campaigns and the state party, and then we’re going into other states for other colleagues to bolster the vote to make sure that women know the Republican Party. We’re the party of parents, we are the party that is fighting [critical race theory], we're fighting ‘woke’ in the schools.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., react to Biden’s most recent speech on the Ukrainian crisis. , Fla. - Lawmakers reacted to an apparent contradictory statement President Biden made in his address on the Ukraine crisis on Thursday. ""No one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening,"" Biden said Thursday, as he announced new sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion into eastern Ukraine. ‘- ,' Yet on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris had taken a different tune. ""The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence,"" she said. Lawmakers reacted to the dueling narratives. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., said the statements revealed a severe lack of communication. ""I don't think obviously the president, the vice president know what the left hand's doing from the right hand, and obviously they're not communicating about things,"" Steube told Fox News Digital. ""If they don't believe that the sanctions are effective, then why are they actually doing them? So, obviously they believe that they're effective. They were unwilling to do it earlier, so they know it has an economic impact to Russia. I think these are things we should've done a long time ago."" President Biden speaks to update the situation of the Ukraine-Russia border crisis during an event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Feb. 18, 2022, in Washington, D.C. The congressman argued that the president's message only made the U.S. more vulnerable. ""But it goes back to, our adversaries and our enemies saw what happened in Afghanistan, and so they know that Biden is not going to take a strong stance militarily,"" Steube said. ""And if you listen to his words carefully yesterday, he said we'll do everything that we can within our power to support our allies. Well, Ukraine's not one of them. So he basically telegraphed to the Russians that whatever Putin wants to do in the Ukraine, we're not going to do anything to stop him."" ‘ ' Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., offered a blunt assessment of the administration's foreign policy capabilities. ""President Biden was right: no one expected his toothless sanctions to deter Putin,"" Cotton said in a statement to Fox News Digital. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., responded to the White House's contradictory comments on sanctions by saying the ""currency of deterrence"" had already been disrupted because the administration hesitated to act against Russia. ""The currency of deterrence was lost when the president and this administration chose not to move forward sanctions last fall,"" Blackburn told Fox News Digital. ""The currency was lost when he gave Putin everything he wanted on Nord Stream, with no conditions. And it was lost when there was the renewal of New . So all of that, your deterrence value was lost at that point."" ""And to say on one hand, that they work and on the other hand that they don't,"" she continued. ""What we do know is if they are placed forcefully and if our allies get a solid, comprehensive, cohesive message from us, what our position is, then it works. Our allies need to know that they're our friends. Our enemies need to know that they better fear us."" Ukraine supporters chant ""I support Ukraine"" outside the White House. The chaos in Ukraine marks Biden's second major foreign policy disaster of his presidency, the first being the chaotic and deadly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan last August.

American-owned F1 team Haas carried on racing without the sponsorship of Russian company Uralkali on its car Friday amid increasing disquiet on the final day of preseason testing in Barcelona where Mercedes and Red Bull were the fastest in early action. Haas F1 has removed the Uralkali sponsorship from its Formula One cars. Haas' driving lineup includes Nikita Mazepin, the only Russian driver on the Formula One grid this season. Its decision on its plain livery came after four-time champion Sebastian Vettel said he would not race at the Russian Grand Prix in September because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Haas F1 Team will present its -22 in a plain white livery, minus Uralkali branding, for the third and final day of track running at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya,"" the team said in a statement Friday. ""Nikita Mazepin will drive as planned in the morning session with Mick Schumacher taking over in the afternoon."" Haas F1 fields cars driven by Mick Schumacher of Germany and Nikita Mazepin of Russia. Formula One later pulled its race from Russia, saying it would be ""impossible"" to hold the race in Sochi under the current circumstances. Mazepin has not yet spoken publicly after Russia's attack on Ukraine. He and team principal Gunther Steiner canceled media appearances Thursday. Mazepin's test run was cut short because of a suspected leak. A coolant leak had reduced the team's time on track on Wednesday. Haas receives significant funding from Uralkali and had unveiled a white, blue and red livery that resembled the Russian flag. The car Friday had the word ""Haas"" in big red letters on its side. ""No further comment will be made at this time regarding team partner agreements,"" the team owned by Gene Haas said. The Uralkali livery featured the colors of the Russian flag. George Russell was fastest in the morning session with Mercedes, ahead of the Red Bull of defending world champion Max Verstappen, Vettel for Aston Martin and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. After no major incident during the first two days, the final session was red-flagged five times in the morning — first because of an issue with the Alpine of Fernando Alonso and then because of a crash by Pierre Gasly into the tire barriers with AlphaTauri. Pirelli will artificially soak the track in the afternoon session to test wet tires. Among the sweeping regulation changes to try to improve racing in 2022 was the addition of bigger tires.

China will feel emboldened in its aggression toward Taiwan after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to experts. Taiwan reported that it dispatched fighters to caution nine Chinese planes that flew into its defensive airspace on the first day of Russian’s invasion. China has conducted similar flybys in the past, but the timing remains notable. James Anderson, former deputy undersecretary of defense for policy under President Trump, told Fox News Digital that China would be watching ""intently"" to see if Russia suffers ""significant and lasting consequences"" from its action in Ukraine and how the U.S. has responded. 'S ‘ ’ ; ""I think there’s real risk that China may conclude that concrete U.S. actions in response to Russia’s invasion fall somewhat short of its rhetoric,"" Anderson said, noting that Biden had promised ""swift and severe sanctions"" but has yet to invoke the most severe economic punishments against Russia.

And Dean Cheng, senior research fellow at the Asian Studies Center for the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, agrees that the U.S. response to Russia may prove too soft for deterring China from similar actions against Taiwan. - ""I think what you are seeing is not surprising in any way unless you are someone who weirdly bought into this idea that somehow China was suddenly going to oppose Russia,"" Cheng told Fox News Digital. ""I think there has been a lot of wishful thinking over the last year or so that Russia would be deterred, Russia doesn’t really want a war, and we’re going to see exactly the same thing if and when Taiwan becomes an issue.""

The most significant difference between the European and Indo-Pacific theaters is that the U.S. has the alliance to act as a deterrent against Russian action in several countries – an alliance Russian President Vladimir Putin feared Ukraine would join, bringing the alliance a greater presence along Russia’s western border. 'S , The U.S. lacks a similar unifying alliance in the Indo-Pacific theater but instead maintains a series of strong, bilateral security treaties with countries like South Korea, Japan, Australia and Taiwan, the last of which is enshrined in the 1989 Taiwan Relations Act. But Cheng believes that European forces would be less effective and more cautious in an Asian theater of operation, noting that has stood back from taking direct action to stop the invasion of Ukraine, which borders on a number of allies. ""What do you think they bring to the table – and that leaves aside the question of why would they come in?"" Cheng argued. ""If they won’t come into Ukraine, which borders on multiple allies, in open violation of a number of formal treaty commitments that every signed – Helsinki accords, Minsk, too – why would we assume our European allies to fight and die for Taiwan when there’s no commitment to it?""",5

Just to mention a very important point, there is a major financial game between Germany, other European countries and Russia, and we are partnering with both. We … this administration, Germany and Russia are part of what — the Iran deal. And the Iran deal is not just about $40 billion, but $150 billion and even more than that. So the calculations in Moscow are since you are sitting at the same table with these partners, including our administration and the Biden administration is so much dead-set on going back to the deal. Therefore, their calculation is that we're not going to confront them. But there's a second reason. They saw what we've done in Afghanistan, that we withdraw from Afghanistan and we cut a deal with the Taliban leadership, and that in the eyes and the mind of Putin or the Russian leadership means that we're not ready. This administration is not ready to confront them and Ukraine as well. … This all indicates that this administration and its partners, the Western partners and probably India, were not ready for what Russia has done, and they were not ready because they didn't even calculate that Russia could do so. There is a reason behind that, and I go back to my first point.

Michael McCaul, R-Texas and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, slams Biden for lack of proactivity in Russia-Ukraine tensions and believes another dictator is watching the brewing crisis closely. President Biden's decision to wait and see what Russia would do in the lead-up to the invasion of Ukraine represents a ""bystander in chief"" approach that may embolden China's President Xi Jinping to launch his own aggressive move against Taiwan, a foreign policy expert warned. On the day Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops to invade Ukraine, nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan's air defense zone, the Taiwan Ministry of Defense announced Thursday. James Jay Carafano, a national security and foreign policy fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital that President Biden is not taking the right approach to preempt a possible Chinese attack. : ""The worst possible situation is to sit back and wait until the enemy acts and respond to it,"" Carafano told Fox News Digital in a Thursday interview. ""That's essentially what we've done in the cases of Putin and Xi."" As President Biden’s tenure in the White House hits the 100-day milestone, media watchdogs and journalism professors alike have noticed that journalists are ""overwhelmingly favorable, polite, and gentle"" when covering the current administration. Carafano warned that Biden is ""very risk averse. He waits for the enemy to do something and then he tries to respond."" ""We are sitting back and waiting for the Chinese to decide what they want to do and when,"" he warned. ""This is the mistake we made with Putin."" Carafano did not predict whether or not Xi would attack Taiwan – an island that China considers part of the People's Republic of China in a similar way that Putin considers Ukraine a historic part of Russia – but he did say that Biden is letting Xi set the terms of any potential engagement. Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, June 5, 2019. In October, Biden said the U.S. would defend Taiwan if China attacks. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson responded by saying, ""No one should underestimate the strong resolve, determination and capability of the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. China has no room for compromise."" Carafano said the Chinese planes in Taiwan's airspace ""could mean they're going to war or not,"" but Biden's lackluster approach makes the situation worse. ""This is the difference between being the world leader and being the bystander in chief,"" Carafano said. ""When you're waiting for the other guy to do terrible things before you do anything, you fail. The whole idea is to have them not do anything bad to begin with."" After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, ""Biden has already failed,"" Carafano said. ""The idea was to prevent Ukraine from being invaded and he failed.

Mike Braun says Biden must enact ‘painful’ sanctions on Putin to end Ukraine invasion: ‘Cat’s out of the bag’ , Fla. – Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said Biden must enact ""painful"" sanctions on Russia, not just ""slaps on the wrist,"" if he's serious about forcing Russian President Vladimir Putin to roll back his invasion in Ukraine. In an interview with Fox News Digital at the Conservative Political Action Conference Braun slammed President Biden for his ""weakness"" on the Russia-Ukraine war, saying that his reaction to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine should have been stronger. ""When President Trump was [in power], if you crossed a red line, almost everybody expected there to be a consequence,"" said Braun. In contrast, the senator said that Biden is projecting weakness, by disarming the U.S. by taking away an opportunity for the country to become energy independent and overseeing the chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan. : ""Bad actors see that, and that feeds into their motivations. And they're going to say, ‘Hey, if this is the same old reaction, I can get by with it.’ That's what's happening,"" explained Braun. In response to Biden’s newly announced second wave of sanctions against Russia, Braun told Fox News Digital that since the ""cat is out of the bag,"" there is no guarantee they will work against Putin, and they cannot be just ""slaps on the wrist.""

Aside from being tough on foreign adversaries, Braun also explained to Fox News Digital why it is important to crack down on domestic criminals. , Braun, along with Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, authored a letter to the U.S. Government Accountability Office this week asking the nonpartisan, fact-finding body to dig into nonprofits that provide bail services. Braun told Fox News Digital that he was motivated to call for an investigation because of the continued ""coddling"" of criminals, especially in Democrat-run cities. Senator Mike Braun, a Republican from Indiana, walks to a Senate Republican caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol. ""So here is another example of where if you're coddling, if you're letting criminals, especially ones that have got bad records out on the streets, it's a signal for them to continue bad behavior. Very analogous to the bigger picture international criminals. Bad actors take their cue by what they see your reaction is going to be,"" Braun said, referring to Putin’s aggression toward Ukraine. In addition, in response to a question from Fox News Digital regarding whether Braun would get behind the growing movement to recall Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon over his crime policies, the senator said he would support it.

President Biden, asked by a reporter Thursday if he would urge China to help isolate Russia, responded: ""I’m not prepared to comment on that at the moment."" Speaking on ""America’s Newsroom"" Friday morning, K.T. McFarland, a former deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration, wryly commented that she didn’t think Chinese President Xi Jinping was presently taking Biden’s phone calls. McFarland, who also served in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations, noted, ""China is not calling this an invasion – why? Because when China goes into Taiwan, they are only saying, ‘Well, we are only taking part of China, this isn’t an invasion, this is actually just part of China.’"" Also causing some alarm: a New York Times report that described how, over a period of three months, the U.S. held meetings with Chinese officials showing intelligence detailing Moscow’s ""troop buildup around Ukraine."" The Times reported that the U.S. side had ""beseeched the Chinese to tell Russia not to invade."" It turned out, according to the report, that Beijing shared the information with Russian officials claiming that the United States was ""trying to sow discord,"" noting, ""China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions."" Showing the closeness of the relationship, Chinese media reported that Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a telephone call Friday in which they discussed the situation in Ukraine. It didn’t appear as if Xi asked Russia to stop the invasion or even called it one. Rather, according to the readout, it was noted that Xi reiterated China’s support to Russia and Ukraine to resolve the issue through diplomacy. Putin, the readout noted, had explained the historical context of Russia’s ties to Ukraine and also brought up Russia’s special military operation taking place in the east of Ukraine. China also announced the previous day it was lifting all previous sanctions on Russian wheat imports. ‘’ , 'S 'S Nile Gardiner, the director of the Heritage Foundation’s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, told Fox News Digital that Beijing has been taking full advantage of what it's seen as a weak America.

Biden is a quintessentially European Union-style politician who believes in endless negotiations and multilateral solutions... He's not someone who believes in the protection of hard power, and that's a fatal mistake to make when you are confronting both Beijing and Moscow because it just sends a message of weakness rather than strength."" Gardiner said China continued to look ahead to the Biden administration's response, saying that if Biden does run, and win a second term in office, that China will ""become more and more powerful, and in the absence of a robust American leadership, the Chinese Communist Party is going to be increasingly assertive, aggressive and confident."" Gardiner concluded, ""The world is a far more dangerous place when the United States is in retreat as we're seeing today under the Biden-Harris administration."" Craig Singleton, a China expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington, said China needed to be careful about how it dealt with the present crisis, especially given its cooling economy. ‘ ’ , : ""China's evolving and increasingly convoluted messaging about the Ukraine crisis reflects the tension that exists between China's great-power aspirations and its current limitations. Beijing's tacit support for Russia's grievances advances its goal of undermining the U.S.-led international order; however, China also remains reliant on Western capital and technology to power its economic development."" Singleton, a former U.S. official, noted that the ""inherent friction will greatly complicate and, in many ways, constrain Xi's ability to successfully navigate the fallout resulting from what is increasingly shaping up to be a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, one that Beijing is perceived as having backed."" Ukraine supporters chanting ""I support Ukraine"" outside the White House. Singleton told Fox News Digital that China’s leaders were closely watching the situation, and what they've seen might not be to their liking. He said they've been ""gauging how the United States and its allies are responding to Putin’s actions. The bad news for Xi, as he evaluates potential military operations against Taiwan, is that so far Putin’s aggression has unified member states."" He continued, ""Chinese leaders remain deeply concerned by Washington’s ongoing attempts to build up its alliance network to counter Chinese belligerence throughout the Indo-Pacific. If Washington and Brussels are able to impose significant costs on Russia, leaders in Beijing may think twice about striking Taiwan, opting instead to continue apace with their existing strategy of retaking the island by all means short of war."" Singleton also pointed out the slowdown in China’s economy that actually could lead to a rethinking of China-Russia relations. ""Europe remains a top Chinese trading destination. More than a dozen European countries have signed onto China's Belt and Road Initiative. China also remains highly dependent on oil imports to meet its surging energy demands. Economic instability and a resulting economic slowdown resulting from Russian aggression in Ukraine will absolutely test the Sino-Russian partnership."" Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, appearing on the ""Faulkner Focus,"" was asked by Harris Faulkner if we are ""looking at a new world order."" Pompeo said he was very concerned about a set of ""cascading risks."" He noted he had no doubt that Xi was watching this.

Much of Ukraine is ethnically Russian, the rest is Slavic. These are considered family, and they know it's family attacking family, and look, nobody believes the propaganda that Putin is liberating Ukraine from fascists or protecting Russians from an ethnic genocide, nobody believes that. Ukrainians and Russians talk to each other all the time, and they know the difference between reality and propaganda. So, on the one hand, it's completely unsurprising that people would go to the streets. Is it likely to lead to anything? The answer is probably no. … They've arrested several hundred people, but they've actually been fairly light at the crackdown on this point because they're not looking for a big distraction.

2022-02-26,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-rep-perry-biden-admin-china-taiwan,GOP Rep. Perry says 'not too late' for Biden admin to prevent Chinese attack on Taiwan amid Russia-Ukraine,"Fox News correspondent Mike Tobin reports on the latest in Ukraine. , Fla. – Republican Rep. Scott Perry said it is ""not too late"" for the Biden administration to ""show some strength"" with regard to China's ambitions in Taiwan amid concerns that Beijing has been emboldened by Russian aggression in Ukraine. During an exclusive interview with Fox News on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference , Perry, R-Pa., said the Biden administration’s leadership has been ""an abject failure."" ""How we got into this, in my opinion, is twofold,"" Perry said. ""It's our energy policy in the United States. When we pull the United States offline of producing the energy that the world needs, it opens it up for other actors who use it to extort their neighbors, and Vladimir Putin is one of them."" : Perry said when U.S. ""assets"" are pulled off the market, it ""raises prices because there is less of it."" ""And when you do that, somebody like Vladimir Putin, who's got an economy that is 40-50%, driven by fossil fuels, it raises the amount of money he's making, so it makes it affordable for somebody — some autocrat — to do what he's doing. So that's number one,"" Perry said. ""The Biden energy policies have facilitated what's happening in Ukraine right now."" Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., takes a question from a reporter at a news conference held by the House Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill in Washington Aug. 23, 2021. ""Number two, his rhetoric has been weak,"" Perry said. ""We saw him being weak in Afghanistan and so too the rest of the world, certainly, but Vladimir Putin did, and then just recently, with Ukraine talking about a little invasion or something like that, would be something we wouldn't do anything about it. That’s very, very provocative. ""When a tyrant is looking for a green light, that’s essentially opening the door completely."" Some have raised concerns in recent days that Russia’s multi-front war on Ukraine could embolden adversaries like China in their ambitions to take Taiwan, but Perry told Fox News there is still time. ""It’s not too late, but the actions obviously haven't had any effect on Russia's calculation, on Vladimir Putin's calculation, and the risk related to invading another country on the world stage,"" Perry said, referring to the Biden administration’s sanctions on Russia. ""There’s a risk to that and, apparently, he’s determined that it is worth the whatever that risk is."" As for China, Perry said he believes ""China is making an assessment right now."" ""It's ongoing,"" he said. ""It's a continuous assessment, and I still think that there is time for the Biden administration to show some strength here and some resolve. President Biden delivers remarks on the debt ceiling during an event in the State Dining Room of the White House Oct. 4 in Washington. ""But if they continue to fail or fail more spectacularly than they already have, I think it kind of opens the door wide open to China's regressions, and then it's just a matter of timing."" Taiwan scrambled its air force Thursday as nine Chinese aircraft have entered the island nation’s air defense zone, the Taiwan Ministry of Defense announced. A small fleet of eight J-16 fighters and a Yun-8 technical reconnaissance aircraft breached the airspace. The Taiwanese aircraft broadcast a warning and monitored the Chinese fleet’s activities. A Defense Department spokesman said that the Pentagon is ""aware of the reporting"" and that the U.S. remains ""concerned"" by ""provocative military action near Taiwan."" ""The United States will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues, consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan,"" the spokesman said, stressing that such action is ""destabilizing"" and undermines regional peace and stability. ""Our commitment to Taiwan is rock solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region."" The last such incursion occurred on Jan. 23, when 39 Chinese aircraft flew into the defense space, but the new fly-by occurs at a time of heightened tensions. In this undated file photo released by the Taiwan Ministry of Defense, a Chinese J-16 fighter jet flies in an undisclosed location Taiwan increased its alert levels as Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine Thursday local time. China criticized the move by saying Taiwan is ""not Ukraine."" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Tan Kefei stressed that Taiwan was a ""core issue"" for China, and it would tolerate no foreign interference. ""We urge the U.S. side to recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan issue,"" Tan said, according to Reuters. And China appeared to stress that coverage of Russia’s invasion could play into helping ""solve the Taiwan issue once and for all."" Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., takes a question from a reporter at a news conference held by the House Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill in Washington Aug. 23, 2021. Meanwhile, when asked why the average American should care about the conflict in Ukraine, Perry said there is a ""macro issue which maybe most of Americans don't realize."" ""We are a treaty signatory. We made a guarantee with some of our European partners that if they're ever attacked, we would be there to defend them, we would come in with armed forces,"" Perry said. ""Vladimir Putin hasn't gotten there yet, but he's on the doorstep right now, and if he goes any further, we are there, so that's a good reason to be concerned."" Perry also said that ""every single day,"" when Americans are ""buying goods and services, whether you're paying for it at the pump, or whether you're buying a half a chicken for your family for dinner this evening, you're paying more because of the fuel prices."" ""It is unnecessary,"" he said. ""We don't have to sacrifice. We can still have the ideals that people should be free and should not be invaded while producing our own fossil fuels and driving the cost down for us.""

2022-02-26,https://www.foxnews.com/media/brig-gen-blaine-hold-ukraine-energy-russia,Brig. Gen. Blaine Holt explains what America can do economically during Russian-Ukraine crisis,"Blaine Holt tells Jesse Watters that Putin will keep going until he has found Zelenskyy and either killed him or detained him. Brig. Gen. Blaine Holt told ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" on Friday that there are economic approaches the United States can take to make it a more ""complicated pathway"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy. : It's time to complicate Vladimir Putin's solution, and it needs to be a multilayered approach. And while I like a force presentation that shows him capability, and let's be honest, he's not having a cakewalk in Ukraine, and it only gets harder for him militarily from here. But back home economically, we can absolutely start drilling, pumping and flowing oil into the economy tomorrow to start dropping his strike price and an array of things that we can do around the world to make it a much more complicated pathway for Vladimir Putin's true strategy. … So this is where I hope our leaders are having very serious consultations tonight, both here at home and at . Vladimir Putin is going to keep going until he has found Zelenskyy and either killed him or detained him. And this is very serious, and the atrocities that we're seeing on the ground indicate to us how far they're willing to go. So while there may not be an Article 5 from in our future, there's certainly nothing to stop the United States from checking his power with air power space assets, cyber assets, shows of force. You know, President Zelenskyy asked for a no-fly zone. I'm not sure that our leaders have that on the table, but certainly we should be looking at one of our greatest strengths, is American logistics, and we should be absolutely resupplying all classes of stock to the Ukrainians tonight.",0
2022-02-26,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-russia-ukraine-defeat-joe-biden,Tucker Carlson: Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a humiliating defeat for Joe Biden,"Tucker told viewers that America has had two historic foreign policy debacles in under a year in Friday's opening monologue. We tried to bring you as straightforward an analysis as we could of the invasion of Ukraine yesterday. It was then in progress. It still is. The war at that point was less than 24 hours old, and it seemed disrespectful and wrong to use the deaths of people on the ground as a partisan cudgel. War is horrifying, of course, but it's also a grave and profound thing. You have to stand back and offer a moment before you start drawing convenient conclusions from the suffering you see. Death is a mystery. Acknowledge that. That's how we feel. Joe Biden's allies in the media do not feel that way. They use the opportunity to attack their political opponents immediately, as they always do. They have no restraint and no shame. We're grateful not to be them. So that was last night. Tonight, it's fair to note the obvious: The invasion of Ukraine is a humiliating defeat for Joe Biden. He's our leader. He staked this country's reputation, billions of dollars and the full force of the U.S. government, on preventing Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine anyway, and America is diminished by that. : It's not the first time Joe Biden has done something like this. Less than six months ago, Biden oversaw an almost indescribably chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. He left American citizens behind. He armed the Taliban with advanced weapons systems on the way out. It could not have been worse. So here you have two historic foreign policy debacles in under a year. Is there a precedent for that? What's the message of it? Well, weakness, obviously. Republicans often say that, but as usual, don't go far enough. Weakness? Well, North Korea is weak. They literally have famines. People starve to death in North Korea. That's weakness. But they're still a nation we have to contend with because they bite. A venomous spider is weak, you can crush it, but you're still afraid of it because it bites. We do not bite, and that's the problem. We're not simply weak. The United States government under Joe Biden is ridiculous. It's pompous. It's self-involved. It's long-winded and fatuous. It's not so different from the fading old man who leads it. There's no hiding this. The rest of the world sees it clearly. So do many Americans, if watching the invasion of Ukraine this week made you feel a little sick, this is probably why. Of course, you felt sorry for the Ukrainians being killed. But you also sense that this was a genuine disaster for us in America. And you're right, it is. Joe Biden is quickly draining the reservoir of America's credibility and power that has accumulated over centuries of wise decision-making. Like the U.S. Treasury, this is not Joe Biden's capital to spend. He is squandering something that others made. How much is left at this point? You hate even to think about it. Someday, we're going to find out. So the problem here isn't complicated. Joe Biden broke the oldest rule of all: Don't make threats you can't back up. You'd think he would know that if he had actually squared off against Cornpop, but the public swimming pool in Wilmington 60 years ago. But he never did. So he doesn't know that if you say something serious, you had better mean it. Is reckless to tell obvious lies. If you do that before long, and it happens very quickly, in fact, people figure out that you can be ignored. You're not a superpower. You're a joke. And that's why you never, under any circumstances, say anything like this: : The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence. But let's also recognize the unique nature of the sanctions that we have outlined. These are some of the greatest sanctions, if not the strongest that we've ever issued. : The president believes that sanctions are intended to deter. : As to the sanctions. The most important thing we can do is to use them as a deterrent, as a means of dissuading Russia from engaging in further aggression. Those were statements made just recently, in some cases just days before Vladimir Putin showed precisely how meaningless our sanctions actually were. The greatest sanctions ever, said Kamala Harris, wearing her stupid little mask on Monday. She's a buffoon. You knew that. A person carries a banner during an anti-war protest, after Russia launched a massive military operation against Ukraine, in Moscow. A Ukrainian serviceman carries an anti-tank weapon during an exercise in the Joint Forces Operation, in the Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine. A woman walks past the debris in the aftermath of Russian shelling, in Mariupol, Ukraine, A Ukrainian serviceman is reflected in a mirror as he smokes a cigarette on a position at the line of separation between Ukraine-held territory and rebel-held territory near Zolote, Ukraine. Now it's obvious that her buffoonery is a real peril for the rest of us. No one in the White House seems to understand this. It's life's most obvious lesson. So here is Joe Biden from today telling you that actually, these sanctions the greatest, most deterrent sanctions ever, were never intended really to deter anything. Sorry, if it took us seriously the first time, we didn't really mean it. : No one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. It has to show, this could take time and we have to show resolve. So he knows what's coming. And so the people of Russia know what he's brought on them. That's what this is all about. Who gives him these scripts? Do they not think we have access to YouTube? Or maybe they're just hoping Google will scrub it by the time he holds another press conference. You just told us on Monday that the purpose of these sanctions was to deter the invasion of Ukraine. So, at the very least, acknowledge they didn't work as intended. : ‘ ’ They can never acknowledge that. Oh, the vaccine prevents transmission and infection. Just tell the truth. People will understand. But they lie every time. Now they're telling us, Putin knows what's coming. We'll get him next time. Right. No one believes you anymore, Joe Biden. No one should believe you. It is very hard to take unserious people seriously. A serious president who cared would have reassessed everything America's foreign policy and how it was administered after the Afghanistan withdrawal last August. That was a disaster. So a responsible person would have asked himself: How do we prevent this from happening again? That's how responsible people think. It's our leaders who care about their country's think. Of course, it's the baseline requirement for leadership. This was a disaster. How do we prevent it from happening again? That's not hard. But lifetime federal employee that he is, Joe Biden did the opposite of that. His first instinct was to protect the bureaucracy, not the country, the bureaucracy. So not a single person from the Pentagon or the State Department was fired or even reprimanded. In fact, famously, the only person who was punished in the end for that historic debacle was a marine colonel who complained about it. He went to jail for complaining. And you will see the same response this time after the disastrous invasion of Ukraine. The American officials who so publicly trashed this country's credibility will be promoted for it. They always are. Victoria Nuland is one of the geniuses behind the Iraq War that was almost 20 years ago. Does that hurt her career? It should have, should have ended her career, in place right then. Go do something useful. Learn how to lay tile. But it didn't end your career, in fact, your career accelerated. In fact, this same person, Victoria Nuland, went on to help lead the Ukraine debacle we're watching now. She's completely unqualified for the job she has. We knew that 20 years ago. And yet she's highly successful in Washington. Some day she'll probably be the secretary of state. Remember her name, Victoria Nuland. She'll be rewarded for failing. Meanwhile, people who criticize Victoria Nuland or who care enough about this country to critique Joe Biden's foreign policy disasters, find themselves denounced the media as, of all things, traitors to America, and then spied on by the . You see how that works? It's all self-protection, and because it is, only buffoonery is rewarded. And that's exactly why John Kerry is still around. John Kerry told the in public on camera that the real victim of this war is something called ""the climate."" : Massive emissions consequences to the war, but equally importantly, you're going to lose people's focus, you're going to lose, certainly big country attention because they will be diverted. And I think it could have a damaging impact. … So I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate. And of course, he flew private to that interview, hoping nobody noticed, not caring if anyone noticed. What is the explanation behind that? How could you say something like that? That clip is real. We didn't make it up. It's hard to believe it, but it is real. It's all real. If you did a nationwide search for the people least capable of leading a large nation through complicated times, you would get our leadership class. You would get John Kerry. Oh, we found him. The search is over. And of course, at the very top of that list would be John Kerry's friend, Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton revealed the real story she's telling you that the actual enemy in this war is not in Russia, not eastern Ukraine. It's not Vladimir Putin. It's you. The real enemy of this country is anyone who dares to criticize the mismanagement of Hillary Clinton and her friends. : I think it's time for what's left of the Republican Party that has any common sense not just to say, , go help defend Ukraine against Putin, but to stand against those people in politics and government, in the media and elsewhere in our own country who are literally giving aid and comfort to an enemy of freedom and democracy. It can't. It can't continue because it plays right into the ambitions of not just Putin, but also President Xi of China to undermine democracy, to literally divide and conquer the West without ever invading us, but by setting us against each other. Your opinions are the real threat to democracy. Dare criticize us, and we will denounce you as a dangerous traitor because that's democracy. So if Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine? But guess whose fault it is? It's your fault. Notice the theme here? It's always your fault every single time. And they're going to punish you for it. Hillary did say one interesting thing in that clip, probably inadvertently. She didn't say it, but the allusion was there. Russia and China are now aligned as a bloc against the United States. Now, how did that happen? It's pretty obvious you're looking around the world, you're thinking, who are the big powers with meaningful economies and nuclear weapons? Maybe they shouldn't be aligned against us. That's just the simplest kind of math. Maybe we shouldn't do anything that pushes our enemies into a bloc. Because that threatens us. But they don't know that that's happening, or maybe they're in favor of it. God knows what the Biden administration is thinking. According to the New York Times, ""The United States met with China over three months to present intelligence, showing Russia's troop buildup near Ukraine and to urge Beijing to help avert war. Chinese officials rebuffed the United States and then shared that information with Moscow."" Oh, yeah. So we went to China for help to prevent Putin from invading Ukraine at the very moment that Russia and China were forming a very public alliance against us. Did that really happen? Apparently, it really did happen. How long can this go on? And maybe that's why Biden didn't mention China during his press conference. He gave them our intelligence and they gave it to Putin. Perfect. But don't mention that or you're a traitor.",0

American actions ""could make him think twice about further cooperation with Russia,"" she said, noting the necessity of beginning ""what will be at times a very painful"" decoupling from China. 'S 'S , ""The very idea that the administration thought that they could get the to act in our interest is delusional,"" Ingraham said, adding ""that's the thinking of someone who knows literally nothing about the way our biggest adversary operates.""

For the United States to decouple from China, Ingraham suggested raising tariffs to make products in America, ""delinking our manufacturing on key technologies"" and canceling the student visas of the 340,000 Chinese students studying stateside. ""Why are we training China's next generation, all of whom are approved to be here by the ?"" she asked. ""Why are we training them in fields? And at some point down the road, we know they're just going to turn around and use what they've learned here against us, or our allies.""

Nowhere worse than the fall of Afghanistan, when so many other things began to ratchet up against us around the world. China is watching this very closely. And again, China and Russia have been even closer to the process of this engagement here. I think if you look at what the must be thinking about this, they're eyeing Taiwan very closely. They want to see what the world's reaction is going to be to this, and it's not working out well for the rest of the world, certainly not working out well for Taiwan.

A news host in Ireland grilled Russia's ambassador to Ireland during a interview, at one point referring to him as an ""apologist for slaughter"" and pushing back against claims that it was ""not [Russia's] choice"" to start a war against Ukraine. News' David McCullagh spoke with Ambassador Yuriy Filatov on Friday. As the interview concluded, McCullagh asked the ambassador why Ireland should continue to allow Filatov to remain in Ireland, given this week's events in Ukraine. ""Why should our government entertain your presence here when you're acting as an apologist for slaughter?"" McCullagh asked. ""Well that's a good question,"" Filatov replied. ""You might ask your government. It's up to them. I can leave any time."" Earlier, the ambassador said that war has been going on in Ukraine's Luhansk region for almost eight years, and claimed it was ""waged by the Kyiv regime against the people of Donbas and Luhansk."" : ""I'm sorry, ambassador,"" McCullagh responded, ""but that war was started by Russia. It was fomented by Russia. It was continued by Russia. Russia has been arming the separatists in those areas you mentioned."" ""We did not,"" Filatov answered. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addresses the nation from Kyiv, Feb. 25, 2022. The ambassador continued: ""That has been started by the [Ukraine] government, which came to power in 2014 and to everybody, the only reason was that the people in the republics in the region, the thing they simply rejected – that they have not accepted – the new regime, which was all about Ukraine mutation. They wanted to keep their language, which is Russian, to speak it, to leave the room real life and just put it isn't. They were victims of the old operation aimed to suppress them, suppressed them."" McCullagh then accused the ambassador of presenting the ""Russian version of events"" and asked Filatov why 's viewers should ""believe the Russian version of events when Russia has been misleading us in recent weeks."" The ambassador responded that he didn't think the Russian government was misleading anyone. McCullagh then pointed to a statement the ambassador had made just 10 days earlier, saying claims of a Russian invasion against Ukraine were ludicrous. ""We do not have any plans to invade anybody, least of all Ukraine,"" Filatov said. '' Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""We do not have any political, economic, military or [any] other reason to do that. The whole idea is insane,"" Filatov previously said. Filatov initially denied making the comments when they were brought up by McCullagh, but then said that the invasion was ""not our choice."" McCullagh wasn't buying it. ""Your forces have invaded a sovereign nation. It absolutely was your choice,"" the host said. ""Well, it was not our preferable choice,"" Filatov replied. ""If you are a little bit patient, you would listen through what they have to say. We tried all efforts to settle things politically through the Minsk process. They have failed. It all became clear that Kiev just did not want to sit in the forum of the Minsk agreements, let alone the benefit of the republics. They simply used this diplomacy as a cover to prepare an offensive for them."" The ""Minsk process"" refers to a series of agreements that followed Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine. A Ukrainian soldier passes by houses in the village of Novoluhanske, Luhansk region, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. 19, 2022. McCullagh said there was ""no proof"" to support the ambassador's claims. ""There is no proof whatsoever. Are you expecting the world to believe that Kyiv waited until you had nearly 200,000 troops massed on its borders to launch an offensive. It is ludicrous to use your own words,"" McCullagh said. The interview took place during the second day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine early Thursday morning local time, saying ""our confrontation with these [Ukrainian] forces is inevitable.""",0

2022-02-26,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-world-war-russia-invasion-ukraine,Trump warns 'world war' could be next as Russia continues invasion in Ukraine,": , Fla. — Former President Trump warned that Russia’s multi-front invasion in Ukraine could lead to ""world war"" and told Fox News Digital that the Biden administration is going to have to ""do a lot more than just sanctions"" to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin. During an exclusive one-on-one interview with Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, the former president said Russia’s war on Ukraine ""never should have happened."" ""It is a horrible thing. It would never have happened under any circumstance, and it is what it is,"" Trump said. ""But there's great bravery being shown, and I think they’re doing one hell of a job—much more so than anybody would have thought possible."" : When asked if he had a message to Putin, the former president said: ""I have no message."" ""I just think it's a shame that this is going on. It's something that should not be going on,"" Trump said. ""Thousands of people, I mean, this can lead to much bigger than this one area,"" Trump warned. ""This could lead to a lot of other countries and can lead to world war."" Trump said ""you never know how it starts, in a world war."" Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference Saturday, Feb. 26, 2022, in Orlando, Fla. ""You never think a war is going to come out of it,"" he continued. ""All of a sudden, you end up in a world war."" He added: ""This is a very dangerous period for our nation, for the country."" Just before the interview, the United States, Canada and other European allies announced additional sanctions on Russia—specifically ""selected"" Russian banks to be removed from the financial system. Trump, reacting to the sanctions, told Fox News Digital: ""They’re going to have to do more than just sanctions, I suspect."" ""But sanctions are not, you know, Putin—he understands how to avoid sanctions, and he goes through other countries,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""He goes to China as an example."" Trump, though, said the sanctions ""have to be strong, and they have to be swift, , to use a word, because that is a very powerful sanction, as you know, ."" Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference Saturday, Feb. 26, 2022, in Orlando, Fla. ""And if they’re not, I can’t imagine—it’s just going to be a question of time,"" Trump said. ""It’s a very ugly thing that's taking place. Should have never happened."" Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News Digital that China has been emboldened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in regard to its aspirations to take Taiwan. ""I do. I think that China would do that anyway,"" he said. But the former president pointed to the ""way"" the Biden administration withdrew U.S. troops and military assets from Afghanistan, calling it a ""surrender."" ""Getting out was a good thing. I had it down to two thousand soldiers,"" Trump said, referring to his decision as commander-in-chief to reduce the footprint of U.S. troops in the region. ""We were going to get out with strength and dignity, but to take the soldiers, the great Army out first— we took our Army and Marines—we took them out first to do that and leave the Americans behind, leave other people behind, leave $85 billion worth of equipment behind."" ""We had 13 young people that were killed, many that were very badly hurt in the bombing and a couple of other things the way they got out,"" Trump said, referring to the Aug. 26, 2021 suicide bombing outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul during the withdrawal that took the lives of 13 U.S. service members – including 11 Marines, one Navy sailor and one Army soldier. Eighteen other U.S. service members were wounded. The bombing also left more than 150 civilians dead. ""I really think that was the most embarrassing—one of the lowest points in the history of our country,"" Trump said. ""And President Xi and Putin, they watched that, and I think they probably came up with ideas that they didn't have before seeing it, because it was grossly incompetent."" Trump was asked if the Russian invasion of Ukraine occurred under his administration, what he would do, but told Fox News Digital that he couldn’t say ""right now."" ""Well, I tell you what, I would do things, but the last thing I want to do is say it right now, because if somebody asks me that is in a position where they can utilize whatever it is I give them,"" Trump said. ""But I certainly wouldn't want to be talking about it on television or to the media too much."" Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference Saturday, Feb. 26, 2022, in Orlando, Fla. He added: ""But there are things you can do that would be very powerful."" Trump said if Biden requested his help, he ""certainly would do that,"" but said the Biden administration is ""stuck in this situation that should not have happened, and we’re going to see how it ends up."" ""It is very sad, but there is a great amount of bravery being shown right now that’s been pretty incredible,"" Trump said. Trump would not say whether he had spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""I don’t want to say,"" he said. ""I just don’t want to say."" Meanwhile, shifting to social media, Trump, who has been banned from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat and has launched a social media company of his own, ocial, was asked for reaction on Putin’s ability to use the platforms as he wages war. ""There's death in Ukraine, and he's able to use the power of very sick people,"" Trump said of Big Tech executives. ""These are very bad people that control it."" Trump said ""what they are doing is so bad for our country."" ""Legal or not, I'm not sure,"" Trump said. ""And it gets a lot of people, we will tell you that what they've done is terrible, and we're doing Social."" ""Truth,"" Trump said. ""It’s about the truth and I think it's going to be very big, and if you look at it now, how well it's doing—people are amazed—it’s trending like, number one all over the place, and it's going to be great, and we need it."" Trump said the platform will give ""a voice,"" saying it is needed. ""Because these people, there's something wrong with them,"" Trump said. ""They’re almost, perhaps, they’re sick. Perhaps they're deranged."" Trump criticized social media companies for allowing ""stone-cold murderers and thugs and dictators at a very dangerous level"" on their platforms, but ""the President of the United States and other people are not allowed to be on."" ""It's a disgrace,"" he said. ""And you know, I had hundreds of millions of people, but I think that ocial is going to be a way of getting out our voice."" He added: ""It’s going to be very powerful."" When asked if he would use the platform he said: ""I’ll be using it. Yeah. I’ll be using it."" Fox Nation is the Featuring Sponsor of 2022.

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. was repeatedly asked Sunday by ’s George Stephanopoulos to bash former President Trump during an interview on the U.S. response to Russia invading Ukraine. Cotton urged President Biden to react with more severe measures against Vladimir Putin and send weapons to the Ukrainians, during an interview on ’s ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos."" But the Republican’s harsh assessment of the Biden administration’s handling of this crisis did not please Stephanopoulos, a former Bill Clinton aide, who spent the rest of the interview trying to get Cotton to criticize Trump. The interview started off focused on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, before becoming contentious. Sen. Tom Cotton speaks during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the conclusion of military operations in Afghanistan and plans for future counterterrorism operations on Capitol Hill. Cotton called on the president to punish Putin with more drastic sanctions, such as on Russia’s oil and gas exports. He also pressed the administration to heed his plea from ""weeks ago"" to ""rush"" weapons to the Ukrainians. ‘ ’ : ‘ ’""We can do more than prayers and hashtags and lighting up buildings, George. It's time for the president and some of our European partners to stop pussyfooting around. The financial sanctions announced last night are riddled with loopholes. I know they say they sanctioned 80% of the banks in Russia, but Vladimir Putin controls 100% of the banks in Russia. He can use the other 20% to continue to finance his war machine,"" he said, calling for more immediate assistance to Ukraine and for all Russian banks to be removed from the international payment system. But things took a turn after Cotton criticized White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki telling Stephanopoulos that the ""mistake, we all probably make"" is believing that Putin follows the ""global norms and beliefs"" the rest of the world follows. The Arkansas senator slammed this notion, saying Putin’s reasoning for invading Ukraine was ""not a surprise"" and that he perceived weakness in our leadership. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, arrive to meet at the 'Villa la Grange', in Geneva, Switzerland, June 16, 2021. ""What Vladimir Putin said on Monday night was not a surprise. He published the exact same arguments about Ukraine in an essay last summer. That's why I've been urging the administration to take the threat that Putin posed to Ukraine and international peace and stability seriously, to start imposing these sanctions weeks and months ago, to start sending these missiles and weapons and ammunition to Ukraine weeks ago,"" Cotton said. ‘ ,’ ‘ ’ But the News anchor bristled at Cotton’s condemnation of the Biden administration, pivoting to repeatedly asking for Cotton to condemn Trump's comments on Putin. ""You've never made that mistake, it's true. You've been stalwart in your opposition of Vladimir Putin. The same cannot be said for the leader of your party, Donald Trump. Last night he finally condemned the invasion but he also repeated his praise of Putin, calling him smart. Earlier in the week, he called him pretty smart. He called him savvy. He says and the U.S. are dumb. Are you prepared to condemn that kind of rhetoric from the leader of your party?"" Stephanopoulos grilled. President Joe Biden and News anchor George Stephanopoulos. But the senator refused to discuss Republicans who've been accused by the left of being weak on Russia. He recalled how Republicans supplied the Ukrainians with weapons when the last Democrat president would not. ""George, you’ve heard what I had to say about Vladimir Putin. That he's a ruthless dictator who's launched a naked, unprovoked war of aggression. Thankfully the Ukrainian army has anti-tank missiles that President Obama would not supply that we did supply last time Republicans were in charge in Washington. That's why it's so urgent that we continue to supply those weapons to Ukraine,"" Cotton responded.Frustrated, Stephanopoulos remarked, ""Why can't you condemn Donald Trump for those comments?"" Cotton said he does not ""speak on behalf of other politicians"" and if he wants to get Trump’s thoughts on Putin, he should ""have him on [his] show."" Stephanopoulos pushed Cotton to condemn Trump's compliments to Putin two more times, before asking the senator if he could still support Trump in 2024. ""George, I'm not worried about this fall's election right now, much less an election two years from now. I'm focused on the naked war of aggression that Vladimir Putin has launched in Ukraine right now. There's not a moment to lose. We can worry about electoral politics down the road,"" Cotton said.Clearly agitated, Stephanopoulos gave one last attempt as the interview wrapped. ""I simply don’t understand why you can’t condemn his praise of Vladimir Putin!"" he said.Cotton stayed on message, decrying Putin as a ""ruthless dictator for years"" that ""too many people have not taken"" as a serious threat. ""That’s why you see the images we see in Ukraine now. Where we need to focus is on stopping that aggression, supporting the Ukrainians as best we can.""",9

Social media, for now, is the forum of choice for commentary. , The Gorbachev Foundation put out a statement that read, in part, ""We declare the need for an early cessation of hostilities and the immediate start of peace negotiations. There is and cannot be anything more valuable in the world than human lives.

Even while inviting the Ukrainians to talk in Belarus, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko continued with harsh rhetoric. He said: ""What's going on now is a bed of roses. If it continues like this it will bloom. And there will be no bunker to hide in--not with the Americans not with anyone else. I wouldn't call this a war yet, it's a conflict.

Former Democrat mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel famously said to never let a serious crisis go to waste.

Kilgore doubled down on this belief that war could ""reboot"" Biden’s presidency. ""In the long run, the war may exacerbate the economic problems that are already bedeviling his administration.

""I think they've probably torn up the draft they had for the State of the Union and are realizing that issues are getting away from them,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital. . ""And that they're going to need to buckle down and do some hard work on these foreign policy issues.

U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on Russia's attack on Ukraine, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 24, 2022. Russia invaded eastern Ukraine last week following a lengthy speech by President Vladimir Putin in which he recognized the so-called Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic as independent. In his remarks, Putin argued Ukraine is historically part of Russia and the current government in Ukraine is illegitimate. U.S. lawmakers have since accused Biden of not acting quickly enough to impose sanctions on Russia before Putin's aggressive action. -- ‘ ’ With such an overseas mess, Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, expected Biden to pivot to his domestic agenda on Tuesday. ""I don't know what he was planning to talk about initially, but he's obviously going to have to focus a lot on what's going on, on the world stage,"" Jackson told Fox News Digital. ""And I doubt that he'll focus on the fact that the incompetence in his own White House has led us to where we're at right now. They could've done a lot to stop this. We're demonstrating incredible weakness globally right now and foreign affairs is just a total mess."" ""I'm sure he'll try to turn it around and talk about his intent to Build Back Better,"" he continued. ""Whatever they're going to do with that, I don't know if they're going to try to resurrect that.

""Because if he doesn't mention Ukraine at this point, he's absolutely going to have to start with that, given what's going on there. What I'd like to hear is that he's going to reinstitute domestic production of oil, which he's not going to, but that would be a great step to buffer, not only the inflation that we're seeing but the rising prices of oil and gas. We can produce our own domestic supply of that product right here in the United States, and he shut that down on day one of his presidency. That would help on so many different levels. Why are we right now bringing in Russian oil to this country? That's what I'd like to hear."" Steube said he's also like to hear the president take a ""strong stance"" against the Taliban. ""That we're going to go out there and get all our citizens out,"" the congressman said. ""We're going to go in there and do away with the $80 billion worth of military equipment of weapons that we left, but we know that that's not going to be talked about either.""

""It was Biden and his team’s patience and close consultation with European allies that has led to the extraordinary unity now on display,"" Velshi quoted from Politico. He then accused Republicans of refusing to care about national security threats posed by Russia to simply spite Biden. ""I remember a time when Republicans were about national security and global security and the threat that the Soviet Union posed and the threat that post-Soviet Russia posed. How does that get lost?"" Velshi asked.

""No, but I think you’ll see quietly, nobody in the Republican Party that is responsible wants to give Joe Biden credit because they’re all political narcissists,"" Jolly replied.

Carter, who has extensively reported on the border and immigration, told Fox News Digital at that Mayorkas is the last person that should be shouldering such a responsibility. The Department of Homeland Security has been designated the lead federal government agency for coordinating domestic preparedness and response efforts related to Russia’s war on Ukraine, the department announced Thursday. ""I think it's absolutely incredible that Alejandro Mayorkas would be put in charge of looking at the potential threats coming from Ukraine when the Biden administration has completely failed the American people on the national security of the U.S.-Mexico border. It is unacceptable,"" Carter said. - – Carter, who was recently granted exclusive access to a Texas border facility holding $10 million in captured contraband, said agents there have not been given the proper guidance, resources or clearance to do their jobs. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. Therefore, she said Mayorkas cannot effectively confront a second potential crisis, given the way he's left his agents unprepared and unable to do their jobs. ""I've been covering that border probably close to 20 years. And I have seen the evolution of what's happened at that border. And I can tell you that the national security threat is the U.S. southern border,"" she said. ""Why? Because first of all, our border patrol agents and our federal agents don't have the capability to harness their power in the right direction because they're so busy processing migrants. They can't even effectively guard the border. And they'll say that themselves. They feel like they're part of the humanitarian crisis that they are helping move people into this country illegally. That's a crazy thought."" : When asked about the media largely ignoring the crisis along the southern border, Carter responded that the situation doesn't fit the narrative for the Democratic Party. host Chris Hayes recently said that ""immigration can mean a lot of things, but it's at extremely low levels right now."" A week later, the Center for Immigration Studies analyzed census data and found the number of both illegal and legal foreign-born immigrants in the U.S. in January was the largest number recorded as far back as 1850. The analysis showed that figure rose by 1.7 million from 2021. Additionally, in the last fiscal year, deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement dropped sharply, coinciding with numerous Biden administration policies that restricted agents from arresting illegal immigrants. ""That is a perfect example -- the Chris Hayes tweet [claiming] we're going to have the lowest numbers crossing the border than we've ever seen. And then all of a sudden, there is the actual facts that come out that show it's like more than double,"" she said. ""They won't fact-check that – If you make a mistake, and everybody does … you fact-check yourself. You correct the record. But they're not correcting the record on the most important issues. Why? Because these are political narratives that suit a political party: the Democratic Party."" Carter said other mainstream outlets ""visibly"" support Democratic candidates and ""lie to the American people without hesitation.""

The New York Times claimed Sunday that President Biden was ""redefining the arc of his presidency"" following a number of policy setbacks throughout his first year in office and a sinking approval rating to one of the lowest in modern presidential history. In a piece headlined, ""10 Consequential Days: How Biden Navigated War, Covid and the Supreme Court,"" the liberal paper argued that Biden's handling of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, his nomination of Judge Ketanji Jackson as the potential first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court, and the recently announced changes to pandemic guidance were sidelining the legislative failures plaguing his presidency. : ""The dizzying events of the past week have pushed to the sidelines the congressional squabbling over President Biden’s domestic agenda, and are already redefining the arc of his presidency,"" the piece read, referencing the failure of Biden's Build Back Better agenda garnering enough support from Democrats to pass through Congress. The piece cited ""a dozen"" anonymous current and former administration officials it claimed had knowledge of Biden's goings and comings from Feb. 18 through the weekend in regard to his handling of the situation in Russia, his selection of Jackson to the nation's highest court, and the announcement of the easing of mask guidance. ""Mr. Biden’s aides say his actions in recent days were an example of the caution and consensus-building that have always been at the heart of his sales pitch to voters,"" it read, noting that his upcoming State of the Union speech received numerous edits as the situation in Russia unfolded, while still keeping ""an eye firmly fixed on Mr. Biden’s place in history."" President Joe Biden at the White House on Nov. 18, 2021 and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Dec. 4, 2021.

The piece didn't, however, mention Biden's poor approval rating, which now stands at 37% according to the latest poll, nor did it offer evidence to suggest Biden's handling of Russia, which continued with its planned invasion despite the administration's announced sanctions, would change voters' views of his job performance.",9

Haas F1 driver Nikita Mazepin is in an awkward situation. Nikita Mazepin is set to begin his second season with Haas F1. The 22-year-old Russian is the son of Dmitry Mazepin, who controls the team's sponsor Uralkali, which is based in Russia and is one of the world's largest fertilizer companies. Dmitry Mazepin met with President Vladimir Putin in January in his role as of Uralchem, which holds a controlling stake in Haas F1 sponsor Uralkali. American-owned Haas temporarily removed the Urakali name and the colors of the Russian flag from its two cars during testing last week in response to the invasion of Ukraine as it assesses the situation. ""There are legal issues we have to go through and then we see what comes out,"" team principal Gunther Steiner told Sky Sports. Haas removed Uralkali sponsorship and the colors of the Russian flag from its cars during testing in Spain last week. Haas was last among Formula One constructors in 2021 as it chose to reduce its investment ahead of the all-new car being launched this season, and Mazepin finished behind his teammate Mick Schumacher 11 of 14 times they both completed a race. If he needs to be dropped as a result of his relationship to Uralkali, Mazepin set to be replaced initially by the team's reserve driver, Pietro Fittipaldi, grandson of two-time Formula One champion Emerson Fittipaldi. ""If Nikita couldn’t drive for one or another reason, the first call would go to Pietro,"" Steiner told Speed City Broadcasting. Pietro Fittipaldi competed in the 2021 Indianapolis 500. Every F1 team has one or more reserve drivers on call in case something happens to their primary drivers. Fittipaldi has already raced twice for Haas in 2020 after then-team member Romain Grosjean was injured in a crash. ""Obviously, [Pietro has been] with us for a few years, and then we would see what we do next."" Competing in Formula One requires an Super License, which is based on experience and performance in other racing leagues, and the list of eligible drivers is relatively short.

Lady Gaga, who appeared on behalf of her film ""House of Gucci,"" revealed on the red carpet that she was ""really honored to be here"" but noted that those in Ukraine should be remembered during the glitzy affair.

""This is not the Rams,"" the 77-year-old clarified to Access Hollywood, referencing the Los Angeles football team that has the same colors. ""If ever there was a time for us to appreciate what true democracy is, I’m just so proud of what these people of this country have done,"" said the actor. Like Douglas, several attendees used accessories to show support for Ukraine. Tyler Perry, Shari Belafonte, Douglas Hodge and Jon Bernthal wore blue and yellow ribbons. Actress Greta Lee wore a yellow and blue Marc Jacobs dress. Lisa Ann Walter pinned a blue and yellow corsage to her dress. Some performers used their speeches to address the ongoing conflict.

""The president of Ukraine was a comic, you know, he was a wonderful comic performer,"" he said. ""And we should respect that for him, and to come to the presidency is amazing."" Like Cox, Michael Keaton commended the 44-year-old’s efforts.

""With all this going on in the world, it can sometimes be difficult to find light and hope. Tonight, our hearts are with our friends in Ukraine. We stand with them and pray for their safety."" Andrew Garfield also remarked that ""it’s a tricky day to celebrate."" ""Keeping what’s happening in Ukraine in our hearts, it’s weird,"" the actor admitted. ""It’s definitely odd that we are dressing up in this moment, but yeah, I’m very grateful to be here with our community – a community of love…"" , 'S J.

The Russian military assault on Ukraine went into its fifth day after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces put on increased alert, ratcheting up tensions yet further. Kyiv’s outgunned but determined troops slowed Russia’s advance and held onto the capital and other key cities — at least for the time being. Explosions and gunfire that have disrupted life since the invasion began last week appeared to subside around Kyiv overnight. Long lines formed outside supermarkets Monday as residents were allowed out of bomb shelters and homes for the first time since a curfew imposed Saturday. Exact death tolls are unclear, but Ukraine’s president says at least 16 children have been killed and another 45 wounded, among hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other casualties. Millions have fled homes or the country. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",6

Fox News host Dana Perino joined ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" Monday to preview President Biden's first State of the Union address coming while the Russia-Ukraine war rages in Eastern Europe. : President Biden got news today that the poll has him at 37% approval. That is what he is looking at. It's just not that Americans have an opinion about him, they have formed a judgment. It was a very high bar for him to clear anyway. I expect that you will see grace notes, some attempts at unity, and he'll be able to introduce to America again his Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, who had a pretty good rollout the other day. Now that said, Jesse, imagine you and your sister played monopoly all weekend. You got all the pieces out on the board and everything is going very well and then the neighbor kid comes over and kicks the board over. That's basically what Vladimir Putin did to the State of the Union speech.",0

Not a man who is strong, but a strong man. What do they rely on? They rely on the perceived public support of what they are doing, right? You know, Kim Jong-un has photos of himself in everyone’s home. It is obviously a propaganda effort. … The problem with the propaganda effort is in order to overcome the economic problem and the economics of the prisoner's dilemma, right, why it is 100 prison guards, you know, can keep 10,000 prisoners under control, the prisoners have a coordination problem. They don’t know who will agree to break out. The problem with public protest for Putin is now the public is seeing that everybody else is agreeing that Putin sucks and he is going to have a serious public perception problem on his hands which defeats the strongman agenda and his mask of strength.",0

Biden is slated to give his presidential address on the national outlook on Tuesday, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have a wish list of what the president will touch on in his speech. South Carolina Republican Rep. Ralph Norman told Fox News Digital in a Monday phone interview that he wants to see Biden highlight the ""heroism"" exuded by the Ukrainian people in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion. - ’S President Joe Biden points to the Oval Office as he arrives on Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Nov. 21, 2021. Norman also said he thinks Biden’s actions going forward will speak louder than his words at the State of the Union. ""I mean, just let Americans open up their businesses again, let Americans continue to take their mask off, let Americans in our military who don't want to sacrifice their medical freedoms not have to take a shot, let Americans be free,"" Norman said. ""Instead of putting handcuffs on us, he needs to free this country, get the gift, the shackles off of Americans."" ""I don't want words,"" he also said. ""We want action."" Rep. Ralph Norman Meanwhile, South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson said in a phone interview with Fox News Digital that he believes Biden’s ""speech will be a failure if it doesn't include the twin pillars of Ukraine and inflation."" ""The president needs to lay out a clear, cohesive and bipartisan strategy for dealing with both of those. I think the last few days has been very good on Ukraine. I think we have, although initially the action the president took, I think, was quite modest and underwhelming, I think in recent days we have been headed in the right direction,"" Johnson said, highlighting the recent sanctions on Russia’s central bank. ""With regard to inflation, I hope the president doesn't just step forward with some big government solutions,"" he also said. ""I mean, giving America deficit spending to put more money in Americans pockets to help them deal with inflation will move us in the wrong direction."" Rep. Dusty Johnson speaks at a news conference in Washington on the bipartisan emergency -19 relief bill on Dec. 21, 2020. Democrat Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine’s office pointed to an interview answer the senator gave to a similar question with the Rev. Al Sharpton. ""If I were President Biden I would start with the candid acknowledgment that the last two years have been nearly the toughest two years in most Americans' lives,"" Kaine said. ""The global pandemic, which has hit America hard… I think President Biden should say, ‘Let’s just be honest folks, the last two years have been among the toughest in modern American history,'"" the senator continued. ""However, numbers are coming down, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is suggesting, because of vaccinations and other things, we can start to shed masks not only outdoors but indoors in much of the country."" Kaine also said the president should highlight ""strong economic trends, job growth, wage growth, growth, and an economic challenge, inflation, that we have to get a hold of. But I believe, even in these tough times we can see a little bit of a sense of uplift as we get not past , but we start to live more normally with ."" Sen. Tim Kaine speaks during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington on April 27, 2021. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said that he is looking ""forward"" to the president's Tuesday address, saying Biden ""has enjoyed robust support from progressives"" and that he is ""proud of what Democrats have accomplished."" ""Since he’s taken office, we’ve passed the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, and created 6.6 million jobs,"" Khanna said. ""I expect a central part of President Biden’s speech to be focused on Ukraine. His Administration has unified our allies in condemning Putin’s invasion and imposing strong sanctions."" ""This is a dangerous moment in history. We need to stand firmly with Ukrainians in the defense of their nation and provide them with weapons and humanitarian relief,"" he continued. ""When it comes to his domestic agenda, I hope President Biden speaks directly to Americans in places that have been left out."" Khanna said he believes den ""should talk about the importance of passing the America Act,"" noting that ""technology infrastructure and manufacturing in the United States to compete with rivals like China has bipartisan support and needs to be a priority."" A White House official told Fox News Digital in a statement that during the State of the Union address Tuesday, Biden ""will make a strong case that the Biden-Harris economic strategy to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out is producing historic results, and he will lay out his plan for the work ahead."" ""He will underscore that during his first year in office, in large part due to the American Rescue Plan, entrepreneurship and business investment rebounded, and the economy achieved its fastest job growth in American history, the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years, and a faster recovery than every other advanced economy in the G7,"" the spokesperson said. ""During his first State of the Union Address, the president will also make clear that there is more work to do to rebuild the economy toward resilience, security and sustainability,"" they continued. ""Specifically, the president will lay out his plan to lower costs for American families while continuing an historically strong economic recovery."" Biden’s State of the Union address comes amid several national crises, including the compounding situation at the southern border, an opioid overdose epidemic taking the lives of young Americans across the nation, and rampant inflation only made worse by what’s going on overseas. Foreign policy appears to be the Achilles’ heel of the Biden administration, with the president’s speech also occurring amid the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine. Republicans are expected to give their rebuttal to the State of the Union on Tuesday, highlighting the state of America under Biden’s policies. In an odd move trying to undercut Biden, ""Squad"" member Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will also be giving a rebuttal speech for the progressives.",13

Brian Mast, R-Fla., on the divide amongst Russians and the military to be at war with Ukraine Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., spoke to ""The Faulkner Focus"" Monday on the ongoing war in Ukraine and how Russians are divided on the war. He also explained what needs to be conveyed to Russia's Vladimir Putin about how the war will likely end. : . : I think you see a divide in the will of the Russian people to wage all-out war on their neighbors, on people that you could say, are that close to them in language and so many other ways. This wasn't the will of their people. There's division amidst the military, and I think what you need to see from the Foreign Affairs Committee and from those that are in talks in Belarus and other places is laying it out to Vladimir Putin that we realize how he began this war. But no matter how long it takes, this is how this war will end because of his nuclear saber-rattling. There will be a Russian nuclear demilitarization. They will return Crimea. There will be an unconditional surrender to Zelenskyy and a removal of their troops from Ukraine. And in my opinion, there should be a demilitarized zone along all Russian borders. This needs to be the way that it ends. No matter how long it takes and maybe add on to that as we see those sanctions going on with banks and currency and , we probably need to go out there and let the Russian government know that Russian energy is not going to be an export that is desired by Turkey or Germany or anyone else. That has to be a commitment by Europe to not use Russian energy for the next generation. Otherwise, it would be like sanctioning a farmer without sanctioning their crops.",0
2022-02-28,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rooftop-revelations-pastor-brooks-reflects-on-his-100-days-on-the-roof-and-gods-timing,Rooftop Revelations: Pastor Brooks reflects on his 100 days on the roof and God’s timing,"– From a rooftop in the South Side of Chicago, Pastor Corey Brooks led a 100-day vigil to build a community center to transform the South Side of Chicago into a thriving community. On the 100th day, he wished to share his views with his audience and to reflect on his experience and God's timing. What follows has been lightly edited. We strongly encourage you to watch the accompanying video so you may hear the pastor in his own words. For the past 100 days and 99 bitter cold nights, I've been camped out on top of these eight shipping containers on the South Side of Chicago at a location where our church hopes to build a new community center. My plan was to spend 100 nights upon the rooftop to raise funds for the center while also raising awareness of the plague of violence in Chicago. 100 days upon the roof in Chicago's winter, I figured would be more than enough to raise the funds to build a community center. But my timing, as is often the case, was not God's timing. : While fundraising is going well and we have been blessed by the generosity of so many donors, we've not yet met our goal. For the past few weeks, I have sensed that God was telling me to stay up on the roof until the fundraising for this project was complete. I know it was God's voice telling me to remain on the roof because it certainly wasn't my heart's desire. Temperatures have gotten down to minus 20 degrees with the wind chill factor, and I have been eagerly looking at my calendar, counting the days until I would come down from this rooftop. During my time up here, I've invited s of major corporations, religious leaders, college presidents and politicians to spend a night camping out with me. Those who have camped out with me have seen firsthand why our community is in need of more resources and better programs for our youth. The Woodlawn neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago is known for gun violence. In fact, during my time up on this roof, I've heard countless gunshots fired with near constant sounds of police sirens waiting in the background. This is a community where nearly 50% of the households make less than $25,000 a year. Poverty is rampant and fatherlessness is rampant. Our feelings are hopelessness. Hopelessness and fear are the primary emotions that compel young men in Chicago to join violent gangs in the first place. But feelings of rootedness in a relationship with Jesus, a strong sense of self-worth and ties to the community are the three best ways to prevent growth of gangs and to help young men transition from being violent gang members to productive members of our society. This pervasive hopelessness on the South Side of Chicago is precisely why we feel so called to create this community center, so God can transform even the most hopeless individuals. And in my 22 years of serving as a pastor in this community, I've seen the life-changing transformation that only God can orchestrate. I worked with former gang members to help them receive training, to start a new career and even more importantly, a new life with positions in construction, the lawn service industry and the restaurant industry. Often, these men are desperate to be given a second chance. Through our church, New Beginnings Church and Project H.O.O.D., we've given them that opportunity to get a fresh start in life. This vision for our future community center is simple. With an 85,000 square foot center, we will be able to expand the programs and services to more individuals. Our plan is that this community center will become the center of our community, providing hope and a future to a forgotten neighborhood. We will offer tools to children and to young adults to reach their God-given potential. We will have classes and job trainings and all of these financial literacy trainings to improve them. We'll have gym facilities, music facilities, art facilities. These spaces will be used to hold community meetings, and we'll distribute necessary care and food and diapers to the community. These are not handouts the way the government carelessly scatters resources. These items are all given as recognition that we can change people, that we can help them to change their lives, that we can change the cycles of poverty and helplessness. The needs of our community are vast, in large part because the government has, for decades, created in us a sense of dependency. The government at all levels — state, local, federal — has failed our community entirely. And our intention is to step in where government has systematically failed to meet our individual needs. The initial plan that we started was to break ground on the center in the spring, and Lord willing, we will eventually reach that goal with your help. God's timing certainly isn't my timing. As we learn in the book of Isaiah, His thoughts are not our thoughts, and His ways are not our ways. God calls us to trust Him even when we cannot understand current circumstances and to be patient even when we want to accelerate work in His name. These are two of the recurring lessons God has taught me throughout my life. So for now, I will remain camped out on this roof. In the words of Nehemiah, as he worked to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, ""I can't come down, not until the work is finished and not until the job is complete, not until the purpose is fulfilled and God has completed what he has started."" I want to thank all of you over this last 100 days for being so faithful, for being so generous. I'm so appreciative for the rest of my life to Fox News for giving me this platform. I want to say thank you to Eli Steele, who has produced such a magnificent show every single day. Thank you to Terrell Allen for staying out in the cold on some cold, bitter nights so that we can communicate a truth that needs to be told from a perspective that is seldom heard, from voices that you seldom hear from, from the South Side of Chicago. And I'm reminded when they said when Jesus was born ""Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?"" Well, sometimes I feel the same way about the South Side of Chicago. People are asking, ""Can any good thing come from the South Side of Chicago?"" And my answer is positively, absolutely, yes. See Pastor Corey Brooks' previous Rooftop Revelations.

Several lawmakers attending in Orlando are slamming Big Tech companies for their crackdown of conservatives while allowing Russia to launch a viral campaign in the midst of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called the double standard ""pretty remarkable"" since these tech giants ""literally allowing individuals doing an actual brutal coup and murdering their neighbors to be on social media."" ""President Trump is blocked, the leadership of Hamas is not. President Trump is blocked, the leadership of Iran is actually not blocked. You've got President Trump is blocked, you've got leaders in Nicaragua that have led through an actual coup and a transition in their government, and they're not blocked,"" Lankford told Fox News Digital. ""Over and over and over again, I can walk you through the world leaders that are brutal dictators that have led an actual coup in their country, and they're still on social media. President Trump still continues to be able to be blocked on this."" 'S A ‘ ,' ""This is a preference thing,"" Lankford continued. ""This goes back to Apple's guide. Apple, in their guide, their user guide says literally, they don't allow things on that they consider creepy. It's a totally subjective piece. Facebook has on there that they don't allow illegal activity unless it's illegally crossing the border, then they do allow that. So there's all this double standard that actually happens. It's really a subjective issue of the far left folks that are in Silicon Valley. If they like it, they allow it. If they don't like it, they block it. And they seem to like Hamas, they seem to like these other dictators worldwide, they just don't like President Trump. So they block him."" Twitter office building in San Francisco. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., called for regulating Big Tech, touting his own legislation he says ""makes complete sense"" but not a ""single Democrat"" has supported it. ""What we will do is we regulate Big Tech, we treat them like a common carrier. That would require them to give nondiscriminatory access,"" Hagerty told Fox News Digital. ""And if they want to come in and censor, they're going to have to inexplicitly state the criteria. Today, in Section 230, they're allowed to come in and have a very broad criteria because they use the language that says or otherwise… ‘offensive.’ And they are interpreting that very broadly to basically say anything that's conservative is offensive."" ""It's amazing to me that this is the path that Big Tech seems to choose where authoritarians are welcome to use Big Tech, where the Ayatollah can call for death for America, yet they'll censor a President of the United States,"" Hagerty added. , , Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., similarly took aim at Section 230, which he said was ""designed to promote more free speech"" and has instead ""created a safe haven for Facebook and Twitter"" to suppress conservatives. ""Do I think that when somebody invades another country, pulling them down off of as many social media platforms as possible makes sense, of course. But I think the more mundane has to be that when in doubt, free speech should be allowed everywhere. And I'm willing to have reprehensible free speech rather than have less people able to speak their mind,"" Issa said. Russian President Vladimir Putin Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., equated the ""silencing"" or ""canceling"" of conservatives on social media to ""book burning."" ""We've seen it with socialism. They always felt that they have to get rid of everybody's ideas, and that's exactly what they're doing,"" Scott said. 'So we've got to stand up. We've got to hold Big Tech accountable. If they're going to be publishers, if they're going to pick and choose what they want on their sites. Then they've got to be held accountable."" Scott continued, ""And you can't allow thugs like Maduro and Venezuela and the Ayatollah on it, on a site and then not, look, you know, conservative in American society doesn't make any sense, but people are being canceled all over this country because they have a different view than it was some of the Big Tech want."" ‘' , Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., blasted Big Tech as a ""joke"" for allowing Russia's ""disinformation"" on its platforms while barring conservatives. ""Honestly, I think Big Tech is a joke at this point. You know, if you were going to censor conservatives with their thoughts about, you know, vaccines or their thoughts about, you know, the 2020 elections, but you're not going to take the Russians off the platform who are literally putting out disinformation- not misinformation, disinformation about what's happened in Ukraine? I think it's a joke,"" Donalds told Fox News Digital. ""I think it's atrocious. They need to actually be consistent. If they were consistent, nobody would have a problem. But the issue is that they're being politically subjective simply because, in my view, they support Democrats and a liberal ideology in a liberal agenda."" The Facebook app. Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., told Fox News Digital, ""We face throttling on social media all across the board but I believe when you start seeing that Donald Trump is kicked off social media right now, you literally have Vladimir Putin, who we've all seen videos of his fighter jets literally bombing homes… You hear young children screaming in the background. We see old women whose faces have been marred by the bombs dropped by Vladimir Putin. We see his soldiers posting videos, selfie videos of them sending missile salvos into civilian-held areas."" - : ‘’ , He added, ""We realize that social media doesn't actually care about justice. They don't actually care about doing what's right. They just care about progressing with their woke ideology. And so I believe we need to get all social media back and under control and break up Big Tech monopolies because they have far too much control."" Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., said it's ""almost incomprehensible"" that Big Tech cracks down to ""hush"" conservative voices while they've ""amplified the Ayatollah and Vladimir Putin and all these despots all over the world."" ""And right now in Ukraine, where we need to see what's going on, the images that are being sent missiles are striking homes with mothers and babies in their arms. I mean, this needs to get out. And so any of the social media that are suppressing the truth of what Russia is doing in Ukraine, stop it. We need the truth,"" Green said. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga, expressed confidence that once Republicans take back the House and Senate following the 2022 midterms, ""significant legislation"" will be passed that will ""bring back our First Amendment rights of free speech without harassment and fear coming from Big Government or Big Tech.""

2022-02-28,https://www.foxnews.com/media/gordon-chang-biden-feeble-response-russia-bolster-china,Gordon Chang: Biden’s feeble response to Russia will bolster China’s attempt to ‘destabilize the world’,"‘The Biden administration has just failed to protect the interest of the United States,’ Chang said , Fla. – Author Gordon G. Chang warns that President Biden’s lack of significant action against Russia will help China’s efforts to ""marginalize the United States"" as Beijing is closely monitoring the administration’s ineffective response to the invasion of Ukraine. ""China wants to destabilize the world. It certainly wants to marginalize the United States and Russia is doing Beijing’s bidding,"" Chang told Fox News Digital backstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference following his appearance on the main stage. ‘’ , 'S 'S ""That’s why Beijing has announced all of these no-limits partnerships, and we’ve heard all of these commodities deals recently. $117.5 billion of new oil and gas arrangements that was announced February 4,"" he continued. ""Just a couple of days ago we had 100 million metric tons of coal to China. Basically, Beijing is financing Russian expansionism because it’s good for China because it makes sure that the United States is preoccupied in Europe."" Last week, Sergey Mochalnikov, the head of the Russian Energy Ministry, announced a pact that will add to an already lucrative deal Russia signed with India in Nov. 2021 to supply 40 million tons of coal. Russian news outlet , which is owned by the government, reported on the deal. Chang also warns that China ""likes to see the United States humbled"" and the current administration is making things easy for them. ""Biden is not defending Ukraine and Europe the way he should be,"" Chang said. ""Beijing is watching very closely what the United States does."" ’S ’S ‘ ’: China leader Xi Jinping wants to ""destabilize the world,"" according to Gordon G. Chang. Chang noted that there was an onslaught or propaganda coming from Beijing last summer following Biden’s botched withdraw from Afghanistan. ""How the United States couldn’t win wars anymore, how when China invaded Taiwan that the island would fall within hours and the U.S. military would not come to help,"" he said. ""So, clearly they’re watching U.S. responses to Ukraine."" Chinese leader Xi Jinping has suggested the nation would take control of Taiwan in the near future. ""This does create an opportunity for Xi Jinping, who otherwise might have been deterred by the United States. Now, he sees the United States not using its power, so therefore, there is this opening that Xi Jinping is starting to perceive,"" Chang said. Meanwhile, there have been reports that Biden recently shared intelligence with China, which quickly shared it with Russia. : Gordon G. Chang feels President Biden’s lack of significant action against Russia will help China’s efforts to ""marginalize the United States"" as Beijing is closely monitoring the administration’s ineffective response to the invasion of Ukraine. ""I can’t understand why the Biden administration thought that China would keep U.S. intelligence from Russia. They just announced their no-limits partnership,"" Chang said. ""This is something where we believe China should calculate its interests in one way and therefore, we believe Beijing, in fact, does. But, no, it’s clear that Beijing believes that its interests are with Russia, not with the United States, so this is a failure of the Biden administration to understand Beijing’s foreign policy."" Chang said Moscow and Beijing have a ""solid, stable"" relationship, at least for the time being. 'S ‘ ’ ; ""They’re closer than allies,"" he said. ""It is something that is directed against the United States…. At this moment, China and Russia are working very closely together to destabilize the world and to move against the United States."" Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""doing Beijing’s bidding,"" according to Gordon G. Chang. While Chang is concerned about Russia’s relationship with China, he suspects that the United States will prevail – but only if Biden steps up to the plate. ""The U.S. is much more powerful than Russia. It is much more powerful than China. And it is much more powerful than Russia and China together,"" Chang said. ""The problem is that the Biden administration is not willing to use U.S. power to protect not only the international system but also to protect the United States."" On Sunday, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin that there is no reason to doubt the validity of reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin has put his nuclear forces on an elevated alert status.

Experts weigh in,"'Outnumbered' panelists discuss Ukrainians' resolve to fight Russian forces and President Zelenskyy's leadership. President Biden was quick to close down the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv as Russians invaded Ukraine, but there is debate on whether this was the right foreign policy move. The U.S. closed its embassy on Feb. 14. The Russian invasion of Ukraine began 10 days later on Feb. 24. Several experts weighed in on the president’s move to so quickly close up shop in Kyiv, but were split on whether the move was a sign of prudence or weakness. James Jay Carafano, a vice president at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin viewed the move as ""a sign of weakness."" , , : President Biden's decision to evacuate the embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, so early has experts divided. ""Truth be told the U.S. response was largely shaped by the disaster of the withdrawal from Afghanistan,"" Carafano said in a Monday email. ""The administration approached the crisis in Ukraine with an incremental, risk-averse response. ""They did want to get caught with photos of a Saigon-like moment in a pullout of Kyiv,"" Carafano continued. ""There is no question that Putin could well have interpreted this approach as a sign of weakness."" Meanwhile, Georgetown professor of government and foreign service Matthew Kroenig dubbed the decision a ""hard call"" in a Monday email to Fox News Digital, but said he believes the move by Biden was a prudent one. People gather for a Stand With Ukraine Rally in Times Square on Feb. 24, 2022 in New York City. ""It is a hard call. On one hand, it would be nice if the U.S. embassy in Kyiv remained opened as a show of American support of, and confidence in, the Ukrainian government as it stands up to the Russian invasion,"" Kroenig, a Vandenberg Coalition advisory board member, said. ""On the other hand, it would be irresponsible to risk the lives of U.S. diplomats by forcing them to remain in a war zone without adequate protection,"" he continued. ""We all remember the Benghazi incident as an example of what can go wrong when diplomatic security is not prioritized."" Kroenig said that on balance, ""it was the correct and prudent move to go ahead and shut down the U.S. embassy in Kyiv."" Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow on Feb. 14, 2022. ""The lives of American diplomats take precedence over a symbolic show of support to the Ukrainians,"" he added. ""After all, I am sure [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy values our Stingers and Javelins more highly than our diplomats for the challenges he faces right now."" Kroenig's fellow Vandenberg Coalition advisory board member and former acting Under Secretary of State Nathan Sales agreed, calling ""the decision to draw down our embassy"" in the Ukrainian capital ""regrettable,"" but ""necessary to protect our diplomats serving on the front lines."" ""The Russian army fights dirty. Look at the carnage in Syria and you’ll have an idea of what the Kremlin is capable of in Ukraine,"" Sales said in a Monday email. ""We’re already seeing reports that Russian forces are indiscriminately attacking civilian areas across the country, and we simply can’t expose our people to that risk."" ""That said, it would be a powerful gesture of solidarity with the Ukrainian people to leave behind a small team of volunteers to run our embassy and engage with the Ukrainian government,"" he continued. Ukraine has seen nearly a week of fighting since the Russian invasion ordered by Putin began. The U.S. began the closure of the Kyiv embassy quickly as Russian forces built up at the Ukrainian border. Since Russia’s invasion of Kyiv, the U.S. and other nations have imposed economic sanctions that have crippled the ruble and made it worth less than a penny.",22

This was coupled with data from respondents for other issues such as immigration and inflation – all below 40% approval.

He has had that imperial ambition since he took office. What he saw in the last six months is a perception of weakness and opportunity. He saw our withdrawal from Afghanistan and began building up these troops on the border of Ukraine a few weeks later. He also saw a long series of one-sided concessions that President Biden gave to him and I believe that's why he calculated them so that he could go for the jugular now in Ukraine which is what he always wanted to do. … What I hope President Biden will do tonight is announce we’ll have no more half measures on sanctions.

It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine, so basically that’s wrong.""

2022-03-01,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-how-did-we-get-here,Tucker: Defense of Ukraine's democracy has led to an erosion of our own,"Fox News host gives his take on the U.S. response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' No sane American approves of what Russia has done in Ukraine. We certainly don't and we don't know anyone who does. On Twitter, you see Democrats pretending that their political opponents are responsible for the invasion and somehow support it. So, Joe Biden and his staff so mismanaged the world that Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine after Biden told us for months he could prevent that from happening, and yet all of it is your fault. So, that's a slanderous lie. In this country, virtually everyone understands that the invasion of Ukraine is bad. It's bad for us and for the world and Vladimir Putin is bad too. So, effectively in America, those are settled facts. We can stop debating them. The question is: What do we do next? Vladimir Putin's badness doesn't absolve us of our responsibility to think clearly about how to protect this country and the rest of the free world, in that order. : Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu at the Kremlin, in Moscow on February 14, 2022. In fact, Putin's badness makes wise decision-making in the United States more important than ever and yet at the same time, it makes wise decision-making harder to achieve. It's not easy to see the long view when you're angry. A writer called Tanner Greer wrote a piece this morning, which you should read. It's entitled, ""Pausing at the Precipice."" Greer began by pointing out that Russia has obviously earned our content. Most Americans now despise Vladimir Putin, and that's understandable. They're outraged, but moral outrage is not enough. Moral outrage is not a foreign policy. In fact, Greer writes, moral outrage can be counterproductive. It's clarifying, but here's the downside. ""A righteous reaction may be a dangerous one...In the field of power politics, it is outcomes, not intentions, that matter most. Failure to slow down and examine the assumptions and motivations behind our choices may lead to decisions that feel right in the moment, but fail to safeguard our interests, secure our values, or reduce the human toll of war in the long run."" Exactly. Nicely put. Another way to express it would be this: Our leaders could easily turn this tragic and volatile moment into a historic disaster. They've done it before. As of tonight, here are the two main things we ought to be worried about going forward: First, and most obviously, this war could get much worse than it already is. We could see many Americans die. Joe Biden is telling us he will not commit American troops to Ukraine. Biden also claimed he opposed vaccine mandates. So is he telling the truth? Even if he is telling the truth about his intentions in this case, Biden can't see the future. Biden has no idea what will happen tomorrow or next week, much less next year. Nobody does. We do know that already many in Washington are pushing for a hot war with nuclear-armed Russia. They're demanding a no-fly zone over Ukraine. That means American forces would shoot down Russian jets in Ukrainian airspace and also take out radar installations and other facilities within Russia itself. Not surprisingly, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on board with this. Why wouldn't he be? He's asked Joe Biden for an American-enforced no-fly zone, but as we said, many in Congress are for it, too. Here's Adam Kinzinger: . : I think this is time where we need to, at the invitation of Ukraine, declare Ukraine a no-fly zone enforced by and the United States. We certainly have the capability to do that. The airspace is still contested by the Ukrainians and we could certainly shut down Russian air operations even if we don't directly engage Russian troops on the ground. ’S , ""We can shut down Russian air operations even if we don't directly engage Russian troops on the ground."" So that's a lie. It's hard to overstate how dishonest Kinzinger's claim is. Shooting down Russian planes and taking out radar installations would, by definition, entail engaging Russian troops. If Vladimir Putin is even half as evil and crazy as they tell us he is, and he may be, that could easily spiral into nuclear conflict. So, you would only suggest that if you had nothing to lose, and Adam Kinzinger, of course, he doesn't. His political career is over. He's disgraced. He has literally nothing to lose. But many of us have a lot to lose—our country. We have children. So, we should pause before we do that, but no pausing allowed. Adam Kinzinger thinks you're a traitor if you're worried about where this might go. ""This breathlessness over nukes is mind-blowing,"" Kinzinger wrote over the weekend— nothing bad will happen. And maybe nothing bad will happen, but something very bad could happen, and it could happen fast. Adults know that. Anyone with experience knows that. Watch any war in history. And yet tonight, amazingly some of those adults, and they are adults, favor this anyway. Two former Supreme allied commanders of , Wes Clark and Philip Breedlove are pushing for armed confrontation with the Russian military. In an interview with Foreign Policy Magazine, Breedlove was honest enough to acknowledge that a no-fly zone would amount to ""an act of war,"" and it would. Thank you for saying so out loud, but Breedlove said he's for it anyway. , so this is the moment when a functioning news media would step in and start to ask basic questions about what happens next. War with Russia, fine. What does that mean, exactly? How far is the United States and its population, who would fight that war, prepared to take this conflict and to what end? Once we start bombing Russia, will Putin withdraw his forces from Ukraine? What will be left of Ukraine by that point? How are we sure that Putin, who we say is deranged, won't go nuclear if a war with him begins? And then, among many other questions, what will China's role in this war be? Thanks to the efforts of the Biden White House, China is now Vladimir Putin's strongest ally. The Chinese have just signed a long-term energy deal with Russia. They now have skin in the game. Russia will be powering China's economy going forward. Good job, Biden White House. But because that's true, how sure we that the Chinese will stay out of a war? ‘’ ‘’ , Russian President Vladimir Putin gives his annual state of the nation address in Manezh in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, March 1, 2018. How do we know they won't take down our digital infrastructure, which they seem to some great extent to control in this country… etc? You can think of many questions, but reporters aren't asking any of them. Asking questions is now immoral. Richard Engel, who knows better, he's the chief foreign correspondent at , is now demanding that American troops fight the Russian army. It's a moral imperative. ""A massive Russian convoy is about 30 miles from Kyiv, the / could likely destroy it, but that would be direct involvement against Russia and risk everything. Does the West watch in silence as it rolls?"" And of course, the answer is implied. We can't watch in silence. That would be immoral. If you're a good person, you will support a war that could very easily turn into a nuclear conflict. Again, this is moral blackmail. No one in America takes pride at the sight, feels anything but revulsion at the sight, of Russian troops within Ukraine. It's wrong. It's destabilizing to the world. It is, in fact, against our values, but how we respond is the question. Thoughtfully, has to be the answer unless we're prepared to risk massive consequences. Now Richard Haass, who is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, would under normal circumstances, be exactly the man you would go to for a wise and reasoned perspective on what to do next. That's his job. Whatever you think of the Council on Foreign Relations, and we don't think much, they're not a radical organization. Their job is to think through the consequences of action. But not anymore. Richard Haass is foursquare in favor of a hot war with Russia. He's calling for ""regime change in Moscow"" because no doubt they'll greet us as liberators. What could go wrong? Here's Richard Haass: : We need now a response of necessity to his war of choice and there's got to be to raise the economic costs at home, to raise the military costs on the ground. I hate to be so blunt, but the most vulnerable thing that...Putin's vulnerable to is dead Russian soldiers. So, we have to make sure Ukraine has the means to...resist. When did a guy that irresponsible take over the Council on Foreign Relations? And of course, that's not his real job, the Council on Foreign Relations, his real job is being a cable news pundit, and that's kind of the problem with the level of discourse around this war. The problem is that when real people with jobs that convey actual authority start talking like cable news guests, things could go sideways very fast. ""Dead Russian soldiers."" : So it's hardly a defense of Vladimir Putin to point out once again that a shooting war with Russia could have massive consequences for us because it's not just Russian soldiers who would die. Americans would die too, potentially many of them. And, by the way, it's not all certain we would win that war. Sorry, it's not. Ask anyone who's familiar with the current state of readiness of the U.S. military. Is victory a foregone conclusion? Is this the roll into Baghdad? No, it's not. This is not Saddam Hussein we're talking about. So again, the point is, are we ready for all of this? We're moving down a path that could result in the destruction of the United States. Americans may be mad at Putin, understandably, but they're wary of where our leaders are taking this next. A new poll, for example, shows a strong majority of Americans, speaking of democracy, oppose direct military action against Russia. Are they all traitors? Are they all pro-Putin? Probably not. At the very least, they would like, and we could use, a sober national conversation about the potential consequences of where people like Richard Haass are taking us now. That's the opposite of what we're getting. Instead, we're getting buffoons like Adam Kinzinger sitting in his office making bellicose noises on social media. Just the other day, Kinzinger posted images on Twitter of Ukrainian Air Ace called the Ghost of Kyiv. He downed Russian MiGs left and right. Well, turns out the whole thing was a hoax, but of course, Adam Kinzinger had no idea because he knows nothing. ""The #ghostofKyiv has a name and he has absolutely owned the Russian Air Force,"" he tweeted. Imagine a sitting member of Congress tweeting about a war like it's a cable news segment. Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, listens during a business meeting of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, Oct. 19, 2021. ""He absolutely owned the Russian Air Force."" Really? Get some respect. People are dying, buffoon. Kinzinger then attached an obviously photoshopped image of the comedian, Sam Hyde, sitting in the cockpit of a fighter jet. Sam Hyde, for the record, is not a Ukrainian fighter...he is, once again, a comedian. That was Adam Kinzinger. These are the people pushing us toward a new world war. So, at the very least, let's pause and think this through. That seems fair and as we do that, it is also worth considering what's happening here in the United States, concurrent with this war and justified by this war and by that, we are speaking of the assault on civil liberties now underway. It would be ironic if a defense of democracy, on the other side of the world, led to an erosion of democracy here and yet that seems to be where we're heading. ‘ ,’ , You'll notice that the moment that Russian troops rolled across the border into Ukraine, Democrats wasted no time in attacking not just Putin, but their political opponents in this country. What did they have to do with it? Isn't war the moment for unity? We're all in this together, but they leverage this war and the human suffering that inevitably entails to make partisan points. One regular, in one of the stranger moments you'll see on television said the whole conflict was the result of a plot engineered by Vladimir Putin's mole, who happened to be the former president of the United States. , : Trump was installed as the president of the United States in order to weaken the alliances that were preventing Putin from achieving his goals— alliances like , our relationship with our European partners, our relationship with Ukraine. Trump was put in as a bulldozer. , so we spent maybe three years holding up the lunacy of the Russiagate people and the lying as evidence that maybe they shouldn't have a meaningful effect on our national conversation about politics and yet somehow, through a very unfortunate confluence of events, those very same unbalanced people are now having a measurable effect on our foreign policy and if you think we're overstating the lunacy, try to follow the logic here. This is what she just told us. So Donald Trump, that would be Putin's man in the White House, tells Europe not to become dependent upon Russian oil, as he did, and to pay more for their own military defense, which he also did and was scoffed at, by the way. And yet, for some reason, Putin then waits to invade Ukraine until his man in the White House is gone and playing golf in Florida and now it is Donald Trump's fault that Europe is dependent on Russia for energy. It was all part of Putin's plan. Republicans wanted this to happen all along. You can imagine viewers, the ones sat through years of this, nodding along ""yes."" Now the pee tape makes sense. What's scary about this is that it's not confined to . The overlap between guests shouting nonsensical partisan talking points and true conspiracy theories and Democratic policy-makers is profound. So Democratic lawmakers now pretending there's a large and dangerous fifth column in the United States working for Vladimir Putin, which there is not. And as always, they're talking about themselves. Rep. Eric Swalwell delivers remarks during the House Judiciary Committee markup of H.R. 7120, the ""George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020,"" on Capitol Hill on June 17, 2020 in Washington, . Eric Swalwell, for example, he recently took the maximum possible campaign donation from a lobbyist for Nord Stream 2 . Now that's the company making the pipeline that will give Russia greater control over Europe's energy grid and from which the Russian government profits. So. Eric Swalwell is taking money from the Russians and by the way, this is a guy who had sex with a Chinese spy. Has he had sex with Russian spies? We don't know, but you'll notice the one guy who probably shouldn't be calling other people traitors, as he takes money from Russian energy interests, is whipping around and accusing everyone else of rooting for the Russians. : We have Republicans who are rooting for Russia and that makes it very hard for President Biden to get the whole country to go along when Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo and Tucker Carlson are rooting for Russians and that's being replayed on Russia to rally Russians for this cause. You know, it's such an awful thing to say. We hesitated even to play that. It's very common. You hear it every day. The question is: Why are they saying that? It doesn't make sense, but it makes political sense. It is an effort to cover their own tracks. Our Foreign policy establishment failed to constrain Vladimir Putin. To bring you back to ancient history like a week ago, they were telling us that sanctions and arming the Ukrainian military would prevent a Russian invasion. Now, they were wrong about that. They've been wrong many times, most recently in Afghanistan and in fact, now that we're casting blame, if there is any single American who deserves scorn and yes, blame for the invasion of Ukraine, it would be Joe Biden. Of course, it was his job, self-described job, to prevent it. But of course, they won't admit that. Instead, they're attacking you and they're doing it with partisan goals in mind. Democrats plan to use the Ukraine invasion, this would become very obvious in the last three days, in the very same way they used January 6th. So bad event takes place. No one really is for it. No one defended the riot on January 6th. We certainly didn't. But history is written immediately for partisan ends. So then you take the hysteria ginned up over that event, some of it legitimate, by the way, people have a right to be upset, and you use that to purge the country of the Democratic Party's political opponents. So what do they really hate? Well, listen to them. They hate populist politics. They hate populist politics in this country far more than they hate Vladimir Putin. So they're using this opportunity, this war in Eastern Europe, to shut down domestic dissent in the United States and you're seeing it as always in our allies first. : ’S ‘’ Several of them, including Canada, have banned journalists who don't agree with their view of the war. Again, if we're going to protect democracy, that should start at home and democracy is defined, literally defined, by the tolerance of the regime for dissent. But no dissent is allowed. So they've pulled off the airwaves in Canada, we did that long ago, and that led Mother Jones Magazine to ask this question today: ""Both and Sputnik air in the United States, too."" Untrue, but whatever they don't know. ""Will Biden follow suit and crackdown on pro-Russia disinformation? If he does, U.S. cable companies will also need to scrutinize media outlets like Fox News, whose shows— Tucker Carlson's in particular— have parodied pro-Russia talking points."". , so Putin invades Ukraine, self-evidently a tragedy bad for the United States, and we're using that as a justification because we care so much about democracy to shut down any news organization, any journalist who questions the Democratic Party? . How did we get here anyway? How corroded have these people become that they're calling for government censorship of dissent and telling us their defenders of democracy? That's just the beginning. Anyone who supports voter I.D. laws is a Kremlin agent, too. You're seeing how they're going to use this? Here's Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Lee to explain: : We talked about the fact that the invasion, the assault on Ukraine, was an assault on democracy. Barbara took the time to talk about assaults on our democracy in our own country. . : The fight for democracy is taking place throughout the world. It's not only in Ukraine, but it's in our own country, and we've seen this through the campaigns of misinformation and disinformation. We see this happening in Ukraine. The fact that now we see those at times take away the voting rights of people of color, of African-Americans, of young people, of seniors, of the disabled. On, February 18, Nancy Pelosi speaks at the Munich Security Conference in Bavaria, Munich. You know, it's not even worth parsing the logic of something like that. You can only feel deep sadness that the people you just saw represent you in our Legislature, but by the way, as long as we're punishing people who are allied with hostile foreign interests, just to restate the obvious, China is now Russia's strongest ally in this war and that has real implications for people like, I don't know Nancy Pelosi, whose family has gotten rich from China or the entire American financial sector, or Hollywood, or all the people who are now profiting from Vladimir Putin's closest ally. Will they divest of those investments? We'll see. But in the meantime, you should be very aware that there are partisan forces trying to use the war in Ukraine to accomplish political objectives here domestically and gain more power for themselves. It's not just about voting rights or shutting down Fox News. It's about shutting you up personally, your ability to express yourself and if you doubt that, you should know that Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia just wrote a letter to his donors, the tech monopolies demanding that they, ""restrict the spread of Russian propaganda."" He did not define the term ""Russian propaganda"" and as a show that has been accused of disseminating it repeatedly, we can tell you we're all sensitive on the topic and you should be too. So, Warner went on television recently to report that his donors and Big Tech quickly complied with his demand. : You sent letters on Friday to our leading social media companies: Meta, which runs Facebook, Alphabet, Reddit, asking them to take action to prevent Russian state media, Russian propaganda operations, from appearing on their platforms. When I ask, have you received any responses yet to your request that they take that action? : Well, David, the short answer is yes. Virtually every one of these platforms has taken down some of the Russian activity or demonetized, so they're not making money off of or Russian ads on real time during the platforms. That's good. I commend these...platforms. So, contrast that with . is when dumb people do propaganda and tell you that Russia invading Ukraine is somehow about racism in the American South or something. I mean, it's nonsensical. Sen. Mark Warner is when smart people do propaganda. You'll notice that Ignatius said Russian state media or Russian propaganda. To just be completely clear, Warner is not talking about banning Russian state media. He's talking about banning Russian propaganda, a term that he gets to define. He's talking about censoring the opinions of Americans. Now, to be clear, that is not allowed in a democracy. In a democracy, citizens who rule have an absolute right to have any opinion they want. Period. That's not an ancillary freedom. That's not just some random thing that we have as an added bonus as Americans. That freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, is the central freedom we have. It's the whole point of the country and there is no point in supporting Ukraine if our leaders ignore our own bill of rights, and we should demand that they respect our Bill of Rights before they take a single step forward in defense of any other democracy.

He continued the trend in subsequent remarks on consecutive poor jobs reports and the rise in inflation.

Ingraham then proposed sanctioning China. This combination image shows U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington, Nov. 6, 2021, and China's President Xi Jinping in Brasília, Brazil, Nov. 13, 2019.

Lee Zeldin discusses Biden's plummeting approval numbers and Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 'Fox Report.' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., suggested Tuesday that Americans are uninformed about President Biden's agenda and what he has worked to do in the White House, but concluded that those who call the United States home are ""blessed"" to have him as president. Asked for a reasoning behind Biden's ""decline"" in polling on certain issues, including -19 and inflation, Pelosi told host Andrea Mitchell that she believes the president's work is misunderstood and that his State of the Union address will be ""very important"" because it will provide him an opportunity to talk about it. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi meets with reporters at the Capitol in Washington on Sept. 8, 2021. ‘’ ""For people to appreciate what the president has done, and that working together with the Congress, they have to know what it is,"" Pelosi said, referencing a quote from President Abraham Lincoln on the values of ""public sentiment."" ""With it you can accomplish almost everything, without it, practically nothing,"" Pelosi said, echoing Lincoln's view on public opinion. ""But people have to know for public sentiment, too."" Noting that ""people still are suffering"" in America, Pelosi said the ""issues that relate to the well-being of the American are being well-served"" under Biden. ""There's no one more empathetic than Joe Biden,"" she said. ""There's no one who cares more.

""I’m not going to be wearing a mask tonight. If I had little children or if I were around little grandchildren, I would, because some of them would not be vaccinated,"" she said. ""Or if I were around a person, or was a person, with some kind of condition that would make me susceptible to it."" Announced Sunday by Congress’ Office of the Attending Physician, the Capitol lifted its mask requirement on the House floor just days before Biden's speech. Once a large proponent for masking in the House chamber, even issuing fines to sitting members of Congress who refused to wear one, Pelosi said she now believes people ""have to use their judgment"" when determining whether to wear a mask to the address.

""I'll make my own judgment that I won't be wearing a mask tonight,"" Pelosi reiterated. Last week, Pelosi told reporters that it was important for Americans to understand the ""brilliance"" of Biden's response to the Russian invasion in Ukraine. ""I think it's really important for people to understand the brilliance with which President Biden is conducting this,"" Pelosi said at the time, per Fox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram.

Pompeo told Fox News that Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""always had a dream of a greater Russia."" ""That hasn’t changed – that’s been a constant since he’s been in charge in Russia,"" he said. ""What changed was American leadership.""

""And when someone crossed that, when someone did something that risked an American life or put our economy at risk that we wouldn’t have jobs, or prosperity, we responded,"" Pompeo said, noting they responded ""diplomatically,"" and also with force, referring to the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. ""Those are the things that leaders come to see — they come to see that America must be realist and serious,"" Pompeo said. ""We don’t need to send 50,000 soldiers every place, but we need to use the things that America has."" Pompeo told Fox News that U.S. economic power is ""of an enormous influence."" Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks at Jerusalem Post's annual conference on Oct. 12, 2021 in Jerusalem. ""We need to be fearless in using it,"" Pompeo said.

I’m worried about a cascading set of calamities around the world.""

""I’m confident the Ukrainian people will fight, but we could have Xi Jinping see a weakness. We could have Chairman Kim see weakness,"" Pompeo said, referring to Chinese and North Korean leaders. Former President Trump, during an exclusive interview with Fox News over the weekend, also warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to ""world war.""

Michael Pompeo, former U.S. secretary of state, speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, on Friday, Feb. 25, 2022. Pompeo urged the Biden administration to ""think about allowing American crude oil and natural gas to travel the world to support the Ukrainian people and the people of Europe."" ""It would reduce the price of crude oil and gasoline--that'd be good for the United States--but, importantly, it would deny $50 a barrel to Vladimir Putin,"" Pompeo said. ""We are, by shutting down American energy, we are fueling a communist invasion,"" he said. ""We should take away the resources from the Russians, just like we did the Iranians and Chinese during our time in office."" He added: ""Those are the kind of things that change the calculus for thugs like Vladimir Putin."" Meanwhile, Pompeo slammed the Biden administration for engaging in negotiations on a new nuclear with Russia in Vienna last week. ""We’re sitting on the same side of the negotiating table with the Russians in Vienna, negotiating a new nuclear deal—we’re their partners in negotiating,"" Pompeo said. ""This is just absurd—I can’t remember a time in history when you had a nation that’s gone to war with a friend and an ally and you decided, hey, we’re going to negotiate with you—with a bad guy who is building a bomb trying to destroy the State of Israel."" He added: ""It is so far afield from the tradition of America and the work that we did for four years."" Pompeo said the United States of America ""is the greatest nation in the history of civilization."" ""We should act that way—not with arrogance and hubris—but with dynamic. Humble power, that speaks with moral clarity about our Judeo-Christian tradition and the country that we are,"" he said. ""When we do that, other countries will want to be our friends."" Pompeo said allied nations will ""want to partner with us and trade with us, and our adversaries will behave in ways that are more normative, less ruthless."" 'S 40 'S : As for Russia and China’s relationship amid the Kremlin invasion in Ukraine, Pompeo said Putin and China’s Xi Jinping ""share some common characteristics."" ""Neither of them gives a whip stitch about human life, and both have grand intentions for the building of greatness for their own nation,"" Pompeo said. ""They have things they disagree on, but for the moment, they are going to find common cause."" Pompeo said the United States needs ""to do everything we can to disrupt that commonality."" ""We managed to do that, I think, in a significant way, for four years,"" Pompeo said of the Trump administration. ""We need to make sure we focus on the primary challenge to the United States of America over the next 50 years—which will turn out to be the Chinese Communist Party, inside the gates, impacting us here at home."" Meanwhile, criticizing the Biden administration, Pompeo said its priorities are at odds with that of the Trump administration in regard to foreign relations. ""The most important differences are that we were fearless about protecting America everywhere in the world. We wanted religious freedom to be one of the things we worked on deeply,"" Pompeo said. ""They’ve chosen to lead with climate change."" ""When you put climate change at the top of your agenda, when the conversation isn’t about power, but about carbon footprint, the world thinks of you in a deeply different way,"" Pompeo said. He added: ""I sadly think that the change in priorities and a lack of focus on America First has driven Vladimir Putin to think that he had this opportunity.""",9

""This is not a war,"" a tearful Spartz, 43, said at a House Republican news conference Tuesday.

They want to be with the United States of America. They want to be free people."" , , 'S '' Ukrainians want to fight back, but they need guns, not sticks, she said in urging Biden to provide more aid. She said Biden's sanctions against Russia are too little and too late. Without greater action, Putin won't stop his invasion in Ukraine, and the United States will ultimately have to join in the fight with military troops, she said. Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., who emigrated from Ukraine, speaks about the war in Ukraine during a Republican news conference ahead of the State of the Union, Tuesday, March. 1, 2022, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

What's happening under his watch is an atrocity."" She added: ""He must act decisively, fast, or the blood of many millions of Ukrainians will be on his hands, too."" She said Putin struck when the United States is weak and Biden needs to step up and show strength. 'S ""He knew that we got embarrassed in Afghanistan.

The move comes amid criticisms from Republicans and former Trump administration officials who have criticized the Biden administration for cutting off U.S. energy production and forcing America and European allies to be reliant on Russian energy production.

Biden echoed a familiar phrase, calling to ""buy American."" ""Every administration—Democrat or Republican—says they’ll do it— but we’re actually doing it,"" Biden said.

""That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control,"" Biden said, touting the economy’s recovery under his administration. Biden laid out his administration’s strategy to combating inflation: ""That means make more cars and semiconductors in America, more infrastructure and innovation in America, more goods moving faster and cheaper in America, more jobs where you can earn a good living in America."" ""Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America,"" Biden said. : Inflation surged more than expected in January, notching another four-decade high as strong consumer demand and pandemic-related supply-chain snarls fueled rapid price gains that wiped out the benefits of rising wages for most Americans. The president referred to his economic plan, Build Back Better, which is stalled in Congress—just not by name. Biden called for cutting the cost of prescription drugs; cutting energy costs for families by ""combating climate change"" and making homes and businesses more ""energy efficient; and cutting the cost of child care. Biden also called for a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations; the passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act; raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour; and an extension of the child tax credit. The president also called for an increase in Pell Grants and support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and an increased investment in community colleges. Pivoting to the -19 pandemic, the president, speaking to a chamber of lawmakers without masks following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated mask guidance, said the U.S. has ""reached a new moment in the fight"" against coronavirus. : ‘ ?’ The president moved to declare that -19 ""no longer need to control our lives."" ""We’ll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases,"" Biden said, but added that ""we have to stay on guard."" Meanwhile, Biden touted his administration's efforts in combating the surge in violent crime across the nation. ""The answer is not to defund the police, it's to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them,"" Biden said. ""Fund them with resources and training they need to protect our communities."" ""Under the new guidelines, most Americans and most of the country can now go mask free and based on projections, based on projections, more of the country will reach that point across that point across the next couple of weeks,"" Biden said. Meanwhile, the president touted retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer for his service, and reminded that he nominated his first pick to the high court last week— Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Biden went on to shift to immigration, as migrant encounters surge at the U.S. southern border. ""We need to secure our border and fix the immigration system,"" Biden said. ""And you might guess, I think we can do both at our border."" Biden said his administration is setting up joint patrols in Mexico and Guatemala to catch human traffickers and putting in place dedicated immigration judges. 220,000 : Biden also mentioned Roe v. Wade, saying it is ""under attack as never before,"" and defended the + community against the ""onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families."" ""It’s simply wrong. I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I’ll always have you back as your president so you can be yourself and reach your God given potential,"" Biden said.

The president, earlier this month, announced he would reignite the Obama-era Cancer Moonshot initiative, and set new goals to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50% over the next 25 years. ' ' ""I think we can do better than that,"" Biden said. ""Turn cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases, and more support for patients and their families."" In closing, Biden said the traditional State of the Union words: ""On this night, on our 245th year as a nation, I've come to report on the state of the nation, the State of the Union, and my report is this: the State of the Union is strong because you, the American people are strong."" ""We are stronger today than we were a year ago, and will be stronger a year from now than we are today,"" Biden said. ""This is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time.

2022-03-02,https://www.foxnews.com/media/sara-carter-cpacs-awake-woke-big-tech,"Sara Carter: CPAC's 'awake, not woke' theme highlights importance of Big Tech hypocrisy","Investigative journalist talks to Fox News Digital at about Big Tech's double standard , Fla. – With conservatives warning of Big Tech firms like Twitter, Facebook and others cracking down their free speech, investigative journalist Sara Carter spoke to Fox News Digital at about the divide and why it is so important that Congress act to preserve the First Amendment. Big Tech has allowed Russia to launch a viral campaign in the midst of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Carter added that actual criminal conduct is rightly restricted and should continue to be. ""It's crazy. But that's why -2022's [theme] is ‘Awake Not Woke’, because people are starting to wake up and realize that these behemoth social media giants like Twitter, like Facebook"" are censoring otherwise free speech, she said. Carter noted that there has been a rise in alternative social media platforms of late – which include Rumble, Parler, and Donald Trump's Truth Social – and that such competition is a good thing. ""I'm not saying we should censor Facebook. I'm not saying we should shut down Twitter. I'm saying that they need to do a better job at giving people a voice, and we're not dumb. We can see what the truth is. We don't need people babysitting us on the truth,"" she said. ' Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference Saturday, Feb. 26, 2022, in Orlando, Fla. ""But overall, are we supposed to say, ‘oh, well, you know, Facebook is the trusted editor for us’? And why do they have these publishing rights but yet they don't have to face any … legal backlash if they publish something wrong?"" she later asked. ""If you're going to act like a publisher, then you should be treated like a publisher. And I think that's important to understand. And for Facebook and Twitter to really silence the voices of the American people and silence the voices of conservatives … tells me that they are really working for a political party and that opens up a whole new can of worms."" She added that, even with government censorship and surveillance in a place like Russia, the Russian civilian population is somewhat waking up to their authoritarian president's behavior and true intentions. Vladimir Putin, elected in 1999, has been in power ever since, save for a four-year swap in roles with ex-Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev. ""We've seen the Russian people marching in the square against this war. Vladimir Putin is going to face his wrath not so much from the outside of the world, but from the inside of Russia – people are waking up,"" she said. As people in Russia are waking up to that brand of censorship, so are people in North America, Carter said, pointing to her comprehensive reporting in Ottawa during the Canadian trucker convoy's gridlock. A '22 sign at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida on Feb. 25, 2022 ""People are waking up, and I think over the last two years dealing with ,"" she said, saying there was a clear dichotomy between how Black Lives Matter and Antifa were covered in the media compared to the Canadian truckers. : ‘ ’ ""It's actually a shame. It's very dangerous for a democracy when you have a media that is failing to do its job because it's politically motivated,"" she said. ""There is something very dangerous when … media are now covering one story based on their political viewpoint and refused to treat those stories as equal."" She compared coverage of the January 6 Capitol riot to the 2020 riots in Seattle and Portland, where left-wing activists set up an ""autonomous zone"" in Washington's largest city. Authorities there had arrested 191 people and filed 389 charges, police announced mid-afternoon Sunday. They had also towed 99 vehicles. ""To the point where you even had Vice President Kamala Harris offering to put up money for bail, asking people and then of course, retracting that, going back on that a little bit, but offering to put up money for bail,"" she said. ""So I think Americans are very well aware that there is somewhat of a two-tiered system happening. And I mean, I've seen that even from, you know, covering the stories back in 2016 with President Trump and the weaponization of the and bureaucracies."" Carter also pointed to how the media would cover the debunked anti-Trump ""Russian dossier"" compiled by ex-6 Agent Christopher Steele, noting that Big Tech did not call it misinformation or act as fervently as they do when a right-wing entity gets something wrong. ""If one of these social media giants tries to censor us, well then we use our voice in another area – we go to a different platform. But we can't be afraid,"" she said. ""We can't be afraid of speaking our minds. We can't be afraid of telling the truth, and we can't be afraid of delivering the message to the people that are most important: which are the American people, and for that matter, the rest of the world.""

2022-03-02,https://www.foxnews.com/media/madmen-putin-russia-ukraine-gowdy,Madmen like Putin who sanction killing of children shouldn't be appeased: Gowdy,"Trey Gowdy reflects on the lessons learned so far in Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 'The Trey Gowdy Podcast.' There is a lot going on in the country, in the world. And when there's a lot going on, it's the perfect time to think and analyze and ask questions starting with ourselves. The answers, I think, will eventually come — or partial answers will eventually come — if we do spend enough time reflecting and analyzing and posing the right questions to those in positions of power and also to ourselves. So, we'll start with what's been on my mind, which is that Russia invaded a sovereign neighboring country, and civilians are being killed. Russian and Ukrainian civilians are bearing the cost of wars waged by a Russian despot, which should lead us to wonder why there has been any equivocation by some in this country on the nature and intentions of Vladimir Putin. - , Some in the media and in positions of power seem frankly enamored with Putin. Looking at the images of dead Ukrainian children should settle the question of who Putin is once and for all. It's not something I've wondered about, but it is apparently something that others have wondered about. And it does beg the question of what some people are drawn to. Some people seem drawn to wealth; some people seem drawn to power. Some people seem drawn to influence. But I think there are more people who are drawn to justice and fairness, and I think that's why you see such widespread condemnation for what Russia is doing. Countries not always known for their toughness are sending weapons to Ukraine. Countries in the past known for their neutrality are abandoning their neutrality. There are countries imposing serious and meaningful sanctions on Russia. The world finally seems to have found something that it can unite in condemnation of, and that is the reckless use of power for the sake of aggression. The U.S. is still, for now, the most powerful country on Earth, and there is still a broad streak of justice that runs through this country. So when a nation is powerful and it is just, it should lead. I don't know the full panoply of sanctions the U.S. has imposed on Russia. I wouldn't know; I couldn't know. But it's fair to ask were they tough enough and were they timely enough and were they intended to deter or punish. And is there a meaningful distinction between deterrence and punishment? We hear people talk about deterrence and punishment as if they're apples and airplanes, like they're two entirely different things, and I think they're more closely aligned. The purpose is to correct behavior, either beforehand, during, or afterward. And between the three, we should want to correct the bad behavior as soon as possible, like before the children are killed before the country is ruined by an invading force. We would want to get tougher sooner. Right? Looking at the images of dead Ukrainian children should settle the question of who Putin is once and for a And when you see the tanks massing at the border, when you see war games in a neighboring country like Belarus, why not start the process of punishment then? One of the limitations of our own criminal justice system is that it is necessarily reactive. Someone does something wrong, and we react — we investigate, we arrest. We indict, we prosecute. We sentence. But if you ask most of us, we would like to have avoided the crime altogether. So how do we act in time before the wrong has been committed? Punishment does not just belong to government — we can do it, too. So, for those in the media and in government who complimented Putin, who wondered why we would side with a democracy like Ukraine rather than a despot who poisons and kills his political opponents, what will be the consequences? What will be our form of punishment for those who provided verbal air cover for a man who waged war on a weaker neighbor while some in this country talked about oil and gas and a desire to be friends with an immoral bully? So while we're reflecting this week, you know, could the war in Ukraine have been avoided? How, when, and by whom? What lessons have we learned — or learned again — to deter, prevent and punish those who want to wage the next war on a weaker nation simply because they can? I mean, I heard Republican senators who aspire to the presidency wonder why we just don't agree to keep where it is — appease Putin, placate Putin, reassure Putin. All of those things you maybe can do with reasonable, practical, cogent, clear-minded people, maybe. But it's hard to appease those who sanction the killing of children simply to satisfy their own ego. We don't call those people geniuses. We call those people madmen.

Former speechwriters and communications experts for top elected officials and Cabinet secretaries weighed in on President Biden's first State of the Union address Tuesday evening, praising the president for his strong support of Ukraine amid Russia's multi-front invasion, but criticizing it for being lackluster and uninspiring. Biden's speech marked the most consequential of his lifetime as U.S. inflation soars and Eastern Europe devolves into war between Russia and Ukraine. Many members of Congress attending the speech were wearing small lapel ribbons of blue and yellow to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine. During his speech, Biden announced that his administration is banning Russian planes from American airspace in retaliation for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, in addition to economic sanctions and other measures he has taken in recent days. : Aside from the international turmoil, Biden's speech also focused on domestic issues as inflation reached a 40-year high and gasoline prices hit their highest level in eight years. In addition, a recent Fox News Poll put Biden’s approval rating at a dismal 43%, the lowest of this presidency, and only 37% approve of his handling of the economy. President Joe Biden delivers his first State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress at the Capitol, Tuesday, March 1, 2022. Biden touted his American Rescue Plan and also committed to getting prices back down. ""I get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control,"" Biden said. However, according to expert analysis from several top communications officials, who have served both Democrats and Republicans, Biden's speech largely fell short of addressing the concerns of the nation, and the world. Here's how they graded Biden: David Wilezol, president of ghostwriting firm Seventh Floor Strategies and former chief speechwriter at the State Department, gave Biden a ""C,"" saying the president's remarks lacked references to China and failed to address other national security issues. ""The best thing President Biden said tonight was his call to fund the police — an act of leadership to help stop left-wing radicals in his own party from setting policing policies,"" Wilezol told Fox News Digital. ""And on the foreign policy front, President Biden sounded appropriately tough as the commander-in-chief and genuinely sympathetic to the plight of Ukrainians who are fighting for their lives. But that won’t make up for the Administration’s posture of weakness which helped provoke Vladimir Putin’s invasion. ""And except for a couple passing references to China, which are not nearly enough, this speech was lacking in addressing other national security matters. That’s not surprising, given the disaster the Biden administration created on our southern border and the rude awakening that awaits Americans if the administration successfully re-enters the indefensible Iran nuclear deal."" Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi applaud President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address at the Capitol, Tuesday, March 1, 2022, in Washington. David Litt, a senior speechwriter for former President Obama, gave Biden an ""A"" for the speech for talking about topics that strike common ground, touting the strongest year ever for job growth and making the case that America is stronger than a year ago. ""That was an A speech,"" Litt told Fox News Digital. ""He did exactly the things he needed to do. This is a moment when he is trying to remind a lot of Americans who voted for him and who approved of his job performance as recently as June or even September, why they supported him. And I think he did that really effectively."" Litt said Biden's speech focused on broader themes that are relatable to Americans, such as opening up schools, lowering prescription drugs and standing with Ukraine. ""He was using language that Americans use all the time. … So I think that was a reminder of who Joe Biden really is,"" Litt said. ""That he is fundamentally looking to be president for everybody. And I think that's why people elected him in the first place."" ‘ ’ Rob Noel, a speechwriter for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Undersecretary of State Keith Krach and former Chamber of Commerce President and Tom Donohue, rated Biden's speech a ""C-"" due to both the content and flow of the address. ""The intro on Ukraine worked well enough, but boy did he move on quickly, and not to anything particularly compelling or new. As a technical matter, the speech felt strung together and disjointed, with cram-ins and jumpy transitions. The substance amounted to a dry list of policy points, like it was geared toward lawmakers in the room rather than people at home. He missed multiple chances to bring ideas to life with examples or audience shout-outs. The conclusion was too safe and forgettable for such a historic time. Politically speaking, while he may have avoided losing ground, he certainly didn't gain any. And that makes it a miss,"" Noel told Fox News Digital. : Jonathan Bronitsky, former chief speechwriter for Attorney General Bill Barr and co-founder of the D.C.-based public relations firm and literary agency , gave Biden the lowest marks by slapping a ""D+"" on the president's first address. Bronitsky called the speech ""tone deaf,"" and accused it of lacking logical progression and coherence, and said it notably underutilized the ""incredible stories of everyday Americans."" ""The ‘buck stops with me’ president didn’t acknowledge responsibility for any of the problems he’s produced, ranging from unprecedented illegal immigration due to open borders to inflation and anemic job growth resulting from draconian mandates. The policies that received the most applause were those that Biden has opposed all along, such as getting kids back into classrooms and supporting law enforcement. As such, the address was an insult to the intelligence of Americans. It was as if the Biden White House gambled that this would be the first time in a year the citizens of this country were tuning into the news."" ""Frighteningly, as the current White House resident isn’t getting any younger, this might stand as the most lucid State of the Union of his administration,"" he concluded. President Joe Biden waves during his State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, March 1, 2022. Rusty Hills, a former speechwriter for former Michigan Gov. John Engler, gave Biden’s speech a ""C and that’s generous,"" he said. He agreed with other communications experts that Biden started strong on Ukraine and had ""a united chamber, Republicans and Democrats."" However, when he launched into ""laundry list land,"" he lost the attention of Americans and said the delivery was ""very, very rough."" ""I did not come away with a strong sense of any plan to deal with gas and grocery prices, which are top of mind for almost every voter and citizen. I did not come away with any sense that here is a well-crafted plan of attack to deal with inflation. The problem of higher prices is here, now. President Biden's proposed solution -- not here, and not now. ""I got the sense that the speech underwent so many changes, so late in the process, that the President was still getting used to it as he delivered it,"" Hills explained, saying also that Biden saved his best line for last, that the State of the Union is ""strong.""",9

""We have to do all we can, and I felt with Ammo Inc. and myself, we were doing the right thing. As far as the logistics of getting the ammo to the front lines, it’s not as easy as boxing it up and putting in on a plane.

2022-03-02,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ukrainian-born-lawmaker-biden-financing-putin-war,Ukrainian-born lawmaker says Biden 'financing' Putin's war by buying Russian oil,"Rep. Victoria Spartz joins 'Hannity' Indiana Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz, who was born in Ukraine called on President Biden and Democrats in power to stop indirectly funding Vladimir Putin's invasion by purchasing thousands of barrels of Russian oil per day. Spartz said earlier Wednesday that Putin is a ""crazy man"" committing a ""genocide"" on Ukrainians. Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., who emigrated from Ukraine, speaks about the war in Ukraine. On ""Hannity,"" Spartz said energy security is a top issue for the United States and ties directly in to the Russian invasion: ""Unfortunately, we have too many people that … hopefully they change their mind that the biggest threat is the climate change right now because we have much bigger problems right now and we have lack of common sense,"" she said. ""We have a lack of common sense in Europe, but we also have lack of common sense in our country, and it's created instability, bloodshed and a lot of problems. So we need to be smarter. And I think, you know, this president needs to understand if we want to tip the scale and make President Putin listen to us, the most effective way to do it is stop financing his war."" Spartz said she previously met with officials from Germany – up until recently a top buyer of Russian energy – and when she criticized that relationship, the Germans responded that America is also buying Russian oil. ""To tell you the truth, I didn't have an answer for them because it was true. And it's just a disgrace that we are doing that,"" she said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivers a speech ) In terms of the invasion itself, Spartz said the U.S.S.R., and now the Russian Federation, always had ""bandits"", but that Putin upped the ante by reportedly installing Chechen ""mafia"" individuals in offices near him in the Kremlin, who she said would threaten Russians. ""And I think a lot of people, even in his police force do not like that because these people are lawless, and he's using them to suppress Russian people and everyone else,"" she said. ""So I wouldn't be surprised if there is some dissatisfaction in the police force in this war on his people."" She said Putin's Kremlin previously ""installed a president who was a former criminal to run [Ukraine] in a criminal way – and Ukrainians said no enough is enough. They took him down."" Putin-friendly former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, now reportedly living in exile in Russia, fled Kyiv in 2014 before the legislature could file impeachment charges against him. She said Putin continues to underestimate the Ukrainian people, but that the West should have been more proactive than reactive in dealing with the hardened former Soviet intelligence officer. ""We need to take people like that seriously. But now we need to stop this bloodshed because a lot of people are going to be killed and we need to exercise some leadership,"" she concluded.

Nikki Haley slammed President Biden's State of the Union address on ""Fox & Friends"" Wednesday, saying some of his remarks sounded like a ""victory lap"" on the Russia-Ukraine war. : : It's bizarre. First of all, he kind of talks about it like the war is over, you know, like he's doing a victory lap. The second thing is he hasn't even done everything he should be doing. Until he sanctions Russian energy, until he stops taking Russian oil into America -- which is unthinkable that we would take that in from an enemy. Until he goes and fully pulls out and has Russia pulled out of the , international banking system, he hasn't done enough. And to go and sit there and act like they've led the West?

Cruz joined ""The Faulkner Focus"" to discuss Biden's approach to Putin as Russian forces continue to attack various cities across Ukraine. , ‘ ’ : A couple of weeks ago, we had a classified briefing with all 100 senators and one of the Democratic senators stood up and asked the Secretary of State Tony Blinken why did Putin not invade Ukraine in 2017 or in 2018 or 2019 or 2020? And I got to admit, I and several other senators began laughing because the answer is obvious, which is that Putin only respects strength, and he believed President Trump was strong. He didn't want to risk the consequences. And critically, Trump had signed into law the sanctions that I authored, shutting down Nord Stream 2, which means if Putin invaded Ukraine, he risked jeopardizing the pipelines that go through Ukraine and without those pipelines, Putin can't get his gas to Europe. It's why Nord Stream 2 was so important. When Biden came in, he surrendered Nord Stream 2. This president believes when you're facing an enemy, you should show weakness, you should show appeasement.

In his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Biden delivered tough talk against Russia, hailed a retiring Supreme Court justice, and was the subject of boos and jeers from Republicans. Here are the top five moments from the speech. A smiling Biden walked into the House chamber, shaking hands with dozens of maskless lawmakers amid the traditional awkwardly long applause that lasted his entire walk to the podium. ‘ ’ The chamber was not as packed as it had been before the pandemic. There were approximately 600-700 people in attendance, in contrast to the 1,600 or so it can accommodate for a State of the Union address. President Biden delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress at the Capitol, Tuesday, March 1, 2022, in Washington, D.C. But Tuesday's speech saw far more people in attendance than the approximately 200 that witnessed Biden's joint session address to Congress in 2021. And the event looked like a presidential speech of great pomp and circumstance. It looked like the State of the Union. ""Last year -19 kept us apart,"" Biden said to begin his speech. ""This year we're finally together again."" Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were wearing Ukraine flag ribbons, waving Ukrainian flags and giving the president standing ovations for his comments on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Americans, Biden boomed, have an ""unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny."" ""Six days ago, Russia's Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

Biden made clear that the U.S. will defend ""every inch"" of territory should Russia try to expand beyond Ukraine, and he touted the sanctions the West is leveling against Russia. ""Putin is now more isolated from the world than he has ever been,"" Biden said to applause. , ""Clearly it was world leader-like that he is. He helped galvanize and bring them together,"" U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said of Biden's tone on Russia. ""That was very emotional for me as well,"" Lee said of the scene with Marakova and the show of support for Ukraine in the chamber. ""I felt that emotion tonight, and I felt that the president felt the emotion, had a respect for President Zelinskyy, and will stand by his side on the behalf of the American people."" Biden also exposed some of the significant fault lines in U.S. politics around domestic and economic policy. That was clear when he touted Democrats' coronavirus stimulus bill from last year. ""Unlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration, that benefited the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan …. ,"" Biden said, before being interrupted by boos from Republicans in the audience.

Fox Nation explored how President Ronald Reagan worked tirelessly to see the end of the Soviet Union on ""Three Days In Moscow,"" which reveals how the former president, who felt he was spared from his assassination attempt to help bring an end to communism, spoke to the heart of the Soviet people while he negotiated with their tough regime. Reagan saw an opportunity to challenge Mikhail Gorbachev when Germany invited world leaders to commemorate the anniversary of the Berlin Wall. The Berlin Wall had stood as a powerful symbol of the evils of communism, separating the free people on the west with the oppressed on the east. Officials had cautioned Reagan about being careful with what he said, even going as far as to claim the German people were used to the wall. However, the reality was very different. ’S — ""In the evening I went out to a residential suburb still in West Berlin where I met about a dozen or 15 Germans,"" Peter Robinson, former Reagan speechwriter, told Fox Nation. ""I said, ‘Is it true? Have you gotten used to the wall?’ One man raised his arm ...,pointed and said, ‘My sister lives just a few kilometers in that direction, but I haven’t seen her in more than 20 years. How do you think we feel about the wall?’ They hadn’t gotten used . They had stopped talking about it."" Another woman, Ingeborg Elz, said if Gorbachev was serious about what he said, he would tear down the Berlin Wall. This inspired Reagan’s famous speech. Though many officials preferred he not include the line, ""Mr. Gorbachov, tear down this wall"" in his speech, he knew it was the right thing to do. ""He was a man of commitment, of vision, or purpose,"" author Peggy Grande said. ""He knew what needed to be said in that way, at that place, at that time and it was truly a moment of destiny and when you look at what could have not happened had he not said that, the world forever may have been a different place."" Six months later, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed and his last summit with Gorbachev followed. Pres. Ronald Reagan walking &amp;amp; giving thumbs up gesture on S. Lawn after returning from . "" sensed that even though the Soviet leaders were not ready for real change, the Soviet people were and he intended to make his case to them,"" Fox Nation host Bret Baier said. In his visits to Moscow, the president and first lady took walks in public among the Soviet people, the president even promenading with Gorbachev. On Reagan’s third day in Moscow, he delivered a symbolic speech at Moscow State University in front of a statue of Lenin, sharing the joys of democracy with the Soviet people. ""America is a nation made up of hundreds of nationalities,"" Reagan told the crowd. ""Our ties to you are more than ones of good feeling, they’re ties of kinship. They come from every part of this vast continent, from every continent to live in harmony seeking a place where each cultural heritage is respected, each is valued for its diverse strengths and beauties and the richness it brings to our lives."" Reagan’s speech was a turning point, showing the Soviet people the hope of what they could have. The president stayed firm in his resolve to collapse the Soviet Union, even denying the Soviets’ request to say ""peaceful coexistence was a universal principle of international relations."" The president's toughness paid off. Eventually, the Berlin Wall was torn down and the Soviet Union disintegrated. ""Reagan knew all America needed to defeat communism was to be unyieldingly hostile toward it, to never accept that it was permanent,"" Baier said.

The speech came at a moment when the state of the union hasn’t been this bad since President Jimmy Carter delivered his last State of the Union address in January 1980. At that time, America was dealing with the Iranian hostage crisis, suffocating inflation, energy shortages, and the uncertain feeling of malaise in the air. The Soviet Union had also just invaded Afghanistan the previous month. It seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same. President Joe Biden delivers his first State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress at the Capitol, Tuesday, March 1, 2022, in Washington as Vice President Kamala Harris and House speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., look on. In fact, Biden’s speech and Carter’s remarks more than four decades ago could almost be used interchangeably. : , '' 'T On that note, here are my five takeaways from Joe Biden’s weak and ineffective first State of the Union address. In President Carter’s address, he stated, ""but now the Soviet Union has taken a radical and an aggressive new step. It's using its great military power against a relatively defenseless nation. The implications of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan could pose the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War."" -- Elk City, Oklahoma: President Carter speaks to the citizens of Elk City, fulfilling a campaign pledge to return after his election. Carter wasn’t wrong in his description. And the politicians and experts making similar claims about Russia’s current invasion of Ukraine aren’t wrong either. However, what can’t be ignored is that the reasons for the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and Ukraine in 2022 are the same. It all comes back to weakness in the Oval Office. - : ' ’By the time Soviet tanks rolled into Kabul 42 years ago, Jimmy Carter’s reputation as a weak leader had been well-established and the Communists in Moscow took full advantage of it. Over the past year, President Biden has cemented an eerily similar image that has yielded the same results -- liberty in retreat. Biden’s refusal to get tough with China -- in the tradition of the Trump America First agenda -- along with his incompetent and impeachable withdrawal from Afghanistan have emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin. Dictators like Putin only understand strength. And with the absence of strength coming from the current American president, there’s no deterrent to the thugs of the world who wish to do evil things. Moreover, we’re also seeing that and the United Nations are only as strong as whoever is sitting behind the Resolute Desk. , A peace through strength foreign policy helped propel both Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump to the presidency and put our adversaries on notice. Conversely, Carter and Biden’s complete inability to project strength puts America at a severe disadvantage. At this precarious moment for America and the world, mean tweets from a political outsider from New York don’t seem all that bad. When Jimmy Carter was about to leave office in December 1980, his approval rating stood at 34 percent and his presidency was viewed by many as a dismal failure. Similarly, the first year of the Biden presidency was a failure across the board. President Biden’s irresponsible and radical leftist policies created a border crisis, a crime crisis, an inflation crisis and an Afghanistan crisis. That’s why his approval rating is clocking in at a dangerously low 37 percent. President Joe Biden delivers his first State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress at the Capitol, Tuesday, March 1, 2022, in Washington. In his address to the nation on Tuesday night, Biden’s feeble attempt to rally Americans around a presidency that’s in freefall, by focusing on defending freedom and democracy abroad, will come up short because he’s lost all credibility on the issue already. : 13 Look no further than the fact that Biden is polling underwater on foreign policy matters with 38 percent of Americans approving his leadership and 58 percent disapproving. The American people will never forget how Biden broke his promise and left Americans behind on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2021. In his January 1980 address to the nation, President Carter said that ""the crises in Iran and Afghanistan have dramatized a very important lesson: Our excessive dependence on foreign oil is a clear and present danger to our nation’s security."" President Trump understood this and successfully made America energy independent by unleashing our abundant domestic energy resources. As soon as Joe Biden took office, he caved to the radical left-wing special interests in his party and made our country once again dependent on foreign energy. Now, instead of admitting his mistake and adopting the successful Trump energy policy for the sake of national security, Biden remains boxed in by his socialist base and the U.S. will continue to buy oil from Russia while lining Putin’s corrupt pockets. Jimmy Carter wasn’t a successful president but he gave it straight to the American people. In his last state of the union speech he told the American people that the ""last few months has not been an easy time for any of us."" While President Carter didn’t know how to solve our problems, he didn’t gloss over them. U.S. President Joe Biden during a State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, March 1, 2022. Biden's first State of the Union address comes against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions placed on Russia by the U.S. and its allies. President Biden by contrast is addicted to telling Americans the lie that his economic and foreign policies are working and that we’re making progress. Biden has no answer for record inflation or the skyrocketing gas prices that are crushing hardworking American taxpayers. , 'S - After a year of out of control spending, no one believes that Biden's policies will cut the deficit or our ever-growing $30 trillion national debt. Biden's decision to double down on his stalled leftist agenda isn't what struggling Americans wanted to hear. He should have listened to former Obama adviser David Axelrod’s advice: ""You simply cannot jawbone Americans into believing that things are better than [how] they feel."" Biden also made clear that his -19 policy was dictated by politics all along and not science. History will remember that when it was time to choose between power and science, Democrats chose power. But people see that the sudden shift to a post- mentality is all about the Democrats trying to fight off the coming tidal wave in the 2022 midterms elections. At the end of the day, President Biden didn't unite the American people during his first year in office, but instead he chose to further divide us with his rhetoric. Instead of shutting down -19, Biden chose political science over medical science. And now Biden is claiming that he support polices and border security is a farce that no one believes. Why? Because his past words and deeds speak for themselves. Biden's 2022 State of the Union address was a huge missed opportunity to change direction and turn the page on a terrible first year that the American people will never get back.",9

""This doesn’t require any legislation,"" McConnell explained. ""All the president has to do is just change."" 'S ‘’ - : ‘ ’ ""The president could, with the stroke of the pen, get us back in the production business so that not only could we meet our own needs, which we did as recently as 2019, but export to Europe as well.""

And he has warned, his Defense Ministry has warned that that will continue today. Yesterday, we saw Putin's forces take out a well-known landmark — the television tower in Kyiv — and there is growing fear now that he's going to pull back and continue this crushing bombardment of built-up areas. They also rained down rockets yesterday on the second-biggest city of Kharkiv, while Russia's Defense Ministry urged residents of both cities to flee today, saying it was going to strike unspecified areas within the city and hit their communications. However, when it comes to that 40 mile–long armored convoy that we have been talking about, the one that had been bearing down on Kyiv, it has actually made no advances over the last 24 hours. And the U.S. official now saying, in fact, that it has been beset by logistical problems, supply issues — short on fuel and food. And there is growing talk that actually this is not going the way that Putin hoped it would, and that is why he is doubling down. That is why he is using his heavy artillery. That's why he's using his rockets. The death toll, it keeps rising, and so does the exodus. The is now saying that 677,000 people have left in the past six days. That number rising by about 100,000 a day at the moment. Again, no one knows what today will bring, but Vladimir Putin in his Defense Ministry, making it very clear they are going to continue hitting these cities. … What is most likely to enrage Vladimir Putin is a sense that this is not going how he wanted, and if he finds himself backed into a corner, he's going to do what we've seen him do over the last day or two, and that is bring out the heavy artillery and hit the people.

""Young Americans know very little, and frequently nothing, about Josef Stalin – the brutal leader of the that took over after Lenin and took his crimes under communism and really ratcheted them up,"" Bremberg said. ""I think people know nothing of the Holodomor, which was Stalin's planned famine in Ukraine that killed over 10 million people during the time."" Soviet Premier Josef Stalin in 1949. At the time of the Holodomor, known as the Great Famine, when Westerners were suffering from the Great Depression in the early 1930s, socialism and communism were ""very much in vogue,"" Bremberg explained. : ""It is a terrible chapter in human history of the 20th century, and the vast majority of young Americans truly know nothing about [it]. Just knowing that one fact, I believe, can really materially change how a person understands communism,"" he said.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, however, the tone of Bremberg's conversations with foreign leaders has shifted. Officials have been reflecting on their own country’s battles against Russia and communism as Ukraine comes under Putin’s fire. A century ago, the Red Army invaded Poland with the intent of taking over Central Europe, and Polish citizens stepped up during the invasion to help defend the country’s capital of Warsaw, which is reminiscent of Ukrainians defending Kyiv today. After the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the Hungarian people helped defend Budapest when Russia invaded to stop the regime change. The body of a member of the Hungarian secret police lies in a Budapest street as western journalists witness the anti-communist uprising in Hungary in 1956.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stands alongside other government officials in a video posted to social media Friday and vows to defend the country from a Russian invasion. In Russia, citizens have risked arrest to protest Putin’s war against Ukraine – something that would not have happened during the Cold War, according to Bremberg. ""It is hopeful, inspiring to see many thousands of Russians protest this war, and that most likely never would have happened under the previous communist regimes,"" he explained. ""[B]ut one difference, frankly, is that I think the regime probably cared or feared a popular uprising, whereas I fear that today that Putin actually just doesn't."" He said he fears ""Putin is so isolated and separate"" from the Russian people ""that regardless of how they may protest,"" the impact of sanctions – with ""Russia being basically cut off from much of the rest of the world"" – will be more significant on them than Putin and Russian oligarchs unless further sanctions, such as travel options, are directed toward the higher-ups personally.",6

Although Ukraine needs as much defense support as possible, the tennis star said his decision to join the fight will be hard for his family to understand. , - 24: Sergiy Stakhovsky of the Ukraine speaks to crowd after winning the final against Oscar Otte of Germany on day Eight of the Fuzion 100 Ikley Trophy at Ilkley Lawn Tennis &amp;amp; Squash Club on June 24, 2018 in Ilkley, United Kingdom. ""It’s not a winning decision. It’s not a right one. All of them are wrong. I hope my wife understood it but I just now hope that I will have a chance to have forgiveness in person and not on the phone,"" Stakhovsky said. Stakhovsky said Ukraine has been at war with Russia for eight years since Moscow annexed Crimea and ""disturbed"" the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the country's east. ""Ukraine knew and saw in their own eyes what the Russia world brings to the table and that's nothing Ukrainian people want to have. Ukrainians want the possibility to travel to Europe without a visa. They want to see the world. They want to experience better things and that's why every single individual inside Ukraine, they don't want the Russian world inside Ukraine,"" he said. ""And that's why they're willing to fight.""

2022-03-03,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mixed-messages-congress-state-union,"Mixed messages from Congress at State of the Union address on Ukraine, COVID-19","Even Hamilton Beach couldn’t make enough mixers to keep up with the mixed messaging on Capitol Hill this week. Congress initially seemed divided about protocols before President Biden’s State of the Union speech. All House and Senate members were invited this year – compared to the 200 last year due to the pandemic. Initial guidelines dictated members had to sit spaced apart in the chamber. Even some members would sit in the gallery above rather than on the floor. No handshakes or backslapping. All members had to have a negative test and wear a mask to take part. Democrats hold the majority in the House and Senate. President Biden is a Democrat. Democrats faced a conundrum. They’re trying desperately to ease the nation into some degree of normalcy and demonstrate a path out of the pandemic – especially ahead of the midterms. A fully-masked State of the Union speech would not present that optic. In a memo, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker declared that lawmakers who refused to don a mask or adhere to other protocols risked getting kicked out of the speech. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris talk as President Biden, center, speaks during a State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, March 1, 2022. -: We now live in the age of performative politics and TikTok. One could only imagine how some lawmakers would have relished the opportunity to make a scene getting bounced from the speech over practices. Such dramatics would go viral and resonate in some conservative districts. Republicans would embrace casting blame on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who they criticize regularly for ""locking down the Capitol."" The House Ethics Committee has already fined Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., more than $100,000 for failing to wear a mask in the House chamber. The Ethics Committee just announced this week that the Sergeant at Arms Office fined Greene for three violations alone on January 20. But the Capitol Attending Physician along with many other jurisdictions, began to dial back masking mandates on March 1, the day of the speech. And so, no masks were required for State of the Union. Sure. A few wore masks on their own. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., ""because we all need to remember that the immunocompromised and those over 60 remain at higher risk of severe illness."" He said it was important to wear a mask ""for those who are vulnerable."" Reps. Al Green, D-Tex., and Jim Langevin, D-R.I., were also spotted with masks. So, the State of the Union speech seemed and looked kind of normal. It wasn’t completely full. Congressional officials only permitted about 600 persons in the chamber. They can typically pack in 1,600 for a completely bulging State of the Union in a non-pandemic period. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., left, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., right, scream ""Build the Wall"" as President Biden delivers his first State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress at the Capitol, Tuesday, March 1, 2022, in Washington. $10B 'S But everyone was back to handshakes and up-close chats. President Biden lingered in the chamber for 17 minutes after his remarks concluded, signing copies of the speech and talking with lawmakers. Unartfully, Democrats got the political optic they needed. But something else happened on State of the Union day which never unfolded before during the pandemic. A record six lawmakers tested positive for . Reps. Dwight Evans, D-Penn., Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., Jamie Raskin, D-Md., Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., Ted Deutch, D-Fla. and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., all tested positive. No more than two members ever tested positive on any one day during the entire pandemic. Granted, there may have been so many positive tests because members sought out tests to gain admittance to the speech. But six positives – just for members – is significant. Congress has proven itself to be a reliable barometer as to where the country stands with . A spike in cases among members usually mirrors a spike in cases around the country. A good example came in December. Lawmakers began contracting just before Christmas as the omicron wave spread. The numbers shot up on Capitol Hill in January, mimicking national coronavirus stats. Then the numbers dipped precipitously in Congress – matching the decline around the country. Either way, the outbreak of cases, pitted against an unmasked speech, doesn’t mesh. Then there is the internal squabbling on both sides of the aisle which also sends mixed messages. Democrats find themselves at odds over addressing energy needs amid the war in Ukraine. The price for a barrel of oil skyrocketed to $111 Wednesday. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., is pushing for an increase in domestic oil production. Republicans are appropriating the Ukraine crisis to push the Biden Administration to approve pipeline construction and leases for drilling. But there’s a schism. Manchin’s ideas run crossways with progressives and those pushing the Green New Deal. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said she was disappointed President Biden didn’t address climate change in the speech. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., sidestepped a question from yours truly when asked if Manchin’s energy ideas were problematic for the core of the Democratic Party. Senator Joe Manchin arrives for the impeachment trial of President Trump on Capitol Hill Jan. 30, 2020, in Washington, D.C. ‘-’ ""The U.S. is a major oil producer. We only get one percent of imports from Russia,"" said Schumer. ""The real problem with gas prices is gouging and monopolies. Democrats are focused on those two issues. We are focused very strongly. You’re going to hear a lot more from us on those issues in the future."" But there was dissonance on the side, too. At the outset of the Cold War, late Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, R-Mich., said that foreign policy ""stopped at the water’s edge."" In today’s toxic political environment, the water’s edge qualifies as an Superfund site. Fox News asked House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., if there was danger for the to hypercriticize President Biden during an international crisis or if they could strike a balance. Especially for State of the Union. ""Are we going to sit down and be quiet? No,"" replied McCarthy. ""We’re not going to sit quietly by."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said there was ""broad support"" for President Biden’s approach to Ukraine. ""But what took him so long?"" People take shelter at a building basement while the sirens sound, announcing new attacks in the city of Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, Feb. 25, 2022. President Biden devoted 12 minutes of his 72-minute oratory to the war in Ukraine. Members festooned their suits and blouses with blue and yellow Ukrainian flag lapels for the speech. Republicans and Democrats may disagree vehemently on a great many subjects – ranging from the riot at the Capitol to executive branch nominees. But after some initial grousing, Congress came together over Ukraine. Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., was born in Ukraine under the Soviet regime in 1978. She was near tears when speaking about the atrocities in her homeland. ""My grandma is 95. She experienced Stalin. She experienced Hitler. But she says we never experienced something like ever,"" said Spartz. The congresswoman characterized the war as a ""genocide."" Spartz then lobbed serious criticism at President Biden. ""We can get together as Republicans and Democrats. But must act decisively. Fast. Or, the blood of many millions of Ukrainians will be on his hands, too,"" said Spartz. The House this week approved a resolution to stand by the people of Ukraine. The vote was 426-3. Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., all voted nay. In other words, Congress stands with Ukraine. Mostly. Another mixed message.",13

Chris Christie blasts the Biden administration’s foreign policy after Russia invaded Ukraine. Former Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told ""The Brian Kilmeade Show"" Friday that President Biden should be doing the ""opposite"" of his foreign policy instincts, criticizing the administration's approach to Russia over the past year. Christie said Biden has been consistently wrong on foreign policy in his career and hesitates to make decisions. - : : It's a lack of leadership on our part to start with, out of the White House. I mean, if people would have taken it seriously. If we were doing what we should have been doing from the time Joe Biden got into office, which was to arm the Ukrainians. President Zelenskyy was begging for it. Joe Biden cut off arms to the Ukrainians, and I think the rest of the world looks at it and says, 'Well, you know, if the Americans don't think it's serious enough to arm Ukrainians, why should we think it's that serious?' A complete lack of spine by the president and a lack of judgment. Well, let's face it, this is the guy who Robert Gates, the former defense secretary, said has been wrong on every major foreign policy issue for the last 40 years, and that streak is intact. … And this is where American leadership is indispensable. … The rest of the world waits to see our signal. They waited and waited and finally, they couldn't wait any longer. And so this is why Joe Biden is such a failure as president in foreign policy. When he makes decisions, he makes the wrong ones, like the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and when he hesitates, he shouldn't be hesitating. This guy should be like George Costanza on the old ‘Seinfeld’ and just start doing the opposite of whatever he thinks he should do and he'd probably be right.",9

The delegation is made up of Democrats and Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a united front to condemn the brutal war launched by Russia and to stand in support of the Ukrainian people. The trip is especially meaningful for Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., who lived in Ukraine when he was an agent. He worked with Ukrainian law enforcement and government on anti-corruption, cyber security and counterintelligence efforts to counter Russia. : ""This is personal to me. These are my friends over there,"" Fitzpatrick told Fox News Digital in an interview. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., talks about his planned trip to the Ukraine border on March 4, 2022 with Fox News Digital. ""The Ukrainians are showing the world why they should have been in the a long time ago why they should have been in a long time ago,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""The world is seeing the courage of Ukraine and Ukrainian people right now."" The lawmakers want to ensure the military equipment the U.S. and allies have provided is effectively making it into Ukrainian hands and to assess the humanitarian needs – such as food, water and energy resources. There's a large influx of Ukrainian refugees crossing into Poland to escape the war launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin, and they will need assistance. - ' 'S The lawmakers will also be investigating potential war crimes that have been committed by Putin, Fitzpatrick said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has attempted to silence non-state media. ""This is beyond war. This is terrorism,"" Fitzpatrick said, noting the Russian attack on the largest nuclear plant in Europe. ""Vladimir Putin is a war criminal. Everybody's always known that."" The delegation is planning to stay in the region through Monday and Fitzpatrick hopes he may be able to cross into Ukraine. ' ' : . ""I will go as far into that territory as they will allow me to go,"" Fitzpatrick said of the military escorts coordinating the trip. ""I'd go to Kyiv if they let me,"" he said.

Gregory Meeks of New York, David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Gerry Connolly of Virginia. The delegation is planning to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has been traveling in the region, Ambassador Mark Brzezinski, national and local and Polish officials and Ukrainian civil society activists, according to Connolly's office. They'll also receive briefings from the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division and visit with U.S. service members.

""I will continue to urge this administration to send more lethal assistance to the brave Ukrainian people fighting for their freedom."" McCaul and other Republicans have been frustrated with what they believe is too slow of a U.S. response, on everything from sanctions to cutting off Russian oil imports. ""The free world needs America to lead,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""We can't be in a situation where Canada is the first to block Russian oil imports, and then we follow suit.

Liberal media was criticized in some corners following the chaotic withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan for failing to hold President Biden accountable, a trend that could be repeating itself following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Immediately after the war began, fingers began pointing at former President Donald Trump, and even the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters for the invasion. contributor Garrett Graff told his Twitter followers there was a ""straight line"" from the 2016 election to the Jan. 6 riot, to the day Russia invaded Ukraine. : ’s Jake Tapper suggested Biden was not ""getting credit"" for his handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine. ""It’s just empirically factual that [Biden] has led the way even when he allowed Europe to act as though they’re leading the way … So he’s not getting credit for the things he’s handling ,"" Tapper said.

After 192 performances at the Metropolitan Opera, soprano Anna Netrebko will not be performing this year due to her support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Met made several attempts to convince Netrebko, who has made statements critical of the war, to rebuke Putin but failed to persuade the singer. ""It is a great artistic loss for the Met and for opera,"" General Manager Peter Gelb said in a statement Thursday.

R. : Sadly, I think he has a little bit longer to go. And, you know, of course, he's running out of options, right? He thought this was going to be easy. He thought he could do it in a few days. He thought the Ukrainian people would welcome him. He believed his own propaganda and disinformation, which you just covered so well. And so, what's he left with? He's left with more devastation. And this follows kind of the playbook of the Russians. I mean, they've enabled serial episodes of mass homicide in the Syrian Civil War. And if you think back to Chechnya, the Chechnya interventions in the 1990s, Putin presided over the last one in 1999 where they essentially dealt with Chechnya rebels in Grozny by just leveling the city. So, I mean, there's tough times ahead for the Ukrainian people. They deserve all the support we can give them. But I don't think, you know, I don't think Russia could be able to accomplish its objectives, but he can certainly inflict a heck of a lot more pain and suffering and make what is already a humanitarian crisis much worse.",0

Russian President Vladimir Putin The speech comes after some Republicans have objected to 's expansion and seemingly downplayed the need for the United States to get involved in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The former vice-president will call on Republicans to demand that the Biden administration increases military spending ""immediately"", arms Ukraine with more lethal weapons, and sanction ""all"" financial institutions in Russia. - Pence, who some believe has ambitions to run for president in 2024, will also take several shots at President Biden’s foreign policy record.

The already challenging path to bringing home Americans jailed in Russia and Ukraine is likely even more complicated now with a war overwhelming the region and increasingly hostile relations between the United States and the Kremlin. Marine veteran Trevor Reed and corporate security executive Paul Whelan are each serving lengthy prison sentences in Russia, but their families have long held out hope for some sort of deal — including a possible prisoner exchange — that could get their loved ones home. Now, though, that seems a much harder ask. ""I can’t help but think that this is not going to help Trevor get released sooner, obviously,"" Reed's mother, Paula Reed, said in an interview with The Associated Press. Joey and Paula Reed pose for a photo with a portrait of their son, Marine veteran and Russian prisoner Trevor Reed, at their home in Fort Worth, Texas, Feb. 15, 2022. : ‘I ’ The war with Ukraine has not only occupied global attention, but it has also led to punishing economic sanctions by the U.S. and escalating Russian aggression in the face of international condemnation over its invasion. Though the conflict has not closed off avenues for bringing home Reed and Whelan, the prospect of concessions by either side anytime soon is eclipsed by the likelihood of continued antagonism by Russia. ""If this becomes long and drawn out, and they take over Ukraine, then the Western countries and the United States are going to be at odds with Russia for a long time,"" said Reed's father, Joey Reed. ""That could lead to additional charges against our son, if he lives, and keep him there indefinitely, which is not uncommon in Russia."" He said he was particularly concerned about a loss of communications between the two superpowers that could foreclose any possibility of the U.S. government getting him home. ""We've been told that even during the Cold War, they kept channels open. Even Kennedy was able to talk to Khrushchev during the Cuban missile crisis,"" Reed said. ""Anyone that's advocating for closing embassies and cutting them off, that's a gigantic mistake when two major nuclear powers are not speaking and are at odds with each other."" State Department principal deputy press spokeswoman Jalina Porter, asked by the Thursday about how the war affected the cases of all three men, said only that the administration’s top priority is the ""safety and security of all Americans,"" including Reed and Whelan.

He has struggled with health issues behind bars, most recently coughing up blood this week, his father said. He is regarded by the U.S. government as a wrongful detainee, as is Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in prison on espionage-related charges that his family says are entirely bogus. Whelan's sister, Elizabeth, said she's been ""doom-scrolling"" news about the war on Twitter like everyone else, concerned about the impact of the war on her brother and the possibility of another ""Iron Curtain"" falling in the region. She said the U.S. could use the conflict as a fresh opportunity to press for the release of Reed and Whelan by making it a condition of any lifting of the sanctions against Russia, though it is not clear that that would happen. Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was arrested for alleged spying, listens to the verdict in a courtroom at the Moscow City Court in Moscow, Russia, June 15, 2020. 'S ?

Ukraine, meanwhile, is holding North Dakota farmer Kurt Groszhans, accused in a plot to assassinate a current member of the country's political cabinet. His family and supporters say the charges are trumped up, and were designed to silence Groszhan's own allegations of government corruption in Ukraine. Kristi Magnusson, Groszhan's sister, said in a statement provided to that she was concerned that the State Department was not ""advocating for his release because it would be inferring that Ukraine is engaged in corrupt activities right at a time when State is focused on being as supportive as possible of Ukraine against the Russians.

One is continuing to make sure that Ukraine can defend itself, and they are defending themselves. And as we just talked about a few minutes ago, we're helping them do that, and we're trying to do that as fast as possible. Number two: Making sure that can defend itself, and that's why the president has ordered additional troops over to Europe. That's why we repositioned troops inside Europe to elsewhere on 's eastern flank. We're making sure that we can make positive that we can defend 's territory, that we're making it clear to Mr. Putin and to our allies how seriously we take our Article 5 commitments under the 's treaty. … Our mission is to make sure Ukraine can continue to defend itself. And look, Mr. Putin has a lot of options available to him. We've all seen the military options that he so recklessly is willing to use against the Ukrainian people, people who pose no threat to him or to the Russian people. The other option he has available to him is diplomacy. He could deescalate this right now.

And look at anything else she's been given in her strange portfolio — not solved any of it. So who do you send to solve the most intractable problem of the moment and the potential for World War , but Kamala Harris. … It's possible [President Biden] is expecting that Kamala will say so many banal things for such a long time that the conflict will be over by then. Remember, she went to Munich the other day, and she told the Europeans that they had to remember they were in Europe, and that there was a war, and therefore this meant there was a war in Europe.

Michael Beckley, an associate professor of political science at Tufts University, said China could take action in Taiwan while the U.S. is distracted with Russia's siege on Ukraine. He said conflict between the U.S. and China would most likely break out if the authoritarian superpower were to take military action in Taiwan. ""The United States and China, I think, are at very high risk of conflict,"" Beckley, the co-author of the upcoming book ""Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China,"" told Fox News. ""Not just economic competition or ideological competition, but an actual war."" Beckley told Fox News that a slowing Chinese economy, rising sentiments of Taiwanese independence and increasing international pressure to contain China’s growth make conflict more likely. Professor Michael Beckley, co-author of ""Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China"" ’S , ""There’s a lot of chatter suggesting that if China is going to move on Taiwan that now would be the opportune time,"" Beckley told Fox News. ""The Russia conflict plays into this because of course it’s a big distraction for the United States."" In October, President Biden pledged to defend Taiwan if China attacked. The U.S., under the Taiwan Relations Act, provides defensive weapons to Taiwan, but it is not obligated to provide military support if China were to invade. President Xi ) Beckley told Fox News that the conflict in Ukraine limits the resources the U.S. can dedicate to protecting Taiwan from China. ""If Russia and China are each fighting back-to-back in their own regions, that's going to overstretch American forces, give them each opportunities to make inroads in their own regions and I think heightens the risk of a conflict over something like Taiwan this decade,"" Beckley told Fox News. Beckley also noted that Russia and China share mutual interests based ""based on geopolitics, on energy, and on a common ideological aversion to the current international system."" Beckley called trade between the two nations a ""natural partnership based on an absolutely vital commodity."" China imports over 80% of the oil and natural gas that it consumes and over half of Russia’s government revenue stems from selling gas and oil to foreign countries, according to Beckley. The two countries also share an interest in ""pushing back against the liberal international order that the United States and its mostly democratic allies sustain,"" Beckley said. The Chinese-Russian relationship features an ""asymmetry in power"" based on China’s military and economic might, according to Beckley. ""China’s economy is 10 times the size of Russia’s,"" Beckley told Fox News. ""China spends four times as much every year on its military as Russia does, and China is really a multi-dimensional, great power."" ""As a result, Russia is always worried of becoming the junior partner in the relationship, and China is always worried that it will give more than it gets,"" Beckley continued. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping Beckley added that there are schisms in Russia and China’s geopolitical interests including border disputes, Central Asian spheres of influence and historical hostilities. Chinese financial interests counter Beijing’s diplomatic support of Russia, according to Beckley. Chinese banks have ""walked back"" some of their transactions with Russia in ""basic, tacit compliance"" with recent sanctions. ""China, on the one hand, wants to support Russia but is not willing to go to the full extent as an ally would because it worries that it'll get cut off from the Western economic system and invite hostility towards itself,"" Beckley told Fox News. China has not imposed sanctions on Russia, according to Reuters. Beckley told Fox News that there are three strategic rationales for this policy. ""First of all, I think the Chinese are worried that if they are to make moves on Taiwan or to get more aggressive or simply a spark the ire of the United States and its allies, they too could be subject to similar sanctions,"" Beckley said. ""And so they want to start undermining the legitimacy of this sort of ganging up on a great power."" Second, Beckley told Fox News that abstaining from imposing sanctions allows Chinese institutions to avoid getting ""caught up in a broader conflict.""",5

Russian authoritarian President Vladimir Putin can be best compared to a gangster who incrementally takes control of his neighborhood while no one stands up to him, until it is too late, Joe Piscopo said on his radio program Friday. The East Coast radio host reported on news overnight that Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant near Enerhodar, Ukraine – the largest on the European continent – took Russian artillery fire and was eventually overtaken by Kremlin forces. His swipe at President Biden was clear. ""Look where we are,"" Piscopo lamented. ""It is because there is nobody in the Oval Office – there's nobody in charge."" He said that until recently, the United States ""led the way"" in the world on multiple fronts and that now, under Biden, America has taken a backseat and allowed nefarious individuals like Putin to exact their own geopolitical plans. : Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin [composite] ""If you take that attitude that, 'Look, we know what’s best for us, we believe in America – we're strong and we have a military and we know what would go,' then you could put people at bay,"" he said. ""It’s really like a gangster in the neighborhood back in the day,"" Piscopo continued.

Putin is just out of control, and I don’t care how corrupt Ukraine is, you don’t just kill innocent people,"" he said, noting that the ex- agent has overseen missile strikes on civilian populations and infrastructure. Piscopo contrasted Biden's leadership – or lack thereof – with that of Donald Trump, saying that when dealing with nefarious, ""crazy"" people, they are only cowed by people they see as crazier. ""When Donald Trump said to Vladimir Putin, you know, we're going to take out Moscow [if] you make one move toward Ukraine -- Putin is nuts, and say what you will about Donald Trump, you know, maybe he was a little off himself, God bless him, but we needed that.

Harris faced widespread criticism after she attempted to provide an explanation of the Ukraine crisis during an appearance on the ""The Morning Hustle"" last week. Asked at one point to explain the crisis overseas in ""layman's terms"" for concerned listeners, Harris responded slowly, ""Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine, so basically that’s wrong.""",9

Ukrainian Parliament Member Sviatoslav Yurash sounded off on Russia-Ukraine peace talks and the attack on Europe's largest nuclear power plant Friday on ""The Ingraham Angle."" : These talks are basically, from what I can see from Russian demands, are a mirage. Russians [have been] trying to essentially … from the very beginning … destroy our sovereignty, our independence, our will to become [an] independent nation. And they demand things which will never pass … These are things that basically destroy any chance for Ukraine to be its own state. So as far as conversation there, … I would point to these peace talks. We need to give them their bodies, and we have so many Russians [who] died already in Ukraine. The transfer of these bodies needs to be organized, and that's something to discuss [in] these negotiations. Also, we have hundreds of their P.O.W.s, and they have some of ours. We need to talk about that, too. … But as far as the actual ending to the warfare, unfortunately [the] Russians aren't giving it a chance. … [T]hey have been shelling that biggest nuclear power plant in Europe. The fact of the matter is, this is the way of them to [try] to hold Europe hostage. To say, ""You do anything, and we will blow this up. We will show you what [it] actually is [like] to fight with the Russians."" Essentially, that's the reality of what's happening. They have been reportedly mining the nuclear station. I've seen reports of that account. And the point is this will be their chip in their negotiations not with us, but with Europe trying to tell it to basically pull back.",0

Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told ""One Nation with Brian Kilmeade"" on Saturday what Russian President Vladimir Putin would need to achieve to secure Ukraine and install a puppet government. : He has nowhere near enough troops to put down a rebellion among millions of people in Ukraine, so he's going to have to keep a significant military force in Ukraine. He's probably going to have to increase it if he wants to hold on to that country, even if he imposes a puppet government, he's going to have to keep forces there to keep that government in power. So I think between having his hands full in Ukraine and the risk of a true war with , I think he'll be very cautious about doing anything that crosses borders of countries. Now I do think in the Baltic States, there is the chance that he will use intelligence means — cyber, covert operations and so on — to try and create unrest in those countries. Thirty percent of the population in Estonia and Latvia, both are Russians. And so I can see him trying to create problems in the Baltic countries, but I don't see him invading, and I would just make one final point. I think that what's really important here are the troops that the United States has sent, and it's not just the 101st Airborne and the 82nd Airborne, it's sending heavy armored brigades. This is serious stuff, and that's what's needed to send a signal to the Russians that crossing into a country, we mean business.

We're approaching the two-week mark of fighting, but despite all the press conferences, the tweets, the official statements, the debates, votes, and opinions, there are still a lot of very serious, open questions about how Vladimir Putin can keep his war machine supplied and funded. The fight can't go on indefinitely, so what's Putin's plan here? Question 1 here: First, the level of engagement by the Russian Air Force has been surprisingly minimal. … Military analysts are puzzled by Putin's failure to use all of his air assets to create his desired dystopian hellscape on the ground in Ukraine. Why is that? … Second, is Putin being strategic here and calculating with his ground forces? Also, if he's holding his ground forces back in this convoy, why? Is he bogged down? Did they not prepare? Does he really — another question here — want to destroy major cities like Kharkiv and Kyiv? Does he want to obliterate ports while planning to occupy them later? Kind of an asinine goal, right? Can he afford to rebuild them later? The answers to these questions are still unknown, but they have to be asked, and don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be intimidated.",0

And he's going to use every weapon he has … which will include cluster-bombs to take down that city. It's a city of about 3 million. … Putin does not bluff. When he said he was coming to Ukraine, he's going to go into Ukraine. And we should have been building up armaments back then. We didn't. We waited. And part of the reason we said, is because we believed if we did, it was going to be escalatory. Well, now we're too late.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is pledging support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the country's fight against Russia, beginning with an immediate ban on Russian oil and gas. Zelenskyy on Saturday spoke to U.S. senators and House members virtually as Congress weighs additional aid requests to help the country fight off a brutal Russian invasion. During a call with Fox News Digital immediately following the senate's zoom with the Ukrainian leader, the senator spoke of Zelenskyy's ""tremendous courage."" - : ""I thought it was very informative call. Obviously, he is showing tremendous courage both personally and then on behalf of the Ukrainian people.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seen in a Zoom call with U.S. senators on Saturday, March 5, 2022. Zelenskyy requested more lethal aid from the United States, including fighter planes, and a no-fly zone, which rejected yesterday, Hawley said. The most interesting thing Zelenskyy said, according to Hawley, was immediately enacting tougher sanctions, starting with a ban on Russian oil imports. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., asked him about a possible oil ban. Zelenskyy ""emphasized that getting tougher on the sanctions was very important,"" Hawley said. ""And he said repeatedly that an embargo on Russia and particularly their oil and natural gas, was absolutely critical."" ""I couldn't agree more on the need to sanction oil and natural gas on the need to stop the United States importing it,"" Hawley added. ""And I cannot believe that the Biden administration continues to keep our energy production turned off and allow the Russians to move forward."" The Missouri senator also told Fox News Digital that Zelenskyy expressed that he had wished sanctions by the U.S. on Russia had come earlier, which may have prevented a war from beginning in the first place. Hawley said the leader ""had hoped and wished that sanctions would have come earlier. And of course, he's exactly right if we had sanctioned Nord Stream 2 in particular…let's remember, Joe Biden came to office and lifted the sanctions on Nord Stream 2."" The senator pointed out that all Democrats voted against enacting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in December, which he said has been ""a very, very costly mistake on their part and is certainly something that they're going to have to answer for."" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022, in Orlando, Fla. Hawley demanded the Biden administration stop imports of Russian ""blood oil"" immediately. Hawley said he will ""continue to try and open up U.S. energy production and continue to try to get stops, American imports of Russian oil and natural gas. And I amazed at every passing day that this administration will not sanction their energy sector and will not open arms up. I just think it's indefensible, indefensible that we were importing hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil a day from Russia. This is blood oil and this is financing the war."" ""And yet Joe Biden won't do anything about it, and he will not turn on our energy production. And it is absolutely indefensible that is costing the people of Ukraine. It is costing them lives. At this point, it is costing the American people, our security and both in terms of our national security as well as economic security. And it is the president has got to reverse course on this. His position is totally indefensible."" The senator concluded by saying Zelenskyy was very ""resolute"" and is committed to carrying on the fight against Russia. , - 28: Sen.

Negotiations have been ongoing in Vienna for the United States to rejoin the international deal that President Trump pulled out of in 2018. Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China are still part of the deal with Iran and have been trying to salvage it. Republicans have long been skeptical of the Iran nuclear deal, but say the timing for any restart is particularly troubling given Russia's involvement during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. - : Rep.

The ramped-up concern is following reporting from the Wall Street Journal on March 3 that the U.S. and Iran were closing in on an agreement after weeks of intense negotiations in Vienna involving the U.S. and Iran, and Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. Officials from both the U.S. and Iran warned that they were still resolving sanctions relief provisions. A European diplomat told Fox News on Friday that a new deal is expected within days.

They gave them up based on our word, based on the commitment that the United States, the gave to Ukraine and to Kazakhstan as well.

2022-03-06,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-opera-singer-putin-met-cancels-jonathan-turley,"Russian opera singer and Putin – Met cancels artist, attacks free speech","Constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley on the fight for free speech after another musician called out those wanting to remove Joe Rogan from Spotify ""It is a great artistic loss for the Met and for opera."" Those words from the Metropolitan Opera manager Peter Gelb makes it sound like soprano Anna Netrebko has died or lost her voice in some accident. In reality, Netrebko was canceled for failing to denounce Vladimir Putin. As with the criminalization of support for Putin in some countries, the termination of Netrebko is an attack on free speech. It is perfectly bizarre for the Met to stand against tyranny by attacking free speech, the very right that combats tyranny in all forms. This is not just the day that the music died for Netrebko, it is the day that free speech died at the Met. – 'S Despite my strong support for Ukraine and condemnation of Putin, it is important for advocates of civil liberties and free speech to be vigilant in calling out such abusive measures. It is during wartime and periods of social discord that the greatest abuses can occur for those with dissenting or unpopular views. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulates Anna Netrebko after awarding her with the People's Artist of Russia honor in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Feb. 27, 2008. Before addressing this latest controversy, it is also important to respond to what has become a rationalization on the left for attacks on free speech in recent years: the First Amendment only protects speech from government crackdowns. The First Amendment is not the full or exclusive embodiment of free speech. It addresses just one of the dangers to free speech posed by government regulation. Many of us view free speech as a human right. Corporate censorship of social media clearly impacts free speech, and replacing Big Brother with a cadre of Little Brothers actually allows for far greater control of free expression. Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy testifies in Washington, March 8, 1950, before a Senate subcommittee investigating his charges about communist infiltration of the State Department. As I have noted earlier, while liberal writers and artists were blacklisted and investigated in the 1950s, liberal activists have succeeded in censoring opposing views to a degree that would have made Sen. Joe McCarthy, R-Wis., blush. Rather than burn books, they have simply gotten stores to ban them or blacklist the authors and artists. For these companies, there is no value to protecting the speech rights of dissenting voices with powerful politicians, academics and even some in the media demanding more censorship. No way forward? How about a free speech path where you allow an artist to perform for her art alone Now back to the Met. According to media reports, Met officials ""made several attempts to convince Netrebko, who has made statements critical of the war, to rebuke Putin but failed to persuade the singer."" That sounds a lot like coerced speech: say these words or you can no longer sing at the Met. That sounds a lot like something Putin is doing in Russia as we speak. Saying, ""Well, we are not Putin"" is not enough when you are acting in the same way by punishing political viewpoints. Netrebko has had 192 performances at the Metropolitan Opera, and is one of the world's most celebrated singers. Did she lose the ability to hit such high notes due to the low note she strikes on politics? Vladimir Putin and Alexander Ovechkin pose in the Kremlin on May 27, 2014, during a reception for the national team that won the ice hockey world championship that year. Other Russians have faced backlash over their past praise of Putin or failure to condemn him now. One such example is Washington Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin. Frankly, I have never been a fan of Ovechkin not only because I am a Blackhawks fan, but he has previously praised this blood-soaked tyrant. However, I would be the first to oppose any effort to bar him from the ice due to his political views . Unlike the Met, hockey officials generally supported the players. Yet, Gelb bizarrely says, ""Anna is one of the greatest singers in Met history, but with Putin killing innocent victims in Ukraine, there was no way forward."" No way forward? How about a free speech path where you allow an artist to perform for her art alone. Gelb and others can then use their free speech to condemn Putin or criticize Netrebko without silencing her on the stage. Netrebko has publicly stated, ""I am opposed to this senseless war of aggression, and I am calling on Russia to end this war right now to save all of us. We need peace right now."" Even that statement should not be necessary as a condition for her to perform. Are all opera singers now expected to repeat mantra-like the view of the Met or the majority? When many artists opposed the Vietnam War, there was widespread support for their free speech rights in opposing blacklisting. The same was true during the McCarthy period. Now, the very same people who celebrate such struggles as defining moments in our history are seeking to cancel artists for their political views. In this case, Netrebko is not even being targeted for saying something offensive but rather for not repeating the position of the majority on the war. Years ago, I wrote that there was a dangerous trend toward compelled speech: ""The line between punishing speech and compelling speech is easily crossed when free speech itself is viewed as a threat."" We appear to have crossed that line. In the end, the Met succeeded in silencing a talented artist because she would not use her voice to support the view of the majority. In doing so, the Met embraced orthodoxy over art. I have previously noted that the growing anti-free speech movement among artists and writers is self-destructive. Artists against free speech is like athletes against fitness. Artists need free speech to be able to create and perform freely. To see artists leading an anti-free speech movement is a form of self-condemnation.",6

As the United States continues to engage Russia diplomatically and economically in hopes of securing a peaceful resolution to this unjustified invasion, we must make clear that Russia will release these two prisoners or continue to suffer economic sanctions."" ‘’ ‘ ’: The candidate's press release pointed to Paul Whelan, a former Marine, and Trevor Reed, who were detained in Russia in 2020 on charges that U.S. officials have deemed illegitimate. Biden mentioned their cases in a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2021. Russian authorities detained champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner in February. Griner faces up to 10 years in prison after customs officers found ""vapes"" containing hashish oil in her luggage, reports say. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an all-out invasion of Ukraine only eight months after Time magazine billed President Biden as ready to take on Putin. Killmeyer praised former President Donald Trump, who secured the release of notable hostages such as Pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey. ""Unlike President Trump, President Biden continues failing to prioritize American hostages and the high number of wrongfully detained Americans around the world,"" Killmeyer added. He also called on Biden to combat Russia in the energy sector. ""In the meantime, President Biden must establish leverage over Russia reversing his misguided restrictions on oil and gas production, and finally sanctioning oil and gas produced in Russia,"" Killmeyer said.

Barr, who served as attorney general during the Trump administration, said it is difficult to see how the current war comes to an end while Putin is still leading Russia. : Attorney General William Barr speaks during a news conference. ""I think Russia has been substantially diminished no matter what happens. They're not 10 feet, they're obviously not 10 feet tall,"" he said. Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, Barr said he ""felt that that Putin would view Biden as weak and would try to take advantage of that by moving, by grabbing whatever he wanted."" Barr also called the Russia collusion investigation a ""despicable dirty trick"" by his and Trump's opponents that ""hobbled"" the first part of the administration, leading him to predict that Putin would ""pursue Russian strategic goals more assertively."" The added consequence, he said, was that the probe and its continued media firestorm essentially froze relations between Russia and the United States, to the detriment of the U.S. as a whole. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to female flight attendants in comments broadcast on state television on Saturday, March 5, 2022. ""When Biden won, I felt that there would be no incentive on the part of the Russians to try to use diplomacy to reach a stable modus vivendi and that they would just grab what they wanted under Biden,"" Barr said.

Jesse Watters said Monday that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was a proxy war between the West and Russia. Watters said he believes Biden's foreign policy decisions, including ""dangling membership over Ukraine's head"" enticed Russian President Vladimir Putin to push forward on his expansionist ambitions. President Joe Biden ditched his signature mask for his first State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. ""This move directly taunted Putin. He was furious and accelerated his mobilization against his neighbor. Did we have a plan for Ukraine? What did we expect?"" the ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" host said.

2022-03-07,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putin-ukraine-war-us-europe-operation-energy-independence-gingrich-mcfarland-forbes-moore,Putin's Ukraine war shows need for US-Europe 'Operation Energy Independence',"The former speaker of the House discusses President Biden, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and defunding the police. Over the last two decades, American innovations led to unprecedented breakthroughs across all energy sectors, including renewables and traditional forms of energy. And for a brief recent period of time these gains helped to secure a monumental national achievement: U.S. energy independence. Sadly, in an even briefer period of time we quickly lost it due to policy decisions based on leftist Green New Deal political agendas embraced early on by the Biden administration. As a result, Americans are paying skyrocketing costs for energy, food and other daily staples. Domestic prices will be further exacerbated by the new security threats and global instability arising from Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. , All told, it is now abundantly clear the U.S. is in immediate need of a systemic reset of its energy policies. Yet, it was evident from President Biden’s State of the Union address that his administration is set to double down on the same misguided policies that led to the loss of our energy independence, naively sticking to an almost exclusive focus on renewable energies at the expense of America’s vast arsenal of more conventional energy assets. Even more bizarre was former Secretary of State John Kerry’s recent tone-deaf commentary over the potential impact of battlefield emissions and concerns over whether war in Ukraine might distract Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attention from fighting climate change. Do today’s liberal political leaders in Washington really expect our global allies, adversaries and competitors to take the U.S. seriously with such nonsense? The world is not right at present. Accordingly, our clear objective here at home should be to quickly reestablish and permanently maintain U.S. energy independence. Not as a loosely held goal subject to varying political agendas, but as defined and permanent economic and national security imperatives. And we must do so by leveraging U.S. energy resources. Even European nations have now realized how blind allegiance to politically favored renewables and reliance on foreign energy sources threaten their economies and sovereignty, and they are changing course accordingly. If the right public policy choices are made, U.S. energy independence can be reestablished in short order. Not dissimilar from Operation Warp Speed, which mobilized U.S. innovators, manufacturers and other front-line industries to produce a vaccine for -19 in record time, we must now unshackle our full array of energy resources and technologies to meet today’s clear and present dangers. Looking abroad, we must recognize that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has been enabled by two primary catalysts: unnecessarily high global energy prices and Europe’s reliance on Russian energy exports. Sadly, the Biden administration’s ""keystoning"" of critical domestic energy investments, punitive tax and regulatory policies, and the waiving off of Russian sanctions that helped to drive oil up over $100 per barrel have given Putin predictable leverage and additional means to generate billions to finance his military ambitions. To address these challenges, there are four overarching objectives the U.S. needs to pursue. First, we must immediately leverage America’s vast and diverse array of resources and technologies across the entire energy spectrum, including all types of renewable and traditional assets. To do so, we must quickly clear the decks of unnecessary legislative, regulatory and legal roadblocks impacting domestic production and global supplies. Second, U.S. energy policy can no longer be subject to the political seesaw of whichever political party holds majority power at any particular time. This includes rampant regulatory and legal overreach based on political preferences. Doing so has led to an unstable and contradictory environment for critical public and private investments, resulting in unsustainable price shocks for American businesses, families and consumers. We must therefore apply realistic cost-benefit analysis to all current and future energy policies. Third, technological viability assessments and national security threats must be fully evaluated and addressed within all government energy programs and policies. For example, much emphasis has been placed on electrifying large portions of our nation’s transportation system, while ignoring that the U.S. is currently dependent on raw materials from countries such as China. Meanwhile, federal and state politicians continue to set costly emissions requirements and price-spiraling fuel standards that are questionable in terms of environmental benefits or knowingly impossible to achieve. Fourth, in the coming days and months we must make available cheap, clean and affordable energy to our European and Asian allies to deny Putin and other rogue actors the wherewithal to threaten or hold allied nations hostage over energy supplies. We must also help support our allies in diversifying their own energy resources and infrastructure to ensure their long-term safety and sovereignty. If the right public policy choices are made at the federal, state and local levels, U.S. energy independence can be reestablished in short order. This will require that we and other nations jettison many of the current domestic regulatory and political obstacles that impede our ability to produce and provide critical energy supplies in timely, cost-effective and safe manners. Ultimately, this approach – call it Operation Energy Independence – if embraced will lower energy costs and drive down inflation for all Americans while advancing greater peace and prosperity throughout the world.

's George Stephanopoulos said that climate change was an ""existential crisis"" during an exchange with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about domestic oil production amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Sunday's ""This Week."" Amid a discussion about the possibility of the U.S. banning Russian oil, Stephanopoulos asked Christie if the Republicans would ""forgo criticizing"" President Biden for increased gas prices if he makes the decision. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie. ""You have to do two things at the same time, and you should be able to. You have to ban Russian oil, and you have to increase domestic production. And that is where Joe Biden is going to have the problem because he's held captive by the environmental left,"" Christie said. : The former New Jersey governor noted comments from John Kerry in which he said the war could have ""profound negative impact on the climate."" The Biden administration climate envoy added he hopes Russian President Vladimir Putin ""will help us stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate."" ""That will summarize what the far left's view is about domestic oil production,"" Christie said. Stephanopoulos quickly shot back by citing a United Nations report that he summarized as saying climate change ""is an existential crisis and it's getting worse."" George Stephanopoulos. ""While people are being slaughtered? That's what Kerry is talking about?"" Christie asked as the other panelists tried to jump in. Panelist Donna Brazile interjected and said ""we can do two things at once."" : ""We can protect our planet, we can protect our earth, climate change is also real. That's why the only approach is not drill, drill, drill, our approach is to be strategic and make sure our European allies stick with us because it's going to get very painful,"" she continued, applauding Biden and his actions so far. ""It should have happened a long time ago,"" Christie said earlier in the segment of the potential oil ban. ""We should have been arming the Ukrainians for the last year, we weren't. We should have been doing much more on domestic production of oil, instead we're going backwards, and we gave Putin the card to hold us hostage.""

2022-03-07,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/china-xi-russia-putin-biden-claire-christensen,China's Xi and Russia's Putin backstab Biden,"In President Joe Biden’s address to the nation last Thursday, following the Russian land, sea, and air invasion of Ukraine, he admitted that no one thought sanctions would stop President Vladimir Putin from carrying out the largest attack against a European state since World War . Let’s set aside that Biden admitted his own strategy in anticipation of the invasion was flawed – even though his administration considered it a certainty. If he didn’t expect sanctions to stop Putin, what then did he think would deter the crisis in Ukraine from erupting? Apparently, the Biden administration bet the Chinese Communist Party would help out. ‘ ,’ - ‘ ,’ The New York Times last Friday, reported, ""Over three months, senior Biden administration officials held half a dozen urgent meetings with top Chinese officials in which the Americans presented intelligence showing Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine and beseeched the Chinese to tell Russia not to invade, according to U.S. officials."" Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to female flight attendants in comments broadcast on state television on Saturday, March 5, 2022. After one of the talks in December, the Biden administration learned that instead of Communist China’s officials persuading Putin to pull back, ""Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord – and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions."" Reading between the lines, this sudden release of information by the Biden administration appears to spin the message that President Biden tried to stop Putin’s invasion months ago, and he blames the Chinese Communist Party for not following his request. As former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and I detailed in ""Trump vs China: Facing America’s Greatest Threat,"" the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for a lengthy list of violent, oppressive, and deceitful transgressions – not least of which includes the genocide in Xinjiang, the coverup of the origins of the -19 pandemic, and the elimination of freedom and autonomy in Hong Kong. ‘’ : ‘ ’ If you study the actions of the Chinese Communist Party since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, it is clear their officials’ response to the U.S. request should be expected. It’s perfectly in accordance with the Party’s pursuit to make China the global superpower by 2049. Why on Earth would the president of the United States of America rely on an adversary to diffuse a dangerous escalation by a foreign dictator? Further, while the Chinese Communist Party and the Kremlin do not have a formal alliance, they are strategic partners . . , Before this year, Xi and Putin met 37 times. Just last month, they met again and issued a more than 5,000-word joint statement which articulated a ""redistribution of power in the world"" and criticized the United States by name six times. Xi affectionately refers to Putin as his ""best friend."" For evidence of their transactional comradery, look no further than the photos of Xi and Putin making pancakes together in 2018, taking a boat cruise along the Neva River in 2019, or the cake and ice cream that Putin gave Xi on his 66th birthday. Did the administration honestly believe that the Chinese Communist Party didn’t know what Russia had planned for Ukraine? Did the White House think Communist China would really side with the United States and stop Putin? What did President Biden honestly think these two ""best friends"" discussed when Putin went to China for the Genocide Olympics last month? It was never in Communist China’s interest to stop Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Ultimately, the Chinese Communist Party benefits from this aggression in the long term. First, the Party gets to learn the U.S. playbook for dealing with conflict between foreign countries . Sharing our intelligence with Communist China also could expose U.S. sources and methods of intelligence gathering in Russia. – China's President Xi Jinping addresses the press next to Argentina's President Mauricio Macri after a working meeting at the Olivos Presidential residence in Olivos, Buenos Aires on December 2, 2018. Now, regarding the possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the western response to the invasion of Ukraine may have given Xi cause for concern. However, the attack on Ukraine isn’t necessarily a perfect analogue. The U.S. economic relationship is much different with Russia than it is with China. We’ve repeatedly seen American companies fail to condemn the Chinese Communist Party for its genocide in Xinjiang. Instead, they pressure U.S. politicians to kill legislation that would hold the Party accountable. Furthermore, while Washington and media are watching Russia, the Chinese Communist Party is once again able to return to the playbook of Deng Xiaoping – hiding its capabilities and biding its time. After all, Congress remains gridlocked on enacting policies that strengthen America and counter the Chinese Communist Party’s ambitions , and President Biden has done a 180 degree turn from President Trump’s leadership in making this a priority. Amid these revelations, and in the aftermath of the weak State of the Union address, it is evident America needs a leader who will boldly and courageously stand up to the most dangerous threats our country currently faces. Let’s hope that President Biden starts living in reality – sooner rather than later.",5

And so we developed an intricate, deep set of intelligence relationships. That's a very important part so that we can make sure they have the info they need to defend themselves. And then we began, albeit not until I was secretary of state, to deliver real deal important equipment to the Ukrainians. If you look back, you think maybe we could have done more, but we did an awful lot more than any administration ever had, and it was the kind of equipment that not only was useful, but that they could train on readily. It's important not to give them things they can't use, but we gave them the kinds of things that you're seeing them now deploy. And we gave them the training to know how to use it as well.",0

She went on to say that Democrats have to run on with a message that they are looking after ""American interests"" and point to Biden's ""leadership"" on the global stage. Earlier in the week, Todd went to bat for the Biden administration over how voters view the economy. The liberal host went off on polling that showed a majority of people think the economy is in either a recession or depression, declaring it was ""just not true,"" and blaming the ""right-wing echo chamber"" for causing those views.

2022-03-07,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/cold-war-russia-china-ukraine-robert-maginnis,Here are 6 indicators of new Cold War against Russia and China,"Jesse Watters unpacks risks of Putin putting Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on alert amid rising tensions. The war in Ukraine is another indicator of our new cold war, which pits the U.S. and its allies against what I label the alliance of evil, Russia and China, which will create levels of anxiety not experienced since the end of the old Cold War. This new cold war is different from the old war which was mostly about ideology, communism versus democracy, pitting the U.S. and the former Soviet Union in a death struggle. Today’s conflict is between opposing world views, liberty versus authoritarianism. ‘’ : Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin during their meeting in Moscow, Russia. The old Cold War rose from the ashes of World War . Recall that President Franklin Roosevelt aligned us with Soviet Russia only because Adolf Hitler attacked Russia, which temporarily put aside our concerns about the communist regime. However, tensions quickly rose after the war when Russia seized much of Eastern Europe and detonated a nuclear bomb, which resurrected then-fresh memories of our devastating bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Cold War paranoia of a Soviet invasion and nuclear annihilation impacted our lives at school and work with mandated duck-and-cover drills, evacuations, and the sound of air raid sirens. Families built backyard fallout shelters, communities designated air raid facilities and the government proliferated educational films on how to survive a nuclear blast. There were warnings about communists in government which fed suspicions even about our neighbors’ sympathies. Tension increased as the nuclear arms race reached a pinnacle in 1962 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev sent nuclear-tipped missiles to Cuba. President John F. Kennedy responded by blockading Russian ships heading to Cuba. That confrontation was the closest the Cold War came to escalating to a full-scale Armageddon. The arms race also was linked with our space programs. In 1961, the Soviets put Yuri Gagarin into orbit, shocking the world and the U.S. responded by accelerating our program because of a concern the Russians would militarize space. Fortunately, the U.S. and Russia never directly fought the other. However, the period was marked by proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, Cambodia and Congo. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan came to office just in time to demonstrate unflinching fortitude and clarity of aim to lead the West to end the Cold War, by addressing the fight on many fronts. Most importantly Reagan knew that any appeasement to Moscow was as good as aiding a ruthless enemy. Today, a new existential conflict is threatening the world thanks to the alignment of the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation. Last month, China’s President Xi Jinping and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin met in Beijing, where they released a joint communiqué, which former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman labeled ""… a declaration of ideological and geopolitical war against the …."" There are at least 6 indicators of that new cold war, which I address in my 2018 book, ""Alliance of Evil."" Consider some recent examples of Chinese and Russian behavior associated with a few of those indicators. Relations between the U.S. and both Russia and China are in the toilet. For example, on Feb. 26, 2022, Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, said Moscow may react to Western sanctions imposed for the Ukraine invasion by severing all diplomatic ties. Many Western leaders indicate that China and Russia are seeking to ""replace the existing international rules"" with their own. European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Moscow of a ""blatant attempt"" to revamp global order. She said that Russia and China want to ""replace the existing international rules – they prefer the rule of the strongest to the rule of law, intimidation instead of self-determination."" Both Russia and China are persistent violators of economic and trade agreements. China seeks ascendancy as the world’s dominant producer of industrial goods and is doing that by violating many World Trade Organization rules, cornering global markets on key commodities, conducting financial warfare using mercantilist behaviors and manipulating its currency. President Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative, that touches many countries, is a ""debt trap,"" according to British 6 chief, Richard Moore. It leaves behind half-built bridges, overbudget railways and mountains of debt, Moore said. Both Russia and China spend more of their gross domestic product on defense than the global average, and much of their security investment is hidden, which makes comparisons with the U.S. meaningless. Chinese defense spending has dramatically increased each year over the past three decades, by more than 250% over the past decade, according to Janes. China’s defense budget amounts to 2.5% of , according to the Pentagon. Thanks to heavy investment, both Russia and China are building large and sophisticated militaries to contest the on a peer basis. The Pentagon’s 2021 report on China’s People’s Liberation Army indicates it fields the largest force in the world and seeks ""complete modernization by 2035."" Further, as evidence of its global ambitions, the "" [is] developing capabilities to conduct joint long-range precision strikes across domains, increasingly sophisticated space, counterspace, and cyber capabilities, and accelerating the large-scale expansion of its nuclear forces."" Although Russia has a giant nuclear arsenal , and threatens to abandon the New treaty which limits each country, China is creating a serious new threat. The is modernizing and rapidly expanding its nuclear forces – land, sea and air delivery platforms. It has increased it capacity to produce plutonium-239, necessary to build nuclear weapons. Further, the 2021 Pentagon report indicates the regime is expected to accelerate weapons production to at least 1,000 warheads by 2030. Let there be no doubt, the China-Russia authoritarian alliance is very real, and threatens our world. Both Xi and Putin intend to dominate our future no matter the cost, and Ukraine and perhaps a coming attack on Taiwan are just the beginning. My book, ""Alliance of Evil,"" details more indicators of this new cold war. The case for this war is hard to deny, especially given recent developments. Further, the whole world may soon begin to experience the constant, nagging anxiety that was all too familiar for my generation during the old Cold War. . .",22

""The Act will ensure the U.S. sends a clear message to the and that any efforts to assist Russia in evading U.S.-imposed sanctions will not be tolerated and will be met with severe costs. As authoritarian regimes seek to undermine and destroy freedom and democracy around the world, the United States must demonstrate leadership, unity and strength."" ""As Russia's unprovoked attack against Ukraine rages on, we need to continue working with our allies and partners to economically punish and isolate the Putin regime through sanctions and property seizure, but we need those punishments to stick,"" Slotkin said. ""The way Russia has cozied up to the Chinese in recent months is concerning, and we need to make sure China isn’t helping Putin and his cronies evade sanctions and, by extension, supporting this appalling, violent invasion of a sovereign country. The Act will make sure that the U.S. investigates whether Beijing is assisting Moscow and develops a clear strategy to block the Chinese government from helping Putin avoid the consequences of his actions.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, June 5, 2019. A Western intelligence report last week shows that Chinese officials had at least some knowledge of Russia’s plan to invade Ukraine. The report detailed that Chinese officials called on Russia to put off the invasion of Ukraine until after the Olympics in Beijing. China has denied the report as ""speculation.""

The bill introduced in the House Monday demands that an unclassified report be submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committees in the House and Senate within 90 days of its enactment.

Zelenskyy will receive the Reagan Freedom Award for his ""indomitable stance for freedom and democracy"" as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues for a twelfth day – an award the foundation said it plans to give him ""in person someday."" In an interview with Fox News Digital, the foundation's executive director John Heubusch said it shared the news of the award with Zelenskyy by letter, which was delivered by Chairman Fred Ryan during a meeting with Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seen in a Zoom call with U.S. senators on Saturday, March 5, 2022. ""It is a very big deal, and not something that is given annually, but, rather, at events and moments like we’re seeing here, when a world leader steps forward with the kind of courage Ronald Reagan would admire, to fight for freedom,"" Heubusch told Fox News. ""And that’s precisely what President Zelenskyy is doing."" ""We look forward, after he is victorious here in fighting Putin and Russia, to giving him that award in person someday,"" Heubusch said. The award is considered the ""highest civilian honor"" bestowed by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute, and is given to those who have made ""monumental and lasting contributions to the cause of freedom worldwide."" In May 1992, President Reagan gave the award to former General Secretary and President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev. President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev outside the villa Fleur D'Eau at Versoix near Geneva, on Nov. 19, 1985. ""How times have changed, right?"" Heubusch told Fox News Digital. ""Because, Gorbachev, who dismantled the former Soviet Union, was one of the first world leaders to receive the award, personally from Ronald Reagan in 1992. ‘ ’ ""Thirty years later, Zelenskyy is fighting a tyrant who is trying to glue the Soviet Union back together,"" Heubusch said. ""So what goes around, comes around."" On June 12, 1987, Reagan challenged Gorbachev to deliver on international peace and progressive policies. His challenge was heard around the world during a speech that marked a turning point in the Cold War. ""General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here, to this gate,"" Reagan said. ""Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.""

Bush, among others. One characteristic all award recipients have in common, Heubusch told Fox News, is ""a willingness to fight for freedom."" ""Any one word that people associate with Reagan is the word freedom,"" Heubusch told Fox News Digital. Zelenskyy was sworn in as the president of Ukraine on May 20, 2019, and has become the ""face of Ukraine's resistance against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invading forces,"" the Reagan Foundation said, adding that while he was a ""political novice with no military background, President Zelenskyy has earned the respect of Ukraine and those around the world by refusing to flee the capital, urging Ukrainians to resist, and crafting a successful communications strategy that has won over European leaders and citizens.""

So, too, was a guy named Ronald Reagan — a former actor who, some even in his own party, frowned upon. And look how both stories have turned out,"" Heubusch said. ""Both were men of incredible courage and were willing to do anything to fight for freedom — Zelenskyy is proving that now and doing so every single day."" : Meanwhile, Heubusch, on behalf of the Reagan Foundation & Institute, said their ""hope is that the U.S. will do everything it conceivably can to support Zelenskyy, and that definitely includes the cessation of any goods or services, including oil and gas, from Russia."" ""We also believe that, right now, we’re in the middle of a little ‘too little, too late,’ and our hope is that the Biden administration pours it on, because if they don’t Ukraine could go in the way of the former captive nation."" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signs application for the membership of Ukraine in the European Union on Monday Feb 28, 2022 in this photo released by Parliament of Ukraine. Heubusch also warned that ""the Chinese, right now, are taking copious notes."" ""They are watching the world’s reaction to what’s happening in Ukraine, and that makes it all the more important that Zelenskyy is successful here and all the more important that we support him,"" Heubusch said. Heubusch told Fox News Digital that, in the long term, he believes that Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people ""are going to be victorious."" ""But it is going to be a very long struggle,"" he said. ""And I think the sooner that we can get them everything they need, the closer we are to the moment where this all ends.""",6
2022-03-08,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-cnn-others-strain-ukranian-plight-domestic,"MSNBC, CNN, others strain to liken Ukrainian plight to domestic political issues","Fox News' Bryan Llenas provides updates on the fallout from Russia's invasion. American pundits and liberal journalists have bent over backward to compare Ukrainians getting bombed and killed during Russia’s ongoing attack to the plight of Americans under Republican rule. Ukraine has been devastated since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion that has resulted in civilian deaths, destruction of cities and over 1.7 million refugees as women and children attempt to flee the war-torn nation. While Ukrainians are fighting for their lives, some pundits have been equating literal war to things such as voting rights and the Jan 6 Capitol riot. District Media Group President Beverly Hallberg told Fox News Digital that hyperbolic comments simply ""shut off dialog we should have on important issues"" in the United States. -: ’s Chuck Todd dinged President Biden for failing to make the comparison during his first State of the Union. ""This is a disservice to the American tradition of productive debate, and it is a disservice to the Ukrainian people who would gladly trade their problem for ours,"" Hallberg said. ""This is an attempt by the far left to continue with the faulty narrative that our democracy is under attack. They make these comparisons because there are little to no Biden administration victories to highlight, so they are trying to win midterms by keeping Jan. 6 and voting laws in the news,"" Hallberg added. ""But it will be to their own detriment as the American people see very clearly what war is and what it isn’t."" While the American people might realize the difference between war and liberal talking points, many members of the corporate media haven’t gotten the message. The Atlantic's David Frum appeared on last week and urged President Biden to blame the invasion of Ukraine on Republican ideology. ""These events have given the absolute lie to the false and idiotic idea of America First, America alone, our allies are worthless, having friends is not important,"" Frum said. ‘’ A ’ - Biden’s State of the Union address last Tuesday was the impetus for much of the punditry. ""The end of the speech was about American values just as it was in the beginning when he was talking about Ukraine and Biden wanting to make the point that American unity is one of the things that he was elected to foster is still on the agenda,"" senior political correspondent Abby Phillip said. Liberal pundits weren’t happy when President Biden failed to connect domestic issues to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. : anchors appeared particularly peeved that Biden didn’t tie Russia’s ruthless invasion of Ukraine to what the liberal network considers threats to American democracy. Joy Reid said Biden had an opportunity to ""take a really solid hit at Republicans for having supported Vladimir Putin,"" but whiffed on the chance. ""He did not mention the January 6 insurrection,"" Reid added. ""If you want to talk about a profound hit to our democracy, there’s nothing more profound than a violent physical attack on the very building he's standing in. That did not make it into the speech, I found that interesting."" ""There are critics, including Democrats, some really wanted him to tie the fight for democracy in Ukraine to the voting rights struggles and the challenges with American democracy here at home. He did not do that,"" correspondent Yamiche Alcindor said. ? The following day on ""Morning Joe,"" Al Sharpton said ""we must be consistent"" on messaging when rhetorically defending Ukraine. ""You cannot stand up to Putin and have a little Putin-ism in your own backyard,"" Sharpton said. ’s Al Sharpton said, ""You cannot stand up to Putin and have a little Putin-ism in your own back yard."" ’s Tiffany Cross had a similar stance when a guest said the war in Ukraine won’t stop the left from pushing their domestic agenda. ""I look at what's happening in Ukraine, and I see, you know, democracy can be a fragile thing, and it feels a bit fragile in America right now,"" Cross said. ""We’re seeing the Republican Party bleed it by 1,000 cuts."" On Sunday, ’s Chuck Todd also dinged Biden for failing to make the comparison during his first State of the Union. ""If there was one thing that surprised me about the president's State of the Union was the lack of connecting the fight for democracy and freedom abroad, with the fight for democracy at home,"" Todd said on ""Meet the Press."" Princeton University professor Eddie Glaude, a guest on the show, agreed and declared he was ""stunned"" at Biden’s missed opportunity. ""I was stunned. I mean it was an easy kind of rhetorical move,"" Glaude said. ""Let’s defend democracy abroad and secure democracy at home."" ‘ ’ - Todd then declared it would have been ""politically helpful"" if Biden could have somehow connected Ukraine to issues in America. ""We have to address the question of what's happening across the country in terms of the assault on voting rights. And we would also have to address the illiberal forces within our country that are driving the challenge to voter rights. So I didn't understand it and I thought it was a mistake,"" Glaude said. Last week, Todd was part of a similar conversation with Sharpton on . ""I'm curious, you know, to me, this moment of Bloody Sunday and what we're seeing in Europe, there is a connection. It's a fight for freedom, it’s a fight for democracy. And Rev, it’s a statement I thought we would hear from the president on Tuesday that connected the two. He didn't quite do that,"" Todd told Sharpton on "" Daily."" : '' Sharpton was in lockstep with Todd, making an apparent play for sprawling Democratic election overhauls that are currently stalled in Congress. ""You cannot fight, and you should, for the right for the people of Ukraine to have a democratic state and make decisions based on voting and then not deal with that same right to be upheld here in America,"" Sharpton said. ""So, as we look for and pray for the people in Ukraine, we need to also deal domestically. And I think that connection is very clear, and we need to make it clear."" Sharpton later added, ""We need to underscore that we cannot be global liberators and at home ignore the threat to democracy right here."" Media Research Center vice president Dan Gainor feels that journalists are typically eager to do the left’s job for them. ""In this case, that means tying a monstrous invasion to election laws in a free nation. It’s not about facts or even pushing a legitimate argument. It’s about Todd, Sharpton and the rest of the media mob pretending anyone who isn’t a leftist is akin to being a dictator,"" Gainor told Fox News Digital. ""There’s no ‘fight for democracy at home’ to use Chuck Todd’s words, unless you mean stopping the Biden administration from abusing the First Amendment and pushing censorship,"" Gainor said, noting that voter is supported by the majority of Americans. ""Every demographic group supports that -- just not any of the network news media,"" he said. DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall said this kind of punditry is ""quite misguided"" and will further damage the media’s already tarnished reputation. ""America is polarized politically, to be sure, but to compare America's policy struggles to Ukraine's desperate military fight for survival makes no sense at all. The pundits engaging in this kind of extreme rhetoric are certainly trying to exploit a serious international crisis in order to make political smears at home,"" McCall told Fox News Digital. ""The American media has a role to play in providing informed and rational analysis of both international and domestic challenges and this kind of flame throwing only contributes to diminishing public trust in media."" Meanwhile, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams even compared herself to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an appearance on Comedy Central’s ""The Daily Show"" last week. ""We are a stronger nation when we allow people to participate. And if we ever doubted that, the war that Putin is waging against Ukraine, President Zelenskyy said it -- I'm going to paraphrase him probably poorly -- he said this isn't a war on Ukraine. This is a war on democracy in Ukraine. When we allow democracy to be overtaken by those who want to choose who can be heard, and those choices are not based on anything but animus or inconvenience, then that is wrong. My mission is to make certain that everyone can cast a ballot,"" Abrams said. Abrams was swiftly mocked for the comparison, and others found issue with host Trevor Noah’s silence. ""Although he’s a comedy host and not a journalist, Noah still should’ve called Abrams out for that analogy because fighting against voter laws does not make you the same type of politician as one who has Russian hits squads coming after him because Moscow falsely labels him a Nazi,"" NewsBusters’ Alex Christy observed.",13

The parents of Trevor Reed, a U.S. Marine veteran, who is reportedly suffering health issues in a Russian prison, were denied a visit with President Biden as bilateral relations between Washington and Moscow continue to erode. Fort Worth, Texas, residents Joey and Paula Reed joined ""Fox & Friends First"" to discuss their son's imprisonment and how they were ""disheartened"" by the White House's decision given the severity of their son's circumstances.

The couple said their son has been coughing up blood ""all day long"" each day and has been denied medical treatment. ""He said that he'd been sick for a very long time,"" Paula Reed said. ""They were still denying his testing. He had that exposure in December, and he had symptoms that he wanted to be tested or receive medical treatment, which they were denying everything."" ""He sounds disheartened,"" she continued. ""He sounds a little bit hopeless for a release, and it was just a good thing to hear his voice, but also sad because he really sounds terrible."" Biden will be in Dallas on Tuesday, but the pair said there was not enough time in his schedule for a visit. ""We're happy that the administration and everyone in it is either working or spoken out forever, everyone, including the president, but we've met with just about everyone, but the president, and the president is the one who makes the final decision on these issues,"" Joey Reed said, expressing disappointment that the couple could not get a few minutes with the president.

2022-03-08,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-we-are-war-russia,"Tucker: We are at war with Russia, whether or not Congress has declared it","Fox News host reflects on the U.S. response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" Yesterday morning, Joe Biden's secretary of state, a man called Tony Blinken, went on to the Sunday show over at News to announce new policy toward Russia. Going forward, Blinken explained, the Biden administration will use Poland as a cutout to send fighter jets to the government of Ukraine. Those jets will be used to fight the Russian military. Blinken announced this in a calm, even tone that suggested this was conventional procedure, business as usual, nothing to worry about, just another weekend at the State Department. But in fact, it's not typical. It's a very big step. It could turn out to be a pivot point in history and for that reason, we want you to know entire exchange. : If, for instance, the Polish government, a member, wants to send fighter jets, does that get a green light from the or are you afraid that that will escalate tension? : No, ...that gets a green light. In fact, we're talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to..the Ukrainians. What could we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they're handing over to…the Ukrainians? ‘ ,’ ’ U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a media conference in Brussels on March 4, 2022. ""Are you afraid that will escalate tension?,"" asks the scriptwriter, because even a News anchor knows that sending fighter jets to a war usually does that. ""No,"" replies Tony Blinken, ""that gets a green light."" It's a remarkable exchange. What are we watching here, apart from a conversation between two incredibly shallow people who have limited contact with reality? What we're watching is the beginning of a war between the United States and Russia. If that sounds jarring, what else would you call it? Now you may support everything that Tony Blinken just said. Maybe you do support it, but let's not lie about what's happening. Let's be as honest and clear-eyed as we can be, especially now, because it matters. The Biden administration just inserted itself with force into the middle of a hot war between two foreign powers. That means the United States is now an active participant in a war. We are at war with Russia. Whether or not that war has been officially declared, whether or not Congress has authorized that war, all of that is irrelevant. That war is happening right now as we watch. Why is no one in Washington saying anything about this? Because they support it. They always have. Almost five years ago, way back in 2017, Rep. Eric Swalwell of California came on this show for another Russiagate debate, one of many. He came to let us know how Vladimir Putin had gotten Donald Trump elected president. It was all as stupid as you remember, it until the end of the interview when Swalwell said something odd and interesting. Swalwell explained that because Putin had installed Donald Trump secretly in the White House, the United States should now ""do everything we can to expand 's role."" In other words, we should let Ukraine join . That's odd. Why would he say that? Why would a policy so seemingly obscure— , Ukraine, What?— Why would that be a priority for some forgettable congressman from the East Bay? Well, simple, because getting Ukraine to join was the key to inciting war with Russia. We didn't get it at the time. Now it's obvious. Vladimir Putin just invaded Ukraine because he didn't want Ukraine to join . Putin certainly had other motives as well. People always do have multiple motives, but that's the main reason Russia invaded. The Russians don't want American missiles on their border. They don't want a hostile government next door. Now that's true, whether you're allowed to say it in public right now or not, it has been true for a long time. A lot has been written about this over many years by serious people. No one who knows anything and is honest will tell you Putin invaded Ukraine simply because he is evil. Putin may be evil. He certainly seems to be, but he also has strategic motives in doing that, whether or not you agree with those motives, that's irrelevant. Those are the facts. So, with those facts in mind, the Biden administration's behavior in the days before the Ukraine invasion tells you a lot about what motivated them. With Russian troops amassed by the thousands on the Ukrainian border, Joe Biden sent Kamala Harris, the least capable diplomat in Washington, to explain America's policy to European heads of state. At a public press event at the Munich Security Conference, Kamala Harris encouraged Ukraine to become a member of . ""I appreciate and admire President Zelenskyy's desire to join ."" Message: Up yours, Vladimir Putin, go ahead and invade Ukraine. And of course, Vladimir Putin did that just days later. : A In this photo, Feb. 27, 2022, taken from video provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks to the nation in Kyiv, Ukraine. So, the invasion was no surprise to the Biden administration. They knew that would happen. That was the point of the exercise. We watched all this happen. We missed it. How? Honestly, because it was insane and therefore very hard to take seriously. Why in the world would the United States intentionally seek war with Russia? How could we possibly benefit from that war? We still don't know the answer to that question, but it is obvious that permanent Washington has been fixated on war with Russia for a very long time. A couple of years ago, you may remember, we'd forgotten, they impeached a sitting president. Why? For threatening to withhold military aid to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Failing to back a proxy war in Ukraine was the one thing Donald Trump was not allowed to do as president. Again, they impeached him for it and no one said much about it, even in his own party, because, of course, they supported war with Russia too— maybe even more than the Democrats did. As far back as 2016, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina— hysterical little Lindsey Graham— was jumping around, acting out his war fantasies in front of foreign soldiers in Ukraine. If we saw this tape at the time, we don't remember seeing it - back in 2016, Ukraine seemed like a faraway place. We should have paid more attention. : Your fight is our fight. 2017 will be the year of offense. All of us will go back to Washington and we will push the case against Russia. Enough of … Russian aggression. It is time for them to pay a heavier price. ""Your fight is our fight."" That's a very strange thing for an American lawmaker to say to a foreign military. Why would the Ukrainian government's fight in 2016 possibly be our fight? On what grounds is it our fight? What does that even mean? We don't know. And yet now it is demonstrably true. Ukraine's fight is our fight. Ukraine's war is our war. It's here, but most Americans did not see that coming—yet permanent Washington certainly did. Permanent Washington understood that the second Vladimir Putin's forces rolled across the border into Ukraine we would inevitably be on a course toward war with Russia. They knew. Here's the president of the August Council on Foreign Relations on the day of the invasion. : We need now a response of necessity to his war of choice, and there's got to be to raise the economic costs at home, to raise the military costs on the ground. I hate to be so blunt, but, you know, the most vulnerable thing that the Putin's vulnerable to is dead Russian soldiers. So, we have to make sure Ukraine has the means to...resist. ""Dead Russian soldiers."" At the time, that seemed a little bellicose right out of the gate. It had just happened. Maybe there's some way to deescalate this. The invasion is terrible, but isn't America's role as steward of the West to make things better? Wouldn't a prompt Russian withdrawal from Ukraine be the wisest course for everyone, including and especially the Ukrainians on whose behalf we claim to speak, but whose country would be leveled by a protracted war? You would think so, but that's not what anyone in Washington wanted. They wanted a war and now they have one. , 33, - So, where's this going? That's the question for the rest of us who had no role in making these decisions. Well, it's worrisome. You should keep in mind that the U.S. government is currently run by the same people who planned the Afghanistan withdrawal, the ones who tanked the U.S. dollar, the people who run Baltimore, the ones who tried to send crack pipes to junkies, these are people with a long history of destroying things and no history at all of building anything. So, a lot could go wrong. They tell us that Vladimir Putin is unbalanced. We'll take that at face value. We know that Putin has thousands of nuclear weapons. Putin has said that if he is pushed, he will use nuclear weapons. It could be wise to believe him. Harry Kazianis does believe him. Kazianis is a foreign policy analyst in Washington. Like a lot of people in his business, he regularly participates in government-sponsored war games. These are designed to map out what would happen if various countries fell into conflict with one another. A couple of years ago, not long ago at all, Kazianis participated in a war game predicated on a war with Russia. He wrote about this the other day in The Federalist. ""In the course of what we call the -Russia War of 2019, we estimated one billion people died."" One billion. ""And if we aren't careful, what happened in a simulation could happen if a -Russia war erupts over Ukraine."" That war has just erupted. The fact that no one in charge seems to worry about where this could go should concern you quite a bit, but nuclear war is not the only risk. The economic consequences of this war are already profound. They're history changing, actually and if you don't believe it, check out commodity prices. They're out of control. Wheat is up nearly 60% over last year. That's the highest price ever recorded for wheat. It's not good news if you plan to eat and it won't get better. Russia is one of the largest fertilizer producers in the world. So, for example, a ton of Urea fertilizer that cost American farmers $265 per ton last January now goes for $846 this year. And thanks to sanctions, that number will get much higher. No one who farms has ever seen anything like this. You probably don't farm, but you do buy groceries. It'll be obvious to you soon. In fact, thanks to Biden's foreign policy, everything you buy is shooting up in price and shockingly fast. Gasoline is now higher than it's ever been in the history of gasoline. In Los Angeles, it is selling for $7.29 a gallon. So if you make under $100,000 a year and most people in this country do, that qualifies as a crisis for you, but for the people in charge, it's not high enough. They'd like to make it worse. Their latest idea, that a lot of people seem to be buying, is that we have a moral obligation somehow to stop buying Russian oil. It's tainted. . What would happen if we did that? Well, needless to say, oil prices would jump likely to over a $150 a barrel, even higher prices for you, but then if that boycott spread and moral boycotts tend to and Europe joined it, buckle your seatbelt. We talked to someone in the energy business this morning, energy traders, to get a little perspective on this. He said a total boycott of Russian energy would cause ""an absolute global disaster."" That means recession, depression, uncontrollable inflation and the rest—economic devastation to us and our allies. And at that point, in fact, we're already there, we'd be forced to make up the difference by getting more oil from other countries because we need the energy. Batteries aren't going to supply it. So what would those countries be? Well, let's see. They would be pretty clear: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela. To repeat, in order to wage a moral boycott, we become more dependent on Saudi Arabia, governed by Sharia law; Iran, a rogue state; and Maduro's Venezuela because this is a moral statement we're making. This is a moral victory so feel good about it as you go bankrupt. That's the short term picture. The long term picture of war with Russia is even scarier than that. Thanks to Biden's policies, Russia and China now form a bloc against the United States. This was the nightmare scenario, now it's real. Just today, the Chinese foreign minister described Vladimir Putin as China's ""most important strategic partner."" So are we going to see a boycott of Chinese goods in the United States? They're making this war possible. Oh, don't bet on it, that would be racist. But we should prepare to lose our position as holder of the world's reserve currency. That is happening in slow motion. It's unmistakable. Now the Biden people seem to have no idea this is going on, or maybe they want it to happen. Joe Biden was up there at the State of the Union bragging about how he took 30 points off the Russian ruble in a single day. Hurray! Good for us, but once we stop celebrating our win, the destruction of the Russian economy, they deserve it, you got to wonder, is there a downside to this? Could it be a pyrrhic victory? Let's see. These policies have driven Russia, China, India, Turkey and other countries to accelerate their flight from the U.S. dollar. : Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin during their meeting in Moscow, Russia Now, to be clear, that's the majority of the global economy. This may be the most reckless and destructive thing any American president has ever done to the United States. If the war in Ukraine ended tomorrow, we would live with the consequences of that loss of the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency for the rest of our lives. No one in Washington is even acknowledging this is happening. They're looking for more moral victories to win. And the companies love it, the woke companies, Apple, MasterCard, lots of other American companies, are taking victory laps for their role in punishing Russia. Great. Punish Russia. We're not against that, but you've got to wonder. You've just seen a handful of woke corporations crash a country and impoverished its citizens indiscriminately. Now that country is Russia, so most of us aren't even thinking about the precedent it sets. We're fine with it. It's Russia. Who cares? But is it possible these same techniques might be used someday against someplace or somebody that you care about? What if one morning you woke up and they decided that you're Vladimir Putin and you must be erased? Could that happen? Don't think about it. You probably aren't able to think about it clearly right now, even if you try. Why? Because there's a moral panic in progress. For the record, this is the third moral panic we have had in the United States of America in less than two years. You don't want to live in a country in which moral panics break out regularly, by the way. Moral panics diminish the people engaged in them and hurt the people who don't. They're degrading. They're crazy. They're the opposite of what you want. You want to live in a country where wisdom and restraint and rational behavior and decency determine the outcomes, not screaming. But we live in a country of moral panics. The first one began in May of 2020 with the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. That changed America completely. The second moral panic was . You've lived through that. So for nearly two years, the shouting has not ended. Hysteria is now the official language of public discourse in the United States. That's not good for anyone, except those benefiting from it. Who is benefiting? Anyone who lies for a living. The liars have perfect cover. Ask yourself: How much of what you first heard about , and then about the coronavirus turned out in the end to be true? How many of the first stories were true? Not many. It was almost all lies, but you didn't know that at the time because you were busy being yelled at. If you dared to point out that actually all lives matter, they denounced you as a racist. If you expressed concern about vaccine mandates, of course, they called you an anti-vaxxer. Sound familiar? The pattern never changes. Hey, maybe war with Russia is not a good idea for the United States. Say that out loud some time. It's not an extreme position. Most Americans would agree with you, but you will immediately be denounced as a tool of Putin. What is this? It's name-calling as a means of social control. The people in charge have decided their primary job is to decide who you should hate. In an environment like this, everything feels like propaganda and that's because much of it is. On Thursday, we told you that Russian forces had bombed a nuclear reactor in Ukraine. That seemed to be true. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine had said it repeatedly, but it was not true. No reactors were hit. An unnamed Ukrainian official claimed that radiation levels in the area had risen. That turned out to be untrue as well. In the words of Mark Nelson, who is a nuclear energy analyst, ""I'm afraid to say, this looks like a coordinated effort to induce panic."" Of course. It was what we call disinformation and it was designed to get you to support a war against Russia. Now, maybe you support a war against Russia anyway, but you should at least know that you're being lied to and manipulated, which you are. Read this from Good Morning America the other day: : Ukraine's mothers, daughters, teachers, politicians, beauty queens, now on the front lines defending their country under siege and there is Anastasiia Lenna, a former Miss Grand Ukraine. Photos of her on Instagram in fatigues, rifle in hand. Underneath, patriotic hashtags. Miss Ukraine with a rifle defending her homeland. Is there anything more inspiring than that? It would be more inspiring if it was real. It wasn't. It was fake. Miss Ukraine was not defending her homeland. That wasn't a rifle. It was an airsoft gun. So the whole thing was not a news story, though you read it as such. It was a propaganda shoot. It was meant to deceive you. It was meant to make you want war with Russia. Sympathize with one side over the other. It works. That's why they do it. It's why the tech companies have censored so many news sites recently, including from Russia, but not exclusively from Russia. Now we're supposed to think this is a victory over Putin or something, but a victory for what? Less information? Fewer perspectives? If getting to the truth was the point of the exercise, we as American citizens would be able to read whatever we wanted to read. That was the rule for centuries in this country. It no longer is because truth is no longer the point. Instead, Twitter and Facebook are proudly censoring any information that might ""undermine trust in Ukrainian government."" Really? Since when are we required to trust the Ukrainian government or any government? Don't ask. By the way, over the weekend, because everything in America is unintentionally hilarious now, the New York Times attacked Vladimir Putin for censorship. Turns out he engaged in censorship and tries to control his people can read. - ‘Z’ : This April 26, 2017, file photo shows the Twitter app icon on a mobile phone in Philadelphia. Lost in the relentless focus on war in Ukraine, by the way, is any perspective about the world or war, which is always lacking in D.C., but never more so than now. The fighting in Ukraine is terrible, of course, you're seeing it happen. No decent person could fail to be moved by the images, but it's not unique. It's not the only war in recent memory or even currently in progress right now. Many thousands died in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war that was between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Ever heard of it? It ended less than a year and a half ago. No coverage. There's been a gruesome war underway in Ethiopia for a couple of years now. It's n progress as we speak. Tens of thousands, women have been raped by militiamen, many of them intentionally infected with . Can it get worse than that? How many people have died in the war in Ethiopia? We don't really know, because no one in our media cares enough to keep track. It's just Ethiopia. We do know that hundreds of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have died in the war in Yemen. It's a war the Biden administration has continued to fund. It doesn't get a lot of attention. It's just Yemen. Who cares? All human life is equal. All of us are equal in the eyes of God. The death of someone in Ukraine is exactly equivalent to the death of someone in Yemen in its importance, period. But hardest of all to ignore, though our media have pulled it off and ignored it, is the civil war that's underway 100 hundred yards from El Paso, Texas, right now: the Mexican drug war. That's what we call it. It's likely killed more than 100,000 people. In 2019 alone, close to 10,000 Mexican citizens just disappeared, most of them young men. More journalists are murdered in Mexico every year than in any other country in the world. The pictures are awful, but it's not a crisis. It's totally normal, says the Biden administration. Open the southern border. The border we care about is Ukraine's. Now, Republicans in Washington, to their eternal shame, have no problem with any of this. In fact, many of them are more for war with Russia than Joe Biden seems to be. That is a disgrace. It will hurt them in the midterms. It will hurt them on some deeper level because it does not serve the interests of this country, a war fought on behalf of democracy that ignores the will of the country fighting it? At some point soon, we'll explain exactly what's going on here, but it's enough to know Republicans are not representing their voters when they move to a position that's way more warlike than Joe Biden's, when they embrace the lunacy that could really hurt this country, that aren't representing people like Bryce Mitchell. Bryce Mitchell seems like a Republican voter. He's a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter. He is a cattle farmer from Cabot, Arkansas. The other day, someone asked him what he thought about Ukraine at a press event. Here's what he said: : Well, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the whole Russia and Ukraine situation. : You know, here's my first thought, is I'm not going nowhere to fight none of these wars for these politicians. I'm staying at home and when the war comes to Arkansas, I will dig my boots in the ground and I will die for everything I love, and I will not retreat. If this country is invaded and everybody's saying, ""Well, ... we got to evacuate, we got to leave. We got.."" I will not. I will dig my boots in the Arkansas soil and I will fight for the people that I love, for the land that I love, and the way of life that I love, but I'm not going overseas to fight. I don't know what's going on to be honest, brother. I really don't. There's so much stuff and I don't think nobody knows what's going on fully. There's been so much political corruption in that area. You got Biden and his son making a sh-- ton of money off of using our tax dollars to bribe their people. That's treasonous, in my opinion. So you got [Joe] Biden and his son using our tax dollars. Hey, if ..Ukrainian government, if you don't do this, we're taking your tax dollars. He shouldn't be giving our tax dollars to that country anyway. We got veterans out here sleeping on the street and you're going to give our frickin tax dollars to these Ukrainians and... brother, I don't know what's going on over there, but I'm not going over there and fighting. Tell us how he's a Putin stooge, Lindsey Graham and David Frum and Anne Applebaum, Liz Cheney. Tell us how he's immoral. When the war comes to Arkansas, he said, ""I will dig my boots into the ground and I will die for everything I love."" That's the American position. Fight to the death to defend what you love, your people, your family, your country, to defend it. That's why we call it the Defense Department. It is not called the Department of Nation Building or the Bureau of Trans Evangelism. Bryce Mitchell may not have good grammar, but he understands exactly what's going on here, even if the people who claim to represent him and our country have no idea.",0

He added that the United States is bolstering their national defense strategy in the wake of Russia's advancement into Ukraine. : If you look at the budget that the president submitted last year you can see that we are actually investing in new technology and new weapons capabilities and new operational concepts. The Pentagon itself is putting finishing touches on our national defense strategy that focuses very chiefly on the challenge raised by China as well as the challenge we see from other major nation-states like Russia, North Korea, Iran. There is a lot of effort to invest in capabilities and concepts to get us on a firmer footing to deal with the more modern nation-state-like threats and we’re doing it now. … We don’t have perfect visibility into Mr. Putin’s military planning but clearly, he wants to make a move on Kyiv. He’s actually approaching on three lines of major access in Ukraine. He has divided his forces. Coming up from the south, coming in from the northeast, and down towards the north towards Kyiv. Kyiv seems to be the main effort in his mind.

2022-03-08,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ukraine-cossacks-fighting-spirit-putin-stalin-john-oneill-sarah-wynne,Ukraine's fighting Cossack spirit – Stalinist Putin won't prevail,"""There have been tyrants and murderers [throughout history], and for a time they seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it – always."" -- Mahatma Gandhi Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began nearly two weeks ago on Feb. 24, people all over the world have watched on their screens the brutal destruction of apartments, supermarkets and city centers. They have also watched the heroic and likely hopeless resistance of the Ukrainian people ranging from farmers fighting tanks with tractors to outgunned, untrained mothers joining the front lines with Molotov cocktails. Those witnessing the graphic news ask why? Why does Vladimir Putin direct such a horror? Why do the Ukrainians fight so fiercely against fearful odds with such courage? To understand the passionate resistance of the Ukrainian people to the fanatical, brutal assault of Stalinist Putin, look to the history of their national anthem, Ukraine and brutal Putin himself. 'S - As we see the massive overwhelming Russian troops, tanks and planes moving to crush the much smaller Ukraine resistance, an old Ukrainian song is often heard by crowds sheltering with children below ground. The crowds began to spontaneously sing a haunting melody beginning with the words, ""Thou art not dead Ukraine … as in the Springtime melts the snow, so shall melt away the foe."" People lie in the Kyiv subway, using it as a bomb shelter on Feb. 24, 2022. ) A video of a housewife singing the song while clearing bombing debris became popular on YouTube and is now played all over the world. Written in the 1860s, the Ukrainian national anthem was banned in Stalin times. Humming it would bring a quick death sentence. For hundreds of years until the Soviet period in the 1920s, Ukraine was a land of small farmers called Kulaks, much like the working farmers of Ohio or Iowa, and roving bands of herdsmen called Cossacks. The Cossacks were generally considered Europe’s greatest horsemen, fiercest warriors and freest souls. Their songs, much like our Western songs, were played and sung by guitar players known as Kobzars. Their romantic and beautiful ballads sang of great love and fierce war on the steppes of Ukraine and of the rides of the famous Don Cossacks and explorers. They were the retained history and culture of Ukraine. The Cossacks became loyal Romanov followers in the 17th and 18th centuries. The last great successful cavalry charges of history were Ukrainian Cossacks led by the so-called Black Baron in World War I, inexplicably breaking the back of modern Austrian machine gun and artillery units through courage and sabers. Because of their love of freedom, the Ukrainians were enemies of the Soviets from the beginning, particularly Stalin. He levied a terrible revenge. As part of his own 1928-1932 ""cultural revolution,"" Stalin determined to control ideology and culture, banning words like God, killing many thousands of priests, and purging the arts. In 1931, the Kobzars in Ukraine were summoned to Kyiv to form a union and meet with Soviet leadership. Hundreds were instead shot and dumped into a secret mass grave with their instruments. Their songs and even their instruments were banned on penalty of death. Stalin then began the collectivization of all agriculture in this great breadbasket, seizing all land and forcing the entire population into collective farms owned by the State. The collectivization experiment was predictability a failure. Stalin’s answer to reduced production was to initiate a slaughter in 1932-1934 sometimes called the Holodomor. Stalin seized most grain, including even the seed stocks required for the next year’s crop. Those who resisted and their families were shot. Wealthier families were sent to be worked and starved to death in notorious projects like the White Sea-Baltic Canal. At least 6 million Ukrainians and perhaps many more perished by starvation and execution during the Great Famine as it came to be known – the greatest genocide other than the Holocaust in modern European history. Until their freedom from the Soviet Union in 1991, the Ukrainians were a bitter, enslaved people retaining in their hearts, but humming only secretly ""thou art not dead, Ukraine."" Putin’s background controls Putin’s actions. His grandfather was Stalin’s cook, and his father a World War exterminator of humans for Stalin. Putin continued in the family business as a officer who, like Stalin, was a self-made man of steel who avoided all combat but utilized deftness and poison to accelerate his rise and eliminate opponents. Asked about Putin when he became president of Russia in 1999, Putin’s mentor Anatoly Sobchak said, ""Putin is Stalin."" Several days later, Sobchak and a bodyguard died suddenly of heart attacks without any prior history of coronary disease. Like his idol Stalin, Putin pursued a dream of a Soviet empire that has graduated from being a retail poisoner of hundreds to mass murderer of many thousands and potentially millions in Ukraine. And like Stalin, Putin may well succeed in his conquest of the physical land of Ukraine through vast numbers and brutal weapons, overcoming courage and homemade Molotov cocktails. Putin will fail, however, to conquer the souls of the Ukrainian people. Writing the songs is sometimes more important than writing the laws. When the Putin statues, like the Stalin statues, fall, the Ukrainians will again openly sing from their national anthem, ""We’ll not spare either our souls or bodies to get freedom,"" and summon forth from their graves the long-gone Cossack leaders to once again fight for Ukraine’s freedom on the steppes.",6

2022-03-08,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-its-hard-remember-betrayal-this-scale,Tucker: Biden's response to the Russia-Ukraine war further proves he hates the middle class,"Fox News host reacts to Biden banning Russian oil and natural gas imports on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' You may have noticed that Joe Biden announced today a new front in his ongoing war against America's middle class. Biden didn't frame it that way, of course, Democrats rarely say what they mean. They tell you it's about something else. In this case, Biden told us it was about Vladimir Putin. Biden explained that we're going to hurt Putin by making it illegal for Americans to buy Russian energy. This, he said, will amount to a massive moral victory for us. We're going to feel great about ourselves. And at the same time, it will be a crushing defeat for the Russians who of course, deserve it. So, it's one of those rare occasions when we could see the good guys win and the bad guys lose. Hurray. Around Washington, you could almost hear the feverish applause as Biden finished speaking. Every constituency loved it. The media agreed that Joe Biden had never seemed more presidential. Democratic officials seemed deeply relieved. For once, they could talk about something other than and the southern border. They'd rather be on offense than defense. -U.S. : President Joe Biden speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. Republican leaders, meanwhile, seemed happiest of all. They barked like seals. Finally, a chance to sound tough and decisive without making angry. Thank you, Joe Biden. We can all be John McCain now. You rarely see unity like this in a city as divided as Washington. The unity was so heady, in fact so delightful and intoxicating, that no one remembered to ask the most basic question: Why exactly are we doing this? What's the point? Is the point to bankrupt Vladimir Putin? That might be worth doing, but this won't do it. Putin already has ready markets around the world for his oil, starting in China, in India and Turkey. So that's not going to work. Maybe the point is to force Russian troops to withdraw from Ukraine. That would definitely be worth doing, but no, that's not the point, either. Joe Biden will typically say absolutely anything, but even Joe Biden didn't claim today that sanctioning Russian oil will end the war in Ukraine because it won't. So, who exactly are these sanctions aimed at? Think about it. If you want to identify the target of a penalty, consider who's going to suffer most from it. And in this case, the answer could not be clear. It's middle-income Americans. They're the ones who were crushed for two years under restrictions. They're the ones who are about to be pummeled by shutting down more energy sources. Notice a theme here? The people in charge hate the middle class above all. So, it's not Vladimir Putin who's getting punished, it's American citizens. It's you. It's not speculation. Gas prices are already the highest they have ever been in history and they're about to get even higher—potentially much, much higher. So will the price of natural gas and the price of electricity and food and everything else you buy that has to be transported more than 100 yards from where it was made, which is to say every single thing in your life. This is not good news for you, no matter what Washington is currently claiming. You are about to get a lot poorer. That's guaranteed. You'll notice as you read this that is the one thing that somehow Joe Biden forgot to mention today. : Today, I'm announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia's economy. We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy. That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine. … It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production. That's simply not true. So, lying by omission is pretty simple. You just don't mention the truth. You heard Biden do that just there, but it takes something else very different—whether it's chutzpah, delusion or senility or whatever else, explains Joe Biden's behavior - It takes something like that to tell a lie like the one you just read at the end of Biden's statement, ""It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production."" : ’S Oh, but it simply is true. It's demonstrably true and everyone knows it. On his first day in office, Biden single-handedly killed the Keystone Pipeline. Then, just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, weirdly, Biden's administration shut down all new energy leases and permits on federal land. That happened. Vladimir Putin did not do that. Joe Biden did it. Biden's publicist tried to explain that actually preventing domestic energy production, which they have done, is very different from holding back domestic energy production. : Let me give you the facts here and I know that can be inconvenient, but I think they're important in this moment. To the contrary, we have...been clear that in the short term, supply must keep up with the demand where we are at, here and around the world, while we make the shift to a secure, clean energy future. We are one of the largest producers with a strong domestic oil and gas industry. We have actually produced more oil. It is at record numbers, and we will continue to produce more oil. There are 9,000 approved drilling permits that are not being used. So, the suggestion that we are not allowing companies to drill is inaccurate. The suggestion that that is what is hindering or preventing gas prices to come down is inaccurate. : , ""Let me give you the facts here."" Now, when they say that, you know the lies are coming and indeed, in this case, they arrived promptly. Because oil companies have not used all the permits they've received, Jen Psaki told us, that means this is their fault. They're not trying hard enough to produce energy. They could, but they don't want to. But wait a second, Jen Psaki. What if there's no oil or gas underneath the permitted land? In that case, energy producers would want permits for land where the energy is. Turns out they don't want dry wells. They want wells that flow, but they're not getting them thanks to the Green New Deal lobby that completely controls this administration, they can't get those permits. And that's what's happening here and if you doubt it, ask anyone who works in the energy business. Russian President Vladimir Putin Jen Psaki just lied to you. They are all lying to you. You probably guessed that already, but you can't say it because if you wonder what these policies may be doing to your country or to your family, you are selfish and disloyal. In fact, you're unpatriotic because real patriotism is caring about Ukraine first. And by the way, caring about Ukraine means prolonging a bloody war on Ukraine until the entire country of Ukraine has been destroyed and millions of Ukrainians are refugees. We know we can do because we did it in Iraq. We can do it in Ukraine. That's patriotism. Once you spell it out, it all sounds kind of complicated, so we're going to hand it over to our late-night moral leader Stephen Colbert to explain: : Today, the average gas price in America hit an all-time record high of over $4 per gallon. , that stings, but a clean conscience is worth a buck or two. I'm willing to pay. It's important. I'm willing to pay $4 a gallon, hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla. ‘’ ’S : A Late Show with Stephen Colbert during Sunday's February 7, 2021 Super Bowl Special. Well, it turns out a guy who makes $16 million a year is willing to pay a little more for gas if that's the right thing to do. He's willing to make that sacrifice, because that's the kind of caring, decent man Stephen Colbert is. Now it's true, as you just heard, that he doesn't actually use gasoline. He drives a $150,000 electric car, but he will do it anyway. He's the kind of man who will take you out to dinner and let you pay, and at the end, he'll let you leave a big tip because he cares about the server. Sometimes, as Stephen Colbert reminds us, life is about making tough moral choices and that's especially true now. If at the end of this project, this protracted exercise and social reorganization achieved through plus a war with Russia, if at that point, whenever it is, we no longer have a self-sufficient middle class, if people who make under $100,000 a year are more desperate and demoralized and dependent on government than they've ever been, if the only Americans who remain truly free at that point are the oligarchs, well, at least we can say we helped democracy. When Mark Zuckerberg controls everything in America, you will know it's a truly democratic system. Justin Trudeau understands this. He ran over members of his middle class with horses because that's what it took to preserve democracy in Canada. And then he went further. He seized truckers’ bank accounts and then he shut down a coffee shop that serves people who didn't vote for him. That's what democracy looks like. Elizabeth Warren was excited when she saw this kind of democracy at work. Warren knows that if we're going to preserve democracy in America, if we're going to fight Russia, then Elizabeth Warren is going to need fingertip control of your family's finances now and always. And by the way, don't try and hide anything from Elizabeth Warren, say, in cryptocurrency, because if you do, Elizabeth Warren will know you are working for Vladimir Putin. : As I mentioned earlier, we're going after two things: trying to squeeze the Russian economy and also trying to squeeze those oligarchs, right. The problem is we're doing that only through the formal banking system and we're doing a good job on that and that is very effective. It's historic. I'm 100% behind it. But, there's a hole in the dike here and the hole is crypto. In other words, you got to pick it, crypto. If you want to continue to trade and provide the trading platforms and so on in the wallets, you can do business in Russia or you can do business in the United States, but you can't do business in both. Here's an idea: Let's keep dumb people and crazed partisan demagogues away from our financial system and our power grid. They can keep the sociology department. Have fun. But why don't you stay away from the fundamentals that keep the country running? How's that sound? That was the arrangement for decades, but no longer. You must submit to total personal control by irresponsible lunatics like Elizabeth Warren or you can serve Russia, as she put it, ""you can't do business in both."" And by the way, you better not complain about this. Good Americans love higher gas prices. They love suffering for a cause they don't understand. looked into it and that's what they found. : People we've spoken to over the last couple of weeks, they're paying higher prices if it means holding Russia accountable for what they are doing in Ukraine, but these prices are likely going to creep higher. : ‘ ’ Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu at the Kremlin, in Moscow on February 14, 2022. It turns out Americans are delighted to be poor and helpless. They love it because poverty means holding Russia accountable, not Putin's poverty, that's not going to happen, your poverty. Well, how exactly does your poverty hold Putin accountable? didn't ask that question, but the polling company Rasmussen did ask. That's what they do. They asked this question, ""If a wider war breaks out in Europe, should the military be involved?"" Pretty simple question. The answer was not simple, though. The answer varied by income. This may not surprise you. The people who actually fight our wars, the people making under $30,000 a year were overwhelmingly opposed to this war. Only 37% of them supported military action, and then it changed going up. 'S : ‘ ’ The richer and more cut off from physical reality people got, the more ardently they supported war with Russia, and it turns out that's the subset you see. Those are the people on television, the people with fake jobs and inherited money. They're totally for it, and they’re for it because they are going to pay no cost, but they'll still get to feel virtuous about promoting it. Then they'll tune in to Stephen Colbert at night with a clean heart. As for the Americans who will do the actual fighting and then the suffering here at home, they don't count. Because in a democracy you can safely ignore the middle class and so our leaders are doing that. . : But the truth is, we should be thinking about the fact that when Americans go to fill up their cars that they should think about sticking it to Putin when they put that gas handle in your gas tank, it's going to cost a little more and part of it's going to be because of Russia and just stick it to Putin. . : Now, here in America, we got to be ready for the fact that will drive up oil prices, that will drive up gas prices and if we are really standing with Ukraine, we have to be prepared to absorb that. . : Just ban all Russian imports into the United States in terms of oil and gas. Four percent of our oil supply comes from Russia. We can easily make that up. So, what we haven't done yet is go after the oil and gas sector in Russia. That's the Achilles heel to Putin's war machine. They don't care about you at all. They have complete contempt for you and your interests. Notice, they don't even bother to apologize to you for what they're about to do to you and your family, which will change your life. We're not overstating it. Now, who are they? The first two men were Democrats. The third was Lindsey Graham. We'll let you decide what he is, apart from utterly loathsome, obviously, but we have to tell you that virtually every elected Republican in Washington, D.C. is fully on board with this, which is another way of saying they are totally committed to screwing their own supposed constituency, which would be America's shrinking, desperate middle class. Those are the people who vote Republican and this is what they get in return. No apology. Shafted. Sen. Lindsey Graham It's hard to remember a betrayal at this scale and yes, we have been here before, by the way, we've been in conflicts with Russia for a long time. The United States traded with the Russians through the height of the Cold War when the Soviet Union and United States had nuclear weapons pointed right at each other and we worried one might go off. We traded with Joseph Stalin in the middle of his terror at the very moment he was murdering four million, yes, Ukrainians. That happened. And then we armed Stalin. We armed the Soviet Army as he was killing Ukrainians and the New York Times endorsed all of it. But now, because Putin invaded Ukraine, effectively encouraged by the Biden administration to do that, which is true, because that happened, we are going to send billions of dollars to the Saudi theocracy and then to the Iranians and then to Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and at the same time, we're going to embrace green energy, which means giving the government of China complete control over a power grid here in America. That's our plan. Are you confused by it? Don't be. It's a moral victory. Let us know when you get tired of winning.",0
2022-03-08,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russian-cyber-attack-united-states-prepare,US is running out of time to prepare for a Russian cyber attack,"Former Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Philip Breedlove on Russia attacking civilians fleeing Ukraine. Why hasn’t cyber figured more prominently in Russia’s war on Ukraine? Russia is, after all, a powerhouse in this area having successfully cyber-attacked Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2015-2016. Add to that an unexpectedly difficult start to the current, long-planned campaign against Ukraine and the question becomes even more perplexing. Analysts have many and varied views on the matter and recent reporting has laid out almost a dozen different potential explanations. Some suggest there is no need to go there, and that the possible downside outweighs any upsides. Others suggest that Putin may still go there - just not yet. : The latter explanation is compelling if only because it requires us not to let down our guard and to continue marching forward on plans to expand and deepen America’s own cyber resilience posture and abilities to withstand cyber and electronic warfare. The good news is that certain key sectors that represent critical infrastructure and support vital national functions have been enhancing their defenses for years. Think financial services and energy for example. Aleksander, 41, presses his palms against the window as he says goodbye to his daughter Anna, 5, on a train to Lviv at the Kyiv station, Ukraine. Natali Sevriukova reacts next to her house following a rocket attack the city of Kyiv, Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu at the Kremlin, in Moscow. The bad news is that other equally important sectors are nowhere near as prepared. Think water - which is working to up its game but is nowhere near where it needs to be as the recent spate of ransomware has made clear. And this is the state of play among the big dogs. Yet the U.S. is an incredibly target-rich environment for any adversary because of the sprawling decentralized nature of both its public and private sector. Put differently: Small and medium size enterprises are not outside the crosshairs. : 'S Officials have been working hard to raise awareness and offer assistance to both public and private entities that may not have the resources or ability to properly protect themselves on their own in the current climate that is so rife with potential cyber threats. The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been doing yeoman’s work in this area. But the scope of the challenge is enormous. So where should we go from here? We must better marshal our efforts so that the piecemeal and uneven progress that has been made to date becomes a more streamlined national effort that makes it far harder for any adversary to achieve its ends. Having a National Cyber Director to act as coordinator and definitively take point on the all-important task of prioritizing our game plans and facilitating their execution in a way that ensures that they will be more than just the sum of their parts is a true step forward. But the will not be able to go it alone. Public and private efforts must cohere and partnerships must be more meaningful than ever before. It’s a tall order but the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative under auspices is a powerful tool that could rise to the challenge if all stakeholders determinedly make that their mission. Among its payoffs could be better situational awareness than the nation has ever had - and coordinated operations that give bad actors a serious run for their money. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addresses the nation in Kyiv, Ukraine. We may not yet be where we need to be, but we can’t take our eyes off the ball. So far the conflict in Ukraine may not have unfolded exactly as Russia thought it would; but these are still early days in what is likely to be a long and punishing war. Longtime expert Putin-watchers underscore that he may lash out further should he feel cornered. He has already made an implied threat concerning the use of nuclear weapons. And now Russian forces claim to have taken over a nuclear plant in Ukraine - the largest such plant in Europe. What comes next is anybody’s guess. But forewarned is forearmed. Let’s push down the path to better preparedness as fast and hard as we can so that we don’t end up regretting that we missed our chance to do so.",22

On Sunday she pointed to an Axios report that Biden might travel to Saudi Arabia in order to get them to pump more oil, providing an alternative to Russian energy. Omar said this would be ""wildly immoral"" due to Saudi Arabia's involvement in Yemen. ""Our response to Putin’s immoral war shouldn’t be to strengthen our relationship with the Saudis who are currently causing the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet in Yemen. Yemenis might not matter to some geopolitically but their humanity should. This is wildly immoral act,"" Omar said.

The article, titled, ""Is this, finally, Kamala Harris' moment?"" focused on whether Harris’ trip to Poland and Romania to help fortify security could be a leadership moment for the vice president. : ‘’ ’ Vice President Kamala Harris talks about the effect of pollution on her sight and taste remarks at the Prince George’s County Brandywine Maintenance Facility on Dec. 13, 2021 in Brandywine, Maryland. ""This sort of tricky international diplomacy at a moment of crisis for Europe and the world is when leaders are made. If Harris can find a way through this fraught period with Poland, as well as the ongoing push by Ukraine for a no-fly zone, it would amount to a major win -- not just for the Biden administration, but for Harris in particular,"" Cillizza wrote. Cillizza noted Harris’ record-low approval ratings and recurring staff issues but appeared to defend Harris’ record by claiming that staff changes were not ""terribly unique."" ""Beset by staff departures and lingering questions about how good a fit she is for the job, Harris has struggled to find her political footing. ,"" Cillizza wrote. He continued, ""That was one of a slew of stories around that time that painted Harris -- and Biden -- as frustrated with the vice president's office. It didn't help that Harris also lost several senior members of her communications staff around the same time -- although the White House insisted that those departures were planned and were not evidence of chaos within her office."" : Vice President Kamala Harris arrives to board Air Force Two, Wednesday, March 9, 2022, at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. Harris is traveling to Poland and Romania for meetings about the war in Ukraine. Harris' past foreign trips have been riddled with controversy and missteps. During her visit to the Mexican border last June, the vice president was slammed as a ""show"" that failed to address border security. In February, Harris was mocked as ‘perpetually unprepared’ in Munich. Despite Harris’ foreign visit blunders, Cillizza maintained that her presence could be a moment to prove her position. ""Harris badly needs a moment to show that she could step into the top job. Those moments don't come along very often, but this week's trip is very much one of them,"" he concluded. - $10 , ’T : On Saturday, Cillizza made a similar post for President Biden titled ""Is this the beginning of a Joe Biden comeback?""

""His handling of the Ukraine situation -- leading an international coalition against Russia and imposing harsh economic sanctions all while refusing to commit American military forces -- has won him positive reviews from Democrats and Republicans,"" Cillizza wrote.

Philip Breedlove tells ‘The Story with Martha MacCallum’ that the Russian-Ukraine war is taking a ‘very brutal turn’ as a maternity hospital is bombed. A group of Republican senators slammed President Biden during a press conference Wednesday and sharply criticized him for working with Russia on a nuclear deal with Iran while Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashes chaos and bloodshed in Ukraine. ""This Iran Deal if and when it is announced will be a massive win for Vladimir Putin,"" Texas Sen. Cruz said during the press conference while flanked by several fellow Republican senators. ""Because the Biden administration has been eager to tell Putin and tell the Ayatollah of course we will have a carveout for the Iran deal on Russia sanctions which means Putin will make billions in oil and gas transactions, in nuclear transactions, and in weapons transactions.""

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, questions Nina Morrison, nominee to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District Of New York, during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, Feb. 16, 2022. - , '#' Cruz added that the Biden administration is ""incoherently"" announcing sanctions on Russia while also ""creating a massive subsidy"" for Russia which ""makes no sense."" ""This is not right, we should walk,"" Republican Sen. Jim Risch emphatically stated during the press conference. ""This doesn’t need to be done right now and particularly it doesn’t need to be done when we have the problems going on that we have in Ukraine.

""This my friends has to stop and we could stop it tomorrow. All we need to do is have this administration come out and clearly state that we’re going to reopen the Keystone pipeline.

2022-03-09,https://www.foxnews.com/media/russia-ukraine-conflict-war-us-will-cain,"In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, war should not be blind: Will Cain","When it comes to making a decision about whether to go to war, one that could result in nuclear war, we need to be as rational as possible, Fox News host says. For two years, emotion has been driving our prism throughout what should be the most consequential, rational, logical decisions of our lives – whether or not to go outside, whether or not to breathe free air, whether or not to inject our children with a vaccine. In calmer moments, we would say, ""Yeah, I think I want to hear out all the arguments on this one."" But we didn't because the emotion of fear took our culture and changed it into something that we would never have accepted and most likely, never have recognized. - : Today, when it comes to Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I can see that we're headed down a similar path. Here's what I mean: This time we're not driven by fear; we're driven more by empathy. We see horrible images go across our social media feed or on our television screen. We see civilian lives, loss of life. We see absolute travesties that warrant, at some point, a discussion of war crimes. And we're driven by empathy to do something. You can't let this continue. We have to do something. And by the way, the emotion of fear is playing a role as well because we sit here and not irrationally fear what Vladimir Putin's next move may be. I want to be clear about something: I'm not telling you that I believe emotion has no role in life. In fact, as I've gotten older, I've actually started to appreciate more the role of emotion. There was probably a time when I thought rationality and logic and turning ourselves into essentially automated robots was the best way to achieve a just society. I was wrong. Logic is cold. It has its role, and you can tell anyone who listens to this knows I lean heavily on logic. But I've also come to understand sometimes that the world operates by very simple emotions – fear, strength, weakness, courage. I know that not only is the world explained by emotion, but emotion is important. It makes life richer. It can't be all black and white. It brings out the colors, and sometimes even though something is irrational, that's part of being human. That's part of this life. But when it comes to making a decision about whether or not to go to war, one that could result in nuclear war, one whose costs could be incalculable, I do want to be as rational as possible. Emotion, empathy, the humanitarian cause, the pleas of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the words in our mind that carry such heavy impact — words like freedom, the concept of the underdog – they all lurk, playing on the irrational decision. But I don't think we can give in to it. I don't think we should just do something. I mean, let's just put into context what that kind of irrationality leads to, how that kind of irrationality is a false North Star. I don't hear many calls right now for us to do something in Syria. In Syria, little children are gassed. Chemical weapons. Chemical warfare. They die. They're disfigured. People die by the thousands in Syria because there's a civil war between separatists and Bashar al-Assad, the authoritarian dictator in Syria, who, by the way, is backed by Vladimir Putin, who's being funded and given weapons and supported by Russia. A Ukrainian serviceman aims towards Russian positions outside the city of Brovary, east of Kyiv, on March 9, 2022. ) And oh, by the way, one more time: This travesty, these war crimes, this horrible, horrible loss of human life has been going on for over a decade, but we haven't been compelled by our media. Our brains haven't given into images to just do something. Why? And don't think Syria and Ukraine are the only places in the world where horrible things are happening. But I want to be clear about something: That doesn't mean we don't do something even if we don't do it everywhere. I don't believe that. I don't think just pointing out our inconsistency says, well, throw up your hands – don't do anything. It just means, hey, recognize we may not be living in the land of principle. We may not be living in the land of reason and logic. On the other side — and it's weird how political lines are totally scattered right now – I can hear from those on the right who say, ""What are you so afraid of? Why are you such a coward? Why does Vladimir Putin scare you so much? We got to go get him."" I think it's worth setting aside for a moment, in our own decision-making, about putting American interests first. And look, even though I used that voice, I don't blow off that kind of mindset, either. I love that America irrationally has an empathetic streak to help people, even when we don't help everyone. I also love that America irrationally sometimes just wants to kick some ass and do the right thing. But I know that those are instincts. I don't want to rip them out of the human experience. But I also want them to have the steering wheel. You can't just go marching boots into Ukraine. You can't impose a no-fly zone. You have to go through the process of the dominoes of warfare playing out, and you have to try to get inside the mind of your opponent. You do it if you're playing chess, you would do it if you were on the basketball court. You would do it if you're on the offensive line facing a defensive lineman. You would try to get into the mind of your opponent. What will they do? Will he try a spin move? Which way is he going to cross over, left or right? You would ask yourself what you have to guard, not just to play defense, so that you know how and when to play offense, and you have to do the same thing in warfare. "" "": What would make Vladimir Putin launch a conventional war against a narrow country? What then would the United States of America have to do? What then would Vladimir Putin do on the escalation scale? Would he employ a nuclear weapon? What then would we do? What would, in that, provoke a 300 kiloton nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile bearing towards Miami? I think it's worth tapping the brakes on we have to do something. I think it's worth setting aside for a moment, in our own decision-making, about putting American interests first. Ask yourselves what can we see down the road? Because – not to be too cute – love is blind. War should not be blind. New episodes of ""The Will Cain Podcast"" are available now and can be at foxnewspodcasts.com.

""Everyone in the ballet is worried about their families, loved ones, friends, colleagues at home. It’s been very difficult."" The Théâtre du Chatelet, in the heart of the French capital, offered them the stage on Tuesday for the last show of a French tour that has left the company stranded after the war broke out in Ukraine.

One of the dancers will be headed to the Ukrainian border in the coming days to pick up her young daughter who was accompanied out of the country. Only a part of the company was travelling around France performing a shortened version of The Nutcracker for young audiences — most of the dancers in Paris are in their early 20s. Many of the ballet’s star dancers stayed behind, waiting to join their friends after they reached Paris.

'S : 'S A ‘… ’ Several media pundits tried to tie the conflict in Ukraine to domestic matters. A few took swipes at President Biden, for instance, for failing to make a connection between the fight for freedom in Ukraine to voting rights efforts in the U.S. during his State of the Union address. ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd and his guest, author and Princeton University professor Eddie S. Glaude Jr., agreed that Biden missed an opportunity to mention the anniversary of Bloody Sunday in his remarks on Ukraine. Bloody Sunday occurred on March 7, 1965, when unarmed civil rights protesters were met with violent resistance from local law enforcement during a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, for voting rights. Todd said he was ""surprised"" by Biden's apparent whiff, while Glaude said he was ""stunned."" ""If there's one thing that surprised me about the president's State of the Union, it was the lack of connecting the fight for democracy and freedom abroad with the fight for democracy and freedom at home. Today's Bloody Sunday,"" Todd said. ""I was stunned,"" Glaude said. ""I mean, it was an easy kind of rhetorical move: Let's defend democracy abroad and secure democracy at home."" Liberal pundits weren’t happy when President Biden failed to connect domestic issues to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. , , 's Tiffany Cross made the same connection, saying on a recent episode of ""The Cross Connection"" that as she observes the chaos in Ukraine, she realizes, ""democracy can be a fragile thing, and it feels a bit fragile in America right now."" She then accused the Republican Party of engaging in ""rampant voter suppression."" In a discussion about the possibility of the U.S. banning Russian oil on Sunday's ""This Week,"" 's George Stephanopoulos called climate change an ""existential crisis,"" defending comments made by former Secretary of State John Kerry that the war could have a ""profound negative impact on the climate."" Biden announced a ban on U.S. exports of Russian oil Tuesday. Late-night host Stephen Colbert irked viewers by appearing to downplay the impact rising gas prices have had on Americans. ""Today the average gas price in America hit an all-time record high over $4 per gallon. , that stings, but a clean conscience is worth a buck or two. It's important. It's important. I'm willing to pay $4 dollars a gallon. Hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla,"" Colbert said. Shell gas pump showing high gas prices in Lafayette, California, Nov. 25, 2021. correspondents defended Biden's claim Tuesday that his policies had not affected the prices at the pump. ""He also made it clear, Weijia, that his policies, the Biden administration policies, are not hurting oil production in this country. He wanted to make that clear, too,"" "" Mornings"" co-anchor Gayle King told senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang. ""Right, because that’s what Republicans have been saying very forcefully. Wondering why we can’t just ramp up oil production here. Well, the President just said that oil companies have the option to do that right now, but they aren’t taking it. And we did talk to a commodities expert, a strategist who said that’s exactly right,"" Jiang agreed. Other media figures like ""The View's"" Whoopi Goldberg and 's John Harwood chose to blame former President Trump for the current chaos or suggest the situation would have had been even more perilous if he was still commander in chief. ""If bonehead had been president, and I say what I said last time, there wouldn’t have been any issue because that guy would have handed Ukraine over to the Russians,"" Goldberg claimed Monday. ""When you hear Republican politicians snipe at Biden on the crisis, Remember: the Republican president who left office last year used his term to strengthen Russia's hand and weaken Ukraine's, his party protected him as he did it, he still leads the party,"" Harwood tweeted of Trump. The blame game amused Fox News contributor Joe Concha, who said on Fox News Tuesday that Trump was ""living rent-free"" in many liberal pundits' minds. Biden announced a ban on all imports of oil and gas from Russia Tuesday, acknowledging it would hurt Americans at the gas pump, but would be a ""powerful blow"" to Putin.",9

We were briefed in the Armed Services Committee that the United States couldn't send them stingers because we didn't have the type of variant that had some classified technology on it. Therefore, we couldn't give it to them. Now here we are, eight weeks later, finally giving it to him. You know what the problem was? Three screws to take a part off. That's what it took the administration months to figure out. And imagine if the Ukrainians had had those stingers on the rooftops on day one. So I agree with you not one American boots on the ground, but this administration is too little, too late. And they also asked for anti-ship missiles to defend their ports. … They didn't receive them. If they had had those, we'd be in a very different place in the Black Sea, too.

That is a lot of nonsense. I mean, Stingers, artillery pieces, anti-tank weapons — they're all there. And why are we afraid that we're going to provoke the Russians here? It's nonsense.

And clearly this continued escalation of this conflict and this war is not in the best interests of the American people or the world, frankly, which is why Zelinskyy's statement last night on News, for the first time that I'm aware of, opening the door, a window of opportunity where he's open to the fact of saying, hey, yeah, maybe we'll set this membership thing aside, and he's willing to talk with Putin directly to negotiate the outcome or the status of these disputed territories really extending an olive branch. … Nothing that the Biden administration has done has helped to make this situation better has helped to deescalate the situation, which is why the only conclusion that I can draw about why they have been completely silent and not engaging at all on this window of opportunity that President Zelenskyy opened last night, is that what is happening before our eyes right now is exactly what they want to see continue. Why is that? Because it's good for the military industrial complex. It makes these politicians look tough and really, you know, it allows them to have this proxy war with Russia, something that Hillary Clinton laid out just recently. Really, what their aims are this war machine, this power elite in Washington is they want to turn Ukraine into another Afghanistan turn into killing fields where this long term insurgency is supported, and they bleed out and cripple, kill as many Russians as possible for who knows, who knows how long, and they're really showing their real aim in the fact that they're not taking action right now to end this conflict.",0

2022-03-09,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-we-have-right-know-this,Tucker Carlson: Someone needs to explain why there are dangerous biological weapons in Ukraine,"Fox News host reacts to claims that the U.S. is funding biological programs in Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' If you had told us just four days ago that the Biden administration was funding secret bio labs in Ukraine of all places, we would not have believed you. Yeah, I don't think we're going to put that on . No thanks. Then, if you told us that not only did the administration fund these secret bio labs in Ukraine, but that they then failed to secure the deadly contents of those labs before the Russian invasion—an invasion they knew was coming, an invasion they helped encourage—if you had told us that four days ago, we would have dismissed you as a nut. It was just too preposterous. We will not want anything to do with a story like that. There was no way it could be true. It was too far out. In any case, we already knew for a fact that that story was false. How do we know that? Because we read Today, America's newspaper. Within hours of the Russian invasion, Today published a rebuttal to all those crazies who were yammering on about secret Ukrainian bio labs. Here was the headline: ""Fact check: False claim of biolabs in Ukraine tied to Russian disinformation campaign."" The U.S. Department of State is seen on January 6, 2020 in Washington, . So, if you look carefully at the story—and we did because we were interested—you notice that this fact check was sourced to Ukrainian government unnamed officials and then Biden State Department officials. These were not exactly objective sources on this subject, but still the story seemed definitive. It was totally emphatic. ""Russia has teamed up with China to further amplify the false claim of U.S. labs in Ukraine."" . Today says it's Russian disinformation. Maybe it is. On to the next story, but the fact checks didn't stop. That was weird. We kept seeing the same check again and again. It was almost like despite endless official clarification, some people refused to believe the Biden administration. They preferred Russian propaganda instead and we assume they must be non members. We assume that because Foreign Policy Magazine told us that. According to Foreign Policy, non, whatever that is, was frantically disseminating ""false claims of U.S. bio warfare labs in Ukraine."" Those labs obviously didn't exist. It was all just another lie from the Russians who lie for a living. Then the European Union... weighed in, throwing its credibility behind the same claim. These are conspiracy theories, the told us, they're lies spread by Putin. An spokesmen then reminded us that, ""the credibility of information provided by the Kremlin is in general, very doubtful and low."" That was good to know. ""Russian disinformation has a track record of promoting manipulative narratives about biological weapons and alleged secret labs."" Yeah. We're not going to do a segment about secret labs in Ukraine. Last thing we want to do on this show is traffic in Russian disinformation spread by non, so we took a pass on that story. And that's where things stood until yesterday when we happened to tune in to a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Toria Nuland was testifying so we were interested. Nuland was one of the people who brought us the Iraq War, never apologized for that and kept getting promoted because that's how works. Toria Nuland is now Joe Biden's Under Secretary of State in charge of Ukraine and she knows a lot about Ukraine. , ‘ A ’ Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland testifies before a Senate Foreign Relation Committee hearing on Ukraine on March 08, 2022 in Washington, . In 2014, Toria Nuland engineered a coup in Ukraine in the name of democracy, of course. So, she is a highly informed source about Ukraine. So, she was having this colloquy with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during her testimony, and at one point, Rubio took a tack that we were not expecting at all. He asked Nuland if Ukraine had biological weapons. We never imagined Ukraine would have biological weapons. Why would Ukraine have bioweapons? So, it seemed like a pretty strange question, but it wasn't half as shocking as the answer he got. Here's what Toria Nuland said. . : Does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons? : Ukraine has a biological research facilities, which, In fact, we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of. So, we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach. Does Ukraine have biological weapons? Ugh, Ukraine has biological research facilities. What? You mean secret bio labs like the secret bio labs that Ukraine definitely doesn't have? Ukraine has those? Yes, it does. And not only does Ukraine have secret bio labs, Toria Nuland said, whatever they're doing in those labs is so dangerous and so scary that she is, ""quite concerned"" that the so-called research material inside those bio labs might fall into the hands of Russian forces. : 1 Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland testifies before a Senate Foreign Relation Committee hearing on Ukraine on March 08, 2022 in Washington, . Try not to use profanity on the air to describe our reaction. Our jaws dropped, let's leave it there. Under oath in an open committee hearing, Toria Nuland just confirmed that the Russian disinformation they've been telling us for days is a lie and a conspiracy theory and crazy and immoral to believe is, in fact, totally and completely true. Woah, you don't hear things like that every day in Washington. Talk about a showstopper and a dozen questions instantly jump to mind. What exactly are they doing in these secret Ukrainian bio labs? Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe. It's hardly a hotbed of biomedical research. We're assuming these weren't pharmaceutical labs, probably not developing new Leukemia drugs. From your answer, Toria Nuland, we would assume because you all but said it, that there's a military application to this research, that they were working on bioweapons. Again, your answer suggests that. Why would we fund something like that in Ukraine, and why didn't you secure the contents of these bio labs before the Russians arrived as you knew they would? And then why did you go out of your way to lie to the American public about all of this? If the ""research materials"" in these labs were to escape somehow and you seem very concerned about that, what would be the effect on Ukraine and then on the rest of the world? How can we prepare for the consequences of that, this thing that you're worried about? Shouldn't we be preparing? Because as it turns out, we've just spent the last two years living with the pathogen that began in another foreign bio lab funded by the United States government secretly. So, this question is on our mind. It seems fair. Now that's some of what we would have asked if we were U.S. Senators, which were not. Yes, there's a time limit. Time limit be damned because this is kind of important, but Rubio did not ask those questions. Instead, he changed the subject and told us once again that Vladimir Putin is bad. . : If there is a biological or chemical weapon incident or... attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100%, it would be the Russians that would be behind it? : There is no doubt in my mind, senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they're planning to do themselves. ‘ ’ Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference at The Rosen Shingle Creek on Feb. 25, 2022, in Orlando, Florida. , just get a pen. It's a classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy, what they are planning to do themselves. That's what Toria Nuland said. We almost laughed out loud. So, what you're saying, Toria Nuland, if, for example, you were funding secret bio labs in Ukraine, but wanted to hide that fact from the people who are paying for it, in whose name you were doing it, then you might lie about it by claiming the Russians were lying about it. In other words, you might mount a disinformation campaign by claiming the other guy was mounting a disinformation campaign. Is that what you're saying, Toria Nuland? It's pretty funny. What's not funny is that this is all entirely real. We invited Marco Rubio on the show tonight to tell us what he knows about these bio labs. He declined to come. That invitation remains open. In the meantime, let's review what little we do know about this. We're going to start with a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday. Now, we would never do this. We never played anything like this on the show before because of course, we're Americans and when we want to know what's going on we ask our own officials, the people we elect and whose salaries we pay, because it's our country. We don't go to foreign sources because we trust our own sources first. But when it turns out the people who represent us and run our government are lying to us and never apologize for it and doing horrific things in our names, then you have to open your mind a little bit and at least assess what other people are saying. So, here was the Russian claim. : During the course of the special military operation, facts were uncovered of the key regime, mopping up traces of military biological program under development in Ukraine, financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry. . So, that apparently—we hadn't seen that until this afternoon we started poking around—that may have been the root of the conspiracy theories that the fact checks told us were Russian disinformation. Let's quote it: ""Military biological programs are under development in Ukraine, financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry."" That's the Russian claim. Separately, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Ukrainians were working on deadly pathogens, including plague and anthrax. Is that true? Now, obviously, we would not take Russia's word for that ever, but we don't have to take Russia's word for that. The U.S. Defense Department has a website that contains this media clip about the opening of a biological research facility in Ukraine in 2010. ‘ ’ , Chief of the Media Service and Information Directorate of the Russian Defence Ministry, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, gives a press briefing on the situation in the Idlib buffer zone in Syria. ""U.S. Senator Dick Lugar applauded the opening of the Interim Central Reference Laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine, this week, announcing that it will be instrumental in researching dangerous pathogens used by bioterrorists. The level-3 bio-safety lab will be used to study anthrax, tularemia and Q Fever, as well as other dangerous pathogens."" Oh, . Then the National Pulse dug up 2011 report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences that also explained that the Odessa based laboratory ""is responsible for the identification of especially dangerous biological pathogens."" So, what we're doing—this is not the first time you've heard this story—we are funding the creation of deadly pathogens so we can study them and prevent people from getting infected with them. Maybe? There are lots of examples of this. The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has a handy web page explaining that American and Ukrainian scientists have worked on a whole bunch of different experiments like this. Some of the projects include work on African swine fever virus, hemorrhagic fever virus, and various respiratory viruses. The interesting thing, the telling thing, is that the U.S. Embassy's website also contains links to fact sheets about America's support for biological research in Ukraine, but all those links are now dead. That's weird. It's our government. We pay for it. Again, they're there in our name, in the name of American citizens, but we can no longer read their web page. How does that work, exactly? They have no right to lie to us. The web page is archived, thankfully, and the fact sheets show Defense Department funding to laboratories in Ukraine. So that looks like proof. It's not Russian disinformation. It's totally real. Sorry Today, America's newspaper, it's real. You can look it up on the internet if you want. In the face of that evidence, the Pentagon is still lying about and in fact, they're repeating the same unbelievably stupid and now thoroughly discredited lies the fact checkers have told for weeks now. Here's the spokesman for the Pentagon, John Kirby, today. : The Russian accusations are absurd. They're laughable and, you know, in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. It's classic Russian propaganda and I wouldn't, if I were you,...I wouldn't give it a drop of ink worth...paying attention to. : Yeah, but can you explain to us what...has there been any relationship between the...? : We are not, not, developing biological or chemical weapons inside Ukraine. It's not happening. -29 , ‘-.’ If I were you, I wouldn't devote a drop of ink to it. First of all, you didn't get to make that decision, Mr. Bureaucrat. We have a free press in this country. You don't get to decide, but you'll notice at the end of that, Kirby refuses to answer the question. Has there been any relationship between the U.S. Pentagon and a bioweapons facility in Ukraine and if so, what is that relationship? That's Russian disinformation! What's the answer? We're not developing in Ukraine right now! , got it, but why are we funding this and what exactly are we funding? We reached out to the State Department separately and they provided us with this very carefully worded statement: ""The U.S. Department of Defense does not own or operate biological laboratories in Ukraine."" Not that anyone said they did. Continuing the quote, ""Undersecretary Nuland was referring to Ukrainian diagnostic and biodefense laboratories during her testimony, which are not biological weapons facilities."" What's the difference exactly? Continuing the quote, ""These institutions counter biological threats throughout the country."" So that means nothing. You could describe our nuclear stockpile correctly as defensive. Our nuclear weapons are not designed to preemptively kill anybody. They're designed to prevent other people from killing us, but they're still nuclear weapons. So, when you stop lying and telling us what's going on here and why don't you more specifically tell us why you didn't secure these materials? So, yes, we're funding secret bio labs in Ukraine, but they are diagnostic and biodefense laboratories that counter biological threats. , if these are purely defensive labs, why was Toria Nuland so concerned that Russians would get ahold of the materials from these facilities? Other world powers have come to the obvious conclusion. Again, we hate to do this, but under these circumstances, we asked our own spokespeople, they lied. We're going to the Foreign Ministry of China, a country we despise. Here's what they said today. They're calling on weapons inspectors to take a look at these facilities in Ukraine right away. : Over the past two decades, the United States has been blocking the establishment of a verification regime to the Biological Weapons Convention and refused to accept the inspection of biological facilities within and outside its borders. The move has further aggravated the concern of the international community. We, once again, urge the U.S. to provide full clarification of its bio militarization activities within and outside its borders and accept multilateral verification. Oh, they're putting Russian and Chinese propaganda on the screen! Yeah, we did. We also put U.S. government propaganda on the screen and the difference is we expect to be lied to by foreign governments. We're not globalists. We believe in one country. It's this country, the United States. We do not expect to be lied to by our government and we won't accept it. But let's get to the substance of what the Chinese government just said. We never agree with the Chinese government on anything, but in this case, they make a fair point. We now know that dangerous biological agents, whether you call them weapons or not is completely irrelevant because they can be used as weapons. Is a gun a weapon? Not when you're quail hunting. When you're in a gunfight, it is. It's a ridiculous semantic debate. Dangerous biological agents remain, thanks to the Biden administration, unsecured in a chaotic war zone. At some point we need to know how that happened, who made those decisions. We have a right to know and let's hope someone in Congress, probably not Marco Rubio, but someone else, will get to the bottom of it, but in the meantime, we pray that somewhere, in the United States government, there as an adult who cares enough to get this situation under control immediately.",0

Last month, as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense zone, prompting a broadcast warning from the island nation. In this Oct. 10, 2021, file photo, Taiwanese soldiers salute during National Day celebrations in front of the Presidential Building in Taipei, Taiwan. Military strategists in Taiwan are closely studying Ukrainians as they've mounted a fierce resistance against a more formidable opponent despite being outgunned and outmanned. : According to some estimates, China spends more than $250 billion on its annual military budget, while Taiwan spends around $13 billion. Still, the setback for Russia has been encouraging to many in Taiwan. Taiwanese lawmaker Lin Chu-Yin told Bloomberg this week that ""Putin’s war sends a signal to China that it won’t be as easy to take Taiwan as it imagines."" ""And it also breaks the myth that one can easily defeat another smaller or militarily weaker country with missiles,"" he said. A satellite image shows ground forces equipment and a convoy, in Khilchikha, Belarus February 28, 2022. Meanwhile, Ma Cheng-Kun, director of the Graduate Institute of China Military Affairs Studies at Taiwan’s National Defense University told Reuters this week that Taiwan’s military has been developing mobile weapons similar to the ones used by Ukraine to push back Russian forces. ""From Ukraine’s performance, we can be even more confident in our own,"" Ma said. Taiwan said it planned to double its yearly missile production capacity to close to 500 this year. The announcement from the defense ministry came after Taiwan approved an extra $8.6 billion for military spending over the next five years. ‘ ’ Tensions were mounting between China and Taiwan well before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. China has for decades regarded Taiwan as a renegade breakaway state. Taiwan and China split in 1949 and China has been increasing pressure on the self-ruled nation, while opposing its involvement in international organizations.

The U.S. and its western allies have imposed crippling sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, targeting the country's banking and financial sectors. However, it's unclear how far these countries would be willing to go against China, given that it plays a more dominant role in the global economy. Many leaders in Taiwan have also questioned how committed the U.S. would be if a conflict with Beijing were to escalate. ‘ ’ , ""If the world does not defend Taiwan, the whole order of things – especially in the Pacific – starts to change,"" retired former Green Beret George Fraser told Fox News. ""After Afghanistan and Ukraine, what country would trust an alliance with the U.S. or any other western nation. China would rise as the strategic power in the region and be on its way to supplanting the U.S. in its position as a global leader.""

Gallagher joined ""The Faulkner Focus"" Wednesday to discuss the White House approach to energy as they continue to pin blame on soaring gas prices on the Russian invasion into Ukraine. : 'S : If you add on to this absurdity with Russia, the fact that this administration is contemplating reviving the Iran deal, well, they may start to justify that by saying we need to bring Iranian crude onto the international market. Don't pay attention to the fact that they're the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. They're close to getting a nuclear weapon. And oh, by the way, they win in this deal, Russia wins and China wins in an Iran deal.

The defense portion passed by a vote of 361-69, and the domestic portion passed by a vote of 260-171 with one present vote. The House voted after months of stalling and debate as Congress faced a Friday deadline to approve government funding or risk a shutdown. In an earlier version of the bill released early Wednesday morning, there was a $15 billion appropriation for pandemic relief. But because of internal friction among Democrats and opposition from Republicans, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was forced to push back the expected vote on the package and remove the -19 funds. , $1.5T As a result, Democrats missed their planned departure to Philadelphia on Wednesday for a conference retreat. Members told Fox News Digital that delays surrounding the bill had to do with major concerns about coronavirus funding, as well as defense spending levels and the short amount of time to review the contents of the 2,741-page measure just hours before they were expected to approve it. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""It is heartbreaking to remove the funding, and we must continue to fight for urgently needed assistance, but unfortunately that will not be included in this bill,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a Wednesday letter to her fellow Democrats.

Michael Waltz discuss how the U.S. and allies could provide aid to Ukraine on ‘Hannity.’ — Congressional leaders reached a bipartisan deal early Wednesday providing $13.6 billion to help Ukraine and European allies plus billions more to battle the pandemic as part of an overdue $1.5 trillion measure financing federal agencies for the rest of this year. Though a tiny portion of the massive bill, the money responding to the Russian blitzkrieg that’s devastated parts of Ukraine and prompted Europe’s worst refugee crisis since World War ensured robust bipartisan support for the legislation. President Joe Biden had requested $10 billion for military, humanitarian and economic aid last week, and Democratic and Republican backing was so staunch that the figure grew to $12 billion Monday and $13.6 billion just a day later. ""We’re going to support them against tyranny, oppression, violent acts of subjugation,"" Biden said at the White House. , : Party leaders hoped to whip the 2,741-page measure through the House on Wednesday and the Senate by week’s end, though that chamber’s exact timing was unclear. Lawmakers were spurred by the urgency of helping Ukraine before Russia’s military might makes it too late. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez, D-N.J., arrives to meet with fellow Democrats, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 8, 2022. They also faced a Friday deadline to approve the government-wide spending measure or face a weekend election-year federal shutdown. As a backstop against delays, the House planned to pass a bill Wednesday keeping agencies afloat through March 15, said a House Democratic aide who wasn’t authorized to publicly describe the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity. ""War in Europe has focused the energies of Congress to getting something done and getting it done fast,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The bipartisan rallying behind the Ukraine aid package was just one manifestation of Congress’ eagerness to help the beleaguered country, though not all of it has been harmonious. ; Republicans accused Biden of moving too slowly to help Ukraine and nations assisting it, and to impose sanctions against Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. They’ve also used the crisis to amplify their yearslong drive to ease drilling restrictions on federal lands and to oppose Democrats’ attempts to curb carbon-heavy fuels that worsen climate change. A bipartisan push to ban Russian oil imports had grown perhaps unstoppable before Biden announced Tuesday that he would do that on his own. Democrats said time was needed to bring along European allies that rely heavily on Russian energy sources. They also noted that plenty of drilling is available on nonfederal lands. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., arrives for a weekly policy luncheon, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 8, 2022. Before the $1.5 trillion measure was released, some details had already emerged of a bill bearing victories for both parties. Democrats won $15.6 billion for a fresh round of spending for vaccines, testing and treatments for -19, including $5 billion for fighting the pandemic around the world. That was below Biden’s $22.5 billion request. - : ' A ' Republicans said they’d forced Democrats to pay for the entire amount by pulling back unspent money from past legislation. The money would come from previously approved spending for combating -19 and for helping states cope with pandemic costs, said one person who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the legislation publicly. Schumer said there would be money for Biden’s ""Cancer Moonshot"" to find a cure for the disease and for increasing Pell grants for lower-income college students. Still unresolved was whether to include programs protecting women against domestic violence and strengthening the country’s cybersecurity, Schumer said. The overall measure was on track to increase overall defense and domestic spending over last year’s levels, though exact figures were not yet available. No. 2 Senate leader John Thune of South Dakota said Republicans were happy with the boost for the military. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the measure would provide loan guarantees to Poland to help it replace aircraft it is sending Ukraine. ""It’s been like pulling teeth"" to get Democrats to agree to some of the defense spending, he said. But he added, ""It’s an important step. It needs to be passed. It needs to be passed quickly."" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., looks over his notes before taking questions from reporters and speaking about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 8, 2022. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., a sponsor of a bipartisan effort to win billions to help the pandemic-battered restaurant industry, said that initiative had not survived due to opposition. House leaders were hoping that chamber could approve the legislation on Wednesday, sending it to the Senate. Debate there could last days. Since the government’s fiscal year began last Oct. 1, agencies have been running on spending levels approved during Donald Trump’s final weeks in the White House. Congress has approved three short-term bills since then keeping agency doors open. Last week, eight conservative Republican senators wrote Schumer saying lawmakers ""should not vote on it"" until they’ve had time to read the bill and for a full study of its costs by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",13

China views Taiwan, which sits off the coast of mainland China, as a breakaway province that will one day be a part of the country. Taiwan operates as an independent country. As Xi likely weighs whether to invade Taiwan, the strength of his military will also come into play.

2022-03-10,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-questions-biolabs-ukraine-everyone-asking,Tucker Carlson: The questions about the biolabs in Ukraine that everyone should be asking,"Fox News host reacts to claims the U.S. has been funding biolabs in Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Wednesday, we told you that the Biden administration is funding a number of secretive biolabs in Ukraine, labs that are conducting experiments on highly dangerous pathogens. Now, that's not a story as we told you, that we wanted to do. In fact, we didn't think it could be true. It's so over-the-top and bizarre and in any case, the administration had repeatedly and very aggressively denied that they were doing anything like this and then they attacked anyone who has questions about it as a tool of Russia. We foolishly assumed that in this one instance, they might be telling the truth and then out of nowhere, the Biden official in charge of Ukraine confirmed the story. Toria Nuland, the Under Secretary of State, casually mentioned in a Senate hearing on Tuesday that actually, yes, the Biden administration does fund a series of biolabs in Ukraine and whatever is in these labs is so dangerous that she is deeply concerned these materials will fall into the hands of the Russian military. Now, that struck us as a shocking development. Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be true. Toria Nuland's testimony raised at least two immediate questions. What exactly are these labs doing with our money and in our name? And why didn't the Biden administration secure the contents of these labs before the Russians invaded? 21 ; Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland testifies before a Senate Foreign Relation Committee hearing on Ukraine on March 08, 2022 in Washington, . So far, we haven't received any answer at all to the second question. We think we're the only ones who have even asked it. Whoever decided to leave deadly biological materials sitting in Ukraine as Russian troops massed on the border has not yet been identified. We hope that person will be identified. We'll keep asking. As for the first question, what exactly is going on in these labs? We've gotten several answers, all of them insulting. Initially, the administration claimed the labs were designed to help the Ukrainians fight tuberculosis, as well as various livestock diseases. That's what officials told members of Congress. It didn't seem plausible and, in fact, it's not plausible. And then after our show last night, the Pentagon released what it non-ironically called a fact sheet designed to make the biolab story seem small and ridiculous. Virtually every news organization in America, with almost no exceptions, repeated the administration's claim verbatim with no verification of any kind. Foreign Policy Magazine ran this version of it, which was identical to many other versions you saw if you follow the news today. "" : DoD has worked with Ukraine to bioweapons left behind by the Soviet Union since 2005,"" said a senior U.S. defense intelligence official, ""but these are weapons labs as Russians falsely claim,"" the official said. The Washington Post assured us of the same thing, so did countless other so-called news organizations. , so no big deal. This is not actually a story. The Pentagon's been doing it since 2005, working with Ukrainians to ""eliminate biological weapons left behind by the Soviets."" That makes sense, but wait. 2005 was 17 years ago. How long does it take to eliminate Soviet bioweapons? Seventeen years seems like a long time. If you had 17 years and ample funding from Congress, you could probably remove and catalog every grain of sand on Waikiki Beach and yet somehow, over that same period 17 years, the Pentagon has not finished removing test tubes from Soviet-era freezers. How does that work exactly? How heavy are these bioweapons? Do we lack the transportation capacity to get them out of Ukraine and bury them in the desert in Nevada? When was the Pentagon planning to finish this important job? In 20 years? In 50 years? Those all seem like very obvious questions, but not a single reporter asked any of those questions. -: ‘’T A ’ Meanwhile, over at , perhaps where the first explanation didn't make sense once you thought about it, offered a new alibi. According to 's site, the labs in Ukraine exist to ""secure old Soviet weapons."" Ok, secure, not eliminate, which raises the question: what does it mean to secure a bioweapon? And again, why has it taken 17 years to do it? And by the way, if these are really just old Soviet weapons, why is Toria Nuland so worried they will wind up in the hands of old Soviets who presumably already have these very same weapons—probably don't need more. It's absurd when you think about it. So, don't think about it and that was the point of today's coverage of the Biden administration's secret Ukrainian biolabs. Stop thinking about it. Start accepting what they tell you at face value. Otherwise, you are an agent of Russia. Here's : , : The foreboding music, biohazard warnings. This Russian state media footage from 2015 claims to show America running facilities in Ukraine and Georgia that caused deadly outbreaks of disease and killed local livestock. This story is false, but that has not stopped it continuing to circulate, evolving from biological hazards to biological weapons and becoming a key part of Russia's disinformation campaign justifying the invasion of Ukraine. The claims were debunked several years ago, when in 2020, the United States issued a statement to ""set the record straight,"" explaining the facilities are in fact for vaccine development and to report outbreaks caused by dangerous pathogens before they pose security or stability threats. ""These claims were debunked several years ago."" These facilities work on vaccines and reporting outbreak, and then they play Russian propaganda. The point is anyone who asks questions about this is repeating Russian propaganda. Got it? And the truth is, we're not interested in what Russian propagandists say about these Ukrainian biolabs. We're not interested in what the propagandists at say about these biolabs. We're Americans, so we would like, in fact, we think we have a right to demand the Biden administration to answer simple questions, straightforward questions. These are obviously questions important enough to make Toria Nuland very nervous. But why? We don't know. They won't answer. So, instead, we did some digging of ourselves to see what we could find and here's we came up with. The day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Robert Pope, the man who heads the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at , sat for an interview with the website Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Pope was the man in charge of securing or eliminating Soviet-era bioweapons, so he knows a lot about the subject, maybe more than anyone else, but it turns out that not all of these Soviet weapons are being destroyed or even secured, and Pope acknowledged that in the interview, which apparently didn't see. According to his interview, Pope said the labs ""may hold pathogen strains left over from the Soviet bioweapons program preserved in freezers for research purposes."" Pope said that ""scientists, being scientists, it wouldn't surprise me if some of these strange collections and some of these laboratories still have pathogen strains that go all the way back to the origins of that program."" ‘’ In other words, because as Pope put it, ""scientists are scientists,"" they don't want to destroy all the bioweapons. Instead, they're using them to conduct new bioweapons research. That's what he said and not just on strains left over from the Soviet Union. The second lie. In fact, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has acknowledged joint American and Ukrainian research on other pathogens such as hemorrhagic fever virus. Apparently, there's a lot of this going on in Ukraine funded by the United States. Did you know that? Why Ukraine? We don't know. We can only guess. We do know that in 2010, the U.S. government helped fund construction of a brand-new level-3 biolab in Odessa, Ukraine. The purpose of that lab was not to eliminate or secure aging Soviet weapons. No. That lab was designed for research a new and ""especially dangerous pathogens"" in Ukraine, the poorest country in Europe. Again, not a hotbed of biomedical research. Why Ukraine? We don't know. Someone should find out. We do know that the Pentagon talking points you saw reported as fact on television today and last night were an utter lie. Did the reporters, who repeated those talking points verbatim, know they were a lie? Maybe they did. On the other hand, how would they know? They didn't bother to do any reporting whatsoever. They got a text from some Biden administration flack and they just read it on the air like it was true. You shouldn't be surprised because that's what they do and it's possible they're afraid not to do that. They know if they stray from the script the White House has written for them, they'll be denounced from the briefing room as tools of Putin. Here's Biden's publicist doing the very same thing today: : The main issue that prompted my Twitter thread yesterday was that Russia has a history also of inventing outright lies like this, which is the suggestion that the United States has a chemical and biological weapons program, or Ukraine does, that they're operating. Russia is the one, is the country, that has a chemical and biological weapons program. So, the objective was to make clear the inaccuracy of the information, the misinformation they're trying to put out, and make clear to the world that they not only have the capacity, they have a history of using chemical and biological weapons, and that, in this moment, we should have our eyes open. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki speaks during the daily press briefing at the White House November 12, 2021 in Washington, . Yeah, but no one denies that. That's the thing. No one denies that Russia has a chem bio program. That's bad. No one denies that Russia lies, of course, and has for a long time, that Russian propaganda is absolutely real, of course. That's not for debate. That's all true.",0

Check out what clicked this week in entertainment. Russian performers have begun canceling concerts in their home country and joining a larger ""no to war"" campaign condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24 after recognizing the independence of two separatist regions in the country. He labeled the attack a ""special military mission."" Outspoken Russian pop group Pussy Riot has used its stage to protest the war. Founding member Nadya Tolokonnikova recently dropped a ""F--- Putin"" at a New York City concert. : ""I hate war. I love peace. I support Ukraine. F--- Putin. I hope he dies soon,"" Tolokonnikova said. Tolokonnikova spoke to The Guardian about the devastation in Ukraine. ""I’m in a panic, I’m crying every day,"" she told the outlet. ""I don’t think it was in any sense necessary. I don’t think it was in any sense logical. It wasn’t something that had to happen. It’s a disaster that will end thousands of people’s lives. I’m freaking out. ""People underestimate how dangerous dictators are. In 2014, we spoke to the U.K. Parliament, we spoke at the Senate in the U.S., we were asked by a lot of people how they should talk to Putin, how they should frame the conversation, and I always advised that they should be as strict as they could. You cannot play nice with Putin."" Members of protest group Pussy Riot speak during a press conference Feb. 20, 2014, in Sochi, Russia. Nadya Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina stand outside of Zamoskvoretsky District Court during an unsanctioned protest rally Feb. 21, 2014, in Moscow.

Pussy Riot has been outspoken against Putin for years, and two of its members spent two years in jail for speaking out against the Russian government. Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich were arrested after the group staged a flash mob-style performance in a Moscow cathedral. They performed the song ""Close to the Altar"" and encouraged the Virgin Mary to ""throw Putin out."" ""I was traumatized by prison,"" Tolokonnikova told The Guardian. ""I was barely functional when I got released. I suffered from a really severe depression in 2014. I’m still on medication for depression caused by ."" Conductor Semyon Bychkov canceled upcoming June performances with the Russian National Youth Symphony Orchestra at Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow. — , ""This is a painful decision as I was looking forward with enormous joy to making music with the exceptionally gifted young Russian artists,"" Bychkov said. ""Yet doing so under the present circumstances would be an unconscionable act of acquiescence."" ""I want the spirit of this decision to be unmistakably clear: It is in no way directed at the orchestra or its public. The emotional suffering of ordinary Russian people at this time, the feeling of shame and economic losses they experience are real. So is a sense of helplessness in face of repression inflicted by the regime. Those individuals who dare to oppose this war put their own life in danger. They need us who are free to take a stand and say, ‘The guns must fall silent so that we can celebrate life over death.’"" Russian rapper Oxxxymiron, known formally as Miron Fyodorov, canceled six sold-out shows planned for Moscow and St. Petersburg as part of the antiwar movement. ""I know that most people in Russia are against this war, and I am confident that the more people would talk about their real attitude to it, the faster we can stop this horror,"" Oxxxymiron said in a video posted to Instagram. ""I cannot entertain you when Russian missiles are falling on Ukraine. When residents of Kyiv are forced to hide in basements and in the metro while people are dying."" Olga Smirnova publicly declared she is ""ashamed of Russia"" amid the ongoing conflict between the country and Ukraine. Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova publicly admitted she is ""ashamed of Russia."" ""I cannot but say that with all the fibers of my soul I am against the war,"" Smirnova wrote on a newly created Telegram account, according to the New York Post. ""I never thought that I would be ashamed of Russia. I have always been proud of the talented Russian people, our cultural and sporting achievements,"" the 30-year-old added. ""But now the line is drawn on the before and after. ""It hurts that people are dying, while others are deprived of a roof over their heads or forced to leave their homes. Political issues in a modern civilized society should be resolved exclusively through peaceful negotiations."" Outside of Russian performers, other stars across the world are denouncing the war. British ballet dancer Xander Parish revealed he is leaving Russia and the country's prestigious Mariinsky Ballet ""until peace comes."" ""Dear friends & followers, tonight I was supposed to be performing Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre but instead, due to the awful crisis I have taken the difficult decision to leave Russia, at least until peace comes,"" Parish wrote. ""My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine, near and far, including @kate_chebykina pictured with me here in @jivoy_dance’s ‘I’m not Scared.' I am so grateful to the Mariinsky Theatre who, thanks to Yuri Fateev, took me in 12 years ago and gave me a career in classical ballet I could only have dreamed about."" British ballet dancer Xander Parish revealed he was leaving Russia and the country's prestigious Mariinsky Ballet ""until peace comes."" Green Day canceled a concert, scheduled for May, in Moscow. ""With heavy hearts, in light of current events we feel it is necessary to cancel our upcoming show in Moscow at Spartak Stadium,"" Green Day wrote on its Instagram Story. ""We are aware that this moment is not about stadium rock shows, it's much bigger than that. But we also know that rock and roll is forever and we feel confident there will be a time and a place for us to return in the future,"" the band continued. ""Refunds available at the point of purchase. Stay safe."" Over the last two weeks, major players in Hollywood have taken swift action of their own to condemn Putin's actions with musicians, festival organizers and industry leaders announcing their decisions to postpone events in Russia, severely limiting entertainment offerings in the country. Putin launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine on Feb. 24. On Wednesday, a Russian airstrike devastated a maternity hospital in the besieged port city of Mariupol amid growing warnings from the West that Moscow’s invasion is about to take a more brutal and indiscriminate turn. Ukrainian officials said at least 17 people were wounded in the attack.",6

People are dying in Ukraine and he is dismissing it saying if you think that’s bad, wait until it gets worse later because of climate. How dismissive and dishonorable and disrespectful that is. … If we were building more pipelines we would be able to capture more natural gas rather than flare it. We would able to send petroleum products to refineries with lower carbon emissions and so forth.

2022-03-10,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-bystander-ukraine-energy-inflation-rep-darrell-issa,"Biden a bystander on Ukraine, energy and inflation crises","Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the president banning Russian oil imports on 'Special Report.' The Ukraine crisis may be a story of Russian aggression, but the preamble is the Biden administration’s total failure to strengthen America industrially and economically, rally the West, bolster , and deter Vladimir Putin. Weeks of sanction threats didn’t stop Putin. Rather, President Biden’s teleprompter sermons provided time for the amassing of offensive forces on the Ukraine border. I attended the Munich Security Conference in late February, along with a bipartisan array of my House and Senate colleagues. The administration was there, too, but provided nothing close to definitive policy. The clearest statements they made publicly or privately were that if you are an American citizen in Ukraine and find yourself trapped in a war zone, well, you’re on your own. 'S – , The culmination of this White House’s missteps: A 65-minute phone call between Biden and Putin. Less than two weeks later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine and the killing began. Biden’s response? A lot of words. Some at high volume. Others at a low whisper. But the out-loud contemplation of sanctions is a poor substitute for leading the nation and world. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and ice President Kamala Harris applaud during President Biden's State of the Union address at the Capitol on March 1, 2022. Many thought the State of the Union Address would be different. It wasn’t. It was empty cheerleading. Take Biden’s full-throated assurance that Putin ""will never gain the hearts and souls of the Iranian people."" We know he meant to say ""Ukrainian"" people. But the statement makes no more sense with the correction. Who can possibly think at this point that Putin is trying to win the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people? He’s trying to take their country and their freedom. I’ve attended 17 State of the Union addresses. I’ve never seen one that was followed by less action from a White House. It’s now been seven days since Biden’s national address. No legislation. No Cabinet-level Hill consultation. No bipartisan White House gathering. The Biden administration had already plunged this country into an energy crisis before Putin mobilized soldiers for this invasion of Ukraine. This brings us to Tuesday’s announcement by President Biden to restrict Russian energy imports weeks after my colleagues and I urged him to do so. The policy move is fine, but his remarks were defensive, divisive and, quite frankly, dishonest. He did not in any way advance the national interest or our international standing. And it is simply not true – as he said – that this administration is doing all it can to lessen the pain that Americans are feeling at the pump, from their utility bills, and in their inflation-battered pocketbooks. It’s dishonest for the White House to link the inflation its policies skyrocketed – and the gas prices it drove up just as fast – to the crisis in Ukraine. This is a naked attempt to offload its failures onto what it hopes will be a sharing of blame with others. The truth is, the Biden administration had already plunged this country into an energy crisis before Putin mobilized soldiers for this invasion of Ukraine. From his first days in office, President Biden stopped energy infrastructure and sent an unmistakable message to the energy industry: no to pipelines, no to drilling, no to the financing of oil and gas projects. This was a stunning reversal of the energy independence policies that were working when he took office as oil production exceeded consumption for most of 2019 and 2020. Has the White House looked to our country for a solution? Just the opposite. It is beseeching and Venezuela to produce more crude. Is Iran next? The administration repeatedly suggests the use of renewables that have no capacity to help us right now and for struggling consumers to buy the electric cars they can’t afford. It's a shame that this White House is so captive to its progressive base and invested in its Green New Deal promises to turn to the best of America. The Congress stands ready to support real measures. But the only administration source heading to the Hill this week is the State Department’s undersecretary for political affairs. Not the secretary of state. Not the national security adviser. Not the secretary of defense. And yet again, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has scheduled a short work week in Washington so the Democrats can get out of town and attend their team-building retreat. Enough. There is no substitute for presidential action, and Biden has been a bystander long enough. Here’s hoping President Biden will address the nation soon with depth, insight and solutions. He certainly hasn’t done it yet.",9

2022-03-10,https://www.foxnews.com/world/pressure-builds-on-biden-to-repay-venezuelas-goodwill-moves,Pressure builds on Biden to repay Venezuela for freeing American prisoners,"Pressure is building on the Biden administration to begin unwinding sanctions on Venezuela after President Nicolas Maduro freed two American prisoners and promised to resume negotiations with his opponents. Maduro’s goodwill gesture came during a weekend trip to Caracas by senior White House and State Department officials that caught off guard Maduro’s friends and foes alike. While the Biden administration is saying little about what was discussed behind closed doors, a smug Maduro — who has sought face-to-face talks with the U.S. for years — bragged that careful protocol was followed, with the flags of the two nations ""beautifully united, as they should be."" 2 For the past five years, the U.S. has, with little success, tried everything from punishing oil sanctions to criminal indictments and support for clandestine coups in its campaign to remove Maduro and restore what it sees as Venezuela’s stolen democracy. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upended the world order, forcing the U.S. to rethink its national security priorities. Hostile petrostates under U.S. sanctions like Iran and Venezuela are seen as the most likely to benefit as President Joe Biden seeks to mitigate the impact from a ban on Russian oil imports that may aggravate the highest inflation in four decades. Venezuelan oil might help ease inflation pressures, at least psychologically and in the medium term, even if it would take time for significant supplies to reach the U.S. But while Venezuela is eager to win relaxation of the economically devastating sanctions, there were signs Thursday it’s not ready to immediately abandon ties to key ally Russia. , , ' ' Only days after the U.S. talks, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez met in Turkey with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sideline of his talks with Ukraine, according to a photo tweet from Russia’s embassy in Caracas, though no details of their discussions were released. Still, the approach has changed in Washington. ""Clearly at some level a decision was made to abandon some of the pillars of the U.S. policy toward Venezuela these past few years,"" said Brian Winter, vice president of the Council of the Americas. ""But until we know precisely what the Biden administration is trying to achieve, it’ll be difficult to evaluate how far this détente can go."" U.S. officials have not detailed any other specific outcomes of the talks, which were led by Juan González, who is responsible for Latin America on the National Security Council. It was the first Venezuela visit by a White House official since Hugo Chávez led the country in the late 1990s, and a rare opportunity to discuss policy issues with the Maduro government. : One official described it as ""a constructive, diplomatic but very candid dialogue"" that did not entail any quid pro quo but allowed the Biden administration to share its ""view of the world"" with Maduro. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that it was an encouraging sign that Maduro decided to return to negotiations in Mexico with his opponents. But neither she nor anyone else in the administration would say how the U.S. would reciprocate, if at all. ""There are a range of issues moving forward, but right now we’re just celebrating the return of two Americans,"" Psaki said. But some American lawmakers are hopeful that direct talks with Maduro can produce meaningful changes. Rep. Gregory Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, applauded Biden’s efforts and said he should next suspend oil sanctions to provide support for negotiations without letting up pressure on human rights abusers and corrupt officials. ""The Trump-era oil sanctions currently in place have only deepened the suffering of the Venezuelan people and failed to weaken Maduro’s control of the country,"" Meeks said in a statement Wednesday. One of the Americans released, oil executive Gustavo Cardenas, had been imprisoned in Venezuela since 2017, when he and several colleagues at Houston-based Citgo were lured to Caracas for what they thought was a meeting with their parent company, state run oil giant . Instead, masked security officers bearing assault rifles burst into a conference room and arrested the men. Later they were sentenced on corruption charges stemming from a never-executed plan to refinance some $4 billion in Citgo bonds by offering a 50% stake in the company as collateral. Cardenas, in a statement Wednesday, said his imprisonment of more than four years ""has caused a lot of suffering and pain, much more than I can explain with my words."" The eight Americans who remain imprisoned in Venezuela, including five of Cardenas’ colleagues from Citgo, are an important obstacle to normal relations with Maduro. But even if a release of the remaining prisoners seems remote, Winter says there is a small window now to keep momentum building, as the U.S. gears up for a long geopolitical standoff with Russia. '' '' , , Among the options available to the U.S. is allowing Chevron — the last remaining American oil company in Venezuela — to boost production and possibly resume oil exports to Gulf Coast refineries tailor made to process the country’s tar-like crude, a U.S. official said prior to the weekend’s shuttle diplomacy. Under U.S. sanctions, Chevron is banned from negotiating with Maduro and doing all but basic upkeep on wells it operates in connection with . There has also been speculation the U.S. could seek to reopen its embassy in Caracas, which has been shuttered since the Trump administration and other governments in 2019 recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Much depends on how much Maduro sets aside his authoritarian impulses. Even as he hosts top U.S. officials, Maduro has shown little sign he is willing to abandon Russian President Vladimir Putin. He spoke by phone with the Russian leader last week in a show of support and attended a rally in Caracas where Putin’s ambassador received a roaring ovation from ruling socialist party stalwarts. Winter said Maduro will also have to show a real willingness to negotiate in earnest with his opponents and not use the talks as he has in the past as a delaying tactic to ease international pressure. Opposition hardliners, as well as their allies in the U.S. Congress, have started to chastise Biden for abandoning a multilateral policy of isolating Maduro. Wherever the outreach ends up, some Venezuelan government insiders are already giddy over the prospects of a better future if not the return to the days when they could buy up real estate in the U.S. and spend weekends in Miami.",22

Republican senators are blasting the Biden administration's refusal to provide combat aircraft to Ukraine, expressing skepticism over the claim that such a move could escalate tensions between the U.S. and Russia. Several members of the Senate Intelligence Committee called out the administration during a Thursday hearing, unsatisfied with what intelligence officials were saying. , ' ‘’ Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., noted that according to U.S. intelligence in January, Russia did not want ""a direct conflict with the United States."" Cotton doubted that this would have changed, considering the Russian military's struggling invasion of Ukraine.

""You think they're more likely to want a piece of us now than they were two months ago?"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee for a hearing at the Capitol, Thursday, March 10, 2022. Haines said it was not a question of Russia wanting a conflict, but perceiving the U.S. as ""being in that conflict."" Cotton was not convinced, arguing that it appears that Putin ""deterred"" the Biden administration by claiming that transporting aircraft would be escalatory. - : ""And if that's going to be our position, we might as well call the commanding general at Fort Lewis outside Seattle and tell him to take the flag down and surrender our position,"" Cotton said, positing that Putin will not stop in Ukraine or even Europe, but will go ""all the way to the West Coast,"" if the U.S. backs off every time he issues a threat. Sen. Tom Cotton listens to testimony from leaders of the intelligence community during a Senate hearing on March 10, 2022, in Washington. Cotton had asked for specific new information that would support the administration's position, but given the sensitive nature of the information Haines offered written material instead. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., shared Cotton's skepticism, but opted to keep his questions for a closed session where the witnesses could speak more freely. He did weigh in on the matter, however, after calling Cotton's questions the most significant part of the hearing thus far. ""Vladimir Putin will embrace the idea that we might self-deter every time he issues a press release. And lawyerly hair-splitting about providing this kind of weaponry is not escalatory but providing that kind of weaponry is escalatory – I don't think we really believe that,"" Sasse said.

Director Christopher Wray, left, National Security Agency Director Gen. Paul Nakasone and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on March 10, 2022, in Washington. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., also took a cue from Cotton and questioned the logic behind the administration's decision-making. Burr noted that both the U.S. and Poland are part of , so it is curious that the U.S. would give Poland a ""green light"" to transfer aircraft to Ukraine, but ""changes their mind"" when the planes are to come from American geography. ""I draw this conclusion: this is a policy decision,"" Burr said, noting that intelligence and policy are typically kept separate. Republican Sens. Tom Cotton, John Cornyn and Ben Sasse listen to testimony from leaders of the intelligence community during a Senate hearing March 10, 2022, in Washington. ""My hope is that we haven't as an intelligence community put our finger on the scale of a policy decision that's been made,"" Burr said.

Host Tucker Carlson noted how sanctions appear superficially to be an easy way to get tough with an adversary, especially after Putin invaded Ukraine and started committing alleged war crimes against civilians. ""Do the sanctions punish the people they're intended to punish? And … are there unintended consequences that we should be thinking about? Good intentions are not enough. You have to care about the effects of your policies. That's how adults make decisions,"" Carlson said. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the Valdai Discussion Club's plenary meeting in Sochi, Russia Clint Ehrlich, a Russia policy expert, told Carlson that the sanctions against the Kremlin may be helping Putin – especially at home. He cited sources on the ground who reported that the autocrat's popularity spiked 10 points in the time since the West took action against the Russian economy, and companies like Visa, McDonalds and other business titans either banned or pulled out of operations in the country. Presidents Biden and Putin ""I know individuals on the ground in Russia who were frankly anti-Putin and pro-Western before this happened, and they've been impacted by these sanctions so much that they're now really turning against the West,"" he said. Russian and Belarusian flags wave during a wreath laying ceremony at the Victory Monument. Ehrlich added that another consequence has been Russia further endearing itself to China – and due to it being blocked from the global banking system, the pair may seek to create a parallel monetary system, thereby weakening the dollar and putting its global fiat status at risk. ""Any state has to consider the risk that if it holds dollars as a reserve currency for its central bank, that those assets or other fiat assets that are under the control of the West could be frozen,"" he said. ""It frankly undermines our influence very directly."" ""What we've effectively done is starting to re-erect the Iron Curtain. It was our policy during the Cold War to try to integrate Russia with the West, to try to integrate them politically and economically. Instead, what we've done is isolate them. And so essentially, we've created a new North Korea, but this time with 6,000 nuclear weapons."" ""And so that doesn't advance our national interests and frankly, it threatens global security.""

The push by the Republican senators, including Sen. Bill Cassidy R-La., and Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., comes as they argue that the United States' national security is threatened by the ongoing aggressive actions by Russia toward Ukraine and by China's increasing hostility. $40 ‘ ’ America's national debt hit a record-breaking $30 trillion last month, and America’s total foreign-owed national debt exceeds $7.7 trillion dollars, with China owning roughly $1.07 trillion, according to the Department of Treasury. ""The United States should not owe over $1 trillion to adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party Chinese Communist Party ,"" Ernst said in a statement to Fox News Digital while announcing the new bill. The senator noted that it is especially egregious because China uses interest payments to fund forced labor camps in Xinjiang. Sen. Joni Ernst speaks during a press conference following the weekly Senate Republican policy luncheon in the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill on Jan. 19, 2022. ""Adversarial ownership over our national debt by foreign entities is not only harmful to our economy—it’s also a direct threat to our national security,"" Ernst said. With the introduction of the bill, the senator hopes that the United States' national debt will no longer be taken advantage of by the Chinese.

2022-03-10,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ukrainian-crisis-china-russia-putin-europe,"In Ukrainian crisis, China is part of problem. Does Europe get it?","‘The Five’ discusses Russia’s reaction to oil sanctions and ban imposed by U.S. and how Russians might turn to China to offset the economic fallout. China has shown its true colors. The regime in Beijing has been an enabler, supporter, underwriter, excuse-maker, and propagandist for Putin’s brutal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. Before the war, in a bid to get China to convince Putin to stop his troop buildup along the border, President Biden foolishly shared U.S. intelligence with Beijing. Rather than restraining Moscow, China handed over the cache of American info to Putin. ‘ ’ European leaders would be equally foolish to look to China for help. They must recognize that Beijing is pleased Putin is doing their work for them, pushing to weaken, destabilize, and divide Europe. An effort to restrain Moscow is the last thing the West should expect from Beijing. Yet false hope still lives in some quarters. The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, recently told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that he supports Chinese mediation in the Russian-Ukrainian war. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping ""There is no alternative,"" he said. ""We [Europeans] cannot be the mediators, that is clear.… And it cannot be the U.S., either. Who else? It has to be China; I trust in that."" This is a proposal unconnected to reality. Let's start by pointing out Xi Jinping is on Putin’s side. At the outbreak of hostilities, Beijing immediately announced it would not join the western financial sanctions against Moscow. It also abstained on the resolution strongly condemning the invasion. Rather than restraining Moscow, China handed over the cache of American info to Putin. Since the invasion, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has described relations between China and Russia as ""rock solid."" Indeed, China and Russia have issued a joint statement reiterating Beijing’s support for Moscow's position opposing expansion eastward. Moreover, they have consolidated their relationships in the financial and energy sectors. '' Why would China want Russia to stop when Putin has served as a stalking horse for all the Chinese Communist Party’s priorities? Beijing hopes that the Ukrainian crisis will stretch the Americans like a rubber band, making the U.S. unable to pay attention to Europe and Asia at the same time. Beijing is also betting that Russian aggression against Ukraine will weaken and transatlantic relations. Russia and China hope that the dependence of some European countries on Russian gas and French proposals for European strategic autonomy will further weaken and divide the Atlantic Alliance in a time of crisis. Xi is also banking on the current political and diplomatic crisis making Moscow even more economically dependent on Beijing, making the Kremlin even more compliant in serving’s China interests. Clearly, putting China in the role of mediator, as Borrell suggests, could only make matters worse for the West. Beijing is interested only in increasing its geopolitical advantage, and this is a risk for the European Union above all. Russia has recently strengthened its gas supply links with China, making it less dependent on Western sales to fuel its economy. Additionally, both Moscow and Beijing are increasing their influence over large parts of Africa. In particular, the Russians have a growing weight on eastern Libya and the Sahel region. Africa is functional to the geopolitical bloc that China and Russia are building, with the aim of marginalizing the United States and dividing Europeans. Instead of relying on Beijing, Brussels should therefore strive to counter Sino-Russian geopolitical pressure. It should consolidate transatlantic relations by reestablishing clear energy autonomy, strengthening its borders on land and sea, and building into a stronger military stiff arm to foreign aggression. It is also time to make hard choices. countries, starting with Germany, should reexamine their ties with Beijing. Start by keeping the highly controversial -China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment in the ""freezer."" This is no time to expand economic ties. Biden, for his part, should understand that Beijing is not a reliable mediator, since it has every interest in undermining transatlantic relations. In the Ukrainian crisis, China is not the solution. It is part of the problem.",5

2022-03-11,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-poll-democrats-strongest-months,Biden says Democrats in 'strongest position' in months; new poll suggests that’s wishful thinking,"An optimistic President Biden rallied the Democratic Party ahead of November’s midterm elections, when they hope to defend their razor-thin House and Senate majorities. ""Coming out of the State of the Union, we are in the strongest position we’ve been in months,"" the president argued as he addressed the Democratic National Committee’s winter meeting. On Thursday evening he emphasized that Democrats ""have a record – a record to be proud of; an agenda that addresses the biggest concerns here in America, in people’s lives; the message that resonates."" But a new national survey suggests the president’s comments are wishful thinking, that talk of a Biden ""bounce"" in the polls – following his State of the Union address on March 1 and after most Americans appear to be supportive of his handling of America’s moves to punish Russia for its deadly assault on neighboring Ukraine – might be overrated. An //Marist national survey released March 4 that indicated the president’s approval up to 47% and his disapproval down to 51% grabbed plenty of headlines. And it was followed earlier this week by polls from Reuters/Ipsos and Politico/Morning Score that also suggested a post-State of the Union bump for Biden. But Biden stands well underwater at 42% approval and 57% disapproval in a Wall Street Journal survey conducted March 2-7 and released on Friday. Those numbers were virtually unchanged for the Journal’s previous poll, which was conducted in November. Half of those questioned in the poll cited inflation and the economy as their most pressing issue, and 63% give the president a thumbs-down on how he’s handling the soaring costs of fuel and food. And by a 47%-30% margin, those surveyed said Republicans rather than Democrats were better able to handle inflation. ""The mood of the country hasn’t gotten any better since the last poll. In fact, it’s gotten a little worse,"" Democratic pollster John Anzalone told the Journal. Anzalone, who was the lead pollster on Biden’s successful 2020 presidential campaign, conducted the Journal survey along with veteran Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, who conducted surveys for former President Trump’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns. 2021: 'S With under eight months to go until the midterms, the survey indicated the with a five-point advantage over the Democrats in the generic ballot, a key barometer used to gauge support for congressional races. And the poll’s generic ballot question pointed to a big jump in support for Republican among Hispanic voters and an erosion for Democrats among Black voters, which Real Clear Politics co-founder and president Tom Bevan argued was ""a 5-alarm fire for the Democratic Party."" Biden’s approval rating hovered in the low to mid-50s during his first six months in the White House. But the president’s numbers started sagging in August in the wake of Biden's much criticized handling of the turbulent U.S. exit from Afghanistan and following a surge in -19 cases last summer amid the coronavirus' delta variant among mainly unvaccinated people. The plunge in the president's approval was also fueled by the surge in inflation and to a lesser degree the dramatic rise over the past year of migrants trying to cross into the U.S. along the southern border. , An average of the all the most recent national polls on the president’s standing with Americans compiled by Real Clear Politics put Biden at 41%-54% on March 1, the day he delivered the State of the Union address and less than a week after Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine. According to the latest average, the president now stands at 43%-52%. A similar compilation by the polling aggregator and analysis shop FiveThirtyEight also showed Biden with a slight bump, from 41%-54% on March 1 to 43%-51% now. President Biden delivers the State of the Union address, at the U.S. Capitol on March 1, 2022. Veteran Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News poll with Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, said that he’s ""pretty skeptical about a bounce back either due to the State of the Union or a Ukrainian rally effect."" And Anderson told Fox News that ""it’s not a huge change. It’s certainly not like things have done a 360 and now Biden’s on a clear upward trend. I think we’ll know in a couple of weeks but as of right now the answer is maybe."" Shaw, who conducted polling for former President George W. Bush’s 2000 and 2004 campaigns, said that polling indicates that Biden ""basically lost independents last fall. I don’t see any reason to think that short-term forces have moved in a way that [they're] going to get them back.""",13

Joe Biden's been counting on Vladimir Putin to be his lawyer for the last year to try to get Iran to cut a deal with us. And that's one of the reasons why he was so weak over the last year, is he didn't want to do anything to offend Vladimir Putin and upset the apple cart with this nuclear deal with Iran. And now, as they were just about to strike another terrible deal, Iran and Russia walk away from the table, because they know they have Joe Biden over the barrel that he desperately wants this nuclear deal, and they can extract more concessions from him, both in Ukraine and in Iran.

Look at that. He didn't even benefit from unifying a country because of an international crisis. Usually, a president can rely upon five, six, seven more points just when there's crisis and uncertainty elsewhere where we feel there's an American interest. He hasn't even benefited that way, and you see why. He's yelling at America again from Philadelphia. He's blaming Putin, blaming the rest of us. Don't forget, 40 percent of the gas hike happened before Putin ever even invaded Ukraine. Don't forget, a couple of months ago, Joe Biden was blaming gas prices and inflation on the supply chain crisis on the ""pent-up"" demand for post-pandemic travel. You cannot have an American president that has an America-last policy and blames Americans and America for what's going wrong. He needs to step up and reflect the best of who we are.",0

2022-03-13,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rooftop-revelations-pastor-brooks-takes-on-joy-reids-racialization-of-the-ukraine-war,Rooftop Revelations: Pastor Brooks takes on Joy Reid’s racialization of the Ukraine War,"– On the 100th day of his rooftop vigil to build a community center, Pastor Corey Brooks decided not to come off the roof because he had not reached his fundraising goal. He raised $10 million in the first 100 days, an accomplishment that still left him short of his $35 million goal. After a two week break, ""Rooftop Revelations"" resumes on the 113th day and the pastor wished to share his thoughts on Joy Reid and how she reduced the Ukraine-Russia war to race. What follows has been lightly edited. We strongly encourage you to watch the accompanying video so you may hear the pastor in his own words. Like many concerned Americans, I have been following the war that Russia launched upon Ukraine. Matter of fact, it's pretty much all that we've been talking about on this rooftop on the South Side of Chicago. The one thing that has been so inspiring for us is to see how bravely and strongly these Ukrainians are fighting for their freedoms — freedoms that many of us in America take for granted. We know what will happen to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters if they lose the war to Russia. Lose the war, lose your freedoms. Freedom, I believe, is everything. Nothing else matters. That's why it troubles me tremendously when people like Joy Reid reduce the freedom struggle of the Ukrainians down to the lowliest of human values: race. People like Joy Reid seem incapable of seeing anything beyond the racial lens. It's all that she has. Race is her power. : On her show, Joy Reid recently accused Americans of ignoring wars featuring people of color, like the Yemen war, in favor of wars fought by whites and Christians. She said, and I quote, ""The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to Western media compared to their browner and blacker counterparts."" Does anyone seriously think that Joy Reid covered the Yemen war in the past? I mean, it's been going on for years. And if Joy Reid has covered it, then where is the coverage? I haven't seen it, if any. I bet she didn't cover it any serious way because she couldn't make it about race. Just like so many others, race is her power, her substance. Race is a reductive force that bypasses human complexities for the overly simplistic values that we project onto skin colors. In asking us to ignore human complexities, race makes us liars out of us. And by imposing her views of race onto the Ukrainian-Russian war, Joy Reid attempted to make the war about herself, her views of race. And that is worth what? That is why I've steadfastly refused to play the race card. Race is not my power. My intellect, and my ability to understand complex issues like the Ukrainian conflict, that's my power, not race. There are some of you that may say, ""What about the Africans being denied entry into other nations?"" I condemn those acts of racism. At the same time, don't you know that Poland has taken in over 100 different nationalities in the last three weeks. While racism may have played a part, we must also ask if nationalism and citizenship issues played a role as well. Also, I've read stories of visitors to the Ukraine describing their experiences. One of the stories I came across was a woman on Twitter who said she visited a hotel several years ago. When the clerk saw her Armenian name, she told the guest that she was not welcome there. The hotel manager overheard it and fired the clerk on the spot and told her never come back. He then told the Armenian woman that her hotel stay had been comped. Ukraine, like America, doesn't have the perfect past. What Ukraine did to the Jews during the Holocaust was simply horrific. But because I believe in the ability of our civilization to evolve, to progress, to move beyond the sins of the past, I must give the Ukrainian people credit for evolving to become a modern nation with modern sensibilities. They have fought for freedom over and over since the end of the cold war and today they are in the fight to death for their freedoms. Those who do not move beyond the past, those who hold on to past grievances, those who do not rise to join the modern world — those people have nothing to offer us. Instead of building themselves into a superpower nation, Russia invaded Ukraine in the name of a long-gone empire. Instead of doing her job and looking into the complexities of the war, Joy Reid reduced the war down to race because she had nothing else to offer. For Joy Reid, I believe attacking whites is her bread and butter. She's absolutely nothing without race. And now here is the supreme irony of all this. Joy Reid blasted us for ignoring wars involving brown and black people. She professes to care so much about brown and black people. I then must ask why hasn't she ever come into my community to talk about the daunting problems we deal with every single day? Why hasn't she come here to learn for herself how our plans for a community center can transform so many lives? Why hasn't she come here to share her wisdom with us on the South Side of Chicago? She milks our pain for her paycheck yet she never visits us. She never talks about us. So that is why Joy Reid's complaint about the Ukraine war rings so hollow with me. And that is why on the South Side of Chicago, I choose to fight for opportunities for my brothers and sisters instead of playing the meaningless race game that gets us absolutely nowhere. I know some are going to be mad, some are going to be upset, but I stand by what I say and what I believe.

Any country supporting Taiwan militarily would face the ""worst consequences,"" China's government warned Saturday, adding that ""no one and no force"" would be able to stop the Communist Party if it took action against the island country, according to a report. China’s relationship with Taiwan has come into focus against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the island bolstering its own defenses since the war started in case of aggression from the mainland. Taiwan said it planned to double its yearly missile-production capacity this year. The announcement from the defense ministry came after Taiwan approved an extra $8.6 billion for military spending over the next five years. : Beijing doesn’t see Taiwan as a sovereign country but rather as a breakaway province that can be absorbed back into China by force if deemed necessary. Chinese military personnel pass by a board displaying a photo of Chinese President Xi Jinping on March 4, 2022, in Beijing. 'S The Communist Party’s warning came a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping held diplomatic talks with Australia, according to Sky News Australia. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen listens while inspecting reservists training at a military base in Taoyuan on March 12, 2022. China’s Ministry of National Defense accused Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton of ""ideological bias"" after he said the country would do ""whatever we can"" to keep China from attacking Taiwan, Sky News reported. China has taken a more aggressive stance against the Democratic island nation lately, sending a record number of fighter jets into Taiwan’s air defense zone late last year. And last month, as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense zone, prompting a broadcast warning from the island nation. Taiwan has been increasingly on edge since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, seeing parallels between their own situation with Beijing. After the invasion, the slogan ""Today, Ukraine, tomorrow, Taiwan!"" spread online, according to The New York Times. According to some estimates, China spends more than $250 billion on its annual military budget, while Taiwan spends around $13 billion. The Communist Party characteristically balked at Taiwan’s recent concerns in the wake of Moscow’s war in Ukraine, suggesting it's exaggerated rhetoric meant to make Beijing look aggressive. ""We continue to watch to try to identify, has [China] learned the correct lessons as it applies to the changing world order and the concern that we see in the Ukraine?"" U.S. Navy Adm.

Pence didn’t refer to Trump by name in his comments, but his targeting of those in the who haven’t fully condemned Putin follows multiple remarks made last month by Pence’s former boss describing Putin’s ""genius"" and ""savvy"" in launching the attack. But Trump has also argued that he was ""tough"" on Putin during his four years in the White House and has repeatedly claimed that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if he were still president. In recent days the former president’s also described the horrific pictures of Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians as a ""holocaust. Nikki Haley headed to New Hampshire Former two-term South Carolina Nikki Haley, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the first two years of the Trump administration, will return to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire early next month to campaign with a former official in Trump’s State Department who’s running for Congress. The trip by Haley, which was first reported by Fox News, will spark more speculation about her possible national ambitions. : Haley will spend April 4 in New Hampshire, teaming up with Republican congressional candidate Matt Mowers at multiple stops including a fundraiser in the southern town of Salem. Mowers is one of the top contenders in the crowded primary in New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, a longtime premiere House swing district that the ’s aiming to flip from blue to red in November’s midterm elections. Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley campaigns with congressional candidate Matt Mowers in Bedford, New Hampshire, in October of 2020. The stop in New Hampshire will be Haley’s first since October 2020, when she campaigned with Mowers during his first bid for the seat. Mowers won the nomination but lost the general election to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas by five points. The two-term Democratic incumbent is running for reelection again this year. Pompeo back in Iowa Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo returned to Iowa on Friday night for the second time in a month. And it was Pompeo’s fourth trip over the past year to the state whose caucuses for a half century’s kicked off the presidential nominating calendar. Pompeo, a former congressman from Kansas who served as director and later as America’s top diplomat during former the Trump administration, headlined an Iowa fundraising dinner in eastern city of Davenport along with former longtime Hawkeye State Gov. Terry Branstad, who served as ambassador to China under Trump. Fox News learned last month that Pompeo will head back to Iowa again in April for events in the western part of the state. 'S Asked about 2024, Pompeo, told Fox News last summer in Iowa that ""my wife and I will pray and we’ll think our way through it and when we hit 2023, we’ll figure our way through it."" Iowa’s lead off position takes incoming fire at meeting While Pompeo was in Iowa, the state’s lead off status in the Democratic presidential nominating calendar was facing serious scrutiny at a meeting of the Democratic National Committee’s Rules and Bylaws Committee Friday evening in the nation’s capital. While there were no final decisions – that will likely come at the ’s summer meeting later this year – many of the party members who spoke at the gathering were clearly open to reordering the presidential nominating calendar to better reflect the party’s growing diversity and values. , The knock against Iowa and New Hampshire – among some Democrats – for years has been that the states are too White, lack any major urban areas, and aren’t representative of a Democratic Party that’s become increasingly diverse over the past several decades. Nevada and South Carolina are much more diverse and have larger metropolitan areas than either Iowa or New Hampshire. - The Iowa Caucuses exhibit in Des Moines, Iowa And Nevada Democrats last year passed a bill into law that would transform the state’s presidential caucus into a primary and aim to move the contest to the lead-off position in the race for the White House, ahead of Iowa and New Hampshire. Compounding Iowa's issues was the botched reporting of the 2020 caucuses, which became a national and international story, and an embarrassment for Iowa Democrats as well as the . Among those speaking at the meeting was member Mo Elleithee, who’s long been a proponent of shaking up the calendar. He emphasized there’s a need for changes, ""not four years from now — now."" ""I think states like New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina can make a compelling argument as to how they fit into that picture,"" Elleithee, who’s also a Fox News contributor, said. ""I have a harder time seeing it with Iowa, but Iowa should have the right to make that case to us."" Causing controversy ahead of the meeting was a leaked draft proposal, which called for having all the early voting states reapplying for their place in the nominating calendar, with an emphasis on diversity and holding primaries over caucuses.",13
2022-03-13,https://www.foxnews.com/media/tom-cotton-iran-nuclear-deal-closely-related-russia-ukraine,Tom Cotton: Failed Iran nuclear deal is 'closely related' to Russia's war on Ukraine,"Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton says Biden is negotiating with a leading state sponsor of terrorism. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., explained the connection between the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and recent talks by President Biden to revive the nuclear deal with Iran. As Russia continues their invasion into Ukraine, the Biden administration has been trying to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran. Despite Biden's rhetoric of isolating Russia from the world community for its actions in Ukraine, the country is still a major player in Iran nuclear talks. : ""The failed Iran nuclear deal is closely related to Russia’s war on Ukraine,"" Cotton said. ""For the last year, Joe Biden has been essentially relying on Vladimir Putin to be his lawyer at these negotiations, trying to deliver through Vladimir Putin a new nuclear agreement with Iran, which would be worse than even the terrible deal Barack Obama got in 2015. It would allow Iran to be a threshold nuclear state, while giving them hundreds of billions of dollars to continue their reign of terror in the Middle East."" ""Perhaps Joe Biden should stop negotiating with the world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism and start holding them accountable,"" he added. ""Sunday Night in America"" host Trey Gowdy expressed shock that the White House is continuing to negotiate with Russia and Iran. Cotton explained that while Biden is likely attempting to revive former President Barack Obama’s 2015 deal, the latest one involving Russia is far worse. The flag of Iran waves in front of the the International Center building with the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency, , in Vienna, Austria, Monday, May 24, 2021. There are major doubts over whether the deal can be reinstated after years of mounting distrust. ""That was the failure in 2015 with Barack Obama’s deal. It put Iran on the path to being a nuclear power. It didn’t even impose many obligations on them. This deal would be even worse. I think Joe Biden feels he could trust Iran to keep its end of the bargain because it doesn’t even have any responsibilities under what we’ve been hearing,"" Cotton said. Cotton also remarked that part of the deal would also involve lifting sanctions from Iran despite several human rights violations. ""They face sanctions because of their support for terrorism, their human rights abuses. So I guess Joe Biden’s plan is that the Ayatollahs will uphold their commitments when their commitments are essentially zero,"" he added. ‘ ’ I , : . In regard to Russia, Cotton criticized Biden for continually appeasing Putin by approving the Nordstream pipeline and refusing to assist Ukrainian soldiers with tools to protect themselves back in December. ""He always conciliated and appeased Vladimir Putin from the beginning. Some of that was related to the nuclear deal with Iran and some of it was just President Biden’s natural dovishness towards Russia going back 50 years,"" Cotton said. ""The logic behind this decision is President Biden thought it would provoke Russia to invade Ukraine. How foolish does that look in retrospect.""",9

Then came a ""random middle-aged"" roofer from Pittsburgh named Charles F. Damilio . He said he didn’t know why he had been invited to the White House along with the gathering of millennial and Gen Z influencers, but he suspected he was confused with the TikToker Charli D’Amelio, a 17-year-old girl who has 130 million followers. He said he planned to head out and ""not that you care what a roofer thinks about Putin but maybe you should put someone on a roof and ping-pong-pow-pow-pow.""

Kellogg: In Ukraine war, Biden relegated US to 'backbencher' status","Former vice presidential national security adviser joins Fox News host's program. President Biden's weak and unreliable leadership abilities have led to a void in certain aspects of world affairs, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg said in an interview airing Sunday on ""Life, Liberty & Levin"". Kellogg, who served as Vice President Michael Pence's national security adviser and is a Fox News contributor, told host Mark Levin that while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has shown courage and leadership in defending his land against Vladimir Putin's military, the discussions of potential ""diplomatic off-ramps"" for the ex- agent are noticeably lacking the Americans. Newly-minted German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron have both been on the front lines of seeking a diplomatic end to the conflict, with Macron often acting as a quasi-representative for the West in engaging with the Kremlin. ""Here's the one thing that concerns me right now, because there's always a diplomatic off-ramp to any conflict,"" Kellogg said. ""You'll notice that everybody is talking to President Macron of France or Olaf Scholz of Germany, or they're talking to others around the world. They're not talking to the United States."" Last month, Macron engaged Putin in a 5-hour meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow. ""Why are they not talking to the United States?"" Kellogg asked Levin. ""We're sitting… on the backbench, sitting, watching what's happening because they don't have any trust or belief that this President Biden can pull it off."" In parliamentary parlance, a ""backbencher"" is used to describe a low-ranking or former member of leadership or a ""shadow cabinet"" who no longer has much legislative pull in-session. ""I guarantee you they'd be talking to President Trump. I guarantee you President Trump would have been front and center,"" the retired general added. Additionally, Kellogg warned of the Americans' explicit fear of provoking a Russian escalation if they interfere or intercede on the part of Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron talks to journalists Tuesday June 8, 2021 at the Hospitality school in Tain-l'Hermitage, France ""What it comes down to, very candidly, is intestinal fortitude, the ability to have guts to make a hard decision instead of wringing your hands in a negative manner,"" he said. ""And we're very concerned about escalation. Look, the guy who's escalated is Vladimir Putin. That's the one who started the war. That's the one who's pushed himself into Ukraine. That's the one who has put the civilian population at enormous risk. He's actually conducting war crimes."" ""If you're afraid of the other guy, and you're afraid of escalation, then you'll probably be in the wrong business being a leader.

""They may not have known the full extent of it, because it’s very possible that Putin lied to them in the same way he lied to Europeans and others. We also are watching closely to see the extent to which China actually does provide any form of support, material support or economic support to Russia."" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan gives an update about Ukraine during a press briefing at the White House, Friday, Feb. 11, 2022, in Washington. ""It is a concern of ours,"" he continued, ""and we have communicated to Beijing that we will not stand by and allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses from the economic sanctions."" Sullivan would not say whether the U.S. would sanction China if it were found to have aided the Russian invasion. ""I’m not going to sit here publicly and brandish threats,"" he said, ""but what I will tell you is that we are communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them. We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country anywhere in the world.""

A Western intelligence report earlier this month showed that Chinese officials had at least some knowledge of Russia’s plan to invade Ukraine. The report detailed that Chinese officials called on Russia to put off the invasion of Ukraine until after the Olympics in Beijing. China has denied the report as ""speculation."" The Olympics concluded on Feb. 20 and Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

2022-03-14,https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-war-sanctions,Ukraine war: Do sanctions work? Experts weigh in,"Clint Ehrlich offers analysis on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' There's evidence that sanctions have worked to secure U.S. foreign policy interests in the past, but experts are underwhelmed by the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. President Biden has ruled out a no-fly zone in Ukrainian airspace and vowed that there would be no military confrontation between U.S. and Russian troops outside of soil while incrementally increasing sanctions against the Kremlin’s interests over the past two and a half weeks. ""The totality of our sanctions is crushing the Russian economy,"" the president tweeted Friday. ""The ruble has lost more than half its value."" President Biden waves as he boards Air Force One for travel to Philadelphia from Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, March 11, 2022. : But Russian troops haven’t backed out of Ukraine. Rich Goldberg, an advisory board member at the Vandenberg Coalition and former director for Countering Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction for the White House National Security Council, said the incremental approach hasn’t deterred Putin but has ""scared the h--- out of the market"" instead. ""We have driven up the price of oil with half measures that have not achieved our objectives,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Sanctions need to be tailored for the appropriate situation to have the desired impact, achieve a certain outcome. Not all sanctions are alike. Not all sanctions are created equal, and not all situations merit the same type of sanctions response."" That means that the right sanctions applied to the right circumstances can lead to concrete results, he said. ""An example would be the Trump administration issuing sanctions against senior Turkish officials, which tanked the lira and forced Turkey to release Pastor [Andrew] Brunson,"" Goldberg said. Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with members of the Security Council via a video link at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, March 11, 2022. Brunson, an American, had been living in Turkey for decades when he was arrested on politically motivated ""terrorism"" charges, prompting the U.S. to demand his release and place sanctions and tariffs on Turkish officials and goods. ? In order to combat Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Goldberg said, the U.S. would need to dramatically step up its sanction game, cutting off all Russian banks — not just some — from the international transfer system. A decade ago, he said, the world oil market was able to stabilize despite a ""maximum pressure campaign"" of sanctions on Iran. Buyers could still purchase Iranian oil, but the payments were held in escrow rather than being sent back to Tehran. Meanwhile, U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia increased production. ""If you wanted to try to design sanctions that would have maximum impact on Putin today and Russia today and over the long term, while trying to minimize the boomerang effect on the U.S. economy or on our allies in other parts of the planet, you could apply the same model to Russia,"" he said. However, President Biden has both failed to impose such sanctions and struggled to shore up similar support from allies in the Persian Gulf this time around, in part because before the invasion of Ukraine, Biden had been cold toward them.

""This was driven partly by domestic politics inside the Democratic Party that wanted to shun Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, and a strong Iran lobby in Washington."" One issue there was the prince’s alleged role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the U.S. He was killed in Turkey in 2018. The Biden administration said last year that bin Salman had approved plans to ""capture or kill him."" The U.S.-Saudi relationship was shored up during World War under the understanding that the U.S. would offer security guarantees in exchange for oil production help, Goldberg said. ""That played an important role at the end of World War , that played a crucial role in the Reagan victory strategy to bring down the Soviet Union, and it played a vital role in our sanctions policies over the last decade against Iran,"" he said. ‘I ‘ Now without help from oil-producing allies, little interest from Democrats in increasing U.S. energy production and ""half measure"" sanctions against Russia, the Kremlin has stepped up violence in Ukraine, allegedly killing civilians and bombing hospitals while troops encircle the capital city, Kyiv. Clint Ehrlich, a foreign policy analyst and Russia expert, said the sanctions currently imposed on Russia have actually served to boost Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s popularity at home while prompting his citizens to ""rally around the flag."" ""People who are hit by sanctions know where those sanctions are coming from,"" Ehrlich told Fox News Digital. ""It's not a mystery for them why their economies are suffering, and they don't place the blame on their governments for the policies that led to the sanctions. They place their blame on the countries that are administering the sanctions."" And that means more support for the invasion of Ukraine, at least for now, he said. ""Especially after 2014, when we put Russia on notice that It needed to prepare to become self-sufficient,"" Ehrlich added. That’s when Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimea region, which it has occupied ever since. Since then, he said, Putin’s government has dramatically increased Russia’s agricultural production. ""That’s the most important thing from the perspective of sanctions,"" Ehrlich said. ""Consumer electronics, brands, people can do without."" The capacity to produce food, however, puts Russia on strong footing, he said. A Sanctions have worked in past situations, he agreed, but they haven’t halted the violence in Ukraine. ""Sanctions were effective against South Africa to end apartheid,"" he said. ""That’s the classic example."" However, South Africa wasn’t an aspiring superpower and had far fewer resources, he said. Russia is a massive supplier of global energy, including to some of Europe’s wealthiest economies. A green-minded, anti-nuclear government like Germany’s backing away from its energy deals with Russia would be like ""if the had to suddenly become pro-Obamacare,"" Ehrlich said. However, he added, the fighting in Ukraine has led to Russia putting some demands on the table that could be the basis for a realistic end to the violence. Those include backing away from Ukraine’s ambitions to join the Western alliance, legitimizing Russia’s control over Crimea, and granting autonomy to pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, along the countries’ shared border.",22

Russia launched a large-scale invasion on Feb. 24. While details of the conflict change by the day, hundreds of civilians have already been reported dead or wounded, including children. According to the United Nations, more than a million Ukrainians have fled. The invasion, which was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, has sparked condemnation around the world and increasingly severe economic sanctions against Russia. Putin, 69, insisted that Ukraine has historic ties to Russia. Zelenskyy, 44, vowed to stay in his country.",6

Ron Johnson, R-Wis., joined ‘The Faulkner Focus’ Monday stressing the need for the U.S. to prevent China from supporting Russian military action against Ukraine. Johnson emphasized how China is ‘playing a very dangerous game’ by standing alongside Russia in any capacity amid their invasion into Ukraine. -: . : China is worried about their image, and they need to understand that their image is being tarnished even further by literally their lack of response. They should be forcefully coming out against what Russia doing. But they're not. Now, can we decouple from China overnight? No, but you begin the process. In many respects. We have begun the process, you know, as wages have increased in China. Manufacturers have moved out of China as China has become more authoritarian. As people perceive a greater risk of doing business with China, manufacturers move out of China. That would just continue. I think that would probably pick up speed. China's playing a very dangerous game, staying pretty much mute as it comes to the atrocities in the war crimes committed by, I guess, their friend, Russia.",0
2022-03-14,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/fight-country-poll-ukrainians-americans-jonathan-turley,Fight for your country? Ukrainians will but Americans torn in new poll. That's a problem,"Ukrainian President Zelenskyy addresses British Parliament. In World War , Winston Churchill famously declared, ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."" It appears that there may be even fewer to count on if a recent poll is accurate. The Quinnipiac University poll asked Americans, ""What would you do if you were in the same position as Ukrainians are now, stay and fight or leave the country?"" Only 55% said that they would stay and fight for this country. That included only 40% of Democrats. Civilians practice moving in groups at a military training exercise conducted by the Prosvita society in Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine, on Friday, March 11, 2022. Overall 38% of Americans said that they would flee. It appears that this country is facing an existential crisis of faith, and we should have a frank discussion about why so comparably few Americans are now willing to pledge their lives in defense of this country. 'S . 'S – Quinnipiac has long been relied upon in polling in the United States and is one of the most cited polling outfits for the media. It is important to note that, while the results were shocking overall, many did say that they would stand and defend the United States from any invader. When asked this question, 68% of Republicans and 57% of Independents say that they would fight. However, more than half of Democrats said they would flee before fighting for their country – 8% did not have an answer, a shrug that is equally alarming. As someone who came from a liberal, Democratic family in Chicago, I was shocked by the poll. My father and grandfather fought in the World Wars and everyone I grew up with on the liberal Northside of Chicago was both intensely liberal and intensely patriotic. Indeed, I often heard my parents challenge Republican friends for suggesting that conservatives were more patriotic or more willing to sacrifice for their country. For my maternal Sicilian family, they felt a deep bond to the country that took them in and allowed them to live in freedom. Despite the prejudice that they encountered and difficult times, my Sicilian grandparents celebrated Independence Day like a religious holiday and often discussed their pride when they became American citizens. If you are not willing to defend this country, citizenship becomes a status of convenience. My grandfather was a union organizer and a coal miner who developed black lung in the mines of Ohio. He could not read or write, but he could proudly recite parts of the Declaration of Independence and our national anthem. We should be alarmed by this poll because it shows a deep disconnection with this country and its protection. If you are not willing to defend this country, citizenship becomes a status of convenience; an opportunistic association that can be shed as easily as it is acquired. It is a commitment that extends little beyond annual tax obligations. Notably, the poll did not pose a question over what might be viewed as an unjustified war in another land like Vietnam. This question asked about an invasion of our country. Indeed, despite the opposition to Vietnam, many Democrats and liberals still felt obligated to answer the call for service when drafted. The poll shows a crisis within the Democratic Party, but also our country at large, with people losing their connection to our common article of faith, the Constitution. That did not occur overnight. There have been unrelenting attacks on our institutions and core values for years that ignore our countervailing successes. We have gone through terrible periods and faced terrible institutions and practices, from slavery to segregation. However, we faced them as a people united in a common faith captured in the Declaration of Independence: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. – That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed..."" We have not always lived up to those principles. Indeed, when those words were written, millions were left in slavery and millions were barred from voting, property ownership and other basic rights of citizenship. However, we became better than we were due to a faith in ourselves and our common constitutional bound. This is just one poll and people can have different motivations in answering such questions. However, there was clearly a desire by many to convey this disconnection with the country in their answers that suggest something more than just impish responses. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks during a meeting of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on June 12, 2019, on Capitol Hill. There has been a growing agnosticism regarding this country as many challenge our foundational institutions and values. It is captured in words of leaders like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who questioned the very need for the Supreme Court when it was not ruling in line with her own views: ""How much does the current structure benefit us? And I don’t think it does."" That is a worthy debate to have, and our Constitution protects all sides in having it. Yet, there is an underlying message that, because our institutions did not produce the results demanded by Ocasio-Cortez, we are told to scrap them. Elie Mystal, who writes for the Nation and Above the Law, called the Constitution ""kind of trash."" In his new book, ""Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy’s Guide to the Constitution,"" Mystal says we should just ignore what the Framers thought or said. When asked ""Are you arguing that the Constitution needs to be scrapped altogether?"" Mystal said he would be ""all for"" a move to ""throw out"" the Constitution. Others, including lawyers, agreed with Mystal and declared ""the Constitution is trash."" It is a crisis of faith shown in academics like Georgetown Professor Eddie Glaude insisting that we need to scrap what we have and be ""refounded"" rather than ""tinker around the edges while people are dying."" He insists that, despite the Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement and anti-discrimination laws, it is hopeless to expect the system to change: ""At every moment when a new America seems to be about to be born, the umbilical cord of White supremacy is wrapped around the baby’s neck, choking the life out of it."" Facimile of the U.S. Constitution The curious aspect of such comments is that we are constantly being reborn as a people. Our Constitution created an experiment in self-governance that remains a work in progress. However, it does not guarantee that you simply get what you want or you can ""throw out"" the Constitution like Mystal's unwanted trash. The people of Ukraine have given the world a symbol of defiance and faith. That is a country that has been deeply divided in the past and only gained its independence in 1991. Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly counted on many opting to stand aside rather than stand up for their young nation. Instead, opposing parties and leaders stood together and united in their common identity as Ukrainians. It appears from this poll that many in the U.S. have lost that capacity for faith and sacrifice. Many are unwilling to take that same leap of faith in our system and each other. President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat who was decorated for his bravery in World War , famously declared in 1961: ""Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty."" The question is whether Americans are willing to answer the same call today.",22

""The View's"" Joy Behar and Sunny Hostin : Co-host Whoopi Goldberg began the segment by asking what President Biden was expected to do to solve the crisis, suggesting he was getting too much blame for the ongoing war. ""We’ve strengthened our economic sanctions, then people were saying, okay no oil. We’ve done that. The final step in my view, and we’ve talked about it on this show, is the no-fly zone,"" Hostin said. ""You have someone like Putin that is saying, if you shoot my planes down during my war, I will consider that an act of war. We’re already in a war with them –"" she added, falsely claiming the U.S. was already in a war with Russia. Goldberg interrupted Hostin, saying the U.S. was not yet in a war with Russia before Behar jumped in, warning that implementing a no-fly zone would lead to direct conflict with them.

Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., weighs in ahead of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's address to Congress Wednesday. China asserted Tuesday that it was completely ""impartial"" over the conflict in Ukraine and dismissed so-called ""disinformation"" from the U.S. government, suggesting that China agreed to send military equipment to Russian troops. China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian – who hasn’t openly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching an invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago and has called the conflict the ""Ukraine issue"" instead of war – made the remarks to reporters during his daily press conference. ""China’s position and statement on the Ukraine issue is completely objective, impartial and constructive,"" Zhao said, according to a translation by The Associated Press. ""We have a clear goal, that is to promote the de-escalation of the situation and end the conflict as soon as possible."" 3 35- : According to the transcript of his remarks shared to the Chinese foreign affairs website, Zhao said, ""China’s position and statement on the Ukraine issue is completely objective, just and constructive. We have a clear goal, that is, to deescalate the situation and put an end to the conflict as soon as possible. We believe China’s position will receive understanding and support from more and more countries."" Though the two translations differed slightly, the message was the same. Zhao criticized the U.S. by nodding to China's contention that Russia was provoked by 's expansion and threats to its security. ""What the U.S. should do is to deeply reflect on the role it has played in the development and evolving of the Ukraine crisis, and do something practical to ease the tension in Ukraine,"" he said. Zhao's comments came a day after U.S. adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi met in Rome over the Biden administration's increasingly concerns that China is using the Ukraine war to advance Beijing’s long-term interest in its competition with the United States.

Face to face, President Joe Biden's national security adviser warned the top Chinese official on Monday about China's support for Russia in the Ukrainian invasion, even as the Kremlin denied reports it had requested Chinese military equipment to use in the war. ) Speaking to Monday, before the seven-hour face-to-face meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Sullivan said the U.S. is ""communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them."" The Kremlin has denied reports it requested Chinese military equipment for use in the war. Zhao on Tuesday said China opposed the use of sanctions from the West, currently pummeling the Russia economy. He again dismissed reports that China agreed to send aid to Russia as ""disinformation."" He also said a third batch of humanitarian aid sent by China for Ukraine arrived in Poland on Monday. ""China is committed to facilitating dialogue for peace, and believes that the international community should jointly support the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine for early substantive outcomes, so as to deescalate the situation as soon as possible,"" Zhao said. ""All parties should exercise maximum restraint, protect civilians and prevent a massive humanitarian crisis. China has provided emergency humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and will continue to make its efforts to that end. China firmly opposes any words and deeds that spread disinformation and distort and smear China’s position."" , - 20: Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian attends a news conference on December 20, 2021 in Beijing, China. ) Zhao repeatedly dodged reporter follow-up questions about Russia’s alleged request for aid. He also condemned U.S. statements about Taiwan and reissued warnings of consequences for any nation that intervenes in Taiwan, claiming the move would attack ""China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity."" China’s relationship with Taiwan has come into focus against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the island bolstering its own defenses since the war started in case of aggression from the mainland. Taiwan said it planned to double its yearly missile-production capacity this year. China has taken a more aggressive stance against the Democratic island nation, sending a record number of fighter jets into Taiwan’s air defense zone late last year. And last month, as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense zone, prompting a broadcast warning from the island nation. On Tuesday, the European Union ambassador to China, Nicolas Chapuis, appealed to China to support Ukraine and ""help Europe to stop the war."" ""There can be no so-called neutrality,"" Chapuis said during a roundtable discussion hosted by the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based thinktank. ""We really call upon all our Chinese friends to name the aggressor and to stand by the victim."" ""We have been playing a constructive part in promoting peace talks,"" he said.

The Atlantic was mocked by political commentators for showing concern about how a nuclear war would affect the climate. Reacting Tuesday to the piece on ""Fox & Friends,"" Hoover Institute fellow Bjorn Lomborg said that he was ""astounded"" by the argument. The Atlantic headline on Sunday argued, in addition to killing millions of people, a nuclear war would ""prove disastrous for climate change."" ""On Top of Everything Else, Nuclear War Is a Climate Problem,"" the headline of The Atlantic article read. ""A nuclear war would kill tens of millions of people and would also prove disastrous for climate change,"" a tweet that accompanies the article said. Activists participate in a climate change protest in Glasgow, Scotland ahead of the start of 26, Saturday, Oct. 30, 2021. ""There are a lot of problems in the world. And global warming is one of them. But it seems to be this obsessive focus just on climate change to the extent that you now actually worry about a nuclear war because it would be bad for global warming is out of whack with reality,"" Lomborg told host Rachel Campos-Duffy. 'T ' ' 'S The article argued, if ""you're worried about rapid, catastrophic changes to the planet’s climate, then you must be worried about nuclear war."" ""On top of killing tens of millions of people, even a relatively ‘minor’ exchange of nuclear weapons would wreck the planet’s climate in enormous and long-lasting ways,"" the outlet added. Critics slammed the tweet, calling the article ""silly"" and questioning the ""priorities"" of The Atlantic. Fox News contributor Joe Concha said ""there are no words"" to describe the statement. After a wave of criticism against the piece, Lomborg said humanity should be concerned about avoiding nuclear war in general. ""Let's get our priorities right. If you want to deal with the problem from Russia, you should be able to have your own energy. That includes getting fracking, maybe going more nuclear. Make sure you get all these energy sources that can actually make you independent instead of just talking about your favorite thing like solar and wind,"" he said, adding global warming must be treated as one of many global problems.

Joni Ernst argues the U.S. should tap into domestic energy and says releasing oil from reserves won't affect gas prices. : Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, introduced the Environmental Protection Agency Transparency Act in order to fight against federal overreach and require the Biden administration to be more transparent about its climate agenda. Ernst, who sits on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, hopes the new bill will increase oversight over regulations by President Biden's on Iowa’s farmers and small businesses. ""President Biden has continued to use environmental concerns as a smokescreen to impose more onerous federal rules and regulations, often to the detriment of Iowa’s farmers and small businesses,"" Ernst said in a statement to Fox News Digital. Sen. Joni Ernst speaks alongside other Republican senators during a press conference on rising gas and energy prices at the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 27, 2021. The Transparency Act would require every new rule from the that increases the role of the federal government over an individual’s private land and property to be accompanied by two reports. The first report would require the to provide data to support claims that the rule would actually be addressing climate change. The second would ask for an analysis on how the rule would affect small businesses financially. The completed reports would be made available to the public and sent to Congress. The senator believes that ""this new effort will increase oversight and transparency and hold the Biden administration accountable – ensuring they both demonstrate the need for any new regulation and understand its impact on Americans."" Ernst's office pointed to the Biden administration's claim behind the repeal of Trump administration's Navigable Waters Protection Rule, that it caused environmental damage and harm. Iowa's farmers reportedly did not see any environmental damage on the ground, and neither the , nor the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, has provided Ernst and her colleagues evidence or documented any ""damage and harm."" In addition, the focus of the Biden administration on electric vehicles, saying they are the ""zero emission"" solution to energy, is another Biden administration ploy, according to Ernst. China dominates the extraction of rare earth minerals vital to the production of an electric vehicle, and does so in a manner that is far from zero-emissions and not in line with the United States' strict environmental regulations on extraction. Before an electric vehicle leaves the showroom, it has already emitted twice the 2 emissions of a car fueled by gasoline, so the administration is ignoring a major part of lifecycle emissions and pouring billions of dollars into electric transportation under the guise of fighting climate change, says Ernst's office. The did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Ernst's proposed legislation. Treasure Secretary Janet Yellen speaks at the U.N. Climate Summit in Glasgow, Scotland, on Nov. 3, 2021. This new bill also comes after Republican Study Committee head Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., called on Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to investigate whether Russia secretly funded U.S. green groups. House Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans also recently called on three environmental groups to disclose their ties to a non-governmental organization that is reportedly used by President Vladimir Putin.

It's also a war between competing narratives. Some are persuasive, but also confusing in this new fog of war. It's always two movies on one screen. Ukraine is fighting and winning, and Russia is about to crush them. You alternate between screens, often with the same visuals. They say truth is the first casualty of war, but it's really perspective. When you start to find yourself moving from one stage of hopeful belief to one of cynicism. First, you're naive. Did you hear about the Phantom of Ukraine shooting down jets? Did you hear about the Ukrainian sailors refusing to surrender? Did you hear about Gutfeld mother in law killing her captors with a can of hairnet? Turns out a lot of these stories aren't quite true, but are just meant to inspire. They serve a purpose, but they turn you from a naive consumer of news to a pissed off cynic like me. Problem is, that's as bad as being naive. Because for us, we want the truth. But in an era of social media and the internet, fables travel to the sun and back before the truth puts on its crocs. My gardener said that. So all we can do is watch and listen and hope for the best. And the best we could hope for that this stupid, horrible thing ends as quickly as possible.

A few days later, when Poland asked us to be part of the transfer, we folded like a cheap suit. What I think happened is that the Russians told Biden and his team that if you send these MiGs in, that will be an escalation and they were intimidated by Putin. We can't let Putin determine who's in . We can't let Putin determine what we do to help the Ukraine. So no, I think the president folded like a cheap suit.",0

The Middle East has taken center stage this week as oil prices continue to skyrocket and western nations look to boycott Moscow over its deadly invasion into Ukraine. But the Biden administration’s attempts to garner support from oil-rich nations to assist Ukraine and counter prices at the pump has been met with resistance, the result of what some argue is long-standing mistrust of the U.S. from nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . According to recent reports, President Biden was rebuffed by the two nations' leaders when he attempted to arrange calls with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the ’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The White House National Security Council pushed back hard on the reports, with spokesperson Emily Horne telling Fox News, ""This is a mischaracterization and does not reflect reality. There are no rebuffed calls, period."" : In addition, Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week downplayed the suggestion that the Biden administration was snubbed by oil-leading nations in the Middle East saying, ""We're all talking regularly."" However, the complex relationship between the U.S. and the oil-rich Gulf nations dates back decades and has been influenced by geopolitical policies relating to everything from oil embargoes in the 1970s to the suspension of arms amid the ongoing crisis in Yemen. In this photo provided by the Saudi Royal Court, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, right, welcomes Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani upon his arrival to attend the Gulf Cooperation Council's 41st Summit in Al-Ula, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 5, 2021. ""In the Middle East, and specifically in Arab society, relationships matter. The last thing you want to be is a fair-weather friend,"" Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official who advised the military on matters relating to Iran and Iraq under the George W. Bush administration, told Fox News Digital. ""And from the very start, [Team] Biden defined themselves as a fair-weather friend."" Upon entering office, President Biden vowed to not only end the war in Yemen, which has resulted in one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world with hundreds of thousands killed and millions displaced, but said he would stop supplying arms to Saudi Arabia. The war in Yemen kicked off in 2014 when Shia Houthi rebels backed by Iran attempted to overthrow the government. By 2015, under Barack Obama, the U.S. began arming Sunni Arab states like Saudi Arabia and the , which have backed the Yemeni government. But mass causalities and the humanitarian crisis prompted the U.S. to limit its military support to the Saudi campaign in 2016. A This decision was reversed in 2017 under the Trump administration, and U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia increased by more than 40%, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute arms transfer database. Biden's administration largely reflects that of the Obama White House to include Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Adviser Jake Sullivan. The president has also said he would revert to policies held by the previous Democratic administration. The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the nature of the former Obama administration and current Biden administration officials' relationships with the oil-rich Middle Eastern country leaders. In this July 30, 2018, file photo, a 17-year-old boy holds his weapon at the dam in Marib, Yemen. ""This war has to end,"" Biden said in a February 2021 address. ""And to underscore our commitment, we're ending all American support for offensive operations in the war on Yemen, including relevant arms sales."" Biden later frustrated members of his own party with a November decision to sell $650 million in defensive aid to the Saudi government as it continues to get pummeled by Houthi forces. The administration justified its move by saying it will continue to prioritize human rights while working with important partners in the region. But some foreign policy experts have argued that the tumultuous U.S. relationship with the Gulf states is rooted in decisions made during the Obama administration when then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice prioritized human rights over geopolitical ties. , ""There's an element of where there's smoke there's fire,"" Rubin told Fox News Digital. ""The Saudis wouldn't be the first to complain about Susan Rice."" Rubin argued that while several of Rice’s decisions in the Middle East put a bad taste in the mouth of Gulf nations, ""I don't think it can be nailed to just one person."" ""You've got a situation where progressives may want to apply pressure to Abu Dhabi and Riyadh because of human rights violations, but they really need to take a step back and consider whether we would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater,"" Rubin added. ""Because if we force the Saudis and the Emirates into the arms of Beijing, it's going to be a lot harder advocating for human rights than it is now."" ' ' , ' ' China’s grip in the Middle East has increased in recent years as relations with the West have strained. Though some relations were improved under the Trump administration’s Abraham Accords, which normalized ties between Israel and Muslim nations like Bahrain, the , Morocco and Sudan, Beijing’s influence in the region remained. ""This is a systematic problem in Washington. We tend to conceive of our relations as always bilateral,"" said Rubin, who is also a senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute. ""But we're not the only players in the sandbox."" ""This isn't just a Democrat or Republican thing."" : '' Saudi Arabia backed the U.S. war in Afghanistan after 9/11 and later during the Iraq war, but Rubin argued that there was a level of disregard toward Saudi concerns during the George W. Bush administration. ""The Saudis were afraid for sectarian reasons that we were going [to] … basically open Pandora's box and, to some extent, they were right,"" Rubin said. ""At the same time, under Obama, the Saudis believe that we were not taking seriously their concerns vis-a-vis Iran. And remember today that they're getting hit by Iranian drones that are being flown from Iraq, are being flown from Yemen."" U.S. relations with Iran have also drastically affected U.S. ties with other top players in the region. President Hassan Rouhani, second right, listens to head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi while visiting an exhibition of Iran's new nuclear achievements in Tehran, Iran, in April. Saudi Arabia and the strongly opposed the nuclear deal established by then-Secretary of State John Kerry with Iran in 2015. Donald Trump on the campaign trail vowed to abandon the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and eventually pulled the U.S. out of the agreement in 2018. Following Iran’s advancing nuclear program, the and Saudi governments have said they back the Biden administration’s attempts to end Iran’s nuclear program but have demanded to be involved in this round of negotiations and have called for stronger parameters from Tehran. ""Saudi Arabia is not interested in hindering or blocking the current negotiations … It is interested in ensuring their success in achieving effectively the desired results,"" Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. Rayd Krimly said in April 2021 as the Biden White House looked to restart negotiations with Iran. President Biden is seen at Camp David in Maryland during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin Feb. 12, 2022. The U.S. has looked to Saudi Arabia and the to boost oil production as the U.S. and its Western allies have taken steps to boycott Moscow oil amid Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. The said last week that it supports increasing oil production to alleviate strains on the global market, but it remains unclear if it will be able to convince the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to adhere to U.S. pleas. ""These countries have long memories,"" Rubin said. ""So to mistreat the Saudis and not expect that there would be a response is wishful foolishness.""",22

On ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday, Gallagher called on the U.S. not to back down as Russia continues to escalate pressure and warns that China's support for Russia is the beginning of the new Cold War against America. : . : Zelenskyy can go a long way towards inspiring the West to continue to provide lethal assistance, and this is going to get more difficult as the Russians escalate.

And so I would like Zelenskyy to lay out exactly what he needs. Talk in particular about the role that those Polish MiG 29s could have played in allowing him to stand up to Russia. The other thing I'd like him to address, and I don't know if he'll go there, is the role that China is playing in all of this in supporting Russia's slaughter in Ukraine. The Biden administration needs to stop playing footsie with the Chinese right now because they're trying to portray themselves as peacemakers. But behind the scenes, they're standing by their man in Moscow. And the harder this gets for Putin, the more dependent he's going to become on China, both as a destination for weapons supplies as well as energy sales. And so, we need to call out the role the Chinese are playing here. This alliance among authoritarian states is a feature of the new Cold War that China has launched against America.

On March 8th President Joe Biden announced that the United States would stop buying Russian oil amid the war in Ukraine. In his prepared remarks he warned Americans this action could raise gas prices, saying, ""I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home."" No sooner was it said than it became a cynical hashtag talking point for his floundering presidency. Now we hear it everywhere. On a very basic and human level it has been disgraceful to watch Biden and his cronies so obviously use the tragic suffering of the Ukrainian people for his own political gain. Biden is draping his own failure, his own very conscious and stated choice to crush domestic energy production with the Ukrainian flag. But it's actually much worse than that. 'S ‘ ’ 'S Poll after poll shows that Americans, on a bipartisan basis, overwhelmingly support Ukraine in this conflict, even if there are differences in what form that support should take. Joe Biden has chosen to throw a hand grenade of domestic partisanship into the middle of that unity. At a time when Americans should be focused on the war, and what it means for our nation’s evolving role in world affairs, Biden is scoring ugly, cheap, political points.

A volunteer of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces stands in the crater from the explosion near a checkpoint in Brovary, outside Kyiv, Ukraine, Tuesday, March 1, 2022. This hamfisted messaging is on par for a White House that treats the presidency like a television show. And it’s not even a good television show. In script writing there is a term called ""exposition,"" it is how the writer deftly weaves plot details into natural sounding dialogue. For example, a character doesn’t just blurt out, ""Hey, remember when mom died of cancer?"" Because of course they remember. : 'S . 'S - ""Putin’s price hike"" is the political equivalent of ""remember when mom died of cancer."" Obviously Americans understand that nixing Russian oil leads to an uptick in prices at the pump. But most also know that filling their tanks was getting pricier and pricier long before Putin started flirting with World War . Biden is badly misreading the political moment. He has seen an approval poll bump of about 2 points since the invasion. That is remarkably modest for a president at a time when the nation may be on the brink of war. There is a reason that unlike during past crises, like the first Gulf War or 9/11, the country is not rallying behind him. It's because he is choosing to make it political. Presidents typically get a bounce from international conflict involving the United States precisely because in those moments they are seen to be above partisan politics. But for the American left absolutely nothing is above partisan politics. That is how you get an amazing article in the Atlantic opining about how nuclear war would be bad for the environment. Biden is badly misreading the political moment. We are all adults. We all get that politicians try to use events, even tragic ones, to their political advantage. But they don’t have to be jerks about it. The plastic phrase ""Putin’s price hike"" is about as organic as a strawberry Jolly Rancher. Its main purpose is to paint those who question Biden’s disastrous energy policies as insufficiently patriotic. President Joe Biden Like every other bit of amateurish stagecraft this administration engages in, including a fake White House set in which Biden plays at being president, Americans see right through this. Flames of war are licking at Europe and our president is doing a ""bit."" Americans have shown through myriad polls that they are willing to make a financial sacrifice at the pump to help the people of Ukraine. Had Biden left it at that, he probably would have accrued some benefit as a president guiding us through a crisis.

However, she argued that Biden’s issues primarily lie in communicating to the American people. ""And if Biden can go head and center and start talking about the why and at the same time go into the place – and I think we discussed this last time – go into communities where the Republicans vetoed, decided not to vote for the infrastructure bill, and actually go in there and say, ‘This ribbon cutting is because I, the President of the United States, is bringing jobs back [sic],’"" Kumar said.

Chuck DeVore, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, tells 'The Ben Domenech Podcast' what the United States can do to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia beyond a no-fly zone. : Ukraine isn't a small place. Excluding Crimea, it's just a little smaller than Texas. It's got about 46 million people. It's got 7 million people who are fit for military service. They are daily rallying to the flag and being issued automatic weapons. So it's going to be very, very difficult for Russia to achieve its political objective, which was to change the regime in Kyiv and put in a friendly puppet government. And so because of that, then what we're likely going to see is continued destruction of Ukraine's cities and continued increased Western demands for action from certainly from the population of most Western democracies. A woman walks past a burning apartment building after shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, Sunday, March 13, 2022. Russia is certainly going to try to shut down some of the images coming out of the country, but they've already shown that they're, you know, electronic warfare and communications warfare techniques don't appear to be up to the task. Certainly, the images continue to get out. And so I think that what we ought to consider doing is a series of things. We certainly need to continue to supply the Ukrainians with the sort of anti-tank and anti-aircraft – shoulder-fired missiles that have been pouring into the country. I think we can go even further, though. We ought to offer training to Ukrainians outside of Ukraine. This was done, for example, in 1973 with the U.S. and Israel to improve Israel's level of training for some of the equipment that we were sending them. We ought to also allow, for example, the creation of a volunteer air force, something similar to what you saw in China, operating against the Japanese with the Flying Tigers in 1930, 1940, as well as the volunteer air force that fought the Bolsheviks on behalf of Poland in 1920. Now Russia is going to complain, of course, but they're not likely to do anything because this is well within the norms of Cold War behavior. In other words, Russian pilots were known to have attacked American bombers during the Korean conflict in the 1950s. You had Russian air defense radar operators in North Vietnam during the Vietnam conflict, many of whom were responsible for downing American aircraft. And again, there was no war, no war between the Soviet Union and America because it wasn't direct. It wasn't, you know, someone in an American uniform attacking Russians on Russian soil. And these are things, by the way, that have been recommended by this group that I'm working with called the Ukraine Working Group. It's a group mostly of academics in England and in North America, other European countries, that are trying to develop ideas as to how we can help Ukraine defend its independence, its sovereignty. Other ideas are, for example, being able to repair vehicles in places other than Ukraine – towing, for example, battle-damaged equipment across the border, getting [them] back into serviceable condition, and shipping it back into Ukraine. There are all kinds of things that can be done, short of what would be tantamount to a formal declaration of war against Russia, which we don't want. They have some 6,000 nuclear weapons. And you know, let's not give reason for any of those to be used. "" "":",0

""We will always respect your state, we will develop relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We will respect the path chosen by Ukrainians, because this is the sovereign right of every nation,"" Fan Xiangong, who relocated with the Chinese embassy from Kyiv to Lviv after Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24, told Lviv officials on Monday, according to the Lviv regional government. ""In this situation, which you have now, we will act responsibly. We have seen how great the unity of the Ukrainian people is, and that means its strength,"" Fan added. China's ambassador to Ukraine, Fan Xiangong, meets with Ukrainian officials in Lviv on Monday. Gordon Chang, author of ""The Great U.S.-China Tech War,"" said it's surprising to see a Chinese official express such strong support for the Ukrainian people, but that Beijing needs to follow through with actions to convince the world of its stance on the war. ""These words really don't mean anything until China stops buying Russian commodities, and it stops letting Russian institutions use its financial system, and it stops its propaganda that is amplifying Russia's ludicrous positions,"" Chang told Fox News Digital. ""These comments are fascinating, but nonetheless, I want to see action rather than words. : Beijing and Moscow have cultivated close ties in recent years, with Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping declaring last month that ""friendship between the two States has no limits"" following the Russian President's visit to China for the Winter Olympics. President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping pose during a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse on Feb. 4, 2022. On Monday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with his Chinese counterpart in Rome, one day after reports came out that Russia asked China for economic and military aid in its invasion of Ukraine, which both countries deny. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that Sullivan was ""very direct about the consequences"" if Beijing offered military or economic assistance to the Kremlin. ""We're going to be watching closely,"" Psaki said. ""But in terms of any potential impacts or consequences, we'll lead those through private diplomatic channels at this point."" : ? Chang said that China is concerned about the potential Western backlash from helping Russia, especially after the United States and European allies unleashed a rash of unprecedented sanctions against Putin and the Russian economy. ""I think that Beijing is certainly worried about the United States imposing sanctions on China, so what they're trying to do is to forestall that with easy-to-issue words,"" Chang said. ""But the question is, what are they really going to do? And that's going to be critical, so this is something that we're just going to have to wait and see.""

""I think it's clear that the leader of the free world is President Zelenskyy,"" Kennedy told host Sean Hannity, referencing Zelenskyy's speech to Congress Wednesday morning. ""He and the Ukrainian people are tough as a boot. And we need to have their back. Point 2: I think it's important when we do something right to acknowledge it -- The West's sanctions on Russia's Central Bank has hurt Putin; hasn't brought him to his knees, but it's hurting."" , Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, speaks during a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing. ""So I suppose you could say President Biden has gotten it right once in a row."" Kennedy described the remainder of the White House's response to date as ""a wimp fest."" : Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivers a virtual address to the U.S Congress. He said Zelenskyy and his people are holding their own against the might of the Kremlin forces, and yet Biden continues to drag his feet and fails to act as decisively as other world leaders. ""Today, President Zelensky said, Can you please help me get planes? Can you please help me get surface-to-air missiles? I'm not asking for American planes, or pilots, or troops – President Biden's response is the same as it always is: 'I'll get back to you in three to five business days',"" Kennedy said. Rep.

Kennedy went on to add that in addition to Biden's weakness on the world stage, his far-left allies in Congress will not permit America to further hurt Putin by encouraging American energy independence, arguing that European allies need a country from which to replace their oil and gas supply – and that the United States geologically – but not politically -- fits the bill. ""The obvious answer is the United States, except for one problem: the Woker-Darlings in the Democratic Party will not allow President Biden to adopt an all-of-the-above energy policy, which includes oil and gas and the president just doesn't seem to have the courage to stand up to them.

2022-03-16,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-propaganda-real-crises,Tucker Carlson: Biden's propaganda is meant to distract you from the real crises,"Fox News host reflects on the -19 pandemic two years later, China's new lockdowns and a cartel firefight on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' We keep a detailed daily calendar. We checked this morning and believe it or not, this week is the two-year anniversary of the coronavirus lockdowns. Those are the first mass quarantines in American history and if you look back, you'll be struck by how much has changed since those lockdowns began. Think back to the America you grew up in. There were three things you knew about that country: It was a free country. It was a middle-class country. It was defined by small business and it was a constitutional country. Our politicians were limited by the guardrails in our founding documents. They couldn't go past that. So, it was a happy place. Unfortunately, none of those three things are still true about the United States and lockdowns are not entirely to blame for that. No single cause ever is, but there's no question that the coronavirus lockdowns accelerated the transformation of the United States. Just think of masks. So, we knew early on that paper masks were not going to stop the spread of . A couple of studies, including a big study from Vietnam, showed pretty clearly that they were not effective and then we watched the behavior of our public officials. It turns out they didn't like masks any more than anyone else liked masks, despite the fact they had ordered you to wear masks. When they thought no one was watching, they often went bare faced. So, you saw that, and you had to wonder: If masks are so darn effective and lifesaving, why aren't our leaders wearing them? : ‘ ’ An employee arranges finished protective masks into piles on the production line at the Taiwan Comfort Champ Manufacturing Co. plant in Taoyuan, Taiwan, on Friday, June 12, 2020. We made that point. We made many points like it. We made them dozens of times on the show and, needless to say, it had no effect at all. The mask mandates stayed. In some places, they still remain. So, as this unfolded, we started to realize that masks, in fact a lot of this, was not really about science or public health. So, what was it about? Well, recently we learned the answer because we watched it. Masks were a training exercise. Mandatory masking was a shock collar designed to teach Americans unquestioning obedience and, of course, it worked because shock collars do work. In a single day last month we watched, for example, our entire professional class dutifully changed their Twitter avatars from mask up to the now mandatory Ukrainian flag. There was no debate about doing this, no reflection. There was not even a real conversation. They just did it. Millions of people simply assumed reflexively a partisan position in a highly complicated foreign crisis, the next crisis, and as they did it, they moved in perfect lockstep. They were guided by their masters of the social media companies who were themselves taking direction from the White House. The whole thing was like watching synchronized swimming in Pyongyang. It was an amazing performance. Most amazing of all was seeing Republican leaders join the herd after two years of training, they couldn't help themselves. The result was the largest political flash mob in American history—Republicans, Democrats, business titans and the media all on one side. So, of course, dissent of any kind was banned instantly and if you persist in asking questions about all of this found themselves censored and those who persisted in asking questions because they were lucky enough to have a rare, protected platform, found themselves threatened with something worse—maybe indictment, maybe arrest. Here's former Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, threatening this show just last night. : Tucker Carlson and others are really, really close to treason in terms of what they are saying and parroting what is... Putin's dream. Oh, so defending our country from your recklessness and unwise decision-making is treason? Declare your loyalty to Ukraine or you've committed a crime, right? Claire McCaskill, whatever you think of her, was not talking like that two years ago. No one in public was talking that way two years ago, before . In a free country, you're allowed to say what you think is true. You can defend your country if you want, even if politicians disagree with you. That was the whole point of living in the United States, but not anymore. Now, if enough powerful people, that would be former senators, New York Times columnists, retired Intel chiefs working as contributors to , if enough of these people call for you to be indicted, you probably will be indicted. If not for the core crime, then for another crime. They'll find something. That's our justice system now works. Those are the rules. This is a big change over what we had before for about 250 years. - Senator Claire McCaskill concedes defeat in her bid to keep her U.S. Senate seat during an election-night rally on November 6, 2018 in St. Louis, Missouri. McCaskill lost to Republican challenger Josh Hawley. So how do we get this new system? Simple, we eliminated the guardrails. We got rid of the principles that set limits to our leaders' power. Those principles, in short, were personal autonomy and the sanctity of the citizens' conscience. And we surrendered both of those during . They no longer exist. We let them go. Once we allowed political leaders to force Americans to take drugs they didn't want, the old arrangement where the citizen had as much or more power as the leaders was over. Our politicians now have effectively limitless power, and they know that. They know it perfectly well. That's why they did it and if you doubt that they know it, watch the way they communicate with the American population. They're giving you propaganda. They always have. What's changed is that their propaganda is no longer sophisticated or persuasive because it doesn't have to be. Instead, their propaganda is blunt and vulgar. They summon TikTok performers to the White House so that some 18-year-old, who has never had a job, can tell you that inflation and historically high gas prices are actually Vladimir Putin's fault. They just did that, in fact. Here's the result. , : I had the opportunity to ask the White House why gas down the street is $7 and here is what they said. … Russia is one of the top three producers of oil and it is actually their number one revenue source. … Now, with Putin starting this horrific fight between Ukraine and Russia, nobody wants to work with him and do international trade. So, with people being scared of war and limited resources, prices are bound to go up as well. , so nothing against teenage energy expert in Lycra you just saw, but that is not the way you communicate with a population in a democracy. That's not the way you talk to free people. That is the way that you command your serfs. You assume that they're stupid and so you serve them up stupid propaganda. You patronize them like you're speaking to a housekeeper at a hotel in Cabo. ""We call this oil. It costs very much now. Vladimir Putin, very bad man."" That's what they're saying and they're saying it for a reason, because when you no longer respect your own citizens, you can't be bothered to speak in complex sentences. You have TikTok influencers deliver your lines. All around this, this is happening even on former news channels. This is exactly what they're doing. That's their power, but it's not their main power. Their main power, the one they deploy most often, is the power to change the subject, the power to force you to ignore what actually matters to you and your family and your country, and focus instead on what matters to them. They call it democracy. Congress, at the moment, for example, is totally absorbed in the question of how to arm Ukraine. How many MiGs should be sending to Zelenskyy and how do we get them there? Now, that's not an issue that directly or even indirectly is related to the many, many...growing number of pressing problems the United States is facing domestically, but even on its own terms, even you think that's the most important thing that we could be talking about, they're not really talking about it in any complete sense and if you doubt that, ask yourself how you would handle it. ‘’ ‘’ The TikTok logo is seen on an iPhone 11 Pro max in this photo illustration in Warsaw, Poland on September 29, 2020. You're the Congress and you're moved by the suffering in Ukraine. Every American is. Americans are kind people. They want to help. Civilians in Ukraine are being crushed by Vladimir Putin. That's true. How can we help? Well, why don't we send more weapons to Ukraine in the middle of a war? It doesn't sound like a bad idea, but if you're going to make that decision, you'd probably feel some kind of moral obligation to consider the ramifications. Like, what effect will this actually have? Is it possible that doing this, as well-intentioned as it is, is it possible doing this will be counterproductive? Will it hurt the people I'm hoping to help? Will it, for example, prolong the fighting in Ukraine at the expense of the vulnerable civilian population in Ukraine? If I do this, could I inadvertently be doing to Ukraine what the West inadvertently did to, let's say, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Afghanistan? You wouldn't want that. You'd hate to do something like that again, because that would be cruel. So, you'd want to make sure you weren't doing that. But not a single person in Washington, at least in public, appears to be asking that question. No one's allowed to ask that question. What are you a Putin defender? And in fact, as well-meaning as most Americans are—most of our lawmakers are well-meaning—you get the sense that the core figures in our foreign policy establishment don't really care. And in fact, never have cared about the effects of their policy. We can give you a million examples. Here's one: Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright way back in 1996, shrugged off the documented deaths of half a million Iraqi children. Not a small number, half a million, because imposing sanctions on Saddam Hussein was ""worth it."" : We have heard that a half a million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died when in Hiroshima and, you know, is the price worth it? : I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it. It is a moral question, but the moral question is even a larger one. Don't we owe, to the American people, and to the American military, and to the other countries in the region that this man not be a threat? So, keep in mind that debate, that conversation, was about sanctions, which were certainly going to hurt Saddam Hussein. They didn't. He ended up invading seven years later because sanctions didn't work. When have sanctions worked exactly to achieve their desired outcome? Let us know when you find out, but in the meantime, a half a million children died, but it was worth it. Because, because why? Former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright attends the 2017 Museum of Arts &amp; Design Ball at Cipriani 42nd Street on November 7, 2017 in New York City. Well, in retrospect, sadly, and it burdens the conscience of every decent person, it's hard to see why it was worth it, but you should know that these are exactly the same people who are now giving you more lectures right now. In fact, at this very moment on every other channel on television, 24 hours a day, about how we have a moral obligation to wade blindly into a war in Eastern Europe against a country that has not attacked us and if we don't do that, you're a traitor. What's going on here? High levels of aggression, that's for sure, but deflection too. Our leaders are a master of deflection. They yell so you won't notice what else is happening. What else is happening? Well, it turns out one of the biggest stories of the decade dropped this morning, you may not even be aware of it, the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia is considering accepting Chinese currency rather than U.S. dollars for its oil sales to China now. Why is that a big deal? Seems like some little financial story. Well, because it would spell the end of the petrodollar. The petrodollar is one of the keys to the United States' wealth. Saudi Arabia has traded oil exclusively in U.S. dollars for nearly half a century and that is one of the key reasons the United States has the highest living standard of any big country in the world, despite the fact that our manufacturing sector long ago collapsed. You may have wondered how that worked. Why are we still so rich? Well, this is how. Petrodollars allow our government, in short, to spend money that we don't have and that money pays for an awful lot of what we have—healthcare, retirements, the military. We could go on—everything, essentially. As economist Gal Luft put it in interview with The Wall Street Journal today, ""The oil market and by extension, the entire global commodities market, is the insurance policy of the status of the dollar is the reserve currency. If that block is taken out of the wall, the wall will begin to collapse."" What's the wall? Well, it's the U.S. economy. Not a small story, maybe even a bigger story than the invasion of Ukraine. Weird that we're not talking about it. Meanwhile, at the exact same moment that happened there's this: The Chinese government has decided to wound our already teetering economy once again by using the pretext of . So, the Chinese have ordered lockdowns in factory towns, towns that make Toyotas, Volkswagen, circuit boards, air conditioning units, batteries, televisions and, yes, iPhones. Now why are they doing this? Well, you're supposed to believe it's all about the coronavirus, which has mysteriously resurged in China in the middle of a war in which China is siding with the country that we are against, Russia. Can that really be true? Hard to believe. Is it really just the virus that's causing this behavior? Yes, say the propagandists of The Washington Post, it definitely is. It's definitely not a trade war brought on by the Biden administration's incompetence in international affairs. We're not suffering for the fact they don't know what they're doing. No, it's just a virus. $1 A pundit called Catherine Rampell, for example, told us with a straight face that, ""Daily cases in China have reached numbers not publicly reported since 2020...Thanks partly to low vaccination rates for the elderly in China, plus the relative ineffectiveness of Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines, the Chinese government has responded to outbreaks with an iron fist."" They should have gone with Pfizer like we did. Now none of that, of course, explains why cases are higher in China now that they were in the beginning of the pandemic, but The Washington Post doesn't want you to think about that. They want you to think about vaccines. It was all about vaccines. It turns out the Chinese have a pandemic of the unvaccinated too, and don't they deserve it? Speaking of news you may not be hearing about, a hot war is in progress 50 yards from Texas, which is an American state. No one seems to notice that either because we're focused on Ukraine. According to one report, a Mexican cartel engaged local authorities in a shootout for more than three hours. There were burning trucks with no one responding to them. That's a war. The U.S. Consulate has just warned Americans to avoid the area or secure shelter. That's our southern border, over which two million people flowed this year with no restraints whatsoever. Meanwhile, in our country, a convoy of American citizens dared to peacefully protest their own government as they assume the Constitution guaranteed them the right to do and yet they have been blocked unconstitutionally from entering their own capital city, Washington, D.C. It's not just truckers who are banned from entering Washington, D.C., it's everyone. D.C. police somehow were allowed to block off many exits yesterday to drivers for more than two hours. This is the same city that rewarded violent Black Lives Matter protesters with a mural. So maybe you're for that, maybe you're not, but in normal times, that would be a big story because our constitutional rights are wrapped up in it and we should be debating what the limits of those rights are, how much power our politicians have, how much power we want them to have, but we're not because Ukraine, because you changed your Twitter name to the Ukrainian flag. It's the new crisis. You're not supposed to pay attention to any of the other crises, particularly here at home.",0

That is their M.O. and it's been Joe Biden's M.O. for 50 years, is he's been wrong on every foreign policy question for five decades, literally since when I was a toddler and Joe Biden arrived in the Senate, he's been consistently wrong. … What's particularly galling is, is these guys spent four years during the Trump presidency saying these guys don't know what they're doing, and now the adults are back in charge. That's what they claim…Russia invaded Ukraine because of Biden's weakness, because of his withdrawal from Afghanistan, because of his waiving sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and every single enemy of America is stronger, is emboldened. The chances of the next shoe dropping of China invading Taiwan are growing by the day because they see Biden's weakness. And right now, Biden's emissaries are in Venezuela, begging Maduro to sell U.S. oil and are in Vienna trying to beg the ayatollah in Iran to sell U.S. oil. They want every enemy of America to get rich, to make billions, to use to kill Americans. And the one people they don't want to actually sell oil and gas are Americans that produce American jobs. It is literally if you sat down and said every enemy of America, let's help them. Let's benefit them. Every friend of America. Let's alienate the let's undercut them. Let's hurt them.",0

A social media account for Vice President Kamala Harris stated Tuesday in a now-deleted tweet that the United States is supporting Ukraine ""in defense of the alliance,"" which the Ukraine is not a part of. ""When I was in Poland, I met with U.S. and Polish service members, thanking them for standing with our allies for freedom, peace, and security,"" a tweet from the @KamalaHarris account stated. ""The United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people in defense of the alliance."" The remarks made in the tweet, which featured a photo of Harris greeting American and Polish service members, come on the heels of similar statements she made while addressing House Democrats over the weekend at the Democratic National Committee’s winter meeting in D.C. : ""Russia’s invasion threatens not just Ukraine’s democracy, it threatens democracy and security across Europe,"" Harris said. ""So I will say what I know we all say, and I will say over and over again: The United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people in defense of the alliance."" Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a joint press conference with Poland's President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on March 10, 2022. Those remarks prompted the White House to alter the transcript from the event, adding ""[and]"" to make it appear that she said the United States supports Ukraine and defends surrounding countries.

The United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people and in defense of the alliance."" The North Atlantic Treaty Organization plays no formal role in Russia's war with Ukraine, but Harris' messaging could be sending signals to Russian officials who have long been uneasy about Ukraine joining the alliance. Vice President Kamala Harris points to Poland's President Andrzej Duda during a press conference in Warsaw on March 10, 2022. Rebekah Koffler, a former intelligence officer and author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital that the tweet from Harris' account ""simply confirmed to the Russians what they suspected all along - and that is that Ukraine is de facto already halfway into ."" , U.S.- ""The Russians already believe that Ukraine already has one foot in ,"" Koffler said. ""This is why Putin launched an attack on Ukraine at this time. Russia views and the U.S. as its top security threat because it’s a military alliance, which has been broadening its membership to include former Soviet states."" Koffler said Putin ""drew a red line on Ukraine"" because he feared it would join the alliance and become a stronger force. Russian President Vladimir Putin ""The Kremlin has observed, accurately, that the U.S. has been pursuing a bipartisan policy that aims to prevent Russia from emerging as a dominant power in Eurasia,"" Koffler said, noting a once-classified policy. ""Russia and the U.S. are on a geopolitical collision course because the two are fighting for control of the post-Soviet space in Eurasia,"" Koffler added.

2022-03-16,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-war-russia-inevitable,Tucker: How could war with Russia not be inevitable?,"Fox News host gives his take on the U.S. response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, addressed members of Congress today in a long and at times moving speech. Among other things, Zelenskyy demanded the United States shoot down Russian aircraft over his country. The White House has not yet agreed to do that, but things do seem to be moving very rapidly in that direction. Not long after Zelenskyy's address, Joe Biden announced the United States will send a total of at least a billion dollars of weapons to Ukraine just this week. Members of Congress from both parties then emerged to say they don't think that's enough. . : And the lethal drones, we need more of those in country as well. You know, people talk about a no-fly zone. Well, they can create their own if we give them the military equipment and weapons. Ranking Member Michael McCaul speaks at House Foreign Affairs Committee with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Capitol Hill on September 13, 2021 in Washington, . . : But there's a lot I think we can do to help Ukraine shoot down those Russian aircraft, bring down those missiles. . : A package that includes fighter jets and air defense systems to the Ukraine immediately so that we can have a Ukrainian no-fly zone. . : What we need to do is make sure that Ukraine has the equipment it needs in order to defend itself, particularly the skies. : I think there is a bipartisan movement right here. Provide them the MiGs. Provide them the planes where they can create a no-fly zone. So, things are changing very fast. For weeks, leaders in Washington told us that an American-backed no-fly zone in Ukraine would be unwise because it would amount to an act of war against a nuclear-armed Russia. As you can see, those views have evolved a lot, but in fairness, Rep. Maria Salazar got there first. Salazar is a longtime news anchor from Miami, who a little over a year ago was elected to Congress as a Republican. She now sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee. A week ago, a reporter from the GrayZone asked Salazar what she thought of a no-fly zone. Here's what she said: $1 , ’S : Do you support a no-fly zone in Ukraine? . : I support everything that has to do with punishing Vladimir Putin and helping the Ukrainians. : Wouldn't that mean direct conventional warfare with Russia? . : I don't know what it will mean, but you know, freedom is not free. : So you don't know what a no-fly zone will mean. If you do have to shoot down Russian planes, I mean.. . : Of course. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., speaks during a news conference to highlight Cuban Independence Day outside the Capitol on Thursday, May 20, 2021. I don't know what it will mean, but, you know, freedom is not free. Now, we made fun of that answer last week when we first showed you that clip, but now what we mocked is the consensus in Washington. We don't know what's going to happen. We've got to do it immediately. That's the argument you're hearing. At this point, no one wants to say it out loud, but it is true. At this point, a shooting war with Russia seems inevitable. How could war with Russia not be inevitable? Virtually everyone with power is for it. We remain against it. We think that joining a war in Eastern Europe will hurt this country, though to be clear, when and if that war starts, we will be praying passionately for America's total victory. Unlike so many in the foreign policy establishment, we love this country above all, and we mean it.",0

His words are viewed as empty. Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe told ""The Ingraham Angle"" Tuesday how the world's view of the Biden administration has shifted. : Why the U.S. isn't more involved as the world's superpower is because the world's expectations, certainly our allies expectations for Joe Biden and his administration, have been lowered as a result of what they've seen for the past years. I've talked to my former counterparts, intelligence counterparts, and some of our strongest allies. And what they relay is the problem is, it's no longer a perception that Joe Biden be seen as weak. It's the fact that Joe Biden has proven that he is weak through his decisions, as people have seen in Afghanistan and now in the lead-up to this crisis that became an invasion in the Ukraine. So, our allies have seen what the American people have seen, that Joe Biden makes promises that he doesn't keep, that he makes promises that he doesn't remember. He makes promises that he walks back. And as a result, that's why you're seeing things like Volodymyr Zelenskyy tomorrow, you know, bypassing Biden and going directly to Congress. It's why leaders of foreign countries like those, like the Saudi prince and the sheikh of the last week not taking Biden's phone calls even to talk about the oil crisis worldwide. So, you know, the rest of the world is rising to meet the challenge of Vladimir Putin, but unfortunately, they don't see Joe Biden as particularly relevant to coming to meet that challenge.",0

It would be much better to start the sanctions weeks or months ago. This is another example of President Biden being on the back foot, not wanting to take any action that might defend our allies in Europe, hoping that he can somehow dissuade Vladimir Putin from invading when he had 200,000 troops on Ukraine’s border. That time has passed. … We need to focus on the here and now. More important, we need to get these weapons the frontlines. Do you know it will stop Russian aircraft in Russian missiles? S-300 air defense systems. Not sanctions on Russian politicians as appropriate as those are.

When do we get involved, and when do we not get involved? And what is legitimate to expect of the world's great superpower? Expectations are appropriately high when you're the most powerful country on Earth, and expectations are appropriately high when you refer to yourself as ""the shining city on a hill."" And that's what we refer to ourselves as – the shining city on a hill. And expectations are high when you refer to yourself as exceptional, which we do – when you refer to yourself as the last best hope for humankind, which we do. 'S , 9/11, , Expectations are appropriately high when you refer to yourself as history's greatest experiment in self-governance, which we do. So, yeah, expectations of America are high. And if we're self-governed, if we really are ""We the People,"" which we purport to be, then we should set our own expectations. We should decide what we stand for, what we want to be known for, and in this case, how much we will take. We've seen a country invade a neighboring country without just cause – without any cause, much less just cause. We've seen the killing of women and children. We've seen escape routes being bombed. Think about that for a second. I mean, the words kind of roll off your tongue, but think about that for a second. You're bombing escape routes. These are people trying to leave. They're not fighting you. They're trying to leave. Then you bomb the escape routes. We sit there while dictators say you're free to leave Ukraine, but only if you come in this direction. You can go east towards Russia; you just can't go west. It's been a week now, and I know we have short memories, but nuclear disaster was narrowly avoided. Then, fast-forward a week, journalists are killed. It looks like civilians are not just being killed, but they're being targeted. And so we see all of this, and our response has been to impose sanctions to stop buying oil and gas from one brutal dictator while we're negotiating to buy oil and gas from other brutal dictators. And we talked about seizing the yachts of Russian billionaires who can go afford to buy new ones. We've talked about international norms and ostracizing Russia from the world community, like that bothers them. And we've imposed sanctions on Russia as it relates to banking and commerce and finance. And yet we're told we need Russia at the bargaining table in another part of the world when it comes to Iran, and we really don't have any response. We have laryngitis when China comes up. China shared our intelligence with Russia. China is doing nothing to stop this conflict in Ukraine, and we have laryngitis when it comes to that country. We have laryngitis when China comes up. So that's the list of things we've done, which is surpassed by the list of things we say we will not do. No troops. Won't impose a no-fly zone. Can't use our planes, can't use us to get our planes to Ukraine. Not sure about offensive weapons. And we're always told the same thing: We can't risk escalation. We don't want to engage in acts of war. We don't want to trigger a broader conflict. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., introduces Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to speak to the U.S. Congress by video at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, March 16, 2022. And I'm with you. It's good to avoid war. It's great to avoid war. I have purposely had members of Congress on our show who served because they did serve. I want to hear from the people, many of whom wear the marks of war permanently. I had Brian Mast on the show – permanent marks of war. Dan Crenshaw – permanent marks of war. I've had Tommy Cotton and Tulsi Gabbard, who still serves. Mike Gallagher, Joni Ernst, Lindsey Graham, who retired from the Air Force a couple of years ago. Like them or don't like them, but they wore the uniform, and they've earned the right, in my opinion, to give us their opinion. And the consensus is: it's good to avoid war.

Ingraham mentioned the case of former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, who had voiced her concerns about certain aspects of the Ukraine invasion. In response, her comments were branded treasonous by Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and throughout the left-wing voices in media.

She noted pundit Ana Navarro, who said on 's ""The View"" that the Biden Justice Department should potentially investigate such dissenters. ‘ ’ Laura Ingraham At the same time, Ingraham said, Americans are supposed to forget that President Biden himself railed against the country he was elected to lead as being systemically racist.

There was a brief pause in the Russia-mediated U.S.-Iran talks after Russian President Vladimir Putin's military invaded U.S. ally Ukraine in a brutal war that's only escalating. But Biden administration negotiators now appear to be moving full-steam ahead toward a deal that may even remove Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list. The resolution opposes ""engaging Russia as a main intermediary for reviving any nuclear agreement,"" ""giving Russia any sanctions exemption or waiver"" in a deal, and calls a nuclear deal not ratified by Congress ""illegitimate.""

He got incredible video in story after story we’d cover. Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, the Mideast, the , riots in Hong Kong, Paris terror, Asian earthquakes. He saved my own life on many occasions. We were embedded in the lead Marine company in the battle of Fallujah in Iraq in 2004. Three Marines were killed, 18 injured, just in our unit. He had my back. He carried 80 pounds of electronic camera gear on his back as we scaled the Kunar Mountains in eastern Afghanistan with young army recruits in 2006. It was the one time I saw him out of breath! We’ve dodged bricks and bats and paving stones and stinging tear gas in riot after riot from Hong Kong to Athens to Paris. He always knew which way to turn and get the best pictures.

He hated... hated… hated sitting around the newsroom. He hated stuck-up rich brats. He loved regular folks. And he might have told a few symbols of authority which way to go from time to time. We called him Zak… Peppy… the Pep-ster… Pepé Le Pew. His family name, Zakrzewski, was a bit hard to interpret . His father was Polish. His mother was French. They met in Scotland. He was raised in Ireland. And with his big mane of curly black hair and mustache, he looks like he should be from somewhere south of the Sahara! And he bears a passing resemblance to the comic character ""Borat."" When the movie was popular, the troops loved to take pictures with him. Pierre Zakrzewski in Lyon, France, July 2019.

He worked hard and he played hard. A classic Type A character . His vacations included riding a motorcycle across the Kenyan desert, hanging out with left-wing guerilla fighters in Central America and climbing any mountain that was handy. He was so colorful, one French author wanted to do an illustrated book about his life. Before he got to Fox News, in the late '80s, he was riding with the mujahideen on donkeys crossing into Afghanistan to fight the then-Soviet army. : ‘ A ’ In 1989, he smuggled out pictures of the deadly crackdown in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. In the '90s, he covered all sorts of coups and disasters. And he found the time one summer to take a job sucking asbestos out of attic ceilings in Rhode Island! It was not just me who liked working with him. Everybody wanted to. Benjamin Hall on the story. Trey Yingst in the last days of Afghanistan. Both in the plunging hell of Kyiv. Steve Harrigan wanted Pierre whenever he could get him. So did Mike Tobin. Amy Kellogg adored working with him. So did our new London reporter, Alex Hogan. He worked selflessly to get Afghans out of trouble when the Taliban took over in that country. Over the years, he would host refugees at his home… adopt long-distance needy folks from around the world. He wasn’t into high-profile charities. He just liked people to people. His back ached all the time. Sometimes it would freeze up, and he’d have to lie on the ground. All due to carrying more gear on trips than any other cameraman around. His ""bum bag"" carried more items than a pick-up truck. He was as deaf as a coot, from standing too close to the artillery blasts too many times. Pierre Zakrzewski on the job.

He had a photographic memory and would recall names and people and stories from years ago. I called him my external memory hard-drive. He was a good teacher. He trained up young journalists in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was patient and thorough. But he did not suffer fools gladly. The terrible shelling outside of Kyiv which resulted in his death was not the first time he got into trouble. Bombs, rockets, shells have exploded around him in the past. We always said he was like a cat with nine lives. Tragically, this week, those lives ran out. He once told me he was going to work a bit longer and then retire. But his plans for retirement with his lovely wife, Mich, were not going to be relaxing. They were going to travel the world and go to every nook and cranny they hadn’t been to yet. Now, he won’t get to do that. As a present for putting up with me, I took him to see the Rolling Stones in London on their 50th anniversary tour a while back. Just the other day, I saw the group planned a 60th-anniversary concert in Hyde Park this summer. I was all set to get another round of tickets. Now, he won’t go there. We’re going to miss you, Pierre. We already do. Big hug.",6

Mike Huckabee joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss Zelenskyy's handling of Putin's assault and his virtual address to Congress. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee argued Biden could learn from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's leadership and communication skills, praising him as a ""remarkable inspiration"" as Putin continues his assault on the nation. Huckabee joined ""Fox & Friends First"" to discuss how Zelenskyy has led his country admirably through a tragic time in Ukraine's history. A ‘ ’ ‘ ’ : Well the most important thing [Biden can learn] is how to communicate, Zelenskyy is a master at communicating. People say, well, he's an actor. He may be, but I'm telling you, he's also a leader, and communication is a very important part of leadership. More importantly than simply his ability to speak is the fact that he has stayed put, and he has gone out and visited the people of Ukraine. He has been defiant to Putin, and he's shown us what leadership looks like, which is never ask others to do what you're unwilling to do. He's asked the people of Ukraine to stand and fight. That's exactly what he's done. Leadership is always putting yourself in the front of the line and say, follow me rather than, hey, you guys go do this, and it's been a remarkable inspiration.",0

They know full well that President Tsai, who's the leader of Taiwan, is tough. Just like Zelenskyy, she's the toughest leader they've ever had to deal with since 1947, when the Communists took over. So does this impact? Yes, it does, but this is a fact: President Xi is determined as ever to bring Taiwan into his orbit. And I don't believe for a minute that the adverse impacts of what's taking place to Russia, that they're heading toward a strategic failure as a result of this invasion, necessarily correlates to him and put curbs on what his strategic objectives are. He is focused on his strategic objectives for his national interest. And what's happening to the Russians, in my judgment, will not deter him.",0

Check out what clicked this week in entertainment. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Hollywood star and former governor of California, is speaking out amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The actor took to social media on Thursday and shared a passionate nine-minute video created and produced by : in which he urged Russian citizens and military members, in particular, to hear ""the truth."" The famed bodybuilder revealed he wanted to dispel information and urged for Russia’s government, military and citizens to end the ongoing violence. ""The strength and the heart of the Russian people have always inspired me,"" said the 74-year-old. ""That is why I hope that you will let me tell you the truth about the war in Ukraine and what is happening there. No one likes to hear something critical of their government, I understand that. But as a longtime friend of the Russian people, I hope that you will hear what I have to say."" Schwarzenegger cited Yuri Petrovich Vlasov, a champion weightlifter from Russia as one of his childhood idols. He described how his father Gustav Schwarzenegger, a member of the Nazi party who served in World War , became angry when he hung a picture of Vlasov in his room. : 'I ' ""My father told me to take down the picture and to find a German or Austrian hero,"" Schwarzenegger recalled. ""But I did not take down the photograph, because it didn’t matter to me what flag Yuri Vlasov carried."" Schwarzenegger candidly spoke about his father’s dark history and its impact. ""[My father] was injured at Leningrad and the Nazi army he was part of did vicious harm to the great city and to its brave people,"" he said. ""When my father arrived in Leningrad, he was all pumped up on the lies of his government."" ""When he left Leningrad, he was broken — physically and mentally,"" he continued. ""He lived the rest of his life in pain. Pain from a broken back, pain from the shrapnel that always reminded him of those terrible years. And pain from the guilt that he felt.

He also detailed how many civilian buildings, including a maternity hospital, were bombed, as well as how thousands of Russian soldiers have died. ""The world has turned against Russia because of its actions in Ukraine,"" he said. ""The destruction that Russian bombs are raining down on innocent civilians has so outraged the world that the strongest global economic sanctions ever taken have been imposed on your country … This is not the war to defend Russia like your grandfather or your great-grandfather fought. This is an illegal war!"" The video was accompanied by videos and images of refugees packed in crowded rooms as they attempt to escape. Other families were seen giving tearful goodbyes before separating. ""To the soldiers who are listening to this, remember that 11 million Russians have family connections to Ukraine – so every bullet you shoot, you shoot a brother or a sister,"" he said. ""To those in power in the Kremlin, let me just ask you: Why would you sacrifice these young men for your own ambition? … To [Russian] President Putin, I say: You started this war.

Liberal media outlets and have spent a chunk of their Ukraine coverage in recent weeks promoting liberal talking points hypercritical of former President Trump and the while bestowing favorable coverage upon President Biden and his administration. Many pundits became visibly frustrated at claims that the Biden administration isn’t doing enough to support Ukraine, with many firing back at assertions that Russian President Vladimir Putin would never have invaded the European country if Trump was still in office. Former President Donald Trump speaks during the 'Save America' rally at the Montgomery County Fairgrounds on January 29, 2022 in Conroe, Texas. On Wednesday, ’s Joe Scarborough interrupted a discussion with morning show host and political correspondent Jonathan Lemire to voice his anger towards those critical of Biden’s ""historic"" response to Putin. - , , , ""What has been done thus far is nothing short of historic. Let me say that again for people writing snarky op-eds about this administration and about Congress and about the United States response. What has happened over the last three weeks is nothing short of historic."" Scarborough said. Scarborough went on to berate anyone arguing that Trump would have enacted a response on the same scale as the current president. ""And anybody suggesting that Donald Trump would have done any of this, please. Please, start your clown show somewhere else. We don't want to watch it. We don't want to hear it,"" he added. Taking it a step further, that same day on ""The 11th Hour,"" Stephanie Ruhle claimed it was a ""far-right narrative"" to say the White House and the larger U.S. government aren’t doing enough to help Ukraine. ""It is also a far-right narrative that keeps getting pushed that the U.S isn't doing anything. And those same Republican lawmakers that are pushing President Biden to do more quicker are the same people who didn't want Trump to do anything,"" she said. : A number of other hosts and journalists also seemed insistent on bringing Trump into the conversation on Ukraine. On March 4 while hosting "" Daily,"" Chuck Todd stressed that voters’ view that Putin wouldn’t have invaded Ukraine under Trump was a ""perception issue"" that wasn't based on ""logic."" ""I don’t buy that,"" he said. ""I don’t think that matches logic, but voters do. That’s a perception issue."" During a Sunday appearance on ’s ""Meet the Press,"" New York Times Pentagon correspondent Helene Cooper argued the U.S. would be in a ""completely different place"" if Trump was still in office. ""I would love to just game out where we would be right now if Donald Trump was still President and Vladimir Putin had invaded Ukraine,"" Cooper said. ""First of all, Trump would already have pulled us out of because that's what he wanted to do. He already started pulling American troops out of Europe. The Pentagon kind of stalled out until Biden came into office."" President Joe Biden speaks about additional security assistance that his administration will provide to Ukraine, Wednesday, March 16, 2022. ) Some hosts and guests also took the time to positively frame Biden, his administration, and the Democratic Party. On Wednesday, host Andrea Mitchell appeared to express hope that the war on Ukraine would have a positive political impact for Biden and the Democrats heading into the midterms. She also touted that the president’s poll numbers had stabilized and even appeared to ""edge up"" in the wake of the war. ""Do you think that this at least is helping the Democrats and helping the White House as they head into the midterms?"" she asked the Washington Post's Philip Rucker. , : ""You know, it certainly is giving Biden an opportunity to be the strong leader that he campaigned as and that he hopes to appear to be in the first year of his presidency,"" Rucker said. One reporter wondered on Tuesday why Biden's stance on Putin’s invasion of Ukraine isn't helping his low poll numbers, calling the president’s actions ""popular.""

Gutted cars following a night air raid in the village of Bushiv, 40 kilometers west of Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, March 4, 2022. Chuck Todd, once again tackling the Ukraine war on March 6, appeared baffled that Biden did not attempt to connect the conflict with voting rights in America, a popular talking point for Democrats. ""There was one thing that surprised me about the President’s State of the Union was the lack of connecting the fight for democracy and freedom abroad, with the fight for democracy at home. Today’s Bloody Sunday, ?"" Todd said on ""Meet the Press."" contributor Eddie Glaude responded he was ""stunned"" Biden did not make the connection between the two, arguing it was an ""easy kind of rhetorical move."" ""And politically helpful,"" interjected Todd. ""I mean, hate to be that crass about it but, right? It’s an easy political message."" Echoing Todd’s comments, correspondent Yamiche Alcindor also made the connection between Ukraine and voting rights during the network's coverage of Biden’s State of the Union address on March 1. In doing so, the moderator also took a shot at Republicans. ""We have our own democratic crisis here at home. Democracy matters and Ukraine is showing that. So, of course, we have our own election, people, the Republicans in a lot of states trying to pull back the voter access to so many different Americans,"" Alcindor said.

Laura Ingraham criticized the media Thursday for its ""war hawk consensus,"" stressing that now is the time for vigorous and open debate on ""The Ingraham Angle."" : Military strategists who specialize in battlefield tactics game out every move, and every step of the way, they ask serious questions like, ""Will MiGs actually help turn the tide in Ukraine? And can Ukraine even maintain these older fighter planes?"" Or is the media's position that it's better to consider these issues after we've spent billions replacing Poland's MiGs? Now this ""spin now, ask later"" approach is how the U.S. ended up without a victory in Iraq, and an embarrassing defeat in Afghanistan — we spent trillions. We lost thousands of our brave troops. We lost contractors and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians to fight a war that created an exodus of Iraqi Christians and also the rise of . Saddam was gone, a great thing, but much of Iraq was as well. A total nightmare. : - : -29 This is precisely the time, now is the time for vigorous and open debate. And one voice that should be heard is that of U.S. Navy Reserve Officer Blake Herzinger, who writes in Foreign Policy that, ""Most of Ukraine's fighter aircraft are still in the fight, flying approximately five to 10 missions per day using a pool of about 50 jets. Russian aircraft are flying nearly 200 missions per day, but keeping their planes primarily within Russian airspace. Both sides are likely exercising extreme caution to avoid ground-based air defense systems. Given this knowledge, a score of Soviet-era air superiority assets would not meaningfully improve Ukraine's military situation."" And there's more. ""Poland's MiGs are decades old, and many were hand-me-downs when the Poles receive them. Fighters, especially older ones, require considerable maintenance, as well as an insured pipeline of spare parts and munitions. Ukraine's capability to sustain those extra aircraft is unclear."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivers a virtual address to the U.S Congress. So asking how Soviet-era MiGs will hold up against newer Russian jets with advanced avionics and defensive capabilities is an entirely rational question. So why is the establishment so afraid to answer it? Why are they afraid even to allow the question to be asked at all?",0

I'm sure the Chinese are livid at the Russians more for screwing up the invasion than for any moral abominations that they have certainly committed. But look, there is upside for the Chinese here. This makes the Russians a lot more pliable for them. They have a lot less leverage. And I think we're seeing the beginnings of the formation of a Chinese-led bloc. I don't think the Chinese are ready to come out of the gate yet. But you see the Saudis trading in yuan, you see the Indians continue buying Russian oil, the Chinese have made it, I think, pretty clear that they're going to continue to support the Russians. They may not want to take political heat for it. But I think in practice, both on the economic sanctions-evasion side, but even potentially in militarily relevant equipment or resources, they seem to be sticking with their man there. … : I think that right now … one strategic, geostrategic issue, if Russia totters or fails, then … China has lost, if you will, its major geostrategic partner as far as how they see the worldview while they have completely different things. I think they make the move on Taiwan. I think that they are exposed. Everything about their economy is vulnerable. I think it would be catastrophic for them.

2022-03-18,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/5-things-biden-must-say-in-his-talks-with-xi,5 things Biden must say in his talks with Xi,"Heritage Foundation vice president discusses if China would risk getting involved in Russia's war on Ukraine on 'Your World.' Don’t get your hopes up, but President Biden will hold a call with China’s President Xi Jinping on Friday to talk about Ukraine and other matters. As you know, China signed a $117 billion oil and gas deal with Russia on Feb. 4 and gave tacit support for Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Is China sorry? Apparently not. The U.S. and are still the ""culprits of the crisis"" in Ukraine, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zshao Lijian charged on Thursday. However, Beijing was surprised by Ukraine’s fierce resistance and Russia's military blunders. The Ukraine crisis has ""reached a stage that Chinese side does not want to see,"" official Yang Jiechi delicately admitted after meeting with U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in Rome on Monday. It’s hard to say if China would help pressure ally Putin to stop his barbaric war on Ukraine. Remember, anything Biden says to Xi will also get to Putin. With that in mind, here are five messages Biden must send to Xi – and one topic I hope Biden won’t bring up. 1) ""Putin must fail."" – Priority one for this meeting isn’t trade; this is Biden’s chance to deliver the strong message that invading neighbors and nuclear blackmail won’t work. Biden must make clear to Xi Jinping that America is committed to ""making sure Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin,"" as Biden said from the White House Wednesday. Or as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson put it earlier: ""Putin must fail and be seen to fail."" Remember, what Biden says to Xi will get back to Putin, fast. ' ' 2) ""Don’t help Putin or mess with the Russia sanctions."" – After his ""intense, candid"" meeting in Rome, Sullivan said, ""We have communicated to Beijing that we will not stand by and allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses from the economic sanctions."" Biden should drive that point home to Xi in plain language. The same goes for military equipment. ""If China does choose to materially support Russia in this war, there will likely be consequences for China in that regard,"" a senior U.S. defense official said on a call with reporters on Monday. Biden should make that point, too. 3) ""Taiwan is a sovereign nation and America will defend Taiwan if you attack."" – China’s military threat to Taiwan grew all year until Russia’s war knocked it out of the headlines. Biden should tell Xi that given China’s support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, America’s policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" for Taiwan is no longer enough. Now is the time for direct recognition of Taiwan and full military support. Taiwan is a thriving free-market democracy with 23 million people. It’s not acceptable for China to seize it just because they couldn’t back in 1949. Let’s hope Biden can make the Ukraine crisis into a stark warning for China. 4) ""I’m planning a visit to Taiwan and more arms sales."" – Okay, it’s not on the White House calendar, but let China stew on the idea of a Biden visit. Biden did dispatch five senior statesmen including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen and former Defense Undersecretary Michel Flournoy to Taiwan earlier this month. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Taiwan, too. Biden should come bearing gifts. President Donald J. Trump resumed defensive arms sales to Taiwan and Biden has wisely continued them. Sales should increase. Let’s not go slow arming Taiwan as we did with Ukraine. 5) ""I’m cutting back on Chinese student visas."" – Biden should make China feel some direct pain for supporting Russia. Last year 317,229 Chinese students were enrolled at American colleges and universities, up from 157,558 in 2010. A lot of them get caught stealing American science and trade secrets. Instead of leading to friendships, the student visa program has led to espionage. Denying student visas is long overdue. Finally, here’s the one topic I don’t want Biden to raise with Xi Jinping: climate change. China is a climate monster. China generates 28% of the planet’s yearly carbon dioxide emissions and won’t even start to cut back carbon emissions until 2030. Team Biden has already wasted too much international political capital chasing climate accords. It needs to be off the table until there’s a cease-fire in Ukraine. Biden’s made a number of bad policy decisions on China, such as reversing the ban on TikTok, ending the Justice Department’s program to root out Chinese spies in universities, and giving China’s solar panel imports a loophole. Let’s hope Biden can make the Ukraine crisis into a stark warning for China. The U.S. can’t let China conclude that they can invade a neighbor and use nuclear blackmail to sideline America. .",5

""At the time, we said we will ban the import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal to the United States – a significant action with widespread bipartisan support,"" Sharma said in an email. ""Our ban blocks any new purchases of Russian energy and winds down deliveries of existing purchases as is standard practice because they have already been paid for."" Cotton’s accusation comes ten days after Biden signed an executive order broadly banning Russian petroleum projects. Sen.

They know full well that they are not able to complete the encirclement of either one of those cities and bring in their artillery, which would be the main element to hammer the city itself and create a devastation there. So what's actually happening then? … What they're doing is they're bringing more troops from the Eastern Military District. They've arrived in Belarus, and they're crossing the border into Ukraine. There will be fresh troops, not particularly better than what's already there, to be frank about it — poorly led, poorly trained, likely having low morale, not knowing why they're there, but they're going to put them into the fight. There's also their best military organization as the first guards tank army based in the vicinity of Moscow. They've had a couple of the smaller elements from them in the fight early on. Now they're bringing larger elements out. This is the organization that keeps Putin in power at all costs.

2022-03-20,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/aid-ukraine-congress-faith-based-groups-aj-nolte-arielle-del-turco,Ukraine war: Congress should partner with local and faith-based groups for aid,"More than 3 million Ukrainian refugees have fled their country to escape the Russian invasion; Fox News correspondent Alex Hogan reports live from Hungary. While Russia continues to attack civilian areas and fire projectiles at residential areas in Ukraine, it has sparked the largest humanitarian disaster in Europe since World War . It’s already estimated that one million Ukrainians have fled the country, with more on the way. In response, the White House has asked Congress to authorize $10 billion in humanitarian, economic and security assistance, $5 billion of which would be allocated to the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development to help Ukraine and allies in the region. As Congress works to allocate funds, particular attention should be paid to supporting some of the development actors who have been proven most effective – local and faith-based organizations. A child sits on a bed in a room hosted by the local Free Christian Church, for those fleeing Ukraine, in the village of Uszka, Hungary, on March 3, 2022. Ukrainian churches are already on the front lines responding to the immediate needs of people within the country, and congregations around the world are funneling support to churches and organizations in Ukraine. Christian humanitarian aid organization Samaritan’s Purse is also sending aid and deploying five field hospitals. Other organizations, are sending resources and staff to assist Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland. , – Religious communities in the United States and in impacted countries are asking and answering the same vital questions as Congress: What do you need, and how can we help? The positive impact of local and faith-based organizations on humanitarian response is tried and true. Over the past 10 months, a team of researchers at Regent University and Family Research Council have studied the relationship between religious freedom and international development. The resulting report to be released soon highlights the profoundly positive role faith-based organizations play responding to crises and fostering human flourishing. They need only to be given the space to do so. Faith-based organizations are often the first responders to any humanitarian disaster. Faith-based organizations are often the first responders to any humanitarian disaster, have tremendous influence within effected populations, and produce positive outcomes at a lower cost over a longer period of time than many other development actors. Faith-based organizations can respond quickly as they already have relationships, and most importantly, trust, on the ground. For most of the United Nation’s sustainable development goals, faith-based actors make serious, positive and long-term progress, often at a lower cost than their non-faith-based counterparts. If Congress wants to get the most bang for their buck when it comes to humanitarian aid for Ukrainian victims of the Russian invasion, serious consideration should be given to establishing something along the lines of the New Partnership Initiative that launched to address the humanitarian crisis caused by ’ genocide against Yazidis, Christians, and other minorities in Iraq. Ukrainian refugees queue for food in the welcome area after their arrival at the main train station in Berlin. The purpose of was to equip and empower local and faith-based actors, who are able to offer smart, targeted, sustainable development assistance to their effected communities. Our research demonstrates that the made important contributions, developing a process that was easy for faith-based actors to use. In the face of Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine, Congress should create a robustly resourced program built along the lines of , with funds set aside within the forthcoming humanitarian aid package. This would direct to partner with faith-based organizations, especially those with strong local ties in effected countries. The model of fast, flexible funding is ideally suited to partner with many of the organizations that are already springing into action to respond to this crisis. Secular and foreign organizations should certainly not be excluded from receiving funds. However, it is all too easy for the State Department and bureaucracy to overlook religious and local organizations if not explicitly required to include them. Working with local and religious groups is especially important as the danger to Ukrainian religious communities in the event that Russia occupies control over any territory is grave. Human rights expert Tina Ramirez said, ""If Ukraine falls, it will be a complete religious freedom catastrophe for countless faith communities. For evidence, we need look no further than what is already the case in Russia itself and in the Russia-controlled Ukraine regions Luhansk and Donetsk."" The need to reconstruct Ukrainian churches and religious institutions following the conflict is already evident. Russian missiles have struck Assumption Cathedral in Kharkiv and the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial in Kyiv. As Putin’s unprovoked invasion escalates into an increasingly brutal and indiscriminate campaign of attacks on civilians, the humanitarian crisis will grow exponentially worse, and faith-based development actors will remain on the front lines. If Congress wants to maximize its ability to meet the needs of those suffering from the war, the forthcoming aid package must prioritize partnering with these groups.

Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson joined ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ Sunday to voice his concerns over a possible Iranian nuclear deal, warning that President Biden's perceived ‘weakness’ could have implications. : You know, we talked about...weakness earlier. I don't think very many Americans realize this because the news media, of course, won't report it, but as the Biden administration went crawling back to Iran to reengage in this horrible nuclear deal, the Iranians refused to meet with Americans; and so, guess who is negotiating the new Iran agreement on behalf of the United States with Iran? Russia and China. Do you think Russia and China view that as weakness? I certainly do. …What we are hearing of this agreement, it is awful. It is way worse than the previous agreement, billions of dollars and apparently delivered to free hostages, which is just going to spark the taking of more hostages worldwide, the lifting of sanctions on terrorists—I mean, horrible, horrible people —this will not prevent Iran from eventually going nuclear, not at all. I doubt that it really even would delay it because I simply don't believe that the type of inspections are going to ever be put in place that will prevent it. They continue to march toward the day when they will become a nuclear power with missile technology. This is...also an evil regime, an evil empire.

Samurai artist Tetsuro Shimaguchi, head of the samurai school Kamui, is training a new generation of youth from around the world in the ways of the sword, as well as the warrior's mindset. Tetsuro has visited 140 cities, operates dojo in multiple countries, and oversees the largest samurai-centric cultural preservation campaign in the world. He arrived in Washington D.C. on Wednesday ahead of his performance at the city's Cherry Blossom Festival opening ceremony. He will also make a special appearance for an halftime show at CapitolOne Arena. ""Even if I die, I want to leave a legacy of samurai culture for the future,"" Tetsuro told Fox News in an exclusive interview. ""This is more important now than ever."" - : Tetsuro began his study of the samurai tradition as a college student. With a background in performing arts such as kabuki and previous experience with martial arts such as karate, Tetsuro began to understand the samurai lifestyle as not only a discipline from the past to study, but an art form to be revived. ""People think, ‘Ah, I can’t be a samurai. They're so cool, and I'm just a normal person.' But that is not the case,"" Tetsuro told Fox News. ""I have noticed that the speed of society is moving way too fast and people have much less patience than they used to."" Kamui promotional photo, provided by Kamui Dojo The samurai warrior is one of the most iconic cultural symbols of Japan, both past and present. The swordsmen were a class of nobleman devoted to serving regional lords as soldiers, diplomats, and guards. As Japan began to modernize in the beginning of the 20th century, the samurai transitioned into a more legal and political role in the Japanese peerage system, similar to the United Kingdom's House of Lords. Following World War , the Japanese nobility was abolished, and the official status of ""samurai"" evaporated. Now, the term no longer denotes an office or privilege. Instead, the Japanese see themselves as the public inheritors of the ""samurai spirit"" and the Bushido code. Kamui promotional photo, provided by Kamui Dojo While the affinity for samurai still exists in Japan, younger generations are drifting further and further from their classical culture. As American cultural supremacy and the allure of European design and fashion saturates the Japanese market, fewer and fewer Japanese youth desire much interaction with the samurai lifestyle. ""Today, Japanese people are using their smartphones so much. They need to reach out and make more direct connections across cultures,"" Tetsuro said. ""It has the ability to really move people’s emotions."" ""The problem is that you need to understand and appreciate something that you can't see or touch,"" Tetsuro explains. ""But with performance, you can see it. It has a stronger feeling."" ""It's not just about the sword,"" Tetsuro said. ""There's more to samurai than fighting."" Tetsuro's testimony rings similar to one of the most skilled samurai in history, Miyamoto Musashi, who carried an undefeated record of 61 duels. Miyamoto also stressed the need for knowledge of the ""unseen."" In his tome of accumulated teachings, Book of the Five Rings, Miyamoto urges the reader to explore not only combat techniques, but experiences and knowledge of the ""spirit"" and ""nothingness."" Kamui promotional photo, provided by Kamui Dojo Samurai have historically been expected to compliment their skills as warriors with an extensive skill set in the humanities and religion. Samurai were prolific poets, artists, philosophers, and sportsmen. ""The image of the samurai cutting people down is still very strong, but there's so much more than that."" Tetsuro said. ""I want people to see that there is more to [samurai] than sword fighting. Education is the most important part."" Tetsuro is currently working with Japanese regional governments and national groups to revive the samurai tradition, based out of his dojo in Aizu – the historic samurai city. He runs similar schools across the globe, and has students of many different races and backgrounds. ""The most important thing for samurai – for any powerful person – is honor, responsibility, pride, and preparedness for any situation,"" he said. Tetsuro said that experiencing foreign cultures from countries like the U.S. was like a mirror. By observing and participating in the interesting parts of other cultures, he was reminded of and understood better his own heritage: ""It made me realize my own Japanese-ness inside of me – seeing and exposing myself to American culture."" Comparing the American cowboy motif to the Japanese samurai, Tetsuro muses that while both are ""cool"" and ""strong,"" there is much more important lessons under the surface. ""While the gunfighting and swords are cool, what's way cooler is having the responsibility and determination to fight for what's right,"" Tetsuro said. ""I want people to start thinking like that."" Tetsuro made a recent splash in the U.S. after a photo of his cultural collaboration with a Ukrainian official went viral. Ambassador of Ukraine to Japan Dr. Sergiy Korsunsky was photographed in traditional samurai armor during the run-up to the ongoing Russian invasion of his home country. ""This armor was provided by samurai artist Tetsuro Shimaguchi. He is a friend of Ukraine and friend of [mine],"" he continued. ""It was a cultural project to put on full, real armor to feel how Japanese warriors were feeling themselves in a battle."" The samurai photo shoot was not originally meant to be a rallying cry for support in the Ukraine. However, he said, ""When Russia began threatening Ukraine, [I] decided to make an appeal to Japanese people who remember what the bushido spirit is.

2022-03-21,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-ukraine-leaders-lying,"Tucker Carlson: We have a right to know what's going on in Ukraine, but our leaders are lying","Fox News host discusses whether Ukraine is a democracy on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' What exactly is democracy? Well, pluralism is the hallmark of it. In a democracy, citizens can have any opinion they want to have. They can express any opinion they want in public whenever they care to express it, including through mass media. If citizens are dissatisfied with their political leadership, they can challenge their leaders for office. Now, all of these things are true in every free country, in any period, always. These are not just features of democracy. These are prerequisites for democracy. So, with that in mind, you should know about a political party in Ukraine called Opposition Platform for Life. With 43 seats in parliament, it is the largest opposition party in that country. Over the weekend, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, banned that party. Opposition Platform for Life is now prohibited from ""all activity within Ukraine."" ‘ ’ ’S , In this image from video provided by the House Television, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks from Kyiv, Ukraine, as he addresses virtually addresses Congress on Wednesday, March 16, 2022. So, with a single command, Zelenskyy made it impossible for anybody to run against him for president. He did this not just to Opposition Platform for Life, but to ten other political parties that he believed were insufficiently loyal to him. They're all illegal now. Obviously, there's a war underway in Ukraine, and on that basis, Zelenskyy has declared martial law, but we must tell you, there is no evidence that the opposition parties he banned were aiding Russia in its war against Ukraine. Opposition Platform for Life, for example, denounced the Russian invasion the moment it happened, just like everybody else. But Zelenskyy took the opportunity to turn Ukraine into effectively a one-party state, which it now is. So having banned all opposition, he then seized control of the country's media outlets. Zelenskyy signed a decree that combines all national television channels into a single platform that he controls. He described this as a ""unified information policy,"" and it certainly is unified. So, if all of these details seem shocking to you, if this is not the Zelenskyy you've heard about on the Today Show, then you may not have been paying attention to Ukraine. Zelenskyy has been solidifying complete control over Ukraine for a long time, since long before the Russian invasion and the war. Last year, he had his main political opponent arrested and his assets seized by the state. At the same time, Zelenskyy shut down three of Ukraine's most popular television networks—channels that, not coincidentally, had criticized him. So, how should we as Americans assess this? Well, first and most obviously, by admitting this is authoritarianism, it's not democracy. Then second, by acknowledging that actually it's pretty common around the world. Even in 2022, real democracy is a rare thing anywhere. Most countries are still governed by some variety of dictatorship, whatever they may call it, and that includes close American allies. The kingdoms of Jordan and Saudi Arabia come to mind, but there are others. We're not moralizing about this, by the way. Obviously, we'd prefer democracy everywhere in every country, but as Americans, it's probably a waste of time to get too involved in the internal affairs of other countries. They're hard to change. What we care about, what all Americans should care about is what happens here in the United States. The United States is, despite the fact it's also a bumper sticker doesn't make it untrue, is a beacon of hope and freedom to the rest of the world. How do we maintain that inspiring position? Not simply by sending people missiles, but by remaining free ourselves. The United States cannot be a beacon of freedom, of light, in the world if we are not free. So that's the first thing we do if we want to inspire and change the world, Ukraine included, is make sure that we stay free. And with that concern in mind, you should be very worried by your leader's response to what's happening in Ukraine, the growing dictatorship there, and that's the word for it. What's another word for it? If you have ideas, send it to us. ’S ; ‘’S ,’ In this image from video provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office and posted on Facebook, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks in Kyiv, Ukraine. On the very same day that Zelenskyy shut down opposition media and all opposition political parties, professional liar and Atlantic Magazine pundit David Frum posted this on Twitter verbatim: ""Ukraine may be the first example in human history of a country that, under the pressure of war, is becoming 'more' tolerant and 'more' liberal."" Right, so when you outlaw all criticism of yourself, that's called tolerance. It's called democracy. Don't take the word of a single Canadian warmonger, propagandist. David Frum is hardly alone in telling you that. All of Washington is telling you that. Watch. : So proud of President Zelenskyy and the courage that he has shown and in Congress, we are trying to get the administration on board. : President Biden is showing moral leadership, just like President Zelenskyy's showing moral leadership. : He, of course, by his example, shows the kind of courage we all hope we can reach and provide at a moment of real testing. : Government doesn't give us our rights. Our rights come to us from God and government is just a shared tool to secure them and you see that spirit, that American Philadelphia 1787 spirit in Zelenskyy right now. , Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a joint press conference with his counterparts from Lithuania and Poland following their talks in Kyiv on Feb. 23, 2022. These people. So, the man who just declared himself king is actually the world's newest George Washington. , so you could be deeply concerned and deeply saddened, outraged by what's happening to Ukrainians without saying things like that, because it's absurd. It's a lie. That's the word from Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a Republican. And again, on one level, you can understand why people are whipped into an emotional frenzy when they talk about Ukraine. Why wouldn't they be? Russia's invasion of Ukraine was shocking. It was wrong. The suffering of civilians there is entirely real. We're watching it on . It's horrifying. So, it's entirely natural to root for the Ukrainians to expel the invaders, and obviously we are rooting for them to expel the invaders, Russia. But just because what Russia has done in Ukraine was wrong doesn't mean you have to lie about the Ukrainian government. In fact, if you really cared about the Ukrainian people and all the people you saw on ,—""we care so much""—you wouldn't want them to live under a dictator, so you'd be highly upset about what Zelenskyy just did, but our leaders are not upset in the slightest. They're cheering it on even when they know better. So, some of it is too dumb to know, but some of them do know. Michael McFaul, for example. He's Barack Obama's ambassador to Russia. Unlike shallow gasbags like Dick Durbin or Ben Sasse, McFaul actually understands Eastern Europe. He has lived there. He knows exactly who Zelenskyy is and exactly what he's doing. So, here's his assessment of the Ukrainian government, not the people, the government, as of this afternoon. ""If Zelenskyy remains in power, Ukrainian democracy is preserved."" That guy teaches at Stanford. But that's not true. So again, Ukraine was invaded by its neighbors, and we oppose that, we should oppose that, but that doesn't mean Ukraine is a democracy. It's not and we shouldn't tell Americans it is because that's a lie. We should tell the truth, but virtually no one is telling the truth. Everyone is lying. So why? Why is everyone lying? Why not just say, ""Look, it's outrageous that Russia did this and....we like Ukraine better. We're going to support Ukraine."" Fine. Why go the extra step to tell us that Ukraine is a model democracy when it's not at all? Why are they doing that? Maybe because Ukraine now has exactly the sort of democracy they'd like to see here in the United States. They hate to think that could be true. It's scary to think that's true, but ask yourself. Play this word game. If they can find a ""national security pretext"" for a war, for example, do you think Adam Schiff and Kamala Harris or Mitch McConnell would pause for even a second before banning their political opponents for running for office in this country? Do you think they would hesitate before pulling this show off the air forever? No, of course not. They'd do it in a flash. Then they call it democracy. So, maybe you're starting to conclude these people love Zelenskyy, not because he represents the Ukrainian people, but because Zelenskyy is exactly the leader they would like to be with wildly expanded war powers to make everyone who complains shut up at gunpoint. Maybe that's what's going on. It seems kind of obvious when you think about it. Now, of course, we pray they never have the power to do any of that in this country, the last free country in the world. We should not let them do that because freedom in America is not just important to us, our children and grandchildren. It's important to the globe. Again, we are the last free country. We must remain free. In the meantime, a war is being waged in America's name with our money, so it's fair to ask how the side we are backing is doing. Clearly, there are an awful lot of heroic Ukrainian citizens. We see them all the time on television. We applaud them. We admire them, but how is the government doing? How is it behaving? Again, we have a right to know, even if state-controlled media in Ukraine won't report it, even if our sort of state-controlled media here downplays it, dismisses it. Here's a man called Gennadiy Druzenko. Druzenko was a medic in charge of a field hospital in Ukraine. He's appeared on . Here, he casually announces that he has ordered the castration of captured Russian soldiers. Watch. ‘ ’ - : I have instructed my doctors. I have always been a great humanist and said that as soon as a person is wounded, he is no longer an enemy, but a patient. But now, a very strict instruction is to castrate all men because they are cockroaches, not people. Cockroaches, not people. Now again, that doesn't mean the broader Ukrainian cause is unjust. It is just. They were invaded. They have a right to fight back and expel the Russians from their country and for the fifth time, we're rooting for that. But we're paying for this. So, we have a right to know exactly what's happening. We have an absolute right to know. In fact, we have a constitutional right to free media. We don't have that. That video, by the way, disappeared. People on the internet managed to get a copy of it. You may hear it dismissed as Russian propaganda, just like Hunter Biden's laptop was or the 2016 presidential election results in this country were, but it's not Russian propaganda. It's real. The man you just saw speaking has confirmed the video is authentic. He apologized for it. So murdering s is a war crime, so is castrating them. We're not shocked by this. This happens that a lot of countries. Ukraine is not unique. Atrocities happen during war, every war, always, no matter what the neo cons may tell you, but this is a war that we are paying for. This is a war with moral implications. This is a war the White House is involved in at every level. So, when the Ukrainian government does something, we have an interest in knowing exactly what it is and what it means, but more than anything, we have an overriding interest and a moral obligation to keep the United States free. So, when you see them admire someone who's shutting down any opposition to him, you should pause.",0

The 94th Academy Awards are right around the corner, and co-host Amy Schumer said she pitched an idea to producers for the show that involved an appearance by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""I think there is definitely pressure in one way to be like, ‘This is a vacation. Let people forget. We just want to have this night,’ but it is like, ‘Well we have so many eyes and ears on this show,’"" Schumer told daytime talk show host Drew Barrymore on an upcoming episode.

Although Russia isn’t a leading market for Hollywood, it was one of the top six box office markets worldwide in revenue in 2021, according to Statista. And over the years, celebs have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin while visiting the country for events, like professional fights and concerts. Here’s a look at some celebs who either once hobnobbed or briefly met with Putin. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Mickey Rourke recalled meeting Putin when Rourke had a ""professional fight four years ago"" in Russia. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Mickey Rourke recalled meeting Putin when Rourke had a ""professional fight four years ago"" in Russia. Rourke is pictured here in 2014. ""I had the time of my life,"" Rourke told Fox News Digital about visiting the country. ""The people couldn't have been nicer, more polite, more respectful. I actually went with Putin. He took us to a very famous museum in St. Petersburg."" Rourke said he also visited a children's cancer hospital. ""And we went in there and visited the really, really sick, little, tiny, tiny kids,"" Rourke recalled. ""And, you know, I looked over at him and I saw him and — nobody's going to want to hear this — but I saw a man with empathy and who was really moved by what these children are going through."" Now Rourke, who once wore a shirt with Putin's face on it and reportedly spoke kindly about him at the time, feels differently, calling what's happening in Ukraine a ""nightmare kind of scenario."" ""Then now there's this whole other thing that's happening,"" the former boxer said, noting that he prays to God that Putin will end the war. ""When I pray at night, I pray, 'Please God, … let him find something inside his soul to just say, 'Okay, that's it,''"" Rourke said. Leonardo DiCaprio was once photographed alongside Putin after the two attended the International Tiger Conservation Forum at the Mikhailovsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg in 2010. A Putin speaks with Leonardo DiCaprio Nov. 23, 2010, after a concert to mark the International Tiger Conservation Forum at the Mikhailovsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. In the wake of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, DiCaprio donated to humanitarian groups , International Rescue Committee, the United Nation's High Commissioner for Refugees and Save the Children in support of Ukraine, a person close to DiCaprio said. However, no dollar amounts were provided. The actor further shared resources Friday on his personal Instagram account. ""The victims of warfare in Ukraine have lost everything from their loved ones to basic materials for survival,"" he wrote, alongside photos from Ukraine. ""Humanitarian organizations like @SavetheChildren @careorg @rescueorg and @refugees are on the ground, dedicating their personnel and resources to support families and innocent people."" Film director Oliver Stone, who previously worked with the Russian president for the documentary ""The Putin Interviews,"" told ’s Robert Scheer in early February that the United States media had ""no proof"" that Russia intended to invade Ukraine. Stone was proven wrong when Putin launched his attack on Feb. 24, and Stone subsequently made a statement condemning Russia's ""aggression."" In this picture taken June 19, 2019, film director Oliver Stone interviews Putin in Moscow. ""Although the United States has many wars of aggression on its conscience, it doesn’t justify Mr. Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. A dozen wrongs don’t make a right. Russia was wrong to invade,"" Stone said. Gerard Depardieu, a reported friend of Putin, has taken a stance against the Russia-Ukraine war. The French actor became a Russian citizen in 2013 to avoid taxes, according to The New York Times. In a letter to Russian state television he wrote, ""I love your president, Vladimir Putin, very much, and it’s mutual."" Before Putin launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine, Depardieu went on French television to say, ""Leave Vladimir alone."" This photo taken Jan. 5, 2013, shows Russian President Vladimir Putin greeting French actor Gerard Depardieu during their meeting in Putin's home in Sochi. Once the war began, the French actor denounced it but didn't call out Putin specifically.

""I say, ‘Stop the weapons and negotiate.’"" Steven Seagal was granted Russian citizenship in 2016 and, prior to the war, had publicly praised Putin. The 69-year-old American actor once called Putin ""one of the world’s greatest living leaders"" but has since tempered his support for the Russian president. ""I look at Russia and Ukraine as one family and really believe it is an outside entity spending huge sums of money on propaganda to provoke the two countries to be at odds with each other,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""My prayers are that both countries will come to a positive, peaceful resolution where we can live and thrive together in peace,"" Seagal added. Paul McCartney met with Putin at the Kremlin May 24, 2003, in Moscow as he prepared for a concert on Red Square. The Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted the Beatles star to share a photo of himself performing in Kyiv in 2008. ""Remembering playing for our friends in Ukraine in Independence Square in 2008 and thinking of them in these difficult times,"" the musician shared on his official website. ""We send our love and support."" Putin listens to musician Sir Paul McCartney during their meeting at the Kremlin May 24, 2003, in Moscow. McCartney also shared links to resources providing support to Ukraine. Although there are no photos of Putin and Jane Fonda together, the actress previously claimed that the now-Russian president was once her tour guide. ""This guy,"" Fonda said during a 2020 interview with Andy Cohen as she pointed to Putin on a screen, ""was our travel guide. When I was married to Ted Turner, and he was going to do his Goodwill Games in Leningrad. ""We landed at the airport, and the person who picked us up, and drove us around, was Vladimir Putin. He was the travel guide. He was like our interpreter at the time."" The actress recalled a moment during the trip when Putin refused to go meet his wife at the hospital. ""His wife had gotten sick, and she was heading to the hospital,"" Fonda said. ""He told us that in the car and Ted said, 'You have to go to the hospital. You have to go to the hospital to check on your wife,' and he wouldn't. Vladimir Putin wouldn't do it. He stayed with us."" She has not publicly commented on the Russia-Ukraine war. Fonda previously received backlash for posing with an anti-aircraft gun in Hanoi, Vietnam, during the Vietnam War. The actress was nicknamed ""Hanoi Jane"" and accused of treason. American actress and antiwar activist Jane Fonda pictured during her 1972 Vietnam trip looking through the scope of an anti-aircraft gun during her tour of the North Vietnamese capital. ""I am proud I went to Vietnam when I did,"" she said during the Television Critics Associations Summer Press Tour in 2018.

Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Before Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in an effort to form an agreement amid the Russia-Ukraine war, Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., stressed on ""America's Newsroom"" Monday that the West must not fear provoking Putin. Gallagher explained what he hopes President Biden accomplishes on his trip to Poland this week. ; : : Our job is to help Zelenskyy, who is doing a phenomenal job rallying support for Ukraine, by continuing the supply of lethal assistance despite Putin’s threat. I would also like the president to iron out the Polish MiG 29 fiasco, as well as find a way to take Slovakia up on its offer to provide Russian-made S-300s to Ukraine. While we should be wary of escalation, we can’t allow the continual fear of escalation to dominate our thinking. I think that’s why we got into this mess in the first place because of the continual fear of provoking Putin, whether it was the administration’s delay for over a year of providing lethal assistance, the Biden administration’s unwillingness to impose sanctions, or the MiG fiasco. We’re continually behind the curve because we are afraid of provoking Putin and it is time we make Putin fear what we’re willing to do in defense of Ukraine. Put differently, the best way to avoid world war three is by strengthening our military deterrent and by investing in hard power and I hope I hear that message from President Biden.",9

The U.S. must learn from its failed attempts to deter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and refine its approach if it hopes to avoid similar Chinese aggression against Taiwan, experts told Fox News Digital. Matthew McInnis from the Institute for the Study of War stressed that any sanctions will not prove effective unless they're accompanied by a ""full-spectrum campaign"" that includes the threat of use of force, effective political and diplomatic maneuvers, information sharing and increased weapons supplies. ""Economic sanctions simply do not work on their own,"" McInnis said, citing his experience managing maximum pressure campaigns for the State Department. : Some critics say that the U.S. showed China – through its response to Russia – what to expect should China increase its aggression against Taiwan, but experts argue that the U.S. also got to see what worked and has an opportunity to refine its approach. In this Nov. 24, 2018, file photo, supporters of the opposition Nationalist Party cheer in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. ""We did a great job of exposing the intelligence, the planning that Putin was doing, which obviously in a Taiwan scenario is going to be very critical about what we know and how we share what we know,"" McInnis explained, but he continued to press the need to make clear how far the U.S. and allies will go to deter China. ""The other issues is … it’s very clear that increased air defense capabilities and anti-armor – the things that have proven to be so effective for the Ukrainian forces – I think we need to take a little more risk in upping the air defense and anti-armor and anti-drone capabilities in a potential Taiwan scenario,"" he added. James Anderson, former undersecretary of defense for policy under former President Trump, also underscored the need to bolster Taiwan’s capabilities in the same way that allies did with Ukraine ahead of Russia’s invasion. ""If we’re talking about Taiwan, there are a lot of capabilities that can and should be strengthened with respect to their ability to defend themselves,"" Anderson said. ""We’ve been working with them for a long time, via the Taiwan Relations Act … we ought to be thinking of ways to very robustly re-interpret the Relations Act and provide assistance to Taipei.""

Without ’s involvement, such assistance may prove difficult: Individual allies can provide assistance but will not likely match the level of investment that went into Ukraine.

""They want Taiwan, but it’s a little different from Russia, who has nothing but aggressive policies."" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with his Beijing counterpart to make clear the international attention to China’s actions, with sanctions against China on the table should it directly assist Russia. A White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the U.S. will continue ""efforts to shape the environment around China by building resilience and competitiveness at home, diversifying markets, limiting the impact of Beijing’s harmful practices, working with allies and partners, and using the full range of tools we have to defend American economic interests.""",5

The Biden administration has appeared cautious so as not to provoke a Russian response directly toward states, but that tact has been conversely criticized by Ukrainian officials who are calling for more specific assistance. Russian President Vladimir Putin ""He's not our national security adviser,"" Crenshaw told host Brian Kilmeade. ""President Trump on Fox News this morning [on Fox Business' ""Varney & Co.""] said the exact same thing.""

In a speech in New Hampshire on Monday, Christie asked ""do we want to send admiring words to someone [Putin] who as we speak this morning is directing the slaughter of women and children in the Ukraine without any conscience?"" And the former two-term Republican governor emphasized that ""words matter everybody. Words matter. And those words from people of our party who called him [Putin] ‘genius’ and ‘very savvy’ are being replayed over and over again in Russian television to justify and prop up a dictator who is sending his soldiers to slaughter in Ukraine.""

The speaking series at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College over the past two decades has become a must stop for White House hopefuls visiting the state that for a century’s held the first primary in the presidential nominating calendar. And in a national exclusive interview with Fox News minutes after the event, Christie was even more blunt regarding Trump’s comments. 'S - ""I think those remarks are dangerous. They’re not just wrong, they’re dangerous,"" Christie stressed. And he said that Trump’s comments on Putin would likely come up if the former president runs for the White House again, noting ""everything that we do in our public lives is fodder for potential campaigns. It’s an adult sport and you’ve got to be ready to deal with and defend or apologize for what you’ve said in the past."" Trump created a firestorm last month with his comments on Putin. And a few days later at a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, Trump reemphasized his stance toward the Russian leader, telling the crowd that Putin was ""smart."" But Trump has also argued that he was ""tough"" on Putin during his four years in the White House and has repeatedly claimed that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if he were still president. In recent weeks the former president’s also described the horrific pictures of Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians as a ""holocaust."" , ‘’ Christie isn’t the only high-profile Republican politician who’s considering a 2024 White House run to criticize Trump over his Putin comments. Former Vice President Mike Pence earlier this month made headlines when he told a Republican National Committee gathering of top donors in New Orleans that ""there is no room in this party for apologists for Putin. There is only room for champions of freedom."" Christie, in his speech, also took aim at fellow Republicans who in the past have questioned the continued need for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the decades old military alliance between the U.S. and numerous European nations. ""For those who said that was an antiquated organization that we should consider pulling out of, I wonder what those same leaders are thinking today, as has brought the entire world together to put sanctions on Russia on a way that has almost never been done in the history of the world."" The former governor, who’s known as one of his party’s best communicators, also repeatedly targeted President Biden over the Russian attack on Ukraine and over the administration’s energy policy. 2021: 2024 Christie charged that ""when Joe Biden decided to stop arming the Ukrainians in January of 2021 when he entered office, that was a huge mistake, because it was a signal to Putin that we don’t care.""

He also offered that ""Joe Biden just doesn’t intimidate anyone. Does anybody in this room look at President Biden and say ‘don’t mess with him.’ I mean that matters everybody."" Christie, a vocal critic of the president on the Sunday talk shows, also claimed that the nation’s energy policy under Biden ""is a national embarrassment."" ""Under the last administration we had energy independence in this country, and we have given it away,"" the former governor charged. ""We need towards energy independence that includes a large portion of alternative energy, but only when our technology is there and developed. Should we continue to invest in it as a country – absolutely. It’s smart to do that. But it is stupid, flat out stupid, to abandon fossil fuels when you’re not there yet."" Christie also said ""I can’t imagine"" the 79-year-old Biden running for reelection in 2024. ""I don’t see it. I don’t think he’ll be up for it."" 'T 2024: He predicted that the president will ""take a beating in the midterms. Everybody will start beating on him then, that he’s an ineffective leader of the party."" And he said it’s possible Biden announces at the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of 2023 that he’s not running for reelection. Trump remains very popular and influential with Republican voters and politicians, as he continues to play a kingmaker’s role in the and repeatedly teases a 2024 run. But Christie predicted that Trump will have rivals for the nomination if he ends up running. ""No one is going to give the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 away without competition. It’s just not going to happen. And it shouldn’t happen. Nobody has earned a pass in my opinion."" But he cautioned that ""if they’re going to get into a primary fight with Donald Trump, they better be ready, because it will not be Tiddlywinks, it will not be softball, it will be hardball."" Christie - who after his own 2016 presidential campaign crashed and burned following a six-place finish in the New Hampshire primary became the first of the contenders to endorse Trump - noted that ""I was the first mainstream person in my party to endorse Trump."" - And he spotlighted that ""I’m someone who has supported the president and former president and many of the polices that he fought for when he was president."" But pointing to Trump’s repeated unfounded claims that the 2020 election was ""rigged"" and riddled with ""massive voter fraud,"" he emphasized that the former president’s ""dead wrong about the election. There is no evidence that the election was stolen. None. Not even stolen in one state, let alone the six states he would have needed to reverse the election."" - President Trump greets New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie after speaking about administration plans to combat the nation's opioid crisis in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Oct. 26, 2017 /Carlos Barria And Christie once again stressed that ""we need as a party to move forward. We can’t look backwards. We can’t be a party of vindictiveness and vendettas. We can’t be a party of settling scores."" But he noted that ""I can’t imagine a scenario under which there isn’t attempts at significant discussion and denial of 2020 during 2024 if he’s [Trump] in the race. So all these people now who say they might run for president and maybe do who are on the fence on that one, time to get off the fence. If you believe it was stolen, what are you doing here? Why are you running?"" Christie also took aim at some other potential 2024 contenders who’ve said they won’t run if Trump runs again. ""For those folks who say ‘I’m going to defer to someone else in running for president,’ I think that says everything about you as a potential candidate,"" Christie told Fox News. ""Because if you think you’re good enough to be president but you’re unwilling to run if someone else is running, in this instance Donald Trump, well then, I think you shouldn’t bother to run at all whether he runs or not."" Christie also said he’ll return to New Hampshire later this year to campaign for Matt Mowers, a former Christie campaign alum who later worked on the Trump 2016 campaign and served in the State Department during Trump’s administration who’s now running a second straight time for Congress in the Granite State. Asked about his own timeline for making a decision on a 2024 presidential run, Christie told Fox News he’ll ""make a decision sometime between the end of the year and the end of Q1 of 2023."" But during a revealing moment at his ‘Politics and Eggs’ appearance, Christie said ""my father turns 89 next month and he says he’s ready. If he’s ready, I may have a hard time saying no to him."" Throughout his speech and question and answer session with the audience of New Hampshire and Massachusetts business leaders, academics, and students, Christie highlighted a theme which in many ways was a veiled jab at Trump. ""We have to decide who we are and I think the fundamental question is are we going to have leaders who are for me or for us,"" Christie asked. He argued that ""when leaders are for me, then every decision is made through the prism of ‘what’s best for me.’ And then if that also works for us, great. That’s not who America should be in my view and that’s not who the Republican Party should be. We need to be for us, for the broader us.""",9
2022-03-22,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-war-ukraine-reveals-truth-news,Greg Gutfeld: The war in Ukraine reveals an old truth about news - if it bleeds it leads,"Greg Gutfeld says 'God help' those who deviate from mainstream media's preferred narrative. Now, one challenge of doing the news these days is not treating the war like every other story: As entertainment. Here we make the news entertaining, perhaps better than any show that ever came before it. Largely due to me. And that our competition over at is as fun as a case of crabs, and not the ones that are delicious with melted butter. But now we run headfirst into daily atrocity and I don't mean facing a hungover cat in the hallway. Ukraine is war, and it's ugly with grim imagery and relentless horror stories. But the news requires standard narratives, and if you veer off the beaten track, God help you. : Other issues demanded the same solemn treatment: , pandemic death tolls, a Kamala Harris speech. I mean, what about the significance of the passage of time? Am I right? : Yeah, the significance of the passage of time. Right. The significance of the passage of time. So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time … and there is such great significance to the passage of time. She is truly a national treasure. If by treasure, you mean embarrassment. But you know, bad news often becomes relentless news, and I get your mail and I get your tweets, so I understand. But the news dictates the mood. It's like those mass shootings. We stop everything to go live to the scene, and we repeat the same 90 seconds of information, mainly because it's all the information that we have available. It's not the reporter's fault, it's the unstoppable predictability of the editorial loop. So, it's the number of injured, dead location, city, shooter, repeat. Then comes the coverage of the coverage as the media turns into its usual circle of self-reflection. That's where I come in. That's my job. . See, I figure the news is really 30 minutes total, or the same time it takes Jimmy Fallia to steal a jacket from a homeless tramp. But like a Vegas casino, cable news never closes, which is why commentary rules. If it weren't for bozos like me, you would have a lot of silence. Refugees fleeing war in neighboring Ukraine board a train at the Medyka border crossing, Poland, Thursday, March 10, 2022. But when I was a kid, the news was like 30 minutes in the morning, a recap at lunch, another 30 during dinner unless something big happened like the Kennedy assassination, the moon landing or Marcia Brady going braless. Who could forget that? And life went on as usual. We played outside, got tuberculosis and shoveled snow year round. changed that. Now we have pretty much the same quantity of news, but we have to add a lot of hamburger helper to feed a family of 330 million. Or six Brian Stelter's. showed it was possible, and also showed us how it could destroy a country. Play the George Floyd video two times an hour for months, and you do more to undermine the fabric of a country than any foreign disinformation. Why look for good news when you can binge-watch home movies of the worst moments of your life? One news story becomes like a potato where you can figure out so many ways to prepare it. Au gratin, mashed, fried, but usually half-baked. First you report it, then you wonder how it affects the economy, the climate, the disadvantaged, the children, the economic climate for disadvantaged children, unless, of course, their father is Hunter Biden. : A 'S , Then you turn it back on the media, which is my specialty. As the media reports the story, what is the media actually saying? I mean, other than it's Trump's fault and you’re racist, sexist and homophobic. In media commentary, we're so high on the smell of our own farts, baked beans are an aphrodisiac. That is disgusting. But in war, we get serious as it gets ugly. We lose the theme music, we drop the cute segments. We come in with breaking news graphics. Now it's nearly a month of this nightly grim routine. Bomb strikes, rubble, refugees, the dead rinse and repeat. We can't do much else because none of us have any real insights, except maybe for Kilmeade. And that's only because his male pattern baldness is in the shape of Belarus. Sometimes in my job, I run across stories that seem too on the nose. So we use phrases like ""reportedly"" or ""some say,"" like the waitress who finds a racist note on a receipt or an actor beaten by Trump supporters at night, or the idiot son of a president losing his laptop somewhere. Well, that story turned out to be legit, which is why they tried to suffocate it, like Rosie O'Donnell sitting on a Chihuahua. There were others out of Ukraine. The phantom jet fighter downing Russian jets, sailors refusing to surrender. But the only thing real that we know of is the brutality. War is bad, and the longer it goes, the worse it gets. But sadly, it makes a great miniseries. It's the greatest show on Earth. If you're lucky enough to live here and binge-watch it like a Netflix offering. But most importantly, it revives the old truth about news. If it bleeds, it leads. But that just makes me wonder where it's leading me? I hope someplace else other than World War .

2022-03-23,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-voters-want-us-do-more-help-ukraine-against-russia,Fox News Poll: Voters want the US to do more to help Ukraine against Russia,"American voters are closely following news about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and want to help. By a 63-32% margin, voters think the U.S. should be doing more for Ukrainians in their fight against Russia. Fully 82% are concerned about the invasion and 76% approve of how Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is responding to it. The new Fox News national survey also finds a growing portion say the Russia-Ukraine conflict matters to life in the United States: 85% feel that way, up from 76% last month. It’s an issue Democrats and Republicans largely agree on: 90% of Democrats and 85% of Republicans think what happens in Ukraine makes a difference here at home, about 8 in 10 Democrats and Republicans approve of Zelenskyy, and two-thirds in each party want to do more for Ukraine. What do voters mean when they say the U.S. should do more? Large majorities favor continuing strict economic sanctions on Russia and providing additional military equipment to Ukraine . Smaller numbers, although still majorities, favor easing immigration requirements to the U.S. for Ukrainian refugees , sending additional troops to nearby countries , and creating a no-fly zone over Ukraine . Voters stop short of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine, as twice as many oppose the idea as favor it . Here again, there’s generally bipartisan agreement on each of these potential actions -- although there is a partisan gap when it comes to easing immigration requirements for Ukrainian refugees. That’s favored by 77% of Democrats compared to 59% of Republicans. Support for additional action doesn’t mean voters aren’t concerned about the potential costs. Three-quarters worry that supporting Ukraine could result in war between the U.S. and Russia and that a U.S.-Russia conflict could lead to a nuclear war . Those concerns limit their desire to help. While 78% favor providing Ukraine more equipment -- support for giving ""substantial military aid"" stands at only 36% if it risks U.S. war with Russia. And even as 80% favor economic sanctions against Russia, that falls to 44% if sanctions lead to higher prices and financial hardship for Americans. One month into the Russian invasion, many voters continue to lack confidence in President Biden’s judgment in a crisis , and over half disapprove of both his handling of Russia and his response to the invasion . Despite mostly bipartisan support on policies to respond to Russia, there’s little unity on Biden’s ratings. Democrats are four times as likely as Republicans to approve of his response to the invasion . ""Biden’s actions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are mostly in-line with voter preferences,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson whose company Beacon Research conducts the Fox News survey along with Republican pollster Daron Shaw. ""But in the face of inflation and entrenched partisanship at home, that’s not enough, at this point, to improve his overall standing in a meaningful way."" -: ‘ ’ ‘ ’ Currently, 45% of voters approve of Biden’s overall job performance, while 54% disapprove. Last month, it was 43-56%. That 2-point increase in approval comes from a doubling among Republicans to 15% -- up from 8% approval in February. Eighty-two percent of Democrats and 33% of independents approve. Among those who approve of Biden overall, 80% approve of his response to the invasion of Ukraine. Two-thirds disapprove of Biden’s handling of inflation -- his worst rating of the issues measured. About 6 in 10 disapprove of Biden on China , border security , and the economy . . Dealing with coronavirus is Biden’s only net positive rating: 50% approve vs. 48% disapprove. ""Some journalists and pundits have suggested Biden might receive a ratings boost because of what political scientists call the ‘rally around the flag’ effect,"" says Shaw. ""But the ‘rally’ effect occurs after a president commits U.S. forces to a conflict, and that isn’t in play here. Perceptions of Biden in this case are much more tied to whether voters think he is walking that fine line between being tough with Putin and not getting the U.S. into another war."" Veterans are more likely than other voters to approve of Zelenskyy , think the U.S. should be doing more for Ukraine , and favor sending more troops to nearby countries . They are less likely to favor creating a no-fly zone over Ukraine , and to think U.S. support could lead to war between the U.S. and Russia or nuclear war . Conducted March 18-21, 2022 under the joint direction of Beacon Research and Shaw & Company Research , this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,004 registered voters nationwide who were randomly selected from a national voter file and spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.

During an interview with Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the House Republican Issues Conference in Ponte Vedra, Florida, McCarthy, R-Calif., said Biden’s trip to Europe this week is ""too late."" : ""I think all of his actions have been too late,"" McCarthy told Fox News. ""His actions have created this problem – how he pulled out of Afghanistan, denying American pipeline but providing it to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin – I think it’s too late."" Biden is traveling to Brussels, Belgium, on Wednesday for a summit on March 24, and later to Poland to discuss international efforts to support Ukraine and punish Russia for its invasion. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy responds to reporters at the Capitol on Dec. 3, 2021. McCarthy told Fox News that European allies are ""trying to change their behavior."" ""Europe has united – not because of something Biden has done, but because of what Putin has done,"" McCarthy said. ""They’re looking for some leadership and, unfortunately, they’re not getting it from Biden."" ' ' The president, this week, warned Americans and American businesses of ""evolving intelligence"" to suggest that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks against the United States, and urged the private sector to ""immediately"" harden its ""cyber defenses."" ' ' ""He warns American businesses that you're going to be attacked, instead of telling Putin you’re not going to attack us,"" McCarthy said. ""I mean, that is a sign of weakness. That is making America more vulnerable."" President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the debt ceiling during an event at the White House on Oct. 4, 2021. He added: ""Do not warn us. Stop it."" ""That weakness is inviting America to be attacked,"" McCarthy said. McCarthy, though, praised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying he is ""showing what leadership looks like."" ""The problem is, Biden has fewer options today than he had before,"" McCarthy said. McCarthy, detailing a conversation he had with Biden before Putin invaded Ukraine, told Fox News that retroactive sanctions would not be effective. ""I told him, if you’re only offering sanctions after he enters, it will not work with Putin, because he has lived with sanctions, and he doesn't care,"" McCarthy said. McCarthy also said he recommended that Biden ""send more weapons to Ukraine"" ahead of Putin's invasion. ""You can’t do it in the middle of a conflict,"" McCarthy said. ""Send the MiGs from Poland now, even if you think it won’t work,"" McCarthy said, adding that it is ""psychological"" for Putin. President Vladimir Putin speaks on Oct. 21, 2021, in Sochi, Russia. Last week, after repeated pleas from Zelenskyy for the United States and Western allies to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine, Biden approved an additional $800 million in military aid for the country – on top of the $200 million in funding provided earlier this month. Biden said the package would include 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 2,000 Javelins, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, 6,000 -4 anti-armor systems, 100 unmanned drones, 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, 400 shotguns, more than 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds, 25,000 sets of body armor, and 25,000 helmets. - , , ' ' Biden said the equipment will be transferred directly from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military. As for Biden’s trip to Europe this week, McCarthy took a swipe at Vice President Kamala Harris, who traveled to Poland and Romania earlier this month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks to the U.S. Congress by video to plead for support as his country is besieged by Russian forces, at the Capitol in Washington. ""I hope Biden does not laugh like Harris did on a serious issue,"" McCarthy said, referring to Harris' joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda when she was asked whether the United States would make special accommodations for Ukrainian refugees. Harris did not answer the question, but turned toward Duda and said, ""A friend in need is a friend indeed,"" before laughing for several seconds. Duda eventually capitulated and answered the question, saying he had asked Harris to help speed the process of Ukrainian refugees obtaining U.S. visas in order to stay with family in the States. ""I hope Biden shows leadership – he can’t just go there and listen,"" McCarthy said. ""He needs to have a plan. He needs to unite people and he needs to confront."" ""Biden is allowing Putin to dictate what is right and wrong,"" McCarthy said. He added: ""Look, Ukraine doesn’t ask for any American men or women to enter the country – all they want is the weapons to be able to win themselves."" ""Supply that, unite the other countries, unite the entire world"" against Putin, McCarthy said. ""Put the pressure on him so that he wants to stop this – to stop murdering children.""",9
2022-03-23,https://www.foxnews.com/world/two-war-doctrine-obama-pentagon-russia-taiwan-ukraine-china,"Obama axing Cold War-era military policy leaves US unable to battle in two, simultaneous regional conflicts","Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane on how Russia's struggles in Ukraine could affect a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan. After the Obama administration ended the Pentagon's ""two-war"" doctrine in 2012, the United States shifted to only likely being capable of battling one major regional conflict, not two simultaneously. A decade later, the U.S. could face the issue of having to choose whether to get involved with a potential war in Ukraine or Taiwan. ""It means we can’t do both,"" Dakota Wood, senior research fellow for Defense Programs at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital in a phone interview when asked if the U.S. would hypothetically be able to fight in both Ukraine and Taiwan. Former President Barack Obama and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced a new strategy in January 2012 that ended the Cold War-era ""two-war"" planning construct. Former President Obama speaks at a rally for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in Flint, Michigan, on Oct. 31, 2020. The two-war doctrine established that the U.S. should be capable of fighting two major regional conflicts simultaneously, and guided military planners through the Korean and Vietnam wars, as well as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11. ""When the Obama team came in, they had a very specific … agenda. It was very domestically focused, and their worldview was such that nearly all problems can be resolved diplomatically via trade,"" Wood said. ""The perception was you just didn't need a big U.S. military."" ’S Wood explained that the Obama administration wanted to establish that it’s ""not really a two-war world"" anymore, and to instead have a military that could handle one major crisis while balancing smaller ""pop-up sort of crises or to maintain a presence."" Obama said at the time that the U.S. military would become ""leaner"" but would maintain its ""military superiority with armed forces that are agile, flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats."" The military has in fact become leaner, with the number of Naval ships shrinking from about 570 in the late 1980s to 296 ships today, according to Wood. U.S. lawmakers have warned this month that ""World War "" could be sparked in Europe if the U.S. gets directly involved with Russian forces invading Ukraine. While in Asia, the threat of China invading Taiwan looms large. Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to Russia, June,5, 2019, and Russian President Vladimir Putin speaking in Moscow, June,5, 2019. A - ? Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy has called on U.S. and foreign leaders repeatedly to impose a no-fly zone over the country. His appeals, however, have so far been rejected by the U.S. The U.S. adheres to a policy reaching back to the Cold War of not having direct, kinetic engagement with Russia. A no-fly zone would risk a direct military conflict with the country, and has the potential of escalating to a third world war, pitting nuclear power countries such as the U.S., France and the U.K. against fellow nuclear power Russia. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine meanwhile has Taiwan on high alert that China could invade. China views Taiwan, which sits off the coast of mainland China, as a breakaway province that will one day be a part of the country. Taiwan operates as an independent country. ’S 'S A : Thousands of U.S. soldiers are reportedly headed toward Australia as tensions with China grow. Roughly a thousand Marines have already landed in the Northern Territory city of Darwin, which sits just south from a handful of Asian countries, the Daily Mail reported. Wood said that if the U.S. were to hypothetically get involved with the two potential wars, ""national leadership would have to decide which theater is more important."" Hong Kong students and Taiwanese supporters hold slogans during a march in Taipei, Taiwan, Sunday, Sept. 29, 2019. ""In a Taiwan scenario, we have no treaty obligation to come to Taiwan's rescue. There was the Taiwan Relations Act that was intentionally written rather ambiguous, that the U.S. supports diplomatic solutions to resolve the condition that exists between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China,"" Wood said. ""If we got involved in Ukraine, it's basically all-in. We have a much more robust, in some ways, relationship economically, culturally, historically with Europe than we do with Taiwan,"" he said. Former President Donald Trump, who increased the military spending budget and created the first new military branch in 72 years, did not revive the two-war doctrine. Wood said that the two-war doctrine is likely not prevalently being discussed due to it being financially cumbersome, but also because of its emotional implications.",22
2022-03-23,https://www.foxnews.com/world/india-china-un-resolution-appease-russia,"India, facing China concerns, abstained from UN resolution to appease Russia: foreign policy expert","India abstained from voting on a United Nations Security Council resolution demanding Russia withdraw its troops from Ukraine largely because of its concern over China, a foreign policy scholar told Fox News. ""India's primary concern is about its rivalry with China,"" a fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, Zongyuan Zoe Liu, said. ""India has a growing concern about China's rising influence, not just in the Indo-Pacific region, but also in the Middle East, which is another area where it has significant interest."" India, while continuing its nonalignment policy, is straddling efforts to appease Russia to prevent it from moving closer to China, while simultaneously trying to keep the U.S. as an ally for security in the region, according to Liu. ""In many ways, India's abstain from the U.N. security vote does not necessarily speak so much about India's concern over Russia and Russia's military action against Ukraine, but really speaks to India's own strategic calculation,"" Liu told Fox News. Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, right, and Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, pose for photographs as Putin arrives at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India, on Monday, Dec. 6, 2021. ‘ ’ ""India is sticking with nonalignment policy in many ways,"" she continued. ""It's frustrating from our perspective."" India has relied on both the U.S. and Russia, according to Liu. Russia has provided 60% of India’s military equipment and has historically been an ally, while the U.S. has been a partner in both trade and security in the Indo-Pacific region. China has been building troops on the border with India for years, and the two nations have clashed on several occasions. Four Chinese soldiers and 20 Indians died in a 2020 skirmish. Officers and soldiers conduct training in Southwest Guizhou, Guizhou Province, China, Feb. 22, 2022. As a result, India is aiming to ensure that Russia will continue selling it arms while maintaining its relationship with the U.S. to ensure its presence in the region. ""India probably does not want to do things that would drive Russia to further support China and which might risk India's strategic security in the region,"" Liu said. ""In terms of India's openly supporting Russia or helping Russia avoid the sanctions, I personally don't necessarily think that that is going to be in India's interest."" The U.S. and other Western nations imposed heavy sanctions against Russia after it invaded Ukraine in late February. Countries that help Moscow avoid the penalties could face secondary sanctions – a punishment India wants to avoid, according to Liu. Border Security Force personnel display weapons during an exhibition as a part of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav programme, on March 10, 2022 in Srinagar, India. Meanwhile, from an economic standpoint, India wants to expand beyond Western markets and reliance on the dollar – a position both Russia and China hold, as well. ""Given that our policymakers here in the United States tend to use sanctions against foreign actors or foreign entities, the weaponization of the U.S. dollar and the dollar-based global financial system tend to make people think about 'well, we probably want to hedge against the dollar hegemon,'"" Liu told Fox News. India ""for a long period of time"" has expressed ""dissatisfaction towards the Western-led or American-led global system,"" Liu added.

President Biden had a secure video call with Chinese President Xi last week for nearly two hours in which he warned of the ""consequences"" should China ""provide material support"" to Russia amid its multifront war on Ukraine. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who met with his Chinese counterpart in Rome last week ahead of Biden and Xi’s meeting, said that the administration ""has not seen"" the ""provision of military equipment by China to Russia"" in the days since Biden’s meeting. ""But of course, this is something we are monitoring closely,"" Sullivan said Tuesday. ""We will continue to monitor it."" As for whether China wants to aid Russia in its war on Ukraine, McCaul said he believes Beijing is ""trying to find the way."" China President Xi Jinping addresses the press after a working meeting at the Olivos Presidential residence in Olivos, Buenos Aires, Dec. 2, 2018. ""Deception is always a model in China,"" McCaul said. ""They are trying to find a way to help their ally next door without being too over the top and get the retribution."" McCaul said that the ""difference"" between China and Russia is the United States is ""so dependent on supply chain."" ""Whether it be semiconductors, medical, rare earth minerals — our economies are too intertwined, that going after China with similar sanctions we are with Russia will be far more difficult to achieve,"" McCaul told Fox News. : He also warned that China has its own ""digital currency"" that he said ""could lead to cryptocurrency where they could evade sanctions."" After Biden’s call with Xi on Friday, senior administration officials maintained that U.S. policy toward Taiwan ""has not changed"" and emphasized that the United States continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo."" McCaul told Fox News that Xi has ""always wanted Taiwan"" and Putin ""has always wanted Ukraine."" ""I hope that Chairman Xi looks at the difficulties that Russia is having — maybe it is not such a great idea,"" McCaul said. ""However, I worry because China’s capabilities far outweigh Taiwan’s, that we need to learn from the lessons and mistakes we made in Ukraine and start heavily arming Taiwan."" ' ' 'S '' , McCaul suggested the United States provide Taiwan with ""asymmetric weapons and anti-aircraft to stop any potential invasion."" ""Because, I guarantee, Chairman Xi is looking at this right now, in terms of making his calculation as to whether his next move will be to invade Taiwan,"" McCaul said. ""I know that Xi is looking at what is happening in Ukraine and learning how best he is going to do this.""",5

Now he and better figure that out fast, considering they're the ones that keep telling us this can happen.

The rest of the world has waited for this moment for over 30 years. Laura Ingraham explained Thursday how President Biden is doing an ""embarrassing"" job of handling the conflict in the Ukraine on ""The Ingraham Angle."" : As the war in Ukraine grinds on, gas prices skyrocket — a global food shortage looming, Joe Biden had no answers. And like his Supreme Court nominee at her confirmation hearing [this] last week, he gave a lot of non-answers to important questions, like when he was pressed on the upshot of his recent phone call with China's President Xi. … ‘’ Translation: ""Let the handle it. They'll handle Xi. I couldn't get anywhere with the guy."" I mean, how embarrassing. Biden obviously couldn't get Xi to agree to anything regarding Russia, so now we're relying on the Europeans to figure things out. Good luck with that. Now, world leaders, especially our adversaries, listen intently to what an American president has to say. And Biden said several things today that were absurd on their face. President Biden. /Evelyn Hockstein … Even The Washington Post had to concede that is far from being unified. And France obviously didn't get that unity memo either. Despite Biden's call to isolate Putin economically, major French companies have just announced that they're not cutting off their business operations in Russia at all. Now, perhaps this is why Biden is singing a different tune on the power of sanctions. … Inconsistency is the only consistent theme of this administration at this point. Now Biden has made it clear that he's content to let other nations lead on Ukraine, on energy, and pretty much everything else. But when all else fails, and all else is failing with Biden, Old Joe returns to his greatest hits: Trump and Charlottesville. … This framing has been debunked so many times, it's not even worth addressing it again. But Biden didn't stop there, using a foreign reporter's question to once again tee off on the United States while standing abroad. … Even for Biden, this is a new low — giving the impression that America is filled with torch-carrying Nazis ready at any moment to storm the Capitol. Why would you want the president of the United States of that America to lead the way on anything? They wouldn't.",0

The five-page document, as reported by Politico, was titled ""The Cruz Bill is Designed to Undermine the Unity of our Allies, not Punish Russia."" The memo was sent to Senate Democrats in an effort to sway the outcome of a vote by the Senate on a bill that would have imposed swift sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, a measure introduced by Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. In the document, under a section headed ""2 Sanctions are Credible leverage over Russia,"" the Biden State Department wrote that the ""deterrent potential of sanctions/shutting down the pipeline would be lost"" if sanctions were to be applied at the time to the pipeline which spans from Russia to Germany. The sentiment offered in that memo from Biden's State Department earlier this year differs immensely from comments made Thursday by Biden during a press conference at a summit in Brussels, Belgium. Biden now claims sanctions ""never deter."" ""Let’s get something straight. You remember if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter,"" Biden said in response to a question from reporter Christina Ruffini. Ruffini repeated the question, asking whether these actions could make Putin change course. President Joe Biden addresses at the European Union summit at the Headquarters, one day to the month of Russia's invasion of the Ukraine, in Brussels on March 24, 2022. ""That’s not what I said. You’re playing a game with me. The answer’s no,"" Biden snapped back. Biden instead suggested that the best way to push back against Putin's actions was to ensure a strong, unified Western alliance. ""The maintenance of sanctions, increasing the pain and the demonstration [is] why I asked for this meeting today, is to be sure that after a month, we will sustain what we're doing, not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year,"" Biden said.

Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, joins ‘Hannity’ Sean Hannity pressed former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard on her stance on the war in Ukraine Thursday, saying he is a supporter of the Reagan and Trump doctrines. Gabbard, a 2020 presidential candidate and U.S. military reservist, said the Ukrainians cannot win their unwitting war against the Kremlin and its autocrat Vladimir Putin, while Hannity maintained that the West has a responsibility – though not through direct troop involvement – to supply victimized nations with assistance. ""I am a supporter of the Reagan Doctrine and the Trump Doctrine. The Reagan Doctrine was [borne out through] providing Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen when the Soviets invaded in the 80s -- they were successful. They pushed the Soviets out, supporting the Nicaraguan freedom-fighting Contras over the Sandinistas and [dictator] Daniel Ortega,"" he said.

""Those are tactics to accomplish what and the ‘what’ is really the central question here that needs to be answered -- what is our objective? What is the objective of the United States?"" ""What actions and objectives best serves the interests of the American people? That's the question.

""Any time you look at so many of our foreign policy disasters in the past, we see they have come about because our leaders have failed to outline what is it exactly we are trying to achieve and how does it best serve the interests of the American people,"" she said. ""You've got to know what we're trying to accomplish, which is an end to this war,"" Gabbard later continued.

2022-03-24,https://www.foxnews.com/us/russian-ukraine-spy-soviet-union-kgb-agent-trained-double-agents,"Jack Barsky: What a Russian spy's job might look like now, from one of the KGB's 'best-trained' double agents","Jack Barsky, a former agent, joined 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss modern-day espionage and his experience as a former spy. Jack Barsky joined a pre-arranged Friday morning Zoom meeting 18 minutes before it was scheduled to begin. Wearing a navy blue, long-sleeved sweater with a white, collared shirt underneath, he appeared the everyday gentleman – an all-American father, possibly a grandfather – as he sat with his arms folded in front of a pre-set background of the Hudson River as the interview began. ""So, literally what's going on in the world right now with Ukraine? That's exactly what [illegal spies] were created for."" Barsky, now a 74-year-old author and public speaker, lives a life that appears to be that of a typical American citizen. But his life and his story are anything but typical. : Barsky was born Albrecht Dittrich before he was recruited by the now-defunct , which later became the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation . He was trained and groomed for years before he spent a decade living a double life as a Russian spy in New York City. ""I wound up to be one of the best-trained agents they ever sent to the United States,"" he told Fox News Digital. This undated photo shows Jack Barsky with his mother when she visited him in Moscow while he was training to become a agent. Albrecht Dittrich was born in Germany in 1949. He was raised in a part of the country that became the German Democratic Republic – known as ""East Germany"" – a vassal state dominated by the Soviet Union. ""I grew up as a good little communist,"" Barsky told Fox News Digital. ""From my right side, this short fellow in a black trench coat, he comes really close. And then he whispers in my ear: 'You gotta come home or else you're dead.'"" Given the Stasi’s – the secret police’s – practice of keeping records on all of East Germany’s residents, Dittrich’s good grades and allegiance to the communist party caught the attention of the not long after he entered the workforce. He spent a year and a half communicating informally with recruiters before he flew to the and Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin and met with the head of the security agency. ""Out of the blue, he asked me: ‘So what? Can we count on you?’"" he recalled of his meeting with the top-ranked official. A Russian /Stasi helmet in front of Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, just two days ahead of the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Nov. 7, 2019, in Berlin, Germany. Dittrich was given until noontime the next day to provide a final answer. ""I thought it through, I said, it is an opportunity to help the world revolution, to free some of the suppressed folks in the Western countries to have the good life,"" he said with a chuckle. ""I said yes. I had no idea what I really signed up for."" '' : A ' ' Five years later, he said, ""I showed up in the United States."" The gravesite for Jack Barsky, the 10-year-old boy who died in Maryland and whose identity Albrecht Dittrich ultimately assumed. Dittrich underwent two years of basic training before he was sent to Moscow for another two and a half years. There, the emphasis was not only on honing in on his spycraft skills, but being able to speak English so well that only a glint of an accent was evident. When his handlers determined he was ready, Dittrich said goodbye to his mother, his wife and their young child, and left behind his life in Germany. From there, he took ""a long zigzag trip through Europe with multiple forged passports"" – and varied which documents he used to prevent traceability. He entered the U.S. in Chicago and made his way to New York City, ditching the bogus passports along the way. ""In the fall of 1978, I showed up in the United States,"" he said. ""The only documentation I had was a certified copy of a birth certificate in the name of Jack Barsky."" Dittrich took on the identity of Jack Philip Barsky, a 10-year-old boy who died in Maryland in September 1955. The mother of the original Jack Barsky bore the maiden name Schwartz, which Dittrich’s handlers preferred because of the surname’s presumed German or Jewish-German roots, Barsky said. He used it as a way to explain away any remnants of a German accent, and told anyone who questioned him he was born into a bilingual household in Orange, New Jersey. From then on, Albrecht Dittrich was someone from a past life – a life that was revisited only once every two years, when Barsky was granted a trip back home. But despite the fact that the actual Jack Barsky was not around to interfere, becoming the new Barsky ""wasn’t easy."" ""I tried once to get one birth certificate and that failed, because the office that issued the birth certificates also cross-referenced death certificates, and I wound up asking for the copy of my birth certificate after I died,"" he recalled. His second attempt was successful, but he wasn’t yet out of the woods. One Madison Avenue, Manhattan, New York He then covered himself in dirt and played the character of a farmworker, because the farm industry was exempt from Social Security requirements at the time, when he went to the Social Security office to get the necessary documentation. ""I made myself into somebody who had just jumped off the potato truck. I rubbed soap into my eyes to make them red, I had stubble on my face, the hair wasn’t really combed well, dirty T-shirt,"" he said. ""Two weeks later, I got the Social Security card in the mail, and I was allowed to actually legally work in the United States."" Barsky moved to New York City’s Upper East Side, but avoided almost any social interaction for about a year, until he had all his necessary documentation. His first job was working as a bike messenger, which he did for two and a half years. When he was on the road or interacting with customers – and even when he had downtime in the office – he absorbed everything. Barsky then went to college, and graduated from Baruch College as Class of 1984 valedictorian. By that point, he ""felt rather comfortable in my American skin,"" Barsky said. He took a job as a computer programmer for MetLife, working in the One Madison Avenue high-rise – all the while still secretly working for the and feeding his handlers any and all information. ""That's when I finally was on my way to become middle class, in the end, the upper middle-class person, at which point I would have become a much more dangerous agent,"" he said. ""But before that happened, I quit."" Jack Barsky with his mother, center, and his handler, named Sergej ""The first and foremost aspect of the mission of folks like us was just there, being in the U.S., being available,"" Barsky said. ""We were supposed to be on standby just in case,"" he added, referring to the possibility that diplomats in the U.S., most of whom were spies, were kicked out of the country. He added that he was sent to the U.S. with the goal of ""collecting information about foreign policy, getting close to foreign policy decision makers or influencers."" His handlers gave him names of people and organizations with whom they wanted him to get cozy, including the Hudson Institute, ""a conservative think tank,"" and Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security adviser under President Carter. ""That was a pipe dream,"" he said. ""I never got to a point where I was positioned in society to have a realistic explanation why I would want to befriend some of these people."" He also wrote periodic reports about how the American public was responding to world events and tried to make as many other connections as possible. ""The other thing that was important to them was for me to get to know as many people as possible – contacts, contacts, contacts, that’s what I heard a lot. And then profile them, analyze them, send profiles to Moscow for them to determine whether they would be good candidates for recruitment."" This undated photo shows Jack Barsky and his colleagues at MetLife. He said he was never told what happened with any of the people he reported, or if and how higher-ups used the information he shared. Barsky also spoke regularly to his handlers in Moscow, and communicated with them at least weekly via radio transmissions. In New York, he and his network communicated via signals in agreed-upon spots – a detail that becomes important later in Barsky’s story – and passed information using ""dead drops,"" a process that entails leaving items or documents in an agreed-upon spot for someone else to retrieve later. He was allowed to mail two letters with ""secret writings"" to his loved ones per month, he said. Asked if he recalled any moment where he thought, ""mission accomplished,"" Barsky told Fox News Digital even developments that might seem small – getting his Social Security card, safely returning to Moscow and East Germany every two years – were seen as big steps. Getting his job at MetLife, and even his gig as a bike messenger, were seen as accomplishments. ""I had achieved probably the impossible, because there were so many situations where it was at best, 50-50 for me to actually get through and not fail,"" he said. ""But again, this was a suicidal mission, quite frankly. And the fact that I actually established myself as an American, that was my, I believe, my biggest achievement."" This undated photo shows Jack Barsky and his infant daughter, Chelsea. Barsky realized he had to make a life-altering decision in December 1988, when the began sending messages urging him to ""get out."" By that point, he was married, in his mid-30s, and living in Queens with an 18-month-old daughter at home. ""There was a spot that we had arranged where agents could put some graphic signals. Very basic ... But the one that I remember the most is the red dot,"" he said. ""The spot was at a supporting pole for the elevated A-train, so as I walked up the stairs and I would look at that particular spot. There was never anything there that was just routine."" But that changed early one Monday morning as he was on his way to work. For the first time ever, he spotted a signal: a red dot. ""That red dot meant I was in danger,"" he explained. ""It was like, ‘Emergency!’ And I did nothing. I got on a train and went to work and stared at the computer screen for all day without doing anything."" The next message came during his regularly scheduled Thursday radio transmission. ""You got to get out. This is an emergency,"" the encrypted message stated, Barsky said. ""We have reason to believe that you're being investigated by the ."" But he doubted what he was being told. Having years of experience looking over his shoulder and taking countermeasures to assure he was not being followed, he wasn’t convinced. A commuter walks on the platform of the Woodside train station in the Queens borough of New York on Monday, Aug. 3, 2020. He chose not to respond to the radio transmission, despite Moscow’s request that he confirm that he received the message and understood his instructions. They repeated the radio transmission every day, he remembered. But ""the most dramatic moment in [his] entire life"" came roughly three weeks later, as he stood on the platform of a Queens subway station, still dark outside, around 6:30 a.m. or 7 a.m. ""From my right side, this short fellow in a black trench coat, he comes really close. And then he whispers in my ear: 'You gotta come home or else you're dead.'"" He said he had a choice: to take this as a serious threat against his life, or attribute the message to ""a lack of understanding of the English language"" or an exaggeration. He had made his decision: He would leave behind his life as a spy and would stay with his wife and his budding American family. Barsky did what he could to ensure that his family in Germany was safe, and sent them one final secret writing, in which he told them that the might be after him. He told them: ""I’m not coming home because I have and that I may have a chance for treatment."" He asked friends within the organization in Moscow to send his family the money he had earned through his work. They did so and ultimately told them that Dittrich had died from . His mother died in 1984, before she was able to learn the truth about her son. Barsky’s story is no secret anymore. Though it took time and years of investigation, the ultimately caught up to him, according to Barsky’s own details and interviews conducted in ""The Agent,"" a podcast about his life. To put the story simply, agents ultimately overheard via wiretap Barsky admitting to his wife that he had previously worked as a spy. They arrested him and confirmed that he was telling the truth and was no longer working for the . They then began working with him to better understand Russia’s secrets. The Jack Barskys of today – spies sent from the Soviet Union, Russia or other similarly situated nations – are few and far between, but ""they’re still around,"" former special agent Robin Dreeke told Fox News Digital. He estimated that there was only ""a handful"" of agents in the U.S. at one time. ""Jack is a great example of why there's not hundreds of them. Because they don't fulfill a huge function, and they take up a huge amount of resources and money,"" he continued. ""Basically, you're paying an employee and a lot of time and resources and money to do not a whole lot … their main role and function is to perform when an event happens that they need to activate them."" And today’s spies rarely have the level of training that he received. Dreeke, former head of the bureau’s Counterintelligence Behavioral Analysis Program, worked personally with Russian ""illegals"" – spies in the U.S. illegally and outside of diplomatic cover – during his time with the New York’s Russian Military Intelligence Squad from 1997 to 2005. Dreeke's unit tried to recruit Russian spies and then neutralize them to protect American interests, national security and allies. Barsky’s training was ""significantly higher"" than what the general illegal spy will get, Dreeke told Fox News Digital. ""Jack did a lot of one-on-one training, as a matter of fact, all of his training was one on one, very in-depth. And typically, they go through schools... people in large classrooms,"" he said. In addition to his ""in-depth,"" ""thorough"" training, Barsky’s level of communication with Moscow was ""much higher than normal,"" Dreeke said. His tasks, while not significantly different from those of the other spies, were ""unusual"" in comparison. ""The tasks he was given were really high tempo, operational-type stuff that generally, the actual intelligence officers will get, like him conducting those dead drops … that's pretty unusual for someone that's not legal,"" said Dreeke, who has since authored several books and founded a company, People Formula. Illegal spies, Dreeke explained, are typically placed inside the country ""for times just like this."" ""Russians put illegals inside our country during the Cold War in case whoever went to war, and all the diplomats were expelled, Russia could still collect intelligence and run their operatives inside the country because they have a network of illegals,"" he said. He added: ""So, literally what's going on in the world right now with Ukraine? That's exactly what illegals were created for: They were created to not just do penetrations of government institutions and organizations, but also to be in place in case the diplomatic corps gets expelled."" The Kremlin towers in front of the Russian Foreign Ministry headquarters on March 18, 2021 Today, with the spotlight on Russia amid the ongoing invasion in Ukraine, spies still lurking in the United States are likely operating on ""high alert,"" Barsky said. Not only would they be more aware of what is happening in the country, but they would also be careful not to ""become too aggressive"" or potentially make mistakes. ""One of the tasks I had, and I was told that everybody who was operating in a foreign country was supposed to … look for any signs of the country preparing for war,"" Barsky explained. ""Guaranteed … the Russian agents in this country are on high alert … To the extent you could do more to look for signs of preparation for war, you would."" He added that this would be the time that he would be reaching out to contacts he had made over the years, either those who were in the military or in companies that produced weapons. Dreeke noted that spies who are living undercover in the U.S. would be reporting back about what people are saying, compared to, and in addition to, what the news reports are saying, but will be looking over their shoulders along the way. ""I suspect they will not be opening new sources of information, but only going to well-established human intelligence sources of information,"" Dreeke continued. ""They are needing that information critically for policymaking – policymakers and decision makers on Russia's side. At the same time, though, they are now entirely paranoid about factions on their own side.""",6

And the Allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because – remember, also – we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment."" Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a joint press conference with Poland's President Andrzej Duda on the occasion of their meeting at Belwelder Palace, in Warsaw, Poland, Thursday, March 10, 2022. Harris also said in February that the ""purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence."" Prior to Russia's invasion, during an interview with , Blinken insisted that the ""purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war."" Similarly, in February, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said ""sanctions can be a powerful tool"" and that the overall goal of imposing sanctions on Russia was to ""have a deterrent effect."" ""Sanctions can be a powerful tool,"" Psaki said. ""They have been in a lot of moments throughout history. And what we view them as — or how we’re viewing them as we’re starting high, as Daleep just conveyed here, in terms of the significance and the severity of the sanctions that were announced today — yes, our intention is to have a deterrent effect."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Friday, March 18, 2022, in Washington. During that same briefing, Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for International Economics, said sanctions ""serve a higher purpose"" and that is to ""deter and prevent."" ""Sanctions are not an end to themselves. They serve a higher purpose. And that purpose is to deter and prevent,"" Singh said. ""They’re meant to prevent and deter a large-scale invasion of Ukraine that could involve the seizure of major cities, including Kyiv. They’re meant to prevent large-scale human suffering that could involve tens of thousands of casualties in a conflict."" During an appearance on 'America's Newsroom' in February, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the administration wanted the sanctions ""to have a deterrent effect."" ""We want them to have a deterrent effect, clearly,"" Kirby said. ""And he hasn’t invaded yet. […] So look, if you punish somebody for something they haven’t done yet ... they might as well go ahead and do it."" A Twitter account managed by the Republican National Committee highlighted remarks from officials in the Biden administration who, at one point, claimed that the sanctions were meant to deter Putin. Also in February, Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, said ""the president believes that sanctions are intended to deter."" ""And in order for them to work — to deter, they have to be set up in a way where if Putin moves, then the costs are imposed,"" Sullivan added. ""We believe that that is the right logic both on its own merits, but equally importantly, we believe that the most important fundamental for anything that unfolds in this crisis, whether through diplomacy or as a result of military action, is that the West be strong, be united, and be determined to operate with common purpose.""

You remember if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that.

President Biden’s bluster on Russia in the lead-up to the country’s invasion of Ukraine gave way to policies that appeased Russian President Vladimir Putin and largely follow that of Obama administration policies, experts say. ""[Biden’s] Russian experts are the same people as the Obama Russian experts. They were the people that said the Russian reset is going to be great,"" James Carafano, vice president of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. The Obama administration heralded a ""reset"" with Russia at the start of his first term, when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a red button reading, ""reset,"" and Obama announced the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia in 2010 – intended to cut the number of nuclear weapons held by the U.S. and Russia. Then-Vice President Biden said Russia joining the World Trade Organization was ""the most important item on our agenda."" - , But the attempt to improve relations with the nation deteriorated by 2014, as Russia invaded and annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in the East Room of the White House in Washington on March 23, 2010. When the Obama administration famously backed off its ""red line"" for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons on his own people, they accepted a deal with Russia to remove them instead. The agreement came as Obama continued setting his sights on a nuclear deal with Iran, and reportedly feared any military action in Syria could have jeopardized it. The administration celebrated its diplomatic solution. But in 2017 an apparent sarin gas attack was launched and former Obama administration officials came under fire for previous claims that the agreement successfully purged Assad's entire chemical weapons stockpile. Carafano told Fox News Digital that Biden tapping the same Russia experts as Obama’s is similar to ""a guy that told you to get on ."" But, "" vaporizes, and then you turn right around and hire that guy to advise you on your next big merger and acquisition."" ""What do you think's gonna happen?"" he asked rhetorically. President Obama's policies stand in stark contrast to President Trump's, who, unlike President Biden, spoke favorably about Putin but came down much harder on his regime in the policy arena, according to critics. In 2018, the Trump administration revealed the U.S. military killed hundreds of pro-Assad Russian mercenaries in Syria in airstrikes. The administration also pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal that year. Later, Trump also unilaterally pulled out of the three-decade-old Open Skies Treaty with Russia in 2020.

President Trump shakes hands with Russia's President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany July 7, 2017. Carafano argued that Putin's decision to invade Ukraine was one he made in 2014, but was put on ice during the Trump administration. ""I think he made this decision in 2014 … he decided that Obama was leaving Europe, that the Europeans were weak and divided and woke, and that he was pushing on an open door. And he just stopped for four years when Donald Trump was there because they didn't know how to deal with Trump.""

Trump vehemently opposed the pipeline, with his administration fearing it would allow Russia to further tighten its grip on Europe’s reliance on Russia for oil. 2 ' ': To Sen.

You can't talk about activities of the armed forces in Ukraine unless you use official press releases from the Ministry of Defense.""Playing by the rules, Prusenkova says, is ""morally complicated"" but they are giving it a go because their readers have asked them to. 95% said they wanted Novaya's writers to keep on writing, and they apparently can read between the lines. Matters related to the war such as demonstrations and economic hardship can be covered even with the restrictions on using the ""five-letter word.""

She chalks solid support for the war up to the fact that in the vast country that is Russia, a lot of people don't use the internet or even read newspapers.

Pence's comments came shortly after Biden said Thursday that a food shortage is ""gonna be real"" following the sanctions that were placed on Russia by the U.S. government as a result of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion into Ukraine. ""With regard to food shortage, yes we did talk about food shortages, and it's gonna be real,"" Biden said during a press conference at a summit in Brussels, Belgium, following a meeting with other world leaders. ""The price of the sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia,"" he added. ""It’s imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well."" Biden said ""Russia and Ukraine have been the breadbasket of Europe in terms of wheat"" and insisted that he and other leaders had a ""long discussion in the G7"" about the need to ""increase and disseminate"" food production. Biden's warning of a ""real"" food shortage and the impact it will have on America and European countries following the implementation of sanctions on the Russian economy comes after White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week that Americans are unlikely to face a food shortage. Speaking from Seoul, South Korea, Pence said that the Biden administration needs to be redoubling its efforts to help Ukraine win the war. ""We've got to give them the tools to be able to defend themselves. We've got to isolate Russia even more than was announced today. And we need to launch that massive Western humanitarian effort for the people of Ukraine. That's the pathway to victory."" Pence went on to say, ""As people talk about food shortages, the way that we avert food shortages, that would affect the wider region and the world is give Ukraine the ability to win."" Joshua Q.

Author and China expert Gordon Chang warned against the Biden administration getting involved in Russia-Ukraine peace deal negotiations Friday on ""The Ingraham Angle."" : The problem here is that Russia is breaking down the international order, so there are all sorts of significant points here that we have yet to really think about. So essentially, what we should be doing is, we shouldn't be pressuring Zelenskyy to cave in. And that's what I'm afraid of, if the Biden administration actually starts to get really involved in these negotiations, because we know that Biden wants a lot from Russia in connection with the Iran nuclear deal, which shouldn't be discussed at this point — it should never be discussed. So, I'm really concerned if Biden does become more involved in Eastern Europe.",0
2022-03-25,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/stefanik-russia-china-strengthening-authoritarian-alliance,"Stefanik warns Russia, China 'strengthening' their 'authoritarian alliance'","House Conference Chair Elise Stefanik tells Fox News' Brooke Singman that Biden is projecting weakness with Russia and China. , Fla. – House Republican Caucus Chair Elise Stefanik told Fox News that Russia and China began ""strengthening their alliance"" before the war in Ukraine, and she called on the Biden administration to enforce ""much, much tougher"" consequences should Beijing provide aid to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""That is dangerous to the West, dangerous to the United States, dangerous to all of our allies, particularly in Europe, and particularly you know, countries like Ukraine and Taiwan,"" Stefanik told Fox News on the sidelines of the House Republican Issues Conference. The Biden administration has voiced ""deep concerns"" about Russia’s ""alignment"" with China. Intelligence officials said that the Kremlin had turned to Beijing for economic and military aid after its invasion of Ukraine Feb. 24. : President Biden had a secure video call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week for nearly two hours in which he warned of the ""consequences"" should China ""provide material support"" to Russia amid its multifront war on Ukraine. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who met with his Chinese counterpart in Rome last week ahead of Biden and Xi’s meeting, said that the administration ""has not seen"" the ""provision of military equipment by China to Russia"" in the days since Biden’s meeting. President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping pose during a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse on Feb. 4, 2022. ""But of course, this is something we are monitoring closely,"" Sullivan said Tuesday. ""We will continue to monitor it."" As for whether China thinks it could be in its interest to provide aid to Russia, Stefanik said she believes Xi is ""having to assess what the consequences would be a potential aid to Russia."" ""And I think this administration should be much, much tougher on what potential consequences towards China would be if they go down that route,"" Stefanik said. ""We have not seen that from Joe Biden — they’ve been very weak when it comes to countering China, which is in stark contrast to the Trump administration's position on China."" But Stefanik didn’t only criticize the Biden administration’s strategy with regard to China — she also pointed fingers at House Democrats, who she said ""have been weak in combating China."" ""I have been a part of the China Task Force, which was supposed to be bipartisan, and we had been working on this for months and months — it was going to be co-equal, Democrats and Republicans, because we believe this is an American issue to combat China,"" Stefanik told Fox News. ""And at the 11th hour, Democrats walked away, they pulled all their members, and it is just House Republicans who were seated on the committee now."" '' , Stefanik said House Republicans have ""put forward some really important legislative proposals"" on that task force. ""Whether it was to make sure that we have robust manufacturing, that we're protecting our intellectual property here that we're calling out Chinese propaganda and calling genocide for what it is, which has been committed by the Communist Chinese regime,"" Stefanik said. Meanwhile, the House Conference chair warned of ""geopolitical consequences of the war on Ukraine"" and warned that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine could embolden Xi in his ambitions to take Taiwan. The White House said Biden, during his call with Xi last week, ""reiterated that U.S. policy on Taiwan has not changed, and emphasized that the United States continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo."" ""We need to learn from this failed deterrence from Joe Biden,"" Stefanik said. ""We need to arm Taiwan now, we need to make sure that they have the resources and the weaponry to self-defend against a Chinese Communist Party invasion and takeover."" Stefanik was referring to the Biden administration's move to send military aid and weapons to Ukraine after the invasion. Republicans have said the president should have provided more weapons, aircraft and military aid prior to Russia's invasion on Feb. 24. The Biden administration last week provided nearly $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine. The new package includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems; 2,000 Javelins, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons and 6,000 -4 anti-armor systems; 100 unmanned drones; 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns; more than 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds; 25,000 sets of body armor; and 25,000 helmets. The equipment will be transferred directly from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military, Biden said. As for Biden, Stefanik told Fox News she feels he is ""projecting weakness on the global stage."" ""Joe Biden as commander in chief and president of the United States should not be signaling this weakness, should not be signaling to adversaries like Russia what we won’t do, because Vladimir Putin is going to take advantage of that — he’s going to take advantage of that vacuum, and weakness on the world stage."" Stefanik said that ""one of the greatest failures of the Biden administration has been their first year in office."" ""Joe Biden was so weak, whether it was. you know, just slapping Russia on the wrist for the numerous Russian-backed cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, whether it was their failure and hesitation to stand with Israel — remember that in the first few months of the administration — or whether it was the catastrophic withdrawal of Afghanistan,"" Stefanik said. ""House Republicans, particularly during the very tragic withdrawal from Afghanistan, we have said that adversaries like Putin, and Xi, and Communist China are watching and they're watching this weakness, and that we think they would take advantage of it,"" Stefanik said. ""And unfortunately, we’re seeing that on the war in Ukraine."" The president is in Europe this week and participated in an emergency meeting to discuss the international response to Russia's war on Ukraine. The meeting took place Thursday in Brussels, Belgium. , 'S The president on Friday morning announced in Brussels that the U.S. and European Union will be launching a joint task force to help Europe pull away from its reliance on Russian gas. The task force will ""work to ensure energy security for Ukraine and the in preparation for next winter and the following one while supporting the ’s goal to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels,"" the White House said in a statement. Under the plan, the U.S. and other nations will increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year. Even larger shipments would be delivered in the future.

""We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul. We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come,"" he said. ""It will not be easy.

Left-wingers cannot fully understand who Russian authoritarian President Vladimir Putin is and why he continues to bombard Ukraine and its civilians because they lack a basic grasp of good versus evil, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News. In an interview airing Sunday on ""Life, Liberty & Levin"", Gingrich explained how Americans were given a preview of how the left would handle Putin's latest violation of international norms when they watched Democrats allow left-wing rioters full reign in 2020 and continue their soft-on-crime policies amid spikes in retail and violent crime in municipalities they run. ""I think that you can be willfully avoiding reality. But if you're open to looking at reality, [Putin has] written a 9,000-word explanation: He gave a very long speech to the Russian people just before he invaded,"" Gingrich, author of ""Beyond Biden,"" said. ""He has said that the greatest disaster of the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet Union. He clearly is committed to reestablishing a Russian Empire."" : Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Yerevan, Armenia. ""The easiest way to think of this is that liberals saw ‘The Lion King’ and thought it was a documentary,"" he said. ""And they literally wander around thinking the lions and zebras sing and dance together."" In the Disney classic, the carnivorous felines rule over an African landscape in harmony with creatures who would otherwise be their prey in real life. Gingrich said liberals and Democrats have this deeply-held feeling that the society portrayed in the fictional film is an allegory for how the world operates. He claimed, however, that if 20th century Americans took that tact, Adolf Hitler's Third Reich would lead the international system and not American republicanism or parliamentary democracy. ""When you try to explain to them whether it's domestic criminals who are out murdering and raping and carjacking and breaking into stores, or it's international terrorists or it's countries whose leaders are themselves terrorists… They can't believe it's true,"" Gingrich said. ' Adolf Hitler gives an impassioned speech while opening the Berlin International Auto Show. ""They keep saying to us, 'Don't you understand, there has to be a better way'. -- Well, I'll tell you without the weight and might of the United States and Great Britain, Hitler would have won. A world dominated by Hitler would have been horrible."" Because liberals refuse to believe the reality of how the planet is set up among its various heads of state and governing systems in this way, it has been difficult to convince them of their flawed worldview, he claimed. Hitler committed suicide in April 1945, and the hammer and sickle was last lowered from the Kremlin on Christmas Day 1991. A man wearing a shirt with the image of former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin attends May Day in Belgrade, Serbia. ""Without the determination of the United States and its many allies, the Soviet Union might have won in a world dominated by the Soviet Union would have been horrible,"" Gingrich added, nodding to the 1991 fall of the U.S.S.R., which he said incensed Putin and fueled his vision. Counting Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union as the 20th-century examples, Gingrich warned that the state of the world looks somewhat similar with two new nefarious actors in Russia and China rising on the stage. ""If they decide that the Western democracies are gutless, that in the end we have words with no weapons, that we are willing to stand for our values, and we're not willing to stand for our interests, this world is going to have to be so much more dangerous almost overnight,"" he warned.

French President Emmanuel Macron warned against escalation Sunday regarding Ukraine, a day after President Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin was a ""butcher"" who ""cannot remain in power."" ""I wouldn't use this type of wording because I continue to hold discussions with President Putin,"" Macron said Sunday during an appearance on France 3 channel. ""We want to stop the war that Russia has launched in Ukraine without escalation -- that's the objective."" His main goal remained ""achieving first a cease-fire"" and then a ""total withdrawal"" of Russian troops from Ukraine through ""diplomatic means,"" Macron told broadcasters Sunday. ""If this is what we want to do, we should not escalate things -- neither with words nor actions."" 'S , ‘ A ’ Macron said Friday that he would be continuing discussions with Putin in the coming days as part of an effort for France to spearhead evacuations from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol which has suffered heavy Russian bombardment. Several attempts at humanitarian corridors have failed as an estimated more than 100,000 people remain in the port city with a pre-war population of 300,000. This comes before France's first round of the presidential election takes place on April 10, with a presidential runoff on April 24 if no candidate wins outright.

During a speech at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland, Saturday, Biden said Putin was ""bent on violence"" and declared ""there's simply no justification or provocation for Russia's choice of war."" Speaking for about 30 minutes, Biden also referenced Poland’s decades of Soviet control behind the Iron Curtain before the end of the Cold War and declared ""democracy will prevail"" again in Ukraine. ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden said, concluding his address.

""A state leader should control his temper, nonetheless,"" Peskov added. The White House was forced to walk back Biden’s statements, saying he was not calling for a regime change in Russia, but rather was preparing the world’s democracies for an extended conflict and making the point that ""Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.""

In a piece titled ""Biden’s support for Ukraine and opposition to Putin were no ‘gaffe,'"" Boot praised Biden for his speech in Warsaw, questioning the ""uproar"" over the off-script moment where the president appeared to call for a new regime in Russia, declaring that President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power.""

""Certainly the fact that Biden’s aides rushed to walk back his remarks with lame explanations suggests that this was indeed a gaffe — one of many that Biden has committed over his long political career."" 'For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,' Biden said in reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday. ""Yet I wonder if perhaps history will vindicate this Biden ‘gaffe’ in much the way that many historians have praised comments by President Ronald Reagan that were once seen as dangerously provocative. Reagan called the Soviet Union an ‘evil empire’ and predicted it would wind up on the ‘ash heap of history.’ Those tough but true words contributed to raising superpower tensions in the early 1980s, but they also inspired many behind the Iron Curtain to fight for freedom. After the Berlin Wall came down, many saw Reagan as a visionary, not as a warmonger,"" he continued. ""Future historians might similarly vindicate Biden’s hope that Putin — whom he has accurately branded a ‘war criminal’ — will fall from power even though the United States apparently has no plan to remove Putin, just as in the 1980s the United States did not have any plan to topple the Berlin Wall."" Despite the White House clarification and subsequent media fallout, Boot credited Biden for delivering ""an unequivocal message of support for the brave Ukrainians who are inflicting grievous casualties on the Russian invaders.""

2022-03-27,https://www.foxnews.com/world/prominent-russian-critic-blasts-putins-schizophrenic-schemes-to-become-lord-of-the-world,Prominent Russian critic blasts Putin's 'schizophrenic schemes to become lord of the world',"Russia's Investigative Committee accuses Nevzorov, a Russian journalist and former , of deliberately spreading false information about the bombing of a Ukrainian maternity hospital earlier this month. A case has been opened against Alexander Nevzorov for calling the bombing of a Ukrainian maternity hospital...the bombing of a Ukrainian maternity hospital. Russia's Investigative Committee accuses Nevzorov, a Russian journalist and former , of deliberately spreading false information about the event which happened in Mariupol, Ukraine earlier this month. Conviction for such a crime could carry fifteen years in prison. Nevzorov is the first high-profile personality to be investigated under the new war-time legislation. Russia asserts the hospital in Mariupol had been all but evacuated prior to the attack and occupied by ultra-nationalist fighters. But others have said what the Russian army did is nothing short of a war crime. , , ""All information about war crimes is perceived extremely painfully by Russia,"" Nevzorov told Fox News. ""And the tragedy that happened to the maternity hospital in Mariupol was like a stake through the heart of a vampire. And they, of course, went mad. They explicitly announced a ban on talking about the subject at all. But I posted information about it on all my social media. I don't consider that a heroic deed. It's normal professional behavior."" Nevzorov is out of the country and said he is tempted to go back ""to show those idiots not everyone is afraid of him."" But he presumes returning would mean jail time and perhaps prefers to keep writing about what's going on from afar. Meantime, he has a wish for President Vladimir Putin. Medical workers treat a man wounded by shelling in a hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, Friday, March 4, 2022. ""For God's sake, give him 100 more palaces, give him 500 more female gymnasts!"" he says, gymnasts being a reference to Alina Kabaeva, Putin's rumored girlfriend or wife and perhaps mother of some of his children. She was an Olympic rhythmic gymnast. ""Just,"" Nevzorov continued his train of thought, ""so he will not carry out his schizophrenic schemes to become lord of the world. Let him play with such palaces, let him be engaged with his personal life, let him steal as much as he wants just to take his mind off his mania to murder."" But then he pauses and seems to think twice about the palace comment, which refers to a billion dollar Italianate palace in Gelendzhik on the Black Sea that opposition leader Alexei Navalny and his team say belongs to President Putin. They released an investigative video about it last year that’s been viewed well over 100 million times. A '' ""Putin's palace stands in a country where 40 million people have no sewage system. If you take all the Russian latrines made of boards with a hole in the floor, where you have to sit in freezing temperatures of minus 30 degrees, and put them together, they would take up an area the size of Chicago."" Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Yerevan, Armenia. Nevzorov is doubtful anyone can convince Putin to change his mind about the war. He said Putin is driven by ""delusions of grandeur."" He said most average Russians don't grasp Putin's motivations. ""Our people are in an absolute zombie state, in an absolutely false and extremely grave state of mind,"" Nevzorov said. ""And Putin has the ability to constantly feed on this state. And even this Luzhniki rally was like a dose of drugs for the dictator. He did not care whether the rally was fake or artificial, whether people were paid or not. He needed banners and crowds of people to make him blossom and spark again."" The Luzhnki rally was a big concert held March 18 to celebrate the annexation of Crimea where the slogan ""A World Without Nazism"" was spelled out prominently on stage. More 200,000 people were said to have attended the rally and some told journalists on the ground they'd been pressured by bosses to go. Nevrozov said many Russians are content to consume only state-run media. ""They want to remain trapped by propaganda,"" he said. ""They want to remain trapped by delusional statements about some Nazis. Where did they find the Nazis? Where did they ever see Nazis in Ukraine?"" ""The scary thing,"" he concluded, ""is that Russia is putting forward as a guide, as a textbook of life a vicious, bloody, horrible, dead-end.""",0

""He wants to establish greater Russia the way it once started and… he has been pretty open about it."" ""He has stated in public that he doesn't consider Ukraine a sovereign nation, and Ukraine and Russia should be united,"" he continued. Barksy's warning comes as the White House has had to clarify remarks President Biden made over the weekend, saying the U.S. does not seek regime change in Russia, despite Biden saying Putin ""cannot remain in power.""

""We focused almost exclusively on helping to reform their military and helping to train their troops for combat,"" California National Guard Maj. Gen. David S. Baldwin said. The call center, he said, is something the guard has never done before. The California National Guard takes calls and communicates with the Ukrainian military and officials, to help streamline aid and resources from the United States Government, on March 16, 2022, in Sacramento, California. : Over the years, members of the Guard have been deployed to Ukraine to train in combat situations. Anastasia Maynich, a California National Guard member and a Ukrainian-American, has had first-hand experiences with field-training. Maynich was also deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and joined the United States Army after 2001, following in her grandfather's footsteps who was a World War veteran. ""It was something that I loved to do because I wasn’t there for just myself. I was there to help the people and for the people,"" Maynich said. She said she's no stranger to jumping into action. It's what she decided to do when she learned her cousin, Tetiana, and her cousin's 11-year-old daughter, Sophia, were almost killed in Ukraine. , ""They’re my family, and you’ll do anything for the people that you love,"" Maynich said. She began the almost 5 thousand-mile journey to the Romanian and Ukraine border to pick them up and bring them to safety. Tetiana and Sofiia packed what they could before leaving Odessa. On the way, they said their car was struck by gunfire. Tetiana and 11-year-old Sofiia are pictured above after crossing into Bucharest. After staying about a week in Bucharest, Maynich, Tetiana and Sophia went on a four-day trip to Germany, where they stayed with a close friend, until they heard from U.S. immigration officials. But this was only the first part of the journey for the family. Because a visa is required to arrive in the United States by plane, Tatiana and Sophia then flew to Mexico, and crossed into the U.S. through Tijuana. : ‘I ’T ' ' ""If I can save at least two lives during this crisis, I’m extremely grateful for being able to do that,"" Maynich said. The family is now temporarily staying with Maynich in her Bay Area home in California.",6

Michael McCaul, R-Texas., responds to Biden's address to and questions Biden's credibility as a world leader. President Biden's Euro-tour this past week played like many a horror movie, where things go from ‘eerily off’ to full-blown crisis in a matter of seconds. His trip was meant to reassure Europeans that when it comes to beating back Russian President Vladimir Putin, America is in it to win it. What happened was something else entirely. On the surface, the folksy ‘Uncle Joe’ routine plays well in Europe. Biden’s statements of solidarity, along with his reassurances of U.S. commitment for Ukraine and the defense of , get good press. Most importantly for most European leaders, he never asks them for anything more than they are already willing to do. He is the inoffensive bystander-in-chief. President Joe Biden leaves Air Force One as he arrives at Warsaw Chopin Airport, in Warsaw, Poland March 25, 2022. Trailing behind the likeable Biden, however, is a dark shadow. Two perplexing problems pose a nagging worry for the future of the transatlantic community. 'S , ‘ A ’ One is Biden's continued penchant for face-planting gaffes that the White House must then explain away. This trip included at least half a dozen, from suggesting American troops would deploy to Ukraine to implying the U.S. would respond to a Russian use of chemical weapons with chemical weapons . The lack of strategic vision is particularly troubling right now. How is the U.S. going to lead after this war to ensure that Putin never troubles us again? It does not help that a national security team that has proven itself subpar backs Biden. Vice President Harris's European visit, for instance, looked like the stuff of a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. The White House would be hard-pressed to cite one positive outcome. 'S ' ' As if their halting response to the Ukraine crisis weren’t enough, the word around Washington is that Biden's dream team is only days away from announcing a new Iran Deal – one that’s even weaker than the last, sure to spark new tensions and conflict in the region and bound to raise more new questions about the competence of Biden and his advisers. The second problem is a deeper one than the cognitive abilities of the president and his team’s lack of competence. It’s that they have shown no skill, no ability, to formulate and execute strategy to safeguard the long-term interests of the United States. President Joe Biden delivers a speech about the Russian war in Ukraine at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland on March 26, 2022. More than a year after taking office, Biden boasts a national gender strategy, but still no national security strategy. The lack of strategic vision is particularly troubling right now. How is the U.S. going to lead after this war to ensure that Putin never troubles us again? The Russian president remains a military threat and still has energy as a weapon of blackmail, coercion, profit and influence. Biden doesn't have a long-term response for either. We need strengthened conventional and strategic deterrence and energy independence. Biden has offered Band-aids and wishful hopes. The Russian president remains a military threat and still has energy as a weapon of blackmail, coercion, profit and influence. Biden doesn't have a long-term response for either. And make no mistake—the Chinese Communist Party has taken note of this weakness. Biden can hope Putin goes away and that renewable energy powers the free world all he wants, but both are magical thinking. In the end, this trip is a reminder that Americans are led by a tired man of limited ability, backed by a team who are no better at this now than when they worked for President Obama.",22

But he hadn't expected to see so much of the war, or its shrapnel, so soon. ; : He had been standing on the truck hurrying to finish the job before sunset Saturday when he heard a noise, looked up and saw an object whizzing through the air.

Car welder Ostap Datsenko, 31, pauses during an interview at a welding workshop in Lviv, western Ukraine, Sunday, March 27, 2022. The Russian airstrike hit a factory connected to the military, and the blast sent Datsenko tumbling. Dazed, he hurried into the garage’s makeshift bunker in the grease pit. The following day, he was back at work for the finishing touches on the truck before it’s driven on Monday to eastern Ukraine, along with three other vehicles. The truck's camouflage paint job was complete. The welders put bars in the back to help support a machine gun. 2 , , The 31-year-old Datsenko, his clothes streaked with oil, said he was ready like all Ukrainian men to be called up to fight. But he had no combat experience, meaning his time is yet to come. Until then, he said, ""I’m doing what I can."" Ukraine’s military appears to have fought Russia’s much larger army into a stalemate on some fronts, which has surprised many observers. One of Ukraine's weapons is a parallel army of volunteers who are busy mobilizing funding and supplies ranging from body armor to cigarettes. Others make the military connections. Car welder Ostap Datsenko, 31, works on a vehicle that will be sent to soldiers on the frontlines, at a welding workshop in Lviv, western Ukraine, Sunday, March 27, 2022. In Lviv, which had been relatively far from the war until the airstrikes on Saturday, the welding shop looked for ways to help. It started off making ""hedgehogs,"" or the metal barriers placed at checkpoints and around some sensitive facilities. Then they heard the call for cars. , : ""Any vehicles are very much in demand on the front line"" by commanders, said Artem Pastushyna, a 27-year-old welder with metal nuts glinting in his earlobes. Only a small number of the vehicles have been adapted with steel plates and camouflage, he said. The need is too big and there's little time.

Until then, the welding shop is paying new attention to its grease pit after Saturday’s airstrikes. They had expected an attack sometime but not one so big, Datsenko said.

They are doing so through using the primary weapons of economic warfare,"" she said. : I 'T ""They are doing so by waging this modern-day siege against Russia, isolating, containing, destroying their economy, starving the Russian people in the hope that the Russian people or the military will rise up and revolt and overthrow their government, and get rid of Putin.""

""The reason why they are lying about this to the American people, is, they know we are sick and tired of our country waging regime change wars. We remember how costly and devastating these wars in Iraq, Libya, Syria have been. And we rejected them wholeheartedly,"" she said. ""So if they were to come out and tell the truth, their polls would tank even more than they already are, and their politics would suffer.""

Rand Paul offers reaction on 'Jesse Watters Primetime' President Biden's latest off-script comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin are potentially risky for the United States, Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Rand Paul said Monday. At a press conference earlier Monday, Biden said he stood by his comment over the weekend that Putin ""cannot remain in power"" and claimed it was not an official U.S. policy change in favor of removing the dictator from power. On ""Jesse Watters Primetime"", Paul warned that Biden's increasingly sensitive gaffes are not going over well internationally. Host Jesse Watters pointed out that the French government has already criticized Biden. ""I wouldn't use this type of wording because I continue to hold discussions with President Putin,"" President Emmanuel Macron said Sunday on French television. ""We want to stop the war that Russia has launched in Ukraine without escalation -- that's the objective."" Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Yerevan, Armenia. Paul said he and most of the Congress are not trying to oust Putin, who has been in the positions of power, either as prime minister or president, since 1999. ""A lot of times when you're around somebody who's in cognitive decline, you find yourself trying to help them with a sentence, trying to help them complete it… but we shouldn't have to do that for the commander-in-chief,"" he said. ""And, it is actually a national security risk because he's sending signals that no one in their right mind would want to send to Russia at this point. We aren't trying to replace Putin in Russia. We aren't trying to have regime change. We're not sending troops into Ukraine, and we're not going to respond in kind with chemical weapons,"" the Kentucky senator added, referencing the other two statements Biden made in Poland that the White House hastily clarified. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron wave. Paul went on to claim Biden ""lives in an alternate universe"" where it is acceptable for him to say one thing, then claim the way the public perceived that particular statement is not true. ""So I guess you're supposed to look the other way. But even the left-wing media is noticing these gaffes,"" Paul said. ""So I do think that it is a real problem, and there's a humorous angle to this. But it's really not funny because we're worried about what he's saying, precipitating or escalating the conflict in Ukraine into a world war. That's very serious.""

International media blasted President Biden for his unscripted remark Saturday when he declared Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power,"" concluding it was a gaffe that hurt more than helped the effort to support Ukraine amid the ongoing Russian invasion. Biden called the invasion a ""strategic failure"" and pledged continued U.S. aide for Ukrainians in his address. But it was his off-the-cuff comment about Putin that made headlines. ""For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden said to conclude his speech in front of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland. : U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during an event at the Royal Castle, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in Warsaw, Poland, March 26, 2022. /Aleksandra Szmigiel/File Photo Several British media outlets referred to Biden's remark as a ""blunder,"" a dangerous gaffe, or a moment that left the international stage in ""chaos.""

In a separate piece, The Telegraph's Defense and Security Editor Dominic Nicholls described the scene: ""Joe Biden’s gaffe is ‘a gift’ to an isolated and increasingly erratic Vladimir Putin."" The word ""gaffe"" frequently appeared in international reviews. ""Gaffe-prone Joe Biden leaves White House reeling after Putin remark -‘Cannot remain in power,"" The Daily Express wrote, with a subhead reading, ""Joe Biden was once again left red-faced after he mistakenly suggested a change in Russia's regime while addressing the public in Poland on Saturday."" ""Joe Blunder,"" The Sun declared. ""Joe Biden sparked chaos with an unscripted gaffe vowing Vladimir Putin ‘cannot remain in power’ - which experts said risks prolonging the war in Ukraine,"" the outlet added, saying the White House ""frantically backtracked"" in response to the confusion. ‘ ’ : ‘ ’ ""Farce as White House clarifies Biden assertion that Putin must be toppled.

A writer for The Spectator wondered if Biden's latest controversial remark could lead to ""World War Three."" ""Could Biden gaffe us into World War Three?"" the Sunday piece from deputy editor Freddy Gray read. Gray argued it wasn't an isolated incident. ""Yet this was Biden’s third potentially world war three-triggering blunder in as many days,"" he wrote. President Joe Biden meets with Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian aid workers during a visit to Narodowy Stadium, Saturday, March 26, 2022, in Warsaw. A ‘’ René Pfister, a contributor to the German outlet Der Spiegel, argued that while he's happy Biden is in office and not former President Trump, Biden's uncaged remarks continue to reverse any progress he may have made in the response to the Russian invasion. ""Joe Biden has the special talent of tearing down with his loose mouth what he has previously worked hard to build up,"" Pfister wrote. Pfister said the speech started out well, but his now infamous line overshadowed it. ""Biden spoke as one would wish from an American president: emotional, full of historical references and yet to the point - if Biden had not said the fateful sentence at the end: 'For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,'"" Pfister said. ""But apparently Biden's sentence wasn't planned, it was one of those rhetorical blunders he's been known for for decades and has gotten him into trouble on more than one occasion,"" he later added.

""The most dangerous thing about the president's performance on the world stage is that it's clear he is being coached on what to say and that his words are contrary to his true thoughts. Is the American president in charge or isn't he?"" ""Frankly, I was thinking that [President] Biden talks a lot,"" Ukrainian journalist Misha Gannytskyi told Fox News Digital. ""Even – talks too much. In Slavic tradition ... if you [aren't] ready to start a fight, don't speak. Or your enemy will understand that you are not about an action."" American media shared their own disappointment in the president's speech. 's Kimberly Dozier called the address ""indisciplined"" and ""a gift to Russian propagandists,"" while News' chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel suggested Sunday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not ""overly impressed"" by the Putin declaration. Axios concluded the ""takeaway from a 27-minute speech of massive consequence — on the world stage, a border away from Russian missile strikes in a war zone — was derailed by a taunt."" The president's Putin remark was the second time in two days the White House had to walk back one of his statements. Biden previously appeared to suggest there could be boots on the ground in Ukraine while speaking to paratroopers in Poland. ""You’re going to see when you’re there — some of you have been there — you’re going to see women, young people, standing in the middle, in front of a damn tank, saying, ‘I’m not leaving,"" Biden said.

2022-03-29,https://www.foxnews.com/world/chinas-shanghai-lockdown-tests-zero-covid-strategy,China's Shanghai lockdown tests ‘zero-COVID’ strategy,"Chinese authorities sought to reassure companies and jittery investors on Tuesday as a two-phase lockdown of Shanghai’s 26 million people entered its second day, casting an unusual quiet over the normally bustling center of finance, manufacturing and trade. The omicron outbreak in Shanghai is one of a series across the country that is testing the government’s ability to enforce a strict ""zero-"" strategy without overly disrupting the economy and people’s daily lives. Many shops were shuttered and pedestrians were sparse even in the half of the city that remained open. The lockdown is being conducted in two phases to limit the disruption, starting with the Pudong financial district and adjacent areas on the east side of the Huangpu River that divides Shanghai. -19 Zhang Meisha, taking a morning jog along the fabled Bund on the river’s west bank, said she hoped to enjoy more sunshine before the lockdown shifted to Puxi. Only an occasional tourist lingered on the promenade lined with century-old historic buildings. ""It’s so beautiful, but not many people can come here to enjoy and appreciate,"" Zhang said of the red and yellow tulips along the Bund. ""Such a pity! I hope the spring of Shanghai can wait for us."" The shutdown has added to anxiety in financial markets over Russia’s war on Ukraine, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s effort to cool surging inflation by raising interest rates and other challenges facing the global economy. Market reactions including Monday’s 7% drop in oil prices in London don’t reflect the ""true reality of the situation,"" but investors already were uneasy about China and the global economy, said Michael Every of Rabobank. Residents line up for test in Shanghai, China, Tuesday, Mar. 29th, 2022. A two-phase lockdown of Shanghai’s 26 million people is testing the limits of China’s hard-line ""zero-"" strategy, which is shaking markets far beyond the country’s borders. ""We have a whole mountain of problems to worry about, and this is just one foothill among many,"" he said. ""If that’s all it is, a lockdown, it’s not difficult to look in recent history books and see how it plays out. But this interfaces with a lot of other issues."" Any interruption of activity at the port of Shanghai poses a greater threat to industry and trade. State media reported that the world’s biggest port was handling normal cargo volumes and that managers were ensuring that vessels ""can call normally"" at the port. General Motors Co. and Volkswagen said their Shanghai factories were operating normally. The new omicron .2 subvariant is widely blamed for a surge of cases in China this month. By far, the hardest hit area has been Jilin province in the northeast. Only two deaths have been reported, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to 4,638, The relatively low death toll and case count has been touted by the ruling Communist Party as evidence of the wisdom of its zero- approach. Outside of mainland China, new cases have declined in Hong Kong following a recent wave that has led to more than 7,000 deaths. The semi-autonomous city of 7.4 million people recorded 7,596 new cases in the latest 24-hour period. Shanghai recorded 4,477 new cases on Monday, all but 96 of them asymptomatic. Gymnasiums and exhibition centers have been converted into sprawling centers to isolate positive cases under the zero- approach. ' ' ; The measures confining the residents of Pudong to their homes, closing nonessential businesses and requiring mass testing are to be lifted Friday after four days. At that time, the Puxi area on the opposite side of the river will go under lockdown. Shops in Puxi along the Nanjing Road pedestrian shopping street were mostly closed Tuesday, with few people out and about. Restaurants offered only takeaway service, and a long line formed outside a McDonalds of people waiting to pick up their orders. Authorities are working to ensure food supplies after panic buying on Sunday and reports of shortages of meat and vegetables. The Shanghai lockdown stands to become the largest of any city in China’s campaign against the virus, in which millions have been confined to their homes for weeks at a time in cities across much of the country. Government workers in hazmat suits, joined by about 68,000 volunteers, are stationed at checkpoints around residential compounds that have been walled off with traffic dividers and improvised barriers. Residents stock up on daily necessities at a supermarket in Shanghai, China, Tuesday, Mar. 29th, 2022. A two-phase lockdown of Shanghai’s 26 million people is testing the limits of China’s hard-line ""zero-"" strategy, which is shaking markets far beyond the country’s borders. Despite central government calls for a more targeted approach and some tweaking of the system, the decision to lock down Shanghai shows the continuing reliance on extreme measures. Besides the two-phase approach, authorities have also given definite end dates for the lockdowns in Shanghai, unlike in other cities earlier. Financial services firm Macquarie Group said the Shanghai lockdown indicates China will stick with its zero- strategy at least until the ruling Communist Party holds its once-every-five-year congress this fall. Authorities have promoted the need for stability in the runup to the event, when Xi Jinping is expected to be granted a third five-year term as party leader in a break with recent practice. China boasts a vaccination rate of around 87% but the percentage is much lower among seniors, who are more vulnerable to the virus. Macquarie Group said in a report that China should be able to contain the virus in the next few weeks, given the effectiveness of lockdowns. ""But does pose substantial growth downside risk in the rest of this year, as lockdown is also very costly,"" the report said, adding that consumer spending and the housing market were set to take the biggest hits. Wang Hui, who runs a shop near the Bund, said high rents and a lack of customers could cost him his business.",22

Jake Ellzey questioned whether the Biden administration colluded with the media after a cue card with talking points was exposed. , D.C. – Rep. Jake Ellzey questioned whether a cue card with talking points that President Biden used involved collusion with the media and suggested that other people are ""calling the shots."" A photo showed that Biden held a note card during a news briefing Monday. The card included prepared responses to a question asking what the president meant when he said earlier that Russian President Vladimir Putin couldn’t remain in power. ""The question I have is, were those questions that he had on the note card planted by somebody else and then referred to by the media?"" Ellzey, a Texas Republican, said during an interview with Fox News. ""That would show collusion with the media."" Biden has previously relied on prepared lists of reporters when taking questions from the media. He’s said he was given a list, but it’s unclear who crafted it. : ""I think he has a team that he relies on more than I would if I were the president,"" Ellzey told Fox News. ""I think that there are some people calling the shots that we don't know who they are, and they need to be briefing us on what they're advising the president on what he should be doing."" Rep. Jake Ellzey speaks to Fox News. The president has previously made remarks that have led critics to question if someone is giving Biden orders. In September, for example, he said he was ""supposed to stop and walk out of the room"" after he finished prepared remarks. Biden said Saturday that Putin ""cannot remain in power."" He made the impromptu comment during a speech in Poland during which he called Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a ""strategic failure."" Administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, clarified that the U.S. is not seeking regime change. Biden, echoing statements on his note card, said Monday that he was expressing outrage, rather than suggesting policy change. President Joe Biden announces his Budget for Fiscal Year 2023, which will reduce deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next decade, advance safety and security at home and around the world, and make the investments needed to build a better America in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 14, 2022. Ellzey noted that politicians regularly rely on note cards to stay on message. ""Especially at the presidential level, every word that he says is going to be scrutinized, gone over by every world leader, because it has impact,"" Ellzey told Fox News. ""He went off message, and it got him in trouble."" Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed into law legislation that could punish journalists with up to 15 years in prison for reporting so-called ""fake"" news about his military invasion of Ukraine. Ellzey added that Biden needs to ""use a lot of thought before he opens his mouth"" since the situation in Ukraine is so sensitive and because the president’s statements carry so much influence. Intelligence officials have warned that Putin could turn to nuclear or chemical weapons since Ukraine has been so effective at fighting off the Russian invaders. A Kremlin spokesperson said Biden’s comments were ""alarming."" French President Emmanuel Macron suggested that they weren’t helpful for peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv.",9

Lee Zeldin reacted to Biden's remarks critics said suggested regime change in Russia on 'Fox Report.' President Biden’s multiple gaffes in discussing the Russian invasion of Ukraine evoke similar missteps during his botched military withdrawal from Afghanistan, where hundreds of Americans and Afghan allies remain stranded. Biden wrapped up his four-day trip to Europe on Saturday after making a series of misstatements about the situation in Ukraine that warranted cleaning up by the White House and members of the administration. , , During a press conference Thursday at a summit in Brussels, Belgium, Biden said the U.S. would respond ""in kind"" if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan later had to clarify that meant Russia would pay a ""severe price,"" but that ""the United States has no intention of using chemical weapons, period, under any circumstances."" President Biden delivers a speech at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland, Saturday, March 26, 2022. During the same conference, Biden declared that ""sanctions never deter"" and that he never said the economic measures would stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine, despite members of the administration, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, explicitly stating that the sanctions were meant to deter. On Friday, Biden was speaking to U.S. troops in Poland when he appeared to suggest that they would soon be in Ukraine itself – something U.S. officials have repeatedly ruled out. ""And you're going to see when you're there… you're going to see women, young people standing – standing… in front of a damn tank, just saying, 'I'm not leaving. I'm holding my ground,'"" Biden said.

President Joe Biden announces his Budget for Fiscal Year 2023 in the State Dinning Room of the White House in Washington, on March 28, 2022. During a speech in Poland on Saturday, Biden said Putin ""cannot remain in power,"" signaling a significant change in U.S. policy toward the Kremlin. Secretary of State Antony Blinken later clarified that the U.S. is not looking for regime change in Russia. In January, a month before Russia launched its invasion, Biden was slammed for appearing to downplay the potential for a ""minor incursion"" against Ukraine. ""It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion, and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera,"" he said. ""But if they actually do what they’re capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine."" The White House later clarified that a ""renewed invasion"" of Ukraine ""will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies."" The series of missteps is reminiscent of the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal just seven months ago, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed by suicide bombers at the Kabul airport. In August, Biden faced widespread global backlash after Taliban insurgents retook Afghanistan in a matter of 11 days, winning the war 20 years after their ouster by U.S.-led forces. Just a month earlier, Biden had told Americans that the ""likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely."" On Aug. 19, four days after the Taliban seized the capital of Kabul, Biden told ’s George Stephanopoulos that intelligence did not indicate the Afghan government would quickly collapse – despite reports that's exactly what the intelligence said. He also said ""no one's being killed"" in Afghanistan despite reports at the time of at least seven deaths amid the chaos at Kabul's airport. On Aug. 26, during the U.S. military's mass evacuation at the airport, suicide bombers killed at least 183 people, including 13 U.S. service members. The U.S. retaliated by launching two drone strikes against suspected -K terrorists, one of which ended up killing 10 Afghan civilians, including seven children.

The U.S. military evacuation, which required significant cooperation from the Taliban to complete, ended a day ahead of deadline on Aug. 30, leaving behind hundreds of U.S. citizens and tens of thousands of Afghan allies, despite Biden’s promise days earlier to ""get them all out."" A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that several dozen U.S. citizens and their families are still trying to get out of Afghanistan. Despite telling Americans after Afghanistan’s collapse that ""the buck stops with me,"" Biden repeatedly blamed former President Trump and the Afghan military for how it unfolded.

That is not a question that Americans should ever have to ask themselves, and yet today, with war raging in Europe, inflation emptying pocketbooks, and a southern border we can’t control, we have to ask it. Who is actually running the country? Because it sure doesn’t seem like it’s President Joe Biden. This past weekend in Poland, Biden gave a speech that the White House itself touted as one of the most important of his presidency. In a final and forceful moment he paused and then, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said, ""For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.""

President Biden meets with Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian aid workers during a visit to Narodowy Stadium, Saturday, March 26, 2022, in Warsaw. For better or worse the American people elected Joe Biden as president. They didn’t elect his communications team, or his Secretary of State, they didn’t elect whatever person or people it is who get angry at him if he takes too many questions. What this debacle in Warsaw made painfully clear is that Biden is not in charge. And that’s not just a problem, it's a threat to our democracy. On Monday Biden said he did not regret what he said, but seemed to indicate it was his personal opinion, not the policy of the United States. What does that even mean? Why would Biden's personal opinion be any different than American policy? Who is he answering to? 'S ' ' The American people overwhelmingly support Ukraine in the current conflict, their opinion of Putin is that he is a dangerous authoritarian dictator. So why on earth can’t the President of the United States say this ""butcher,"" his own word from earlier that day, should not be in power? Is this really such an off the wall idea? Or was our president actually articulating the wishes and beliefs of the people? What this debacle in Warsaw made painfully clear is that Biden is not in charge. And that’s not just a problem, it's a threat to our democracy. Somewhere in some musty back room in Washington, D.C., there must be some chart of things the president is and isn’t allowed to say, options he is and isn’t allowed to put on the table, questions he is or isn’t allowed to answer. Nobody voted on these rules, they just seem to exist. And by the way, what the hell is the point of these rules? 'S ' ', The argument against Biden’s direct call for regime change in Russia, and let's be clear, that's exactly what it was, is that Putin will use it as propaganda to sway the Russian people to his side. But so what? Putin is already exercising a level of censorship in his country that blocks any truth from getting through. President Joe Biden meets with Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian aid workers in Warsaw on Saturday, March 26, 2022. President Biden participates in a roundtable on the humanitarian response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Friday, March 25, 2022, in Jasionka, Poland. President Joe Biden leaves Air Force One as he arrives in Warsaw, Poland, March 25, 2022. This is the same kind of thinking from Biden’s unknown controllers that escalated this mess in the first place. For a month now their mantra has been that they won’t have our president do anything that could invite conflict from Putin. But Putin is already bombing civilians on the sovereign territory of an American ally despite all of our diplomatic restraint. Who exactly are we trying to impress here? The presidency of the United States is a unique political position in all of human history. There is a reason the president is called the leader of the free world, and the most powerful person on earth. Beginning with George Washington, Americans have chosen to give one person all of this power specifically so that nameless unaccountable bureaucrats do not control our lives. For whatever reason, Joe Biden ran for president and won. He does not now get to slip back into the basement with an ice cream and tell Jen Psaki, Antony Blinken, or anyone else to figure it all out. The president doesn’t need better advisers, though his advisers are terrible, he doesn’t need a more active Congress, what he needs is to stand up and be his own man. For one brief moment in Poland it looked like he was doing that, being his own man, leading our country and the world. Then within minutes it was all walked back. By whom? Who knows? The president doesn’t need better advisers, though his advisers are terrible, he doesn’t need a more active Congress, what he needs is to stand up and be his own man.

Gallagher joined ""America's Newsroom"" to discuss the matter, highlighting the contradictions in messaging surrounding both ""sanctions and deterrence"" targeting Moscow. : 'S ‘’ : I was listening to Peter Doocy's description, and I had the thought that perhaps the best thing for national security and global stability would be for the White House to shut down Ron Klain's Twitter account, which is doing enormous damage to national security and makes us look like amateurs on the world stage. Listen, the president made a mistake. He made a gaffe. He walked it back. I'm fine with the walk back, but now they're walking back the walk back, and we saw the same contradiction with the connection between sanctions and deterrence.",9

During a Tuesday segment on his show ""Inside Politics,"" King excused Biden over the gaffe, stressing ""how important"" it was that the White House sought to clarify his remarks, while arguing that Biden was ""human"" and that mistakes like that ""can happen."" host John King on the set of ""Inside Politics"" on March 29, 2022. ‘’T ,' ""You can see how important this was to the White House.

I'm on live television every day – gets out ahead of your brain. It can happen. It’s called being human,"" King said while discussing Biden's gaffe with a panel of journalists. King argued that Biden showed clarifying his remarks was ""important to him"" because he had a note card with him while speaking with reporters on Monday that included an explanation for the gaffe.

Olivier Knox, a correspondent for The Washington Post, argued that with his clarification, Biden was just ""cleaning it up,"" and that his intended audience was not Putin, but rather Americans concerned over an intensifying conflict and the potential for the involvement of U.S. troops.

A reporter for News grilled White House communications director Kate Bedingfield over whether or not President Biden is ""living up"" to one of his most prominent campaign promises. During the 2020 presidential election, Biden repeatedly condemned then-President Trump for his bombastic rhetoric that could result in negative consequences, arguing that the words of a president ""matter"" and suggesting he would be more disciplined as the commander in chief. 'T 'S Following a string of statements Biden made that the White House had to walk back, News correspondent Mike Memoli pressed Bedingfield at Tuesday's press briefing about Biden's explosive comment from Saturday's speech in Poland saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power,"" which the president himself addressed during Monday's press conference. U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during an event at the Royal Castle, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in Warsaw, Poland March 26, 2022. Slawomir Kaminski /Agencja Wyborcza.pl via ""Obviously yesterday, he tried to suggest that there was a distinction between his personal views of what he thought was a moral outrage versus an official policy position on the part of the United States, but you know full well, something that candidate Joe Biden said virtually every day on the campaign trail, which is that the words of a president matter, that they can, as he often put it, lead a country into war,"" Memoli said. ""Is he not living up to the standard that he set himself during the campaign?"" 'S ‘ ’ : A ‘- ’ ""Absolutely not,"" Bedingfield responded. ""I think the words of the president here were incredibly powerful. He spoke personally about the moral outrage that he felt, which is shared by people all across the world. It does not mean he's articulating a change in policy. It does not mean he's laying out a change in U.S. policy."" ""He met with refugees… and saw firsthand some of the pain that Vladimir Putin has inflicted on people who are fleeing their homes and who are seeing their country war-torn. So this was an incredibly personal, powerful statement of moral outrage. It was not an articulation of a new policy. And I think both of those things can be in our true,"" Bedingfield added.

Or Does he regret that those weren't at the very end of the speech overshadowed a larger message which obviously took a lot of thought into the days leading up to it?"" ""Absolutely not,"" Bedingfield answered. ""He spoke from the heart. He, as he always does, as you know very well from having covered him for a long time, as many of you do- and as the American people know, he speaks from the heart. He says what he feels and no, he absolutely does not regret that in any way."" While the president was defiant with reporters on Monday insisting he hasn't walked back any of his comments, the White House seemed to be doing damage control following his speech in Poland when he generated international headlines for suggesting a regime change in Russia. ""The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,"" the White House stated shortly after Biden's address. On Thursday, he suggested that the U.S. would retaliate ""in kind"" if Russia launched a chemical attack on Ukraine. The White House issued a statement that the U.S. ""has no intention of using chemical weapons, period, under any circumstances."" Then on Friday, while speaking to American troops stationed in Poland, Biden suggested they would be sent to Ukraine as he was describing what they would witness on the ground. The White House issued a statement saying, ""The president has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.""",9

In October 1992, radio titan Rush Limbaugh engaged in an exercise in ""illustrating absurdity by being absurd"" when he began a segment by – temporarily – declaring he'd endorsed Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton for president against President George H.W. Bush: ""Ladies and gentlemen, here at 12 minutes after the hour on the 22nd of October, am here to tell you that I have decided to endorse the candidacy of Bill Clinton for president."" Moments later, Limbaugh took calls from listeners spanning from the outraged to the disappointed, who were perplexed as to why he would depart from ""being for Mr. Bush"". ‘ ’: ‘ ’ Rush Limbaugh sits behind the Golden Microphone After Limbaugh returned from a break, a caller from The Bronx, N.Y., asked Rush, ""what are you doing to us?"" by endorsing Clinton. ""It was 23 minutes ago. You keep talking about something that happened 23 minutes ago. It's irrelevant…,"" Limbaugh later told a caller. He ultimately explained he was simply imitating the Democratic candidate: ""Governor Clinton has been doing for 20 years what I did on my show today -- saying things then denying them,"" the conservative radio giant said at the time. Limbaugh commented during a 2013 throwback to the skit that Clinton was repeatedly ""lying through his teeth"" on several issues and denying allegations of an extramarital affair by former Arkansas state employee Gennifer Flowers. On Tuesday's ""Hugh Hewitt Show"", host Hugh Hewitt drew parallels between Limbaugh's exercise illustrating Clinton's behavior, and current President Biden's repeated off-script comments about Russian leader Vladimir Putin remaining in power or whether U.S. troops could be dispatched to Ukraine. 'S Rush Limbaugh ""Thirty years ago, Rush did that bit… and yesterday [it was] Joe Biden,"" Hewitt said. ""Life imitates art – that was Rush being the … artist and Joe Biden imitating it."" ""It's not funny when it's the President of the United States saying ‘nope, that wasn’t me,'"" he added. On Tuesday, Hewitt noted that Biden was being serious when denying that he ever said Putin ""cannot remain in power"" or ever insinuated U.S. troops could end up in Ukraine – while Limbaugh was intentionally lampooning Bill Clinton: ""[Rush] is a radio genius,"" Hewitt said. ""He did this bit 30 years ago, and in the back of my mind… we were trying to collectively remember Rush doing that bit – because [unlike Rush], President Biden wasn't joking."" Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Bill Clinton attend the memorial service for Senator Robert Byrd, D-W.V. ""Rush was doing a schtick… this is not schtick, this is the President of the United States – in a time when the led by Xi Jinping is attempting to take over the world, and when Russia is raping Ukraine,"" Hewitt said.

Keith Kellogg joined ""The Faulkner Focus"" Tuesday to emphasize how important it is for President Biden to realize his ""words matter"" when it comes to Vladimir Putin and Ukraine. Biden insisted Monday he is not ""walking back"" his comment that Putin ""cannot remain in power."" ’S ‘’ : What he said is foolish. Somebody ought to grab him in the Oval Office and say, you need to understand, Mr. President, there's a war going on. Innocent people are dying, cities are being ravaged and destroyed. And your words do matter. … It's very important when it comes to national security. Always look through your opponent's eyes, look through his lens. When you say things, what is he going to get? What kind of reaction you're going to get? I remember with President Trump when we were in the Oval Office, when we were talking to adversaries, we would talk to Kim Jong-un as an example. He was very cautious in his comments, and I challenge anybody to go back and look at what he said about it. He would be pretty hard on our allies. But when it came to Putin or when it came to Kim Jong-un or came to Xi, he was very circumspect when he talked because words do matter. I remind President Biden, you're not talking to this fictional character when you were a lifeguard, Corn Pop, you're talking to somebody who's got a nuclear arsenal that it's the same as ours.

They claim that they support the integrity and territorial sovereignty of Ukraine, at least rhetorically, but they haven't done anything to really help Biden. I think ... that's why the long, long phone calls between Biden and Xi Jinping have not been publicly released.

He falsely claimed that soldiers were training Ukrainian forces in Poland. He said that Putin cannot remain in power, his handlers had to clean up and say this is not the position of the administration, then he pretty much said the same thing yesterday. In a monumental effort to right this ship, Biden staffers think they are clever. They are providing the President of the United States with daily cheat sheets featuring one sentence answers to the most simple, the most basic questions about Joe’s own policies. Ask yourself what kind president needs a note card to answer a basic and predictable question? I’ll say it, I was right before the election, Joe Biden is not well, he is not competent, he’s so cognitively weak that his own staffers are trying to stop him from going off script, which frankly I agree with. It’s a necessary protection in these perilous times.

When I was a kid, I had a dog named Chipper. It was a miniature schnauzer that looked like a tiny German general with mange. You know, think Wolf Blitzer, but with a collar? The dog drove me crazy because we lived on a street between a park and a busy street full of fast cars. And whenever the dog got out, you think it would run to the park to pee or poop, you know, like vagrants and Democrat-run cities. But no, it always ran up the street towards the traffic. And as kids would have to race after him and risk our lives trying to scoop the mutt out of harm's way. It was a weird habit. When offered options to pick the worst one, which seems to be a president's problem. Instead of taking a quiet walk to the park, he just loves to run right into traffic and scream ""World War ."" : We will have a different future, a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light of decency and dignity of freedom and possibilities. For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power. Yes, he just said, ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" ‘’T ,' And sadly, he wasn't talking about himself. He literally brought up regime change, pushing the war into a new phase where our president just validated exactly what Putin was thinking. He may as well have said, ""We're nuking Russia next week unless they do it first."" Thanks, Joe. As we inch closer to negotiations, we just took a giant step back. It's like being on the one-yard line and you get a ten yard penalty for holding. That's baseball cat. Now, I thought our policy wasn't to topple Putin. For us, toppling regimes has worked out about as well as dating a stripper, at least for the people I dated when I was stripping. : Biden threw gas on the fire and at six bucks a gallon, that's really wasteful. If only someone had warned him. ‘ ’: I think the one thing he's got to say, this is where my expertise comes in. Stick to one essential truth. The invasion was a clear violation of international law and don't bring up regime change. Yes. Who got Brad Pitt to be on ""The Five?"" Oh, that was me. They should change the name of the show to the 10. Am I right? Because that's what I am. Right, Martha? But maybe that's a question only the pope can answer. President Joe Biden speaks at the National League of Cities Congressional City Conference, Monday, March 14, 2022, in Washington. The funny part watching the media proclaim how forceful Joe had been in his regime change talk, only to watch it get walked back like an escaped prisoner being returned to his cell. : What a powerful speech that we just heard from President Biden there. : The speech was really, really well done, and it touched on several strategic points. : That line there at the end directly to Putin, I think is the standout line from that entire speech, Wolf. : Yeah, he made it clear he wants Putin gone. : Certainly critical, certainly the message that he wanted to deliver here tonight. But that call at the end in terms of President Putin, that that was something. No question about it. : Obviously, those words, this man cannot remain in power. Very, very strong words. Yeah, so strong in fact, they had to be erased in a panic. A Biden aide said, ""The president's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors in the region. He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia or regime change."" So Joe just forgot to say all of that. Now it's bad enough this administration is telling us what we can and can't say now. They're telling us what we did and we didn't hear. Here's Joe trying to walk back his own words. : I want to make it clear I wasn't then, nor am I now articulating a policy change. I was expressing more outrage that I feel I make no apologies for. All right. But that came after something else he said that was kind of pointless. : You're in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs. … We're going to prevail. Our democracy is going to prevail and the values we share, our autocracies going to prevail. And that's really what's at stake. So what you're doing is consequential, really consequential. . How does this matter to the rest of the world? It only matters to us, and it doesn't shorten the war. It only suggests that the war has a bigger mission for us, like it means more to us than it does to them. But does it? If only someone had warned him about this. ‘ ’ : The invasion was a clear violation of international law. Don't start talking about protecting liberal democracies because places like China and Russia, they don't draw that line. It’s not that important to them, but they do understand violation of international law. You can't get around that statement. Who is that sexy beast? Someone should give that guy a late night show. But there were other gaffes. : Sir, deterrence didn't work. What makes you think Vladimir Putin will alter course based on the action you've taken today? : Let's get something straight. Do you remember if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that. In fact, the sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter. Well, then what's their point? Are sanctions like aromatherapy, where we just pretend it works, but it just stinks up the place? And then there's this: : Ukrainian people have a lot of backbone, a lot of guts, and I'm sure you're observing them. And I don't mean just the military and you're going to see when you're there and have you been there, you're going to see you're going to see women, young people stand on stand in the middle of a damn tank. Saying I'm not leaving. I'm holding my ground. You’re going to see when you’re there. Biden puts his foot in his mouth more than a marooned cannibal. Now, maybe no one takes what Joe says seriously. Maybe the world leaders see our president like Forrest Gump. They laugh and take advantage of them. But this old dog leaves so many messes on the carpet. If only there was a product that could take care of that once and for all. : I am so sick of cleaning up these messes. There's got to be a better way. : Well, then we've got a scoop for you introducing the White House pooper scooper for when the president makes a mess of things perfect for when your boss is talking s--- : For God's sake. This man cannot remain in power. : Or engaged in pissing contests. : And to clarify on chemical weapons could if chemical weapons were used in Ukraine, would that trigger a military response from ? : It would trigger a response in kind. : It even works on verbal diarrhea. : Talking about the significance of the passage of time. Right. The significance of the passage of time. So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time. : Eighty one million people can't be wrong. Order yours today. Shipping may take 12 to 14 months due to supply chain issues. So the White House saw this trip to Brussels as a way to boost the president's sagging numbers. They all these photo ops eating pizza with troops, holding a refugee child - thank God there was no hair sniffing - and meeting with other so-called world leaders. ‘ ’ : ‘ ’ But really, if you wanted to enhance his status, he's just should have stayed home and dated Pete Davidson. It's sad. Joe's been in politics for over five decades. Six if you count his first year as president, he was a Vice President for eight men to a lot of countries, met all the players and of course, knows Ukraine like the back of Hunter's laptop. But in politics, the longer you're in it, the dumber and more detached you become. It's the only profession where experience counts against you. And the higher the stakes, the more Biden screws up. Look, we know Putin violated international law and follows it with bombing the crap out of Ukraine. So why help him at home by indulging his fears? It's just like telling Jesse Waters he's losing his hair. It only makes him angrier. This article was adapted from Greg Gutfeld's opening monologue on the March 28, 2022 edition of ""Gutfeld!""",0

In May 1988, President Ronald and Nancy Reagan made a historic trip to Moscow, in the heart of the Soviet Union. Thirty years later, when I spoke with former Reagan aides for my book, Three Days in Moscow: Ronald Reagan and the fall of the Soviet Empire, they still had vivid recollections of that visit. They remembered the warmth of the people, the desperation and courage of the refuseniks they visited, the opulence of the Grand Kremlin Palace where they met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the ubiquitous presence of agents dressed up as ordinary citizens, asking propaganda-laced questions, and the hope in the eyes of the students who gathered at Moscow State University to hear the president of the United States speak. I’ve often thought of their stories of an empire on the brink of falling, and of Reagan’s unwavering conviction that given an opportunity, people will always choose freedom. That message has new resonance today. : Reagan had come into office nearly eight years earlier an avowed enemy of the Soviet Union. He called it ""the evil empire"" and predicted it would be consigned to ""the ash heap of history."" – , - 31: In this handout from the White House, U.S. President Ronald Reagan shakes hands with a boy as Mikhail Gorbachev looks on during a tour of Red Square May 31, 1988 in Moscow, Soviet Union. ) – - 30: President Ronald Reagan speaks at the Moscow Summit May 30, 1988 in Moscow, .

Soviet and American security men appeared to panic as the crowd surged forward, kicking out and dragging people away. No president had ever used such strident language before. Even Nancy begged him to tone it down. He refused, and the American people were largely behind him. The post-World War generation had lived with the Cold War threat all their lives, and they believed the Soviet Union was the biggest danger to America. Reagan kept the heat on the Soviets in the early years of his presidency, but there seemed to be little room for progress. Then, in 1985, things changed when Mikhail Gorbachev ascended to leadership. Gorbachev was known to have some modern ideas, such as glasnost, which introduced a new openness; and perestroika, a proposal to restructure the old Communist economic model. Reagan took Gorbachev’s measure and declared, ""He’s a new kind of Soviet leader."" – Former President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev attends a symposium on security in Europe 25 years after the fall of the ""Wall"" in Berlin on November 8, 2014. Gorbachev warned in Germany on November 7, 2014, of new East-West tensions sparked by the Ukraine crisis, speaking ahead of ceremonies commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall. ) Reagan and Gorbachev recognized that they had one purpose in common. With nuclear arsenals poised to strike each other at the push of a button, they felt a joint obligation to try and reduce the threat of a nuclear engagement ever occurring. Whether they could manage to wade through decades of hostility to reach common ground remained to be seen. Many American foreign policy experts thought Reagan was hopelessly naïve for trying. But he went ahead with a series of summits with Gorbachev. , , Beginning with the first summit in a lakeside chateau outside Geneva, in November 1985, the two men embarked on a years-long effort to find common ground on relieving the Cold War threat. Their summits were often tense, exhausting, and unproductive, but bit by bit they moved toward certain agreements. In the process they began to understand each other, and they even reached a fragile friendship. Reagan would often spar with Gorbachev, who although more open than his predecessors was still faithful to the Party line. In Reykjavik, Iceland, they came to an icy standoff, with Gorbachev despairingly declaring, ""I don’t know what more I could have done,"" and Reagan responding, ""You could have said yes,"" before walking away. – Left to right: former President, Ronald Reagan , former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, his wife, Raisa , American publishing executive Steve Forbes and former First Lady Nancy Reagan at the Forbes Magazine 75th Anniversary celebration at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, 11th May 1992. ) – , - 16 1990: former President Ronald Reagan and President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev during a meeting in Moscow, Russia, on 16th September 1990. ) – Ronald and Nancy Reagan greet Raisa and Mikhail Gorbachev for a gala dinner given at the White House. – - 30: President Ronald Reagan speaks at the Moscow Summit May 30, 1988, in Moscow, . Reagan makes his first visit to the Soviet Union for the superpower summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. ) It was some time before they met again, but the point is, they did meet again. They never gave up on their grand mission of preventing the likelihood of nuclear conflict. Six months before the Reagans visited Moscow, Gorbachev and his wife Raisa came to Washington, D.C., where the leaders would sign a treaty to reduce intermediate-range nuclear weapons. Gorbachev was hugely popular in America, even as he struggled with declining confidence back home. Americans loved Gorbachev’s western mannerisms, his smile, his fashionable wife. They liked that he called our president by his first name. He seemed to represent a new era. Riding down Connecticut Avenue at the lunch hour, Gorbachev suddenly hopped out of his car and walked, instantly mobbed by crowds of people shouting, ""We love you!"" This successful visit set the stage for the Reagans’ trip to Moscow. While there, Reagan would echo Gorbachev’s populist performance, strolling through Red Square and then taking a spontaneous walk with Nancy in the Arbat neighborhood, where they too were mobbed by cheering locals. Reagan didn’t mind when rough agents arrived to break up the crowd. It made his point. With Gorbachev, Reagan always had a broader objective than just discussing nuclear arms. He often pressured the Soviet leader about human rights concerns and was particularly outspoken about the repression of the Jewish community. He never missed an opportunity to point out the differences between the two nations, speaking of freedoms in the United States that did not exist in the Soviet Union. Though he never revealed it to Reagan, by then Gorbachev knew that the Soviet system was failing. In his 2011 book, The New Russia, Gorbachev wrote of his growing awareness of the Soviet plight: ""A dead-end political situation, economic stagnation, a build-up of unresolved social problems, violation of the rights and dignity of citizens."" The modern world—the free world—was pushing against the limitations of Soviet ideology. The mighty façade was cracking as the republics under Soviet domination, including Ukraine, rebelled and demanded independence. The economy cratered as the foolish quest for dominance, epitomized by the invasion of Afghanistan, took its toll. The Soviet program of empire-building was economically unsustainable. And the people no longer wanted to live that way. The Politburo was increasingly out of touch with the populations under its control. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell amid a popular uprising, as rebellions continued in Soviet states. Ukraine declared its sovereignty in July 1990, and seceded from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1991, in the wake of a failed coup. On Christmas Day 1991, Gorbachev resigned, and the following day the Soviet Union was dissolved. We now know of one man who refused to accept the end of the Soviet Union—Vladimir Putin. At the time of Reagan’s visit, Putin was a young operative stationed in East Germany. Over the years he came to power, often referring to the collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century—and the one he’d most like to reverse. – Russian President Vladimir Putin enters the hall to address Tokyo 2020 Paralympic medalists during the meeting at the Grand Kremlin Palace, on September 13, 2021 in Moscow, Russia. For thirty years he has resented what he perceives as the destruction of the Russian homeland, which extends into other territories. This belief was behind his seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, and it’s behind his invasion of Ukraine. Before the invasion, Putin often declared that Russia and Ukraine were ""one people,"" and therefore belong together. He spoke of disgruntled Russian-speaking populations within Ukraine, and he clearly believed that these groups would celebrate the Russian invasion as a liberation. Yet he has sent bombs and soldiers into those very areas, targeting civilians and destroying their homes, schools and hospitals. Pro-Russia sympathies are dissolving in the face of Putin’s brutality. Russian-speaking Ukrainians are still Ukrainians, and they are fighting back. It’s tempting to speculate about what Reagan would say if he were alive today to witness Putin’s effort to remake the Soviet Union. Reagan never doubted that the Soviet Union was doomed, for the simple fact that a system could not survive without freedom. He believed that its end would not come from outside aggression but from an internal collapse—which is what happened. Reagan thought the Soviet people could be seduced by the promise of self-determination and freedom, and he used his visit to Moscow to gently beckon them toward a better life. The visit culminated in a speech to a mostly young crowd at Moscow State University. There, standing beneath an enormous bust of Lenin, Reagan gazed out at a packed theater and invited them to think differently about the world and end hostilities with the West. In his warm, melodic voice, which his own countrymen knew so well, he tempted them with home truths: I've been told that there's a popular song in your country -- perhaps you know it—whose evocative refrain asks the question, ""Do the Russians want a war?"" In answer, it says: ""Go ask that silence lingering in the air, above the birch and poplar there; beneath those trees the soldiers lie. Go ask my mother, ask my wife; then you will have to ask no more, 'Do the Russians want a war?' But what of your one-time allies? What of those who embraced you on the Elbe? What if we were to ask the watery graves of the Pacific or the European battlefields where America's fallen were buried far from home? What if we were to ask their mothers, sisters, and sons, do Americans want war? Ask us, too, and you'll find the same answer, the same longing in every heart. ""People do not make wars; governments do. And no mother would ever willingly sacrifice her sons for territorial gain, for economic advantage, for ideology. A people free to choose will always choose peace."" Reagan was confident as he spoke to the young Russians about the possibilities of freedom. He knew they were experiencing that longing, as were young people across the Soviet Union. The Cold War terrors were beginning to recede. The possibility of freedom was in the air. The Soviet Union was already falling and there was no turning back.

Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume told ""The Brian Kilmeade Show"" on Wednesday that too many people overlooked President Biden’s failings during his campaign. : Look, people thought back during the campaign when he was running that after all, he was seasoned and he was a nice guy. And he was way better than Donald Trump because you never knew what Donald Trump was going to say or do. [Trump] was entirely volatile, unpredictable, and he was completely self-absorbed, all of which may have been true. But far too many people overlooked Biden's own failings. And now they are front and center because we're in a big crisis in the world. … You talk about domestic issues, there are all kinds of entities in this country, the private sector, the states and localities who can address domestic issues. Foreign policy and defense are uniquely the province of the federal government and the person who is the head of the federal government and has the greatest leeway in power in this area is, of course, the president. And so you pay a very serious price if you have weakness in that job. And we now unmistakably do.",0

Jim Banks, R-Ind., on critics having fears that the Russia invasion of Ukraine could be comparable to the situation in Afghanistan. U.S. Gen. Tod Wolters admitted that President Biden's strategy to deter Russia from invading Ukraine failed during testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. Wolters made the admission in response to questions from Republican Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher. While Gallagher did not reference Biden by name, he questioned Wolters about the effectiveness of the U.S. effort to deter Russia's invasion by non-military means in the months leading up to the invasion. ""You as a combatant commander felt that you were part of an inter-agency effort intended to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine?"" Gallagher asked. : ""That's correct,"" Wolters responded. ""Deter and dissuade."" ""Would it be fair to say that deterrence failed in Ukraine?"" Gallagher pressed. ""Number one I would say that 's solidarity remained,"" Wolters began, before being cut off by Gallagher pressing for a direct answer to the question. ""I can't argue with your conclusion,"" Wolters finished. - The exchange comes as the Biden administration continues to insist its threats of sanctions against Russia were never meant to deter an invasion. ""Let’s get something straight,"" Biden told a reporter who pressed him on the issue Thursday. ""You remember if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter."" Vice President Kamala Harris indicated otherwise when asked whether she believed sanctions would deter Putin in February, however. ""Absolutely – we strongly believe – and remember also that the sanctions are a product not only of our perspective as the United States but a shared perspective among our allies. And the allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because – remember, also – we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment,"" she said at the time. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also stated in a February interview with that the ""purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki also affirmed that the purpose of Biden's sanctions was to have a deterrent effect.",9

News correspondent Yamiche Alcindor offered a warning to the Biden White House following her network released devastating polling data for the president. anchor Andrea Mitchell began the discussion by citing the ""catastrophic"" poll from News that showed President Biden reaching his all-time low from the network at only 40% job approval. : 'S ''S ' , The poll also showed that 38% of Americans blame President Biden and his policies for inflation while only 6% blame Russian President Vladimir Putin, who the Biden administration attempted to pin America's economic woes and soaring gas prices on in the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. President Joe Biden introduces his budget request for fiscal year 2023 in the State Dining Room of the White House on March 28, 2022, in Washington, D.C. Mitchell asked Alcindor how Biden can ""focus on the economy,"" which remains a high-priority issue with voters. ""What this poll essentially tells the president and Democrats is that they have to be messaging better, that they have to be talking about the things that Americans are listing as their priority,"" Alcindor said. ""Ukraine, of course, is something that the president didn't pick to be talking about, but he had to deal with that. And when I talk to White House officials, they understand that there is this this this real messaging issue that has to happen, especially when you look at this poll, the number that jumped out to me was the fact that 38% of Americans are blaming Biden's policies for inflation and gas prices and only 6% are blaming Russia."" 'T ‘ ’ ""Remember that President Biden wanted to call this Putin's price hike. Remember, that was the sort of White House messaging. So this really goes to the idea that the president- and the White House says that they were always been focused on cost of living and the economy, but this really needs to be in some ways a re-centering of that while also having to deal with what's going on abroad."" News correspondent Yamiche Alcindor. Coincidentally, Alcindor sounded the alarm of the Biden administration's ineffective messaging to Andrea Mitchell, who previously touted the White House's ""Putin's Price Hike"" campaign when speaking about the ""potent"" issue of rising gas prices. ""I really do think—in talking to members of Congress—that they now see the politics right now, and it may not last, that the American people are behind this,"" Mitchell told anchor Chuck Todd earlier this month.

Like, that’s another way to message it, I might argue,"" Todd said. ""Yeah,"" Mitchell responded. And ‘Putin’s price hike’ is a great way to message it."" anchor Andrea Mitchell. Mitchell, News' chief foreign affairs correspondent, argued that when the American people see the ""devastating"" pictures coming out of Ukraine, particularly the images of civilians being attacked at hospitals, voters are ""willing to put up with"" the surging prices at the pump, ""at least the Democrats in Congress think."" ""I really thought that the Republican leader Kevin McCarthy was maybe premature in his new messaging that people aren’t blaming President Biden for this- yet,"" Mitchell said.

Russian news outlet , which is owned by the government, reported on the deal, adding that Russia’s share of coal in the Asia-Pacific market has increased by 8% since 2010, with Russia now controlling around 12% of the market – another sign of the increasingly close relationship.

I'm sure he's not hearing everything … In this very top-down centralized command structure, I'm sure there are people who are reluctant to tell him bad news or to offer different opinions.

2022-03-31,https://www.foxnews.com/world/cracks-kremlin,Cracks in the Kremlin,"Oleg Ignatov of the International Crisis Group speaks on Russian President Vladimir Putin's ultimate desire to stay in power. It's been said more than once in recent days that Russian President Putin has likely been misinformed by his security and military services about the war in Ukraine--from the initial prospects for victory to progress on the ground. To date, no one suggests this is part of a conspiracy but rather the result of advisors being afraid to tell Putin things he doesn't want to hear. It may be that now finally, Putin has become clear-headed, seeing that a month in, Russia has not achieved its goals that were supposed to have come with lightning speed. It did not take Ukraine in a couple of days. Without regrouping or changing tack, the path ahead looks long and uncertain. And now Putin's inner circle, which once appeared to be in lockstep about the war and the officially declared reasons for it, is split quite dramatically between those who want to cut Russia's losses and run and those who want to fight until the bitter end, to deliver Ukraine in its entirety to the Russian people. ""Some think that Russia should be realistic about its goals and about its resources,"" Oleg Ignatov of the International Crisis Group told Fox News. Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, listens to Lebedinsky Managing Director Oleg Mikhailov, left, as businessman and founder of Holdings, Alisher Usmanov, right, and Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov stand behind him while visiting the Lebedinsky , in Gubkin, Belgorod Region, Russia, Friday, July 14, 2017. He added that some of the elites actually think taking that position is tantamount to failure: ""They would never say this in public, but if you read carefully some statements or posts on Telegram or on other social networks, and if you talk to people, you can see it. "" ‘ ’ Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey this week set off a firestorm of reaction from those not afraid to talk. ""Nice talks in Turkey!"" sarcastically bellowed one of Russia's top propagandists, personality Vladimir Solovyev on his Wednesday show, apparently railing against Russia's negotiator who had come out of the meetings with positive statements about prospects for a deal, for compromise, with Ukraine. He went on: ""My friend failed to consider that any negotiation with the Nazis, as long as your boot is not on their throat, is perceived as weakness. And you must not shake the hand of this scum. And you must not exchange different formulas with them, ask ‘How you are doing?’, have small-talk. In principle, you don't have to meet them or talk to them."" A destroyed Russian tank is seen after battles on a main road near Brovary, north of Kyiv, Ukraine on Thursday. ""This is what I think. This is my personal opinion. Don't mislead and try to demoralize our people and our troops with such crazy messages like yesterday. The task has been set, and it must be accomplished in its full scope. The task is set in our country only by the commander-in-chief. And you will listen to him only,"" Solovyov said. Skeptics find it hard to believe that any opinion expressed on Russian is personal. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, whose fighters feature prominently in the war in Ukraine, expressed similar sentiments about going all the way. ""Kyiv, I assure you, if you don't come to us on your own, if you don't fulfill all the demands of our Commander in Chief, our President, there will be no mercy for you, for the government, for Rada [Ukraine's parliament ]… for [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. Europe and the West will not save you, because you are criminals, you have killed tens of thousands of people. You will not be left alive. If there's any justice in this world, you're done."" ""Better today to come and ask forgiveness, first from the Ukrainian people, then from the Russian people,"" a wild-looking Kadyrov ranted on his Telegram channel, before signing off with ""Allahu Akhbar!"" Oleg Ignatov believes this could all be part of theater staged by the Kremlin to show that those who want to continue on to Kyiv and not confine fighting to the Donbas, as now appears stated strategy, are people just like Kadyrov. But Ignatov actually believes the divergences of opinions among Russia's power players may be more genuine. 'T , The independent and widely read news website Meduza ran with a long story Thursday about how Russia's presidential administration is struggling with the idea of a climb-down, a scaling back of ambition to the taking of Donbas, and how to project that idea to the public, to package it as something positive, even victorious. ""Citizens were overheated by propaganda. Suppose a decision is made to stop on the territory of Donbas. What about the Nazis then? Are we no longer fighting them? This word has been hammered into people so much that I can’t imagine how one can stop in Donbas without losing ratings,"" Meduza quoted one source, apparently consulting with the presidential administration, as saying. Meduza's sources say the Kremlin is alarmed by those who think talking with Ukraine this week was admission of defeat. Another quote from another supposedly relevant but unnamed strategist was this: ""So much coal was thrown into the locomotive’s furnace, it won’t be possible to stop it right away."" Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko leave a joint news conference following their talks in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Friday, Feb. 18, 2022. According to Meduza, the Kremlin wants secret polls for their own people and supporters to truly understand what the inner circle and core Russian supporters/believers feel about the war and what it needs to achieve in order to minimize fallout from a climb-down. And Oleg Ignatov of the Crisis Group says actually those purges — that ""cleansing"" Putin talked about last week — may not be just for dissident voices in society and the ""foie gras addicted"" fans of gender choice. Purges, cleansing, ""clearances"" as Ignatov calls them, may well be aimed largely at the elite to clear the way for Putin's political preservation. He can't win another election or two without them on board. ""If a peace deal with Ukraine is not in favor of Russia,"" Ignatov says, ""it means that he will make decisions inside Russia, so he will have to consolidate power. Yes, he will make some clearances. He will have to clear his team.""",0

After speaking with a panel of guests, Todd circled back to the polls and became visibly frustrated at the idea Americans believe the country is in a recession or depression. ""It’s just not true.

After reading an ""alarming"" statistic that Biden’s job approval rating had fallen to the lowest level of his presidency, Ruhle boasted about Biden’s Ukraine response before moving on to the state of the economy. ""….while inflation here at home is still a big problem, jobless rates are the lowest that they have been in more than 50 years, and the American people recover from -19, so does our economy. But, that is not translating to the American vote,"" Ruhle said. Ruhle then asked contributor Charlie Sykes why Biden was not ""reaping … the benefits"" in the polls. ""These are big wins,"" she added before allowing Sykes a response. Earlier in March following Biden’s State of the Union, Ruhle said the president ""needs to do more talking"" about his ""economic wins"" in order to ensure Democrats are not defeated in the midterms. Earlier in the night, she complained about Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, R., talking about inflation and quickly moved the discussion to claim that Biden had created 6.5 million U.S. jobs. On March 15, guest host Garrett Haake also wondered why Biden had not seen improvement in his poll numbers despite his ""popular"" stance on Russia's invasion into Ukraine.

Soon after the first bombs exploded in multiple towns, he enlisted in the armed forces and has since visited more than a dozen war affected towns across the country. ""The most effective way for me was to use my popularity to inspire people and boost the morale of those who fight for our country. I wanted to be useful,"" says Vakarchuk who, for the last month, has been performing in the most unusual places - from underground bomb shelters to children’s hospitals and to empty streets of war-torn towns. Leader of the Holos Party Sviatoslav Vakarchuk is pictured during the presentation of the party's regional branch and campaign staff, Vinnytsia, central Ukraine. Vakarchuk’s band Okean Elzy is the most decorated Ukrainian rock band with a record of bringing the biggest crowds in Kiev during the 2004 Orange Revolution and 2013 Euromaidan protests. ‘ ’ 'S , , ‘ ,' When asked by Fox News how it feels to stand in the center of an underground metro station turned into a bomb shelter and perform patriotic songs? - ""Absolutely relevant to the situation,"" he answers, adding ""you understand that now you need to sing to these people in the underground because these people need you much more than all the fans you sing to during peaceful times."" A post shared by Святослав Вакарчук Slava Vakarchuk is a household name in Ukraine. From debuting in 1994 as the band's vocalist to twice becoming a member of parliament and creating his own political party - 46-year-old singer has a long-standing history of social and political activism. Okean Elzy band leader Sviatoslav Vakarchuk performs during the Ark Ukraine: Ten Centuries of Ukrainian Music concert in Mykhailivska Square in celebration of the 30th anniversary of Ukraine's independence, Kyiv, capital of Ukraine. In the 2019 parliamentary elections Vakarchuk’s party ""Holos"" secured 20 of 423 seats as the opposition party. Now that seems like ancient history: ""there is no opposition today, everybody is supporting the government, the president, and we are all one team fighting against Russia."" Ultimately, Vakarchuk left both parliament and the party. When asked if he ever regretted the decision, he quickly answers him and politics was never a ""love story"". ""It is something I couldn't help doing, because I felt it was the right place and right application of my efforts. I was trying to change the political landscape, especially when I created the party. My desire was to bring new people to parliament.

Lead vocalist Sviatoslav Vakarchuk is pictured during an impromptu open-air concert of the Okean Elzy rock band on the pedestrian and cycling bridge across Volodymyrskyi Descent, Kyiv, capital of Ukraine. Okean Elzy has refused to perform in Russia since 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, a decision he calls solid. ""You cannot perform in the country that annexed your territory and pretend nothing happened."" And he stood by that decision for 8 years. When asked if he can imagine ever performing in Russia again, he says, he is not ready to answer the question. ""Asking this today is like asking Albert Einstein in 1936 if he could see himself ever going to Germany. The answer is - I don’t know. It's very difficult to predict.

Some of Okean Elzy’s old hits are finding a new light in wartime, like ""Bez boyu""- in which Vakarchuk vows to not surrender without putting up a good fight, just like his country, something Vakarchuk prides himself on. ""Ukraine today is the bravest nation in the world, and I mean it. It is true that we did not have a choice, we had to fight. But we had a choice on how to fight and the way we've chosen makes me very proud. Everyone from generals to soldiers, to nurses and ordinary drivers is trying to do their best for Ukraine’s victory."" 'S : 4 'S As somebody who has spent some time in the States as a fellow at the Yale and Stanford universities and performed in many corners of the world, Vakarchuk believes, Ukrainian’s today are fighting for values that Americans created. ""I think that it is an obligation of the Western civilization to make some sacrifice when Ukraine is making such a big sacrifice to fight the common enemy, who wants to destroy the very foundation of what the free world means."" Okean Elzy’s other hit that came up during his interview with Fox News is ""Obiymy"" , the lyrics of which say ""when the day comes, the war will end."" Fox News asked him what he is looking forward to once that day comes. ""To see my family and to kiss my young son"", he says. Vakarchuk’s 28-year-old daughter volunteers in Lviv, and they manage to meet once in a while, but he has not seen his 9-month-old son since the war erupted.",6

Kevin Cramer for criticizin the media as Todd asked him about Donald Trump's recent remarks about Vladimir Putin and Hunter Biden. A conversation between ’s Chuck Todd and Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., quickly became heated when Cramer claimed the media would have treated the Hunter Biden laptop story differently if he was one of former President Donald Trump’s children. Todd pressed Cramer Thursday over recent comments he made regarding Trump’s call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to release information pertaining to Hunter Biden. ""Well I don’t know if he has dirt on Biden. If he does, he should reveal it, but he is a war criminal so I don’t expect that he’s right now sitting around thinking about ways he can [reveal information],"" Cramer said earlier this week. ' ' 2020 ’s Chuck Todd tries to get Sen. Pat Toomey to criticize his own party over voting rights during an appearance on ""Meet the Press."" Todd asked Cramer about his comments and why the U.S. should trust propaganda or anything Putin had to say about Biden's son. Cramer responded that he was being ""sarcastic"" in his comments on the subject and said he found the question ""interesting"" considering the media’s obsession with ""Russia collusion."" ""We were going to believe everything that was coming out of Russia a few years ago when it was about Donald Trump,"" Cramer said. A few moments later, Todd pressed Cramer again, asking him if he stood by the former president’s statements about Hunter Biden and Putin, calling Trump’s comments ""horrendous"" and ""a bit unpatriotic."" 'S : ‘A --A- ’ The New York Times confirmed the authenticity of Hunter Biden's infamous laptop on March 16, 2022. ) ""Here’s the reality,"" Cramer began. ""If Hunter Biden’s name was Donald Trump Jr. or Eric Trump you guys would be treating the war in Ukraine like— ""Don’t what-about … Enough of this,"" Todd interjected, waving his hand. """"That is the laziest attack. It is not about the media. It doesn’t matter about the media."" ""It’s also honest,"" Cramer said as the two continued to speak over each other. The conversation continued on, with Cramer later saying that what Trump said is ""nothing compared"" to how Biden is handling the Russia-Ukraine conflict. He added that it was perhaps not the ""wisest thing"" for Trump to say, considering that the source of the information, Putin, is not credible. ""Once again Donald Trump baited you all and you all took the bait. Now we’re having a discussion about the Bidens,"" Cramer said. Todd retorted he wouldn't debate whether Trump gets too much coverage but, like it or not, Trump was the leader of the Republican Party.",9

He was convicted in 2020 and sentenced to nine years in prison. Joey and Paula Reed, parents of U.S. Marine Corps veteran and Russian prisoner Trevor Reed, stand in Lafayette Park near the White House, Wednesday, March 30, 2022, in Washington. Since then, Biden administration officials have repeatedly called for the release of Reed, as well as Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive from Michigan who is jailed in Russia on espionage-related charges his family says are bogus. The White House says both men are being wrongly detained. Joey and Paula Reed of Granbury, Texas, traveled to Washington this week to seek an in-person meeting with Biden after a phone conversation earlier this month when the president visited Texas. After the Reeds had stood along the route of Biden’s motorcade in Texas in hopes it would stop — it did not — the White House said it would work to schedule a meeting. A poster photo of U.S. Marine Corps veteran and Russian prisoner Trevor Reed stands in Lafayette Park near the White House, Wednesday, March 30, 2022, in Washington. On Wednesday evening, the couple met in the Oval Office with Biden and some senior administration officials for more than a half hour, according to Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for the Reed family. He declined to discuss specifics of the meeting. White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the meeting and said the president’s national security team would remain in contact with the Reeds. : ',' ""During their meeting, the President reiterated his commitment to continue to work to secure the release of Trevor, Paul Whelan, and other Americans wrongfully held in Russia and elsewhere, and to provide all possible assistance until they and others are free and returned home to their families who are advocating so passionately for their release,"" Psaki said.",18
2022-03-31,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-news-trey-yingst-on-reporting-in-ukraine,Fox News' Trey Yingst on reporting in Ukraine: It's important to highlight the 'moments of humanity',"The Fox News foreign correspondent joined 'America's Newsroom' to recount his firsthand view of the Ukrainian resistance. Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reflected on his time reporting from the ground in Ukraine during the ongoing invasion from Russia. After spending five weeks in the war-torn nation, Yingst returned to the U.S. and appeared on the ""Fox Across America"" radio show, where he described his job as being ""the calm amid the storm."" ""There's a lot of chaos around us depending on the war zone. Sometimes it's rocket fire, sometimes it's a ballistic missile, sometimes it's small arms fire,"" Yingst told Fox News' Jimmy Failla. ""And you got to breathe, you've got to relax, understand that if you're panicking, or you're running around, you can't get the story out. And you also have to remember that people are relying on you to give them a clear picture of what's happening on the ground. They understand there's chaos, they understand that Russia has invaded a sovereign country, so how do we distill this down in a way that people can grasp but then ultimately care about?"" : ‘ ’ ""Because I don't think I'd be doing my job correctly if I simply showed people what was happening and didn't think about the impact that these events could have on their lives down the road but also could have on the lives of the people that we are talking to. You have to make people care about people,"" Yingst said. Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst conducts an interview on the ground in Ukraine alongside Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova, who were both later killed in an attack. Yingst shared that his reporting from war zones has given him ""incredible perspective,"" specifically in Ukraine where he met ""thousands of people who are fleeing their homes"" among the millions displaced during the Russian invasion. ""I’ve covered a lot of war zones and this one feels to me, and it could be in part because we’re in the middle of this war right now, this one feels different in the way that there is still room for this humanity to shine through,"" Yingst said. ""But it is so widespread and so serious for the entire population of Ukraine that it’s limited in how much people are lighthearted because they are literally experiencing a nightmare. It’s unfolding all around them. It’s the sirens. When there are air raids, it’s the explosions in the distance. It’s watching their children or trying to shield their children from seeing bodies in the streets. It’s these really heavy, heavy things."" ""But amid that, there are these moments of humanity, and sometimes it’s just helping an old lady across a bridge that’s been bombed out, and she’s escaping her home. Sometimes, as we saw in the metro system of Kyiv, someone sharing a piece of bread with another person who is sheltering, trying to get away from the bombing. And so you have all of these moments together, and I think it’s important to highlight them in our coverage because it’s really easy amid the chaos to just focus on the bombs and the bullets and the loud bangs that happened behind us. But we have to, as journalists, dig into that and figure out, well, who’s affected here and how do we make people care about their story,"" Yingst continued.

2022-04-01,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-democrats-benefitting-biden-energy-crisis,Tucker Carlson: Democrats are the ones benefitting from Biden's energy crisis,"Fox News host provides insight on U.S. energy policies as gas prices rise on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Pretty much everybody in America feels awful about what is happening right now to average Ukrainians. They didn't ask for this war and they're really suffering so your heart goes out. You feel compassion for tragedy no matter where it is, whether it's a landslide in Sri Lanka or a war in Ukraine. So, you feel compassionate. On the other hand, you may have, at some point over the last month, asked yourself: ""Why is the invasion of a faraway eastern European country suddenly the single biggest thing that ever happened in our country, in America?"" It's kind of strange, especially given everything we've got going on in the U.S. right now and what is it with Biden's response to this war? That's weird, too. Biden keeps telling us these energy sanctions are going to crush Putin, but they haven't. That's clearly not true. Putin's fine. The ruble has almost completely recovered since the day Russia invaded. So much for destroying the Russian economy and getting the Russian military to withdraw from Ukraine and yet we in the U.S. are paying higher and higher gas prices thanks to these sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a cabinet meeting via video conference at the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, March 23, 2022. So, Biden is not hurting Vladimir Putin. Biden is hurting American citizens. Why? What exactly is this about? Well, the first thing you should know and never forget is that nothing changes a society faster than a war, even a war in another country. If you want to reorder a society, you're going to need a major crisis in order to do it. The democratic process is not going to work for you. The democratic process will never get you to total transformation because voters almost never want systemic change. They prefer incremental improvement and that's why they tend to elect the very same people to office year after year. They do that because radicalism—big change—scares them. They are not looking —and they are never looking —for massive, abrupt changes to the way they live. So again, if you want a revolution, you're going to need some kind of emergency to justify it. Let's say, for example, that you wanted to change a country's 250-year-old system of voting in order to make that system much more vulnerable to mass election fraud, which you would commit. How would you go about doing something like that? You couldn't do it by referendum. No. You might need to declare a public health emergency and then institute vote-by-mail in the name of fighting a pandemic. You should try that because that might work. Or, for another example, how would you go about taking full control over an economy built on fossil fuels? Well, you'd first have to break the existing economy because if you gave people a choice over how to power their vehicles, homes and businesses, not many of them would choose windmills. No, they'd go with what they have, which is oil and gas. So, you'd have to take that choice away from them. You couldn't let them choose and you couldn't do this by democratic means because no legislature would ever vote for a change like that because they know voters don't want it. So instead, you might use a war underway across the world to declare an energy shortage in your country and then make fossil fuels unaffordable for the average person and that way, people would have no choice but to switch over to the new system, which, not incidentally, you and your friends and your donors would control. So that'd be one way, maybe the only way to get a Green New Deal, without having to get it through Congress because it never would go through Congress. Hmm. Do you think that's what's happening here? You'd hate to think so. You wouldn't want to think that your government would intentionally exacerbate the suffering of millions of Ukrainian civilians in order to take over America's energy grid, but that seems to be exactly what is happening right now and we know this because the administration has essentially told us up. As of tonight, the vast majority of electricity that we use in this country for everything but 80% of our electricity comes from just three sources—natural gas, coal and nuclear energy. The Biden administration has pledged to get rid of all three of these things. There will be no more coal plants, Joe Biden said during the campaign. John Kerry, our climate czar, agreed. No more coal plants operating in the United States by 2030, he said—no clue in how we're going to power the cities that are totally dependent on coal fired electricity. Here's Joe Biden explaining that electricity for your home, your city, electric cars, all of it pretty darn soon is going to come from heat pumps and solar panels. : Under my plan, which is before the Congress now, we can take advantage of the next generation of electric vehicles that a typical driver will save about $80 a month from not having to pay gas at the pump. If your home is powered by safer, cheaper, cleaner electricity like solar or heat pumps, you can save about $500 a month on average. President Biden speaks about status of the country's fight against -19 in the South Court Auditorium on the White House campus, Wednesday, March 30, 2022, in Washington. 2 , ‘’ Wow. So, we just need to completely change the way that you power your home. We're going to get rid of coal, gas and nuclear energy and you can save on average some more $500 a month. You just have to power your house with solar panels. It's simple. So, where will these solar panels come from? Well, as it happens, they will come from China. We can be certain of that because the Chinese make more than 80% of all the world's solar panels, which is to say, all of them. So, we're going to be even more reliant, far more reliant on Chinese manufacturing than we already are. Offend the Chinese and no more electricity. So that's a risk, considering they despise us, but it's going to be worth it, Joe Biden says. We're going to upend the entire U.S. economy and make ourselves completely dependent on a country that seeks to displace us. But you're going to save 500 bucks a month on your energy bill - $500 a month, not a small thing, but it's not actually true. Shortly after Biden spoke, in a ritual we're becoming very used to, the White House issued a clarification. It turns out that Biden meant to say—and if he wasn't senile, would have said—that you're going to save $500 a year. So, that's one-twelfth of what he promised if we turn over our electricity production to China. So, $500 a year, not a month. So, he was only off by about $5,500 bucks. On the other hand, $500 a year is still something. It's enough to fill your maybe three times. 42 , , : It costs tech entrepreneur Mo Hassan $140 every two days to fill up his 2021 Cadillac Escalade when he cruises the streets of Southern California. … Prices vary depending on where you buy. At many stations, it's still way above $7 a gallon. Still the highest in the country, though, we've had a dip of a few cents in recent days. Hardly a game changer. Oh, it's just $7.50 a gallon, not a big deal. It's always been this way. Oh no, it hasn't. Pretty soon they'll tell you that, but we just want to say, for the record, that that's not true. In 2018, which is not ancient history, the average price of a gallon of gasoline in the state of California, most expensive for the country, was $3.60 per gallon. Now it's double that. How did that happen? Does it have anything to do with the current president's pledge to ""phase out fossil fuels forever?"" Gasoline is a fossil fuel. He wants to phase it out. It shouldn't surprise you that it's more expensive. Or could it be Vladimir Putin's fault? Did Putin do it? Here's what PragerU found out when they spoke to people who are actually buying gas. Americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2008 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon. : Why do you think that the gas prices have gotten so high? : Well, I think it's to do with maybe all the sanctions on Russia, part of it. : The United States stopped importing Russian oil or something to that effect. I don't know if I have the details are quite right, but that's what I think. : Part of that is definitely true. A lot of it is somewhat because America isn’t energy independent. We don't produce a lot of our own energy anymore, but Russian oil is only about 3 % of the oil that America gets. The price of gas was going up before Russian oil. : If we had our own energy, our own oil production... : It would be a lot...easier and a lot more self-reliant. A lot more reliable, too. Yeah, that's a very interesting thought. I've not thought about that before. That's a pretty interesting response. People know it has something to do with Russia. They've been told it's all Putin's fault. The kind, you know, there's a connection between the sanctions against Russian energy and our own rising gas prices. What they don't understand is it's much deeper than that. They're blaming Russia. So, there's a reason the people pushing this war love this war. It's an all-purpose excuse for the disasters they have made, the disasters that benefit them, but if you take a look at the numbers you see, there's a lot more going on here than just a war in Ukraine, no matter what they tell you. ‘ ’ In February of 2021, a year after the corona pandemic began and a month after Donald Trump left office, the average price of gas the United States was about $2.50. Since then, the price of gas has continued to rise. By last November, months before the Russian invasion, the per gallon average was $3.39. So, no, the war in Ukraine did not do this. Putin did not do this. Putin didn't, by the way, sanction himself. Energy inflation is a direct and intended result of White House policies. The whole point of these policies is to make it impossible for you to use fossil fuels because you can't afford it and then substitute those fossil fuels, which you could afford with new green energy that you have no choice but to use. They're saying that essentially out loud. Here's the Speaker of the House, third in line to the presidency, Nancy Pelosi. She explained that even though we probably could fix this problem by producing more of our own energy in the United States, which we own, which is the root of our prosperity, we're not going to do that because cheap oil would devalue her family's investments in renewable. Sorry, we didn't mean to say that. We mean cheap oil would destroy the planet. : We cannot allow the fossil fuel industry to use this as an excuse to reverse everything we're doing to save the planet. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks to reporters during her weekly press conference at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 13, 2022. Did you read that? ""Everything we're doing to save the planet."" Now these are the people who preside over the dirtiest state out of 50—California — who don't go outside except in their own walled gardens, who know nothing about the environment, who couldn't care less about the environment, who are trashing the environment and who were raising your gas prices in the name of the environment, so their families grow rich. ""We can't stop what we're doing."" She's just saying it, right up there in English, ""We're doing this,"" which they are. So, this is a lady with huge estates all over the country who brags that she has a $30,000 freezer telling you, you're just have to suck it up and be poor for the planet she doesn't care about at all. So, who's benefiting from this? China's benefiting from it. We already told you that. That's obvious, but the Biden administration's donors are benefiting from it, too, and one of them is now the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm. Thanks to reporting from the Washington Free Beacon, which we are grateful for, we know that Jennifer Granholm held millions of dollars in stock in so-called green energy companies while she was serving as the secretary of energy. : Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Nov. 23, 2021, in Washington. So, you hold energy stocks while you're the secretary of energy? Hmm, where's the Justice Department? Jennifer Granholm did not sell these equities, even after she took office. Is that a conflict of interest? Of course, it is. It's criminal, but Jennifer Granholm didn't seem bothered. She knew she would never be charged with anything. The Biden administration isn't bothered, either. This is the whole game. Make your donors rich by saving the planet. Jennifer Granholm is still running the Energy Department. Here she is explaining that her stock portfolio would really benefit if we ""decarbonized the fossil fuel industry."" : We want to invest in renewables. We want to invest in the technologies that decarbonize the fossil fuel industry. To become energy independent with clean energy is the medium to long-term strategy. It does kind of answer one enduring mystery. Why would they put someone in as secretary of energy who knows nothing about energy, never been in the energy business, has no idea what the energy grid is, has no clue how your iPhone is charged overnight—none at all—and yet she's the secretary of energy? Oh, because it's an investment scam and they're all in on it. Check investments right now in renewable energies since the manmade energy crisis that Joe Biden and his sanctions set off and you'll see it's quite a robust market right now. Who's benefiting from that? Right, people like Jennifer Granholm. She wants to force you to subsidize her investments. That's the medium to long-term strategy and no crisis in the last decade has given them better cover than the invasion of the client state of Ukraine that Jennifer Granholm can't even find on a map. There's a reason they're focused on Ukraine and it's to give you the Green New Deal, whether you want it or not.",0

'T ‘ ’ After Harris recapped her recent visit to Europe, Reid continued her line of questioning about Putin by asking if the sanctions should remain in place ""as long as Vladimir Putin is the dictator of Russia.""

""And we will continue to upgrade them and make them so — more severe as appropriate.

We are seeing a location that was so clearly designated as being a shelter, a place of safety for children. We are seeing … millions of people being displaced, potentially permanently, in a war that was instigated, unprovoked, unjustified, against a whole population of people."" ""So you know, the sanctions are going to be severe and they will last as long as these atrocities and this aggression is continuing,"" Harris added.

2022-04-02,https://www.foxnews.com/media/gop-lawmaker-mike-gallagher-biden-putin-ukraine,GOP lawmaker blasts Biden's 'soft power' diplomatic approach to Russian aggression,"Paul Gigot interviews Wisconsin Congressman Mike Gallagher Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., blamed the Biden administration's ""soft power"" approach as the reason deterrence ""failed"" in Ukraine, highlighting diplomacy and the threat of sanctions Saturday on ""Journal Editorial Report."" : We had a hearing with the European Command commander this week, and it was unsatisfying. The administration could not provide coherent answers on why we have yet to figure out how to take the Slovakians up on their offer to provide the S-300 Air Defense System. This is sort of the similar story we saw with the Polish MiG-29 fiasco. The Pentagon got caught flat-footed and can't figure out with the sense of urgency how to make this work. So as much as there is bipartisan support for arming the Ukrainians, I still think the administration is not moving quickly enough. I still think there is more we can do to help Zelenskyy and put him in the strongest possible position going forward, and the administration just continues to be guided by a fear of provoking Putin. That's really what's guided their efforts from the start. And I think that's why we're somewhat behind the curve. … Having watched this pretty closely and more to the point, what we've seen from the administration is, at the same time, they're reticent to move more quickly. And at the same time, the war is still very much underway, and it could escalate in ways that we don't foresee. They're bragging about the success of their approach. There are anonymous Pentagon officials that are bragging about the success of so-called integrated deterrence. Integrated deterrence is the intellectual foundation of their forthcoming National Defense Strategy. It's basically a jargon buzzword, academic slang intended to cover for what they're actually trying to do, which is cut conventional hard power. The reason that deterrence, in fact, failed in Ukraine, despite the fact that they're saying it succeeded, is because we relied solely on soft power, specifically, the threat of sanctions and ""hashtag"" diplomacy. And we signal that every step that we were unwilling to use hard power. That's a recipe for failure going forward.",0

2022-04-03,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ronald-reagan-volodymyr-zelenskyy-michael-mcgonigle,"Without Ronald Reagan, there would be no Volodymyr Zelenskyy","John Heubusch, executive director for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, hosts Bill Hemmer and 'America's Newsroom' at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. For the last month, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been rallying his people against the vicious brutality of Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Facing near unsurmountable odds, the former comedian has been dodging bullets and bombs – but he’s only been in a position to do so because a former president of another time dodged death from the bullets of would-be-assassin John Hinckley’s gun. President Zelenskyy was 3 years old on March 30, 1981, when Ronald Reagan emerged from the Washington Hilton. Reagan had just delivered a speech to the -. As he waved and smiled to those outside on that rainy Tuesday, the 40th president was struck by a single bullet that broke a rib and punctured and collapsed his left lung, lodging itself just one inch from his heart. Miraculously, Reagan survived. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks from Kyiv, Ukraine, as he addresses virtually addresses Congress on Wednesday, March 16, 2022. A man of deep Christian faith, Ronald Reagan long attributed his unlikely recovery to a ""Divine Plan"" – a belief that God had spared him for a very specific purpose. Recounting the moment in his diary later that day, he wrote, ""Whatever happens now I owe my life to God and will try to serve Him in every way I can."" In the weeks and months that followed, President Reagan became convinced he had been spared for a singular purpose: to rid the world of atheistic Soviet communism. To Reagan, there was no greater injustice than preventing access to the Gospel and therefore eternal salvation. Throughout his presidency, Reagan laid the groundwork for the collapse of the Soviet Union. He believed the best defense was a strong offense, but he also appealed and collaborated with another fellow anti-communist – Pope John Paul . They believed faith was even stronger than all the armies of the world. They also shared a similar animosity for the wicked communist ideology, believing it enslaved and killed millions of innocent people. During his second term, Reagan also forged a unique and consequential relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev, who served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the ill-fated Soviet Union. When Ronald Reagan left office in January of 1989, the pieces were in place for the collapse of communism – though no one suspected it would happen as quickly as it did. Soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Reagan’s two friends - Gorbachev and Pope John Paul – met at the Vatican. During their discussions the pope zeroed in on Ukraine, demanding the Catholic Church and religion be made legal in the country. Moved by the pontiff’s appeal, Mr. Gorbachev promised there would be laws passed to protect freedom of religion – and that’s precisely what happened. Pope John Paul shakes hands with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in the first meeting between a Kremlin chief and a pontiff, at the Vatican on Dec. 1, 1989. Volodymyr Zelenskyy was thirteen years-old on August 24, 1991 when Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union. In an instant, the youngster was free of communist oppression and free to pursue his dreams. By the age of seventeen, he was an entertainer, traveling as a comedian and actor throughout eastern Europe. When the now Ukrainian president announced plans to run for office in 2018, he said he was motivated by a desire ""to bring professional, decent people to power"" and to ""change the mood and timbre of the political establishment."" Sound familiar? President Reagan speaking at Moscow State University during a summit, May 30, 1988. When Governor Reagan announced his campaign on March 31, 1976 to challenge incumbent Gerald Ford for the presidency, he said: ""I would like to be president, because I would like to see this country become once again a country where a little six-year-old girl can grow up knowing the same freedom that I knew when I was six years-old, growing up in America."" Without President Reagan surviving the attempt on his life in 1981, there would have been no independent Ukraine in 1991 – and no President Zelenskyy in 2019. In many ways, Zelenskyy is now following in Ronald Reagan’s footsteps, surviving attempts on his life while battling an ideology that threatens to destroy the lives and freedoms of all Ukrainians. It’s the role of a lifetime – some would even say a ""Divine Plan"" and one that has been decades in the making.",6

""Indeed, this is genocide,"" Zelenskyy said during a ""Face the Nation"" interview on . ""The elimination of a whole nation, and the people -- we are citizens of Ukraine."" ""We have more than a hundred nationalities. This is about destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,"" Zelenskyy told host Margaret Brennan. ""We are the citizens of Ukraine and we don’t want to be subdued to the policy of Russian Federation. This is the reason we are being destroyed and exterminated. And this is happening in the Europe of the 21st century. So this is the torture of the whole nation."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy heads to a meeting with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, April 1, 2022. Brennan asked Zelenskyy whether he believed the world would ""actually make good on this promise"" to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin responsible for war crimes, prompting him to say that everything ""has to be fair and according to justice, as the civilized world will decide."" Zelenskyy went on to say that he doesn't believe it is ""fair"" to only hold Putin accountable and punish him, adding, ""I think all of the military commanders, everyone who gave instructions and orders should be punished adequately."" However, he said that the ""adequate punishment"" for these people is ""difficult to be achieved."" ""It has to be done according to the law and what they have done,"" Zelenskyy continued.

2022-04-04,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-russia-ukraine-war-trump-deterrence,How Biden could prevent another Russia-Ukraine type war with a Trump model of deterrence,"Historian Victor Davis Hanson on how Biden could have avoided various quandaries in Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 'The Ben Domenech Podcast.' Hoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson explains how the Biden administration could have avoided the various quandaries it has encountered in its handling of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on a new episode of ""The Ben Domenech Podcast"" on Fox News Audio. : I think we were getting there with Trump. For all of his excesses – the people who were around him, his national security advisers and people who were advising him – I think he did get to a Jacksonian common ground. And by that, I think it's similar to what you and I were talking about, and that is, you create deterrence abroad, and you don't screw with the United States. Whether that's taking out Baghdadi, who is responsible for killing U.S. people, or your 200 Russian mercenaries, and you attack an American installation in what is now the Wagner Group, you're going to get rid of them, or whether it's Soleimani, who has caused so much mayhem. But you're not going to get on an expeditionary, optional, huge military engagement or even something like Libya. Trump did not want to go in and create a no-fly zone between Turkey and Kurdistan. And the never-Trump right went crazy, they didn't want to do that, but that was wise. , : '', '', '' And so we were kind of saying, ""no better friend, no worse enemy."" But we weren't going to try to remake the world in our own image. And that sometimes meant to North Korea, if you want to talk crazy stuff, we can talk crazy stuff, and we've got a lot better deterrent against you than you do against us. And so for that four-year period, we did some pretty Jacksonian things – I mean, going and taking out a lot of bad people. But you know, we destroyed , and we backed North Korea into a corner. Yet we moved the embassy to Jerusalem, we said that Golan Heights are not going back. But if it wasn't for the hysteria over the Russian collusion hoax, the Alfa Bank hoax, the laptop hoax, I think Trump would have had more latitude still. But he was getting to a point, in the art of the deal style, where he was back to the Kissinger formula that China will never be a better friend of Russia than it will be to us. And the same was true of Russia – it won't be a better friend of China than it is to us. And within that triangulation, you have a sense of stability. The only thing that has changed now is that Russia's the weaker of the three rather than China. Russia has a lot of national interests that are not the same as China. They have a border. They've had problems in the past and China vis-a-vis – and it seems to me that we really just handed over that Russian card, a realist card, to play against China. We shouldn't have done that. In terms of existential threats, obviously short-term Russia is scaring everybody because they've got all this oil and the oil price is high, and they've got all these nukes, and they're talking promiscuously about using them. But long term, it's China, and that's right. Former President Trump and President Biden What we do in Ukraine and vis-a-vis Russia at this late date, how we got here, I think, will be a discussion because it could have been prevented had we armed the Ukrainians with Javelins much earlier, so they had maybe 20,000 anti-tank weapons and s rather than, you know, 500 or 600 the first day of the war. Had we pumped oil and kept it up to 13 or even gone up to 14 or 15 million barrels, we wouldn't have been in this situation. Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, June 5, 2019. /Evgenia Novozhenina/Pool Nevertheless, I think, if we can deter Russia – and that means that he {Putin] doesn't take most of Ukraine and he pays a big price – then I think China will – they're already hedging a little bit. If you look at their communiques, they thought this was the blueprint for Taiwan, and they would be legitimized by the world. So when they did it to Taiwan, it would be just as easy and nobody would complain. Now they're thinking second thoughts, I think. What if the Taiwanese fought like the Ukrainians. What if they parachuted, Javelins, s and stingers in there? What if they did these sanctions on us? Like, what if these Europeans that were our puppets, what if they got on their hind legs and reacted toward us? And so what if we lost 380,00 students in the United States and they all had to be sent home? So I think that you can start to see the formulation of what we can do if we have somebody there that knows what he's doing. Unfortunately, we don't. "" "":",0
2022-04-04,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-ukraine-war-military-mistake-putin-armed-forces-expert,"Russia’s Ukraine war a colossal military mistake, armed forces expert tells Fox News","Armed Forces expert calls the Ukrainian war a ""colossal mistake"", given the lack of equipment and dwindling soldier numbers. To say nothing of the evidence of war crimes, the Ukraine war was a colossal military mistake, according to one Russian armed forces expert and veteran of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. And he says it boggles the mind of many like him. It’s not that the Russian soldiers were lacking good equipment, food or warm clothing, as many have said, according to Valery Shiryaev. It’s that there were far too few of them to do what their president wanted them to do, which Shiryaev said was the impossible. The U.S. and its coalition partners dispatched half a million soldiers to fight the first Gulf War in circumstances under which you could argue Saddam Hussein had less support on his side than the Ukrainian president has right now as his country fights an existential battle. Compare that to the fact Russia had less than a quarter of that number – a mere 120,000 lined up for the invasion of Ukraine, something Shiryaev never actually thought would happen, until it did. , : ‘’, ‘’, ‘’ Shiryaev, a veteran of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, said this war has been like none other this century, with men on both sides who are similar in culture and who fight the same way, or at least come from the same experience. The Red Army may be long gone, but some legacy must carry on in the republics of the former . That led Shiryaev to ponder how the Russians even thought about waging this war in the first place. ""It’s a big mystery!"" the military expert explained. ""There was an opinion among military experts that an attack was not rational. Everyone assumed [Russian President Vladimir] Putin as a politician acts rationally,"" Shiryaev continued. ""If a politician is dominated by emotions, he can make a mistake."" And, Shiryaev said the war in Ukraine was ""a colossal"" one. He described it as a shared miscalculation between the different agencies that were studying the situation, from Russia's security agency known as the to foreign intelligence to military intelligence. He, like many others, wondered whether these generals and spies were too timid to tell Putin the truth and exactly how the decision to go in was made. , '' He also pointed to the underestimation of Ukraine’s resolve. ""I don’t get it. We all know Ukrainians – they are our brothers. We know them as ourselves. They would never surrender, just as Russians would never surrender if they were attacked."" He blamed what he called essentially a one-man power structure in Russia for the miscalculations. Even under the undemocratic system that was communism, there were some checks and balances. ""After Stalin died,"" Shiryaev continues, ""there was collective leadership in the Communist Party, and when troops went into Afghanistan, there was a vote in the Politburo of the Communist Party,"" he said. Of course, there was no telling whether that vote took place at the end of the barrel of a gun. ""The Communist Party of China also has a voting procedure, but in Russia, there is one person and he made a mistake. This is the tragedy of Russia’s political structure."" Ukrainian soldiers celebrating at a check point in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, April 3. On the subject of nuclear weapons, Shiryaev was not alarmist, believing Russia’s talk about getting to a higher state of readiness was to ensure boots don’t cross into Ukraine. He similarly was convinced the Russians won’t use chemical or biological weapons. He didn’t believe the Russians would deploy something so toxic so close to their own borders, something that could blow right back at them. He saw an end game by Russia’s annual Victory Day, celebrated May 9, when the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War is marked. And perhaps, Shiryaev suggested, Putin will at that point just declare whatever they have taken by then is exactly what they wanted all along – and that will be the spin. But, he acknowledged that even the fight for the Donbas has not gone so well. Just listen to the Russians. ""Every day, [Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Igor] Konashenkov talks about how Ukrainian missiles and Ukrainian shells are exploding in Donetsk. This means the troops are where they were and nothing has changed. And a month has already passed. Every day, Konashenkov tells us Russia destroys some Ukrainian planes, some S-300 air defense equipment. But I’m sorry, these targets should have been destroyed in the first week.""",0

Piers Morgan took on cancel culture and questioned what ""red line"" must be crossed in Ukraine for the United States to get involved in the war in a conversation with Martha MacCallum on ""The Untold Story"" podcast on Fox News Audio. : This cancel culture phenomenon, for want of a better phrase, has got to be canceled, and I see myself as leading the charge in the battle for free speech. : I mean, it's incredibly ignorant when you think about it, and it's very self-indulgent. And I can't help but think, and I've thought this in the early days of the war in Ukraine, ""Well, there goes all that garbage."" You know, because when you see people struggling for their lives and you see a war underway, it makes all of that seem really trivial. : But I thought the same thing about the coronavirus pandemic. I thought that that would wake up the woke brigade, but it had the opposite effect. … : : It intensified it. : The level of pointless virtue signaling, the level of attacks on free speech, the level of attacks on division of opinion was unprecedented and yet fueled by this crisis. So I wish I could share your optimism that even a war would concentrate people's minds, that the spectacle of watching maternity hospitals in Ukraine being bombed, of women – pregnant women and children being blown to pieces – would somehow focus the minds of people about what is important in life, about giving them a new perspective. But I fear it won't be the case, that actually the opposite will happen. They'll use it to drum down that their views are the only acceptable ones, even while we're watching a battle for freedom itself. . Dead bodies of the head of the village, her husband and son are seen buried in a shallow grave, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in the village of Motyzhyn, outside Kyiv, Ukraine, April 4, 2022. . The body of civilian woman Yaroslava 43, is covered with a blanket near a grave, according to residents Yaraslova was killed by Russian soldiers, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in the village of Motyzhyn, in the Kyiv region, Ukraine, April 4, 2022. Tanya Nedashkivs'ka, 57, mourns the death of her husband, killed in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, on Monday. : I wonder, I've always felt that there's going to be some global event that … brings people together, that's so horrific, sadly, that that's what it would take, that it brings people together. And we'll see. I think this is going to go on for some time. I think this is a game-changing event that happens across Europe and has all kinds of implications. I thought it was interesting. President Zelenskyy was talking about Boris Johnson and saying that he felt that he's been the most helpful leader in this environment. And Zelenskyy is clearly frustrated with the promises that have been made to him and the desperate situation that he finds himself in. : Well, my view about this Ukraine war is not a popular one. But I don't understand really where our ""red line"" is on this. If the red line is not actually maternity hospitals being bombed deliberately; if it's not refugees being deliberately targeted as they try and flee a war-torn area; if it's not lines of people, including Americans, as it turned out, queuing for bread because they're starving, being shot at and killed; f it's not Holocaust survivors being incinerated in their homes by Russian missiles, what is our moral red line? And why does it [need to] be different, really? The morality of this is if he invades a native country and if Putin does take over what he wants in Ukraine and then invades a native country because he's factored in our fear of him and his threats of using his nuclear arsenal as a reason not to engage with him, why does that dynamic change when he invades a native country? All he'll do, then, if he invades one of the Baltic Island countries, for example, all he has to say is, I'm going to nuke you if you do anything, and we've already blinked. We've already said, well, we're not prepared to engage in that, in which point at which point I say, Well, then the nuclear mad option of mutually assured destruction disintegrates. This is one guy using his country's nuclear arsenal to bully his way around the world, and at some point, you've got to stand up to him. 6 ' ' , , 'S Bullies only understand one language. And I look at it, I think, is Vladimir Putin really going to kill himself by launching a nuclear strike? Why would he do that? Nothing about this guy's mentality or history points to a bloke prepared to lose his own life. He's a man who wants to grab other people's land, grab other people's money, enrich himself and make himself even more powerful. He's not an Islamic fundamentalist who wants to commit suicide. So if you look at it in totality, you think, at what point do we get involved? And I know all the arguments not to. But I also think we have a moral compulsion to do what Zelenskyy's saying – to get engaged and to take on a dictator. Because frankly, I think if Twitter had been around in 1939, we wouldn't have engaged with Adolf Hitler because people would have been too worried about the consequences. "" "":",0

The article, titled ""A new world order is emerging - and the world is not ready for it,"" argues that American influence is on the decline on the world stage. ""Our Mideast partners have lost confidence in America’s commitment to global leadership or competence for it following last year’s botched Afghanistan withdrawal,"" he wrote. : A Russian tank T-72B3 fires as troops take part in drills at the Kadamovskiy firing range in the Rostov region in southern Russia, Wednesday, Jan. 12, 2022.

The president of the organization cited conversations he had with industry and government leaders at the World Government Summit about his prognosis of the west's declining influence and power. ""In all my many travels to the Mideast over the years, I have never heard this level of frustration from Mideast government officials with American policymakers,"" he added. Kempe contends that a Russian victory in Ukraine would spell doom for American hegemony and would ""would accelerate Western decline as an effective global actor."" : G7 'S However, Kempe suggests this is an opportunity for the U.S. and the west to build support for ""the first truly ‘global’ world order"". ""With that context,"" he wrote, ""the question is not what the new world order would be, but rather if the U.S. and its allies can through Ukraine reverse the erosion of the past century’s gains as a first step toward establishing the first truly 'global' world order."" According to him, a victory in Ukraine will frustrate what he describes as China and Russia’s growing influence on the world stage. ""Should Ukraine survive as an independent, sovereign, and democratic country, the U.S.- and Europe-backed forces will regain momentum against the previously ascendant Russian-Chinese forces of authoritarianism, oppression and evil."" While Kempe calls Russia's actions evil, he appears to ignore the number of human rights abuses by China.

The retired Army lieutenant colonel argued ""this kind of leadership"" is not what the world needs as Putin's brutal assault on Ukraine rages on. - , : So I think there's two things that we can conclude right off the top. One is the Russians were deliberately doing this to intimidate and terrify the people that they had captured to let them know who is in charge. So this was the most brutal form of suppression that you could possibly do. To in your face, leave bodies in the street. And the second thing was, they did this the way they did because they never thought they were leaving. They thought they were there to stay and the world would never get to see the clear and compelling forensic evidence. I think this really shows who, what this regime is, and unfortunately, I haven't really heard the administration go after that with the kind of clarity that we really need. So it does, again, it just sounds like we're cheerleading along with the rest of the world, and I don't think that's the kind of leadership we need right now.",0

2022-04-05,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-ukraine-war-congress-aid-push-pergram,Reporter's Notebook: Russia’s Ukraine war and Congress’ long push for aid,"James Carafano, of foreign policy at Heritage Foundation, joined 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss how the United States has positioned itself within the international arena on the crisis in Ukraine. It was late January. Russian leader Vladimir Putin was rattling sabers about invading Ukraine. The Senate called in top Biden administration officials to brief them on what to expect from the Kremlin. The Senate quickly prepared to pummel Moscow with what senators described as the ""mother of all sanctions"" bill. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, D-N.J., indicated that the sanctions bill was on ""the one yard line."" After leaving a classified briefing on Ukraine, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that the meeting seemed to steel the resolve of senators to sanction Russia. Unlike American football, the U.S. Senate operates on more than four downs – considering that the legislation was purportedly so close to the goal line. Top senators kept saying the bill was inching closer. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., even indicated that the tough sanctions bill was a way to deter Putin from invading Ukraine. Thus, it was important to pass the bill before an invasion. It never happened. President Joe Biden speaks about his administration's plans to combat rising gas prices in the South Court Auditorium on the White House campus, Thursday, March 31, 2022, in Washington. , - 04: A photo shows massive destruction in the area of conflict at the Bucha town after it was liberated from Russian army in Ukraine on April 4, 2022. ‘ ’ , , Yes. Congress has provided Ukraine with all sorts of aid and weapons. Lawmakers tucked nearly $14 billion in aid to Ukraine into a gigantic, omnibus spending bill to avoid a U.S. government shutdown. But Congress has yet to send to President Biden’s desk a solitary bill which just deals with Ukraine. This is why it’s been far from everything Ukrainian leader Volodomyr Zelenskyy requested. Zelenskyy continued to push for a transfer of MiGs from Poland and the declaration of a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Lawmakers from both sides boasted about what Congress has dispatched to Ukraine. Republicans have criticized the Biden Administration for what the right says is a slow response to the crisis. But Ukraine has received far from everything on its wish list. Lawmakers are careful to note than ’s enforcement of a no-fly zone could inject the west directly into the conflict – something the U.S. wants to avoid. ""We’re fulfilling almost every single request that the Ukrainians made of us,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. ""This town is so obsessed with the incredibly narrow band of equipment that we don’t feel we have the capability to transfer. So I think we should be really proud of the pretty extraordinary pace of transfers to the Ukrainians."" In late March, the House overwhelmingly approved a bill for the U.S. to revoke normal trade relations with Russia. The House approved the plan 424-8. On its face, one would have thought this bill would be a lay-up in the Senate. But then again, you’re dealing with the U.S. Senate. At first there was an issue over Russian oil raised by Sen. Michael Crapo, R-Idaho. But once that was resolved, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blocked speedy consideration of the measure. ""Somebody ought to read the bills,"" said Paul on the floor. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, speaks at a press conference on the Act to benefit burn pit victims on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, March 29, 2022, in Washington. , The Kentucky Republican also hamstrung the measure over his concerns it could be too punitive in efforts to punish human rights abusers. And so, the Senate burned more than two weeks without advancing that bill. Schumer ducked a question about why he failed to put in motion some parliamentary steps which would force a Senate vote last week. Yes, the process would have cost the Senate several days – even though all senators seemed to be in favor of lifting normal trade relations with Russia and Paul was the only obstruction. But the Senate would have scored an end result to help Ukraine and slap Russia. That said, Schumer may have been reluctant to tie up floor time with the Senate facing the pending confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson. The Senate aims to confirm Jackson by the end of the week. Democrats are very leery of doing anything which could delay or imperil Jackson’s confirmation – especially in a 50/50 Senate. Few would say this. But as much as senators from both parties want to penalize Russia, Democrats are slightly more concerned about getting Jackson confirmed to the High Court. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, center, walks before a meeting with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, April 1, 2022. Especially after Republicans didn’t grant a hearing to Attorney General Merrick Garland when President Obama nominated him for the Supreme Court in 2016 – and Republicans then shoehorned the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett just days before the 2020 election. ""The confirmation of Judge Jackson remains the highest priority of the Senate this week by far,"" said Schumer. Trade with Russia – and how the U.S. should now approach trade with China amid the war in Ukraine – took center stage at a recent Senate Finance Committee hearing with U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai. ""We’re only halfway there,"" said Tai when asked about the Senate’s inaction on cutting off normalized trade ties with Russia. ""We need to finish the act. It has been so important to have the United States government speaking in one voice."" Of course, that is always the challenge on Capitol Hill: getting a bicameral legislature to speak with one voice. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., moved on to another piece of legislation with the Russia trade bill stalled. ""If American companies are doing business in Russia and paying taxes to the Russian government, we ought to take away foreign tax credits,"" said Wyden. ""There is no reason that people in Oregon and Ohio ought to be subsidizing the Putin war machine. So we’ve got to get this done."" President Biden imposed sanctions on Russia on his own. But Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., expressed concern that Moscow may wiggle out of the consequences. ""How can you continue to apply pressure on Putin for these unprovoked attacks?"" asked Hassan of Tai. ""The most direct tool that we have in the trade toolbox is how we treat Russia at the ,"" replied Tai. Congress is now trying to quickly pass a bill to prep the nation for the next wave of the pandemic. The bill lacks money to fund measures overseas - much to the dismay of many lawmakers. It’s believed Congress may need to work on an international coronavirus bill in the coming months. The international aid part is unpopular with some Republicans. The working theory on Capitol Hill is that lawmakers could stuff additional Ukraine money into that measure in the coming months to make the legislation more palatable. Now there’s a bipartisan push on Capitol Hill by lawmakers to condemn Russia’s butchery in Bucha. ""I think this should be a turning point for the world,"" said Graham. ""We should follow him to the ends of the Earth to prosecute him. But this should be a turning moment in the war."" But based on its track record on Ukraine, it’s unclear if the tragedy of Bucha is a turning point for Congress.",13
2022-04-06,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/zelenskyy-and-ukraine-freedom-fighters-peace-corps,"Zelenskyy and Ukraine's freedom fighters are an inspiration, deserve more of the world's support","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reveals if he thinks President Biden wants Ukraine to win and a message for Russian President Putin on ‘Special Report.’ Back in 2015, I was among those captivated by a Ukrainian television series, ""Servant of the People"" . First aired from 2015 to 2018, its lead actor, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, played a teacher fed up with corruption in his country. His fictional character’s populist rant, filmed by one of his students through an open window and viewed by millions on YouTube, ultimately led to a crowdsourced campaign for public office. Life subsequently imitated art, and in 2019, Zelenskyy was elected president of Ukraine in a landslide. , Who would have thought this actor turned real-life president would now inspire the civilized world with his courageous defense of his country? The Soviet flag last flew over the Kremlin on Christmas Day, 1991. I was Peace Corps director during that seminal period in world history in which the Soviet Union collapsed. I sent the first Peace Corps volunteers into the former Soviet republics, including Ukraine. I subsequently visited Ukraine in 1993 and in 1996 to see this burgeoning democracy taking root. I visited Sevastopol, in Crimea before Putin’s 2014 invasion. Sevastopol is the largest city in Crimea and a major port on the Black Sea. We knew that transition from a state-run central planning economy to a free enterprise system would not be easy and would require different survival skills. So, we recruited a different type of Peace Corps volunteer. Previously, most Peace Corps volunteers were recent college graduates and worked in nations with subsistence economies by helping to build ditches and improve agricultural methods, elementary education, and community hygiene. Ukrainians' fight for survival is a stark reminder that freedom and peace anywhere are not to be taken for granted. To help the people of the former Soviet Union transition to free-market economies, we recruited a new type of volunteer – older, more mature, with degrees or business backgrounds. There was a tremendous outpouring of eagerness to be part of this new Peace Corps initiative. In the months after we put the call out for volunteers during January 1992, the Peace Corps received thousands of inquiries from Americans wanting to sign up. In this image from video provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks to the Norwegian Parliament from Kyiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 30, 2022. Ukraine was among the first of the former republics to ask for Peace Corps volunteers. I remember meeting the first Peace Corps volunteers headed to Ukraine on May 9, 1992. The first U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine was an Ukrainian American, Roman Popadiuk, the first Peace Corps Director in Ukraine was Jerry Dutkewych, another Ukrainian American. Ukraine eventually became the largest Peace Corps program in the world. The Peace Corps' entry into Ukraine was marked with hope and optimism. Ukraine had a population of 52 million people, many highly educated and skilled, and was uniquely positioned for economic and democratic success in the coming decades. Kiev was a beautiful city of large boulevards lined with trees, a city of promenades and greenery. To see this beautiful city today being bombed into rubble is heartbreaking. - , Though they lived behind the Iron Curtain for nearly 70 years, the Ukrainian people aspired for their country to join the West and enjoy the benefits of freedom and opportunity. The admiration the Ukrainian people had for the United States, for our freedoms, our liberties, and our economic ingenuity was inspiring. Despite the many challenges and uncertainty that loomed on the horizon, the Ukrainian people were proud, determined, and energized to once again be independent and in control of their own country. Despite overwhelming odds, Ukraine today is standing fast against Putin’s Russian forces. Civilians are taking up arms. People are risking and giving their lives to protect their homes, their freedom, and their sovereignty. The rest of the world needs to do all we can to help Ukraine survive. Ukrainians' fight for survival is a stark reminder that freedom and peace anywhere are not to be taken for granted. President Zelenskyy has shown us that one person can make a huge difference. The Ronald Reagan Foundation, on whose board I serve, recently awarded its highest honor — The Ronald Reagan Freedom Award — to President Zelenskyy. The award is given to ""those who have made monumental and lasting contributions to the cause of freedom worldwide."" Ukraine’s freedom fighters need more of the world's support. In our indelible memories of their courage and sacrifice, all of these Ukrainian men and women are making lasting contributions to the cause of freedom. Among the things I am sure of, when one day the Peace Corps is able to go back into Ukraine, there will be no shortage of volunteers.",6

You know, he's a war criminal. He's a murderer. He ought to be tried for war crimes. But at the same time, the number one person negotiating with Iran is a Russian, and their goal is to get us to agree to give up all of the sanctions as it relates to Iran. And if the U.S. Congress would step up and say, no, we're serious about sanctioning Russia, we're not going to give them a loophole that would be a very powerful signal. And lastly … Where are the jets? Where are the tanks? Where were the anti-ship missiles? I mean, why are we allowing Ukrainians to die while our bureaucrats and politicians just keep talking.

2022-04-06,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russians-sent-packing-espionage-accusations,200 Russians sent packing following espionage accusations in Europe,"Russian professor Ruben Enikolopov speaks on the impact of Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine, as well as the role Russian propaganda plays in who is to blame for the country's hardship. In the course of just 48 hours, 200 Russian diplomats were either expelled or declared ""persona non grata"" in Europe. Officially, the diplomats stand accused of being involved in espionage, but it is widely understood that these latest expulsions are a reaction to recent revelations of atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha, Ukraine. The French, meanwhile, have opened three probes into potential war crimes against some of their nationals in Ukraine, on top of the investigation relating to the killing of Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski outside Kyiv last month. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi also has called for independent investigations into the killing of civilians in Ukraine that ""deeply share our souls."" As the debate stretches on over squeezing Russia in the hopes of getting it to stop the war in Ukraine, Berlin moved earlier this week to take control of a subsidiary of Russian energy firm Gazprom in Germany. The U.S. and Europe are set to announce further sanctions. Service members of pro-Russian troops in uniforms without insignia driving an armored vehicle with the symbol ""Z"" painted on its side in the separatist-controlled village of Bugas in March. And the mounting anger may be making some take matters into their own hands. A car crashed into the gates of the Russian Embassy in Bucharest, Romania, bursting into flames. The driver died. It is not clear whether the act was deliberate, but Russian embassies around the world have been targeted by protesters in recent weeks. In Italy, someone apparently set fire to the Lake Como villa of top Kremlin propagandist and talk show personality Vladimir Solovyov. The villa – one of three Italian properties owned by the Russian showman – already had been expropriated as Solovyov was targeted with sanctions. It's not clear what happened with the villa yet, but investigators said they believed it was a deliberate act. All this as the sanctions start to bite in Russia, though economists have said it will still be some time before the country feels its effects fully, as Russians argued over who's to blame for the hardship. ""I think people who watch Russian will blame the West because the propaganda is very effective internally. People who rely more on independent news will have a very different interpretation and put the blame on different parties,"" economist Ruben Enikolopov said. ""I observe an increasing polarization within Russia and it goes to extreme levels when people in the same family stop talking to each other."" A high school building damaged after Russian missile attacks in Vasylkiv, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine, March 1. Enikolopov acknowledged the societal upheaval the war and clash of opinions in Russia but added, ""It's nothing compared to what's going on in Ukraine, but it's really obviously hitting Russian society."" A huge blow, he said. But the fact that hundreds of thousands of Russians have left the country since the war began may be more damaging to Russia's future than all the sanctions. Many of those fleeing have gone to Turkey, Armenia and Georgia, to name a few countries that have opened their doors to Russians, though many said they've been greeted with animosity or obstacles when they try to rent apartments. They are ""independent journalists who don't want to risk landing in jail for reporting what the Kremlin calls 'fake news,' men fearing the draft and a lot of Russians who work in the sector,"" Enikopolov said. ""Some of them probably will return. It's like a panic stage,"" but many will not return, he added. ""So that's a huge blow for [the] Russian economy, I think, in the long run. Talk about inflation, restriction of imports, they're very important now in terms of long-term development of [the] Russian economy. But the most important thing is this brain drain and the fact that Russian is cut off from new technologies,"" he said. ""That will accumulate, leading to slower and slower economic growth if there will be any growth in the future. But clearly, it will be below the world average in the coming years.""",22

They defeated the former Soviet Union in the 80s. Also, Ronald Reagan helped the Nicaraguan freedom fighters, the contra rebels who were fighting then against the Soviet backed sandinistas, and they were successful.

Former President Obama was called out on Twitter Thursday for presenting what some called a ""revisionist history"" about his record with Russia. The former president was participating in the ""Disinformation and the Erosion of Democracy"" conference at the University of Chicago, where he told the audience and The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, that he had been encouraged by the global response to aid Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded the country in February. He also remarked that when he was president, he recalled having to ""drag"" U.S. allies to take action against Russia.""I will say that, as someone who grappled with the incursion into Crimea and the eastern portions of Ukraine, I have been encouraged by the European reaction. Because, in 2014, I often had to drag them kicking and screaming to respond in ways that we would’ve wanted to see, from those of us who describe ourselves as Western democracies,"" the former president said. ‘' ‘ ’ 'S President Barack Obama chats with Vladimir Putin during the G20 leaders summit in Antalya, Turkey, Nov. 16, 2015. However, Obama's portrayal of how his presidency was tough on Russia didn’t ring true to many people on Twitter, who criticized and mocked the president for his memory on the issue. Terrorism expert and International security professor at Northeastern University Max Abrahms blasted Obama’s answer as ""self-serving revisionist history."" ""Watch Obama's self-serving revisionist history of how his administration responded the last time Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014,"" Abrahms wrote. Mark Hemingway, senior writer at RealClearInvestigations, mocked Obama, tweeting, ""‘grappled’ = did nothing after spending years mocking anyone that thought Russia was threatening and still refused to arm Ukraine."" Several users remembered Obama's infamous 2012 presidential debate moment, where he mocked Republican nominee Mitt Romney for calling Russia our number one geopolitical foe. Obama said at the time, ""the 1980s"" called and they ""want their foreign policy back."" Stephen Miller, contributing editor to The Spectator, shared an image of Romney, laughing. ""Anybody know if @JeffreyGoldberg asked Obama about his ‘the ‘80s called’ jab at Romney? Would be a good question at a conference about disinformation,"" Free Beacon reporter Chuck Ross said. In a thread, popular conservative Twitter account amilton29 said he remembered ""this going a little differently."" ""Umm I definitely remember this going a little differently. What I remember is that after Russian separatists shot down a civilian airliner and Russia invaded a sovereign country, we just passed weak and targeted sanctions. All because Obama wanted Putin's help [w] Iran deal,"" he tweeted. ""And then Obama was publicly thanking Putin less than a year later for that deal. It was no wonder Putin assumed the international costs of another invasion of Ukraine would be relatively low,"" he added. 'S ‘’ , At this same event, Obama also told how Putin had always been ""ruthless"" but ""five years ago,"" he wouldn’t have predicted Putin would’ve invaded Ukraine.

They've also renewed demands for the Biden administration to intervene and bring the American home. As war in Ukraine has waged on more than 40 days, Reed’s parents say they fear their son’s health is rapidly declining in prison, suggesting he may become ""the next Otto Warmbier."" Warmbier was an American college student when he was imprisoned in North Korea in 2016 and eventually transported home with severe brain damage. Reed has been jailed in Russia since his arrest in 2019 on charges he assaulted Moscow police officers who were driving him to a police station after picking him up following a night of heavy drinking at a party. He was convicted in 2020 and sentenced to nine years in prison. - Since then, Biden administration officials have repeatedly called for the release of Reed and Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive from Michigan jailed in Russia on espionage-related charges his family says are bogus. The White House says both men are being wrongly detained. A poster photo of U.S. Marine Corps veteran and Russian prisoner Trevor Reed stands in Lafayette Park near the White House March 30, 2022. In a statement released Wednesday, the Marine veteran’s parents said Reed’s last proof of life was April 1 when Russian authorities allowed him to call his girlfriend. Five days then passed without any updates on Reed’s ""rapidly declining health,"" his parents said, adding that ""with each passing hour, we are more and more worried that something terrible has happened."" ""To be clear, we are unable to confirm Trevor was even transferred to the ‘prison hospital,’ nor can we confirm he has ended his hunger strike, nor that he has received any real medical care as Russian officials have claimed,"" the family said in a statement released by their spokesman Jonathan Franks. Joey and Paula Reed, parents of U.S. Marine Corps veteran and Russian prisoner Trevor Reed, stand in Lafayette Park near the White House March 30, 2022. The last time Reed was silent while allegedly in the hospital was when Russian authorities claimed to have accidentally misplaced him for nine days in the psychiatric ward at the infamous Butyrka prison, the family said. During that time, Reed ""was badly mistreated and held in shocking conditions with dangerous inmates, including murderers, in a cell with walls covered in feces,"" the family added. ""We believe there is a rapidly closing window for the Biden administration to bring our son home,"" they said. ""Our son is out of time. We are again calling for the White House to do whatever it takes to bring Trevor home. Our view remains that a prisoner trade is the only way to bring Trevor home short term."" ""With each passing day lost to ‘deliberations,’ the risk of our son becoming the next Otto Warmbier grows significantly,"" the statement added.

In an interview with journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, Obama claimed that he took proactive measures against Europe and needed to twist arms to get a similarly proportional response from European nations. Obama has been criticized for his soft stance on Russia throughout his presidency. ""As somebody who grappled with the incursion into Crimea and the Eastern portions of Ukraine, I have been encouraged by the European reaction,"" Obama said.

Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney predicted in 2012 that Russia was America’s ""number one geopolitical foe,"" a comment that drew criticism from Obama. ""A few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al Qaeda,"" Obama said during the third presidential debate between him and Romney in October 2012. ""And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War’s been over for 20 years."" Former President Barack Obama looks on as President Biden speaks during an event about the Affordable Care Act at the White House, Tuesday, April 5, 2022. Democrat Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego criticized former President Obama in February for the way he handled situations with Russia during his presidency and said that some of his actions contributed to the problems we're seeing today as turmoil in Ukraine intensifies.

2022-04-07,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kent-what-will-happen-economy-pushing-russia-chinas-arms,Joe Kent: What will happen to our economy if we keep pushing Russia into China's arms?,"congressional candidate Joe Kent discusses the media’s and elected officials’ ‘irresponsible’ narrative regarding Russia on ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight.’ Washington state congressional candidate and veteran Joe Kent joined ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ to postulate the ramifications of the continued pushback against Russia and the media's seeming hunger for war with the country. : Yeah, absolutely, Tucker, I mean, the rhetoric coming from the media, coming from the national security state and many of our elected officials is just completely irresponsible for all the reasons that you outline. What I call people's attention to is that, 'Hey, we are the Iraq War generation. We've seen this movie before.' Recently, many of us like myself, we went, we fought, I lost my, my late wife fighting in these conflicts. We know exactly how we were lied to. We could lay it out. Chapter and verse the lies that the media told. The lies that the administration told everyone can regurgitate those right now, and we're seeing it all being paired right now in this Ukraine war in this effort to get us into a conflict with Russia. So I think we need our lawmakers to actually respect the American people enough to come back to their districts. Congress, like the Constitution, says, and to tell everyone what's going to happen if we're going to continue to sanction Putin, if we're going to continue to call him a war criminal like we did with Gadhafi and with Saddam, if we're going to continue to send $14 billion of our own money over to Ukraine so that they can fight Russia, what's going to happen? What are the possible scenarios if we continue to push the Russian economy into the arms of the Chinese Communist Party? What's going to happen to our economy? None of these discussions are being had. Instead, we're watching the road to the Iraq War Part Two. Except for this time, it might be World War Three as opposed to a prolonged insurgency.",0
2022-04-08,https://www.foxnews.com/world/how-bad-crackdown-dissent-russia,How bad is the crackdown on dissent in Russia?,"Pavel Chicov says that over 18,000 protestors have been detained since the beginning of the Ukrainian War. Therefore, protesting 'can change nothing' because Russia's political system is not democratic How much good can a human rights lawyer can do in today's Russia? Pavel Chikov is keeping up the fight against massive odds. A less terrible outcome, he says, is better than a more terrible one – and he is dedicated to doing whatever he can for his clients. ""Look, we're not talking about justice in terms of a free democratic judiciary. We're not talking about justice like it is in the United States or in any other places.,"" Chikov tells Fox News. ""But still we've managed to win cases, we managed to decrease punishments and consequences."" And sometimes, he says they even get cases dropped. Chikov's been at the job a while and says the crackdown on freedom of speech and press is nothing new. What is new is a state of ""military censorship"" with the new Draconian laws that prescribe up to fifteen years in jail for sharing what the government would consider ""fake news"" about the military. But in terms of sheer numbers and severity of punishment for anti-war sentiment, it is not – so far – as bad as one might think. Though 18,000 protestors have been detained since the war began, only 300 people have been fined. A mere 21 criminal cases have been opened. ""We are not talking about a massive wave of criminal prosecution right now. But the problem is that even a few cases lead to a chilling effect on everyone else, especially when we are talking about journalists,"" Chikov says. A woman passes by a mural depicting the Russian President Vladimir Putin in Belgrade, Serbia, Saturday, March 12, 2022. ', , , He points out that Alexander Nevzorov, a veteran journalist and personality, is facing ten years for reporting about the attack on the Mariupol maternity hospital. Fox News interviewed Nevzorov last month. He was out of the country when the case against him was opened. On the other hand, the fact that Marina Ovsyannikova, the state employee who jumped on set during a live broadcast with an anti-war placard has not been given a stiffer reprimand is somewhat surprising. Chikov remarks, ""I would say the such a huge public resonance that immediately started somehow saved her from worse consequences. So the government decided just to, you know, give her a minimal fine. Plus she has underage kids."" ""But they decided not to post criminal charges against her, which is surprising. But she stayed in Russia. So that's also something, you know, a brave move, I would say,"" Chikov notes. You hear stories about people getting arrested before police even have time to read the signs they are holding or hear what they are saying, so jumpy is the situation. I asked Chikov which recent arrest strikes him as the most outrageous. ""One well-known story is about an English teacher in one of the Russian cities, Penza. Her students asked her why they can't go to sports competition abroad anymore, and she explained why. And this discussion was recorded by one of the students, and then they passed it to police, and a criminal investigation against the teacher started,"" Chikov says. A man reacts standing near his house ruined after Russian shelling in Kyiv, Ukraine, Monday, March 21, 2022. At least eight people were killed in the attack. The school is for athletes. The student who squealed is fifteen years old, according to Chikov. There have been numerous cases of neighbors turning in neighbors. Chikov adds, though, that this is also not a new phenomenon and does not happen by chance. He has come across it in cases he's worked on before. ""We see how these criminal cases started, because someone reported on someone,"" he says. He claims that often stool pigeons, including plants within offices, are funded and supported by the government. There are cases of vigilantism being reported too. Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and editor of Novaya Gazeta which has put its publishing on hold due to threats from the state censor was attacked with an acidic red paint on a train Thursday. The unknown attacker, according to Muratov said, ""here's one for our boys."" Finally, what have been the effects of President Putin's recent threat to cleanse society of ""scumbags and traitors""? Chikin says this too is not something altogether new, but ""the rhetoric is changing. Yes, it's getting more military. You know, it's getting more frightening, threatening. It's it's it's getting worse. Definitely. But this is not something absolutely new for us, civil society in Russia.""",0

Three Americans have been detained by Russian authorities for amounts of time varying from months to years. Nonetheless, the families of Brittney Griner, Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan remain relentless in their pursuit for their safe returns. ""We’ve got to get our son back before he dies, or they put more charges on him."" Meanwhile, Russia has waged war on Ukraine for more than six weeks, since Kremlin forces first invaded the country on Feb. 24. Since then, at least 1,611 people have been killed and another 2,227 have been hurt, according to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday. : Loved ones of two of the three people spoke with Fox News Digital this week, as they said they will continue to ensure their voices are heard despite the constant Russia news coming out of Ukraine. Paul Whelan, a former Marine accused of espionage and arrested in Russia in December 2018, holds a message as he stands inside a defendants' cage before a hearing to decide to extend his detention at the Lefortovo Court in Moscow on October 24, 2019. Paul Whelan, now 52, worked in corporate security for about 10 years before his normal life disintegrated at the hands of the Russian government. His job involved him traveling to corporate locations to test the physical security of facilities his company worked with. He had traveled to Russia a half-dozen times from 2008 and 2018, but his connection to the country ""was really just as a tourist,"" his twin brother, Paul, told Fox News Digital. ""He wasn't there visiting any locations. He didn't work there. He just had made contacts with people who were in Russia,"" Whelan said. ""He happened to be in Russia, he happened to be in contact with those people, and his life fell apart."" Paul Whelan, a former marine accused of espionage and arrested in Russia in December 2018, stands inside a defendants' cage as he waits to hear his verdict in Moscow on June 15, 2020. Paul, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran from Michigan, was in Russia to attend a wedding in December 2018 when he was arrested in Moscow. He was accused of espionage and convicted in June 2020, when a Russian court sentenced him to 16 years in prison. ""In hindsight, probably every American going to Russia in the last two or three years should have been worried about their personal security,"" Whelan said. : A 'S , 'S '-' Paul became known for his ""feisty"" personality and for his unwillingness to crumble to the Russian pressures and has maintained his innocence. In one iconic image from his trial, Whelan, now , held a white sign that read, among other phrases, ""Sham Trial!,"" ""No Human Rights! Paul’s Life Matters!"" ""Decisive Action from and s Needed!"" and ""Happy Birthday Flora,"" his beloved dog. David Whelan said he last spoke to his brother in October 2018, but he and his siblings have remained steadfast in their efforts to bring Paul home safely. ""From the day that he was arrested on Dec. 28, 2018, for about 18 months until he was sent off to Mordovia to the labor colony, none of us were able to speak to him,"" Whelan said. Since around September 2020, Paul has been able to make near-daily calls to his parents and is also allowed to call the U.S. embassy. But there have been times that the family has suddenly lost contact with him, such as in June of this year, when he was ""sent to a hospital without requesting it."" ""We have our own suspicions about why,"" David said, describing how it was ""just before a meeting between President Biden and President Putin. ""And then as soon as he came back from the hospital, he was put in solitary for a month,"" David went on. For that almost two-month period, he was unable to make phone calls to our parents."" David said his brother has tried to be vocal even behind bars about conditions behind bars, ""and we’ve tried to help him amplify his voice and presence."" Whelan said his family has weekly meetings with the U.S. Embassy in Russia, and have continued to do so despite the complications that have arisen from the Russia-Ukraine War. He lauded the work and support of U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan and said the embassy forewarned the Whelan family early on about their concerns regarding Russia’s impending invasion of Ukraine. ""The real issue for us was, if sanctions go into place, what does that do to impact the ability for us to flow money Paul – money that we get put on his phone card, money that we put in his prison account, so he can buy fresh fruits and vegetables,"" Whelan explained. ""As soon as we saw that these things were potentially coming, even though we didn't know the day that they would happen, we transferred as much money from his trust account as we could to the U.S. Embassy, and they very quickly tried to move that onto his accounts and were successful."" ambassador to Russia John Sullivan speaks with the media outside the Moscow City Court in Moscow on June 15, 2020. David estimated his brother would have enough money in his inmate account to last him for the next few months. But he said he feared the impacts of any additional sanctions on his brother’s situation and their ability to regularly check up on him. ""I think the biggest concerns right now are the ability for the U.S. Embassy to continue to operate in Moscow. It's a key ally for us to be able to support Paul,"" Whelan continued. ""If he can't communicate with us, can't receive mail or packages from us, then he really is isolated. He's an American citizen who doesn't speak Russian in a Russian labor colony. I think everybody can imagine how awful."" Whelan said his brother is largely unaware of the ongoing conflict, as he is only exposed to Russian-sponsored television, if at all. Asked how he felt the war could stymie his family’s and the government’s efforts to bring Paul home safely, he said: ""It complicates things."" ""I don't know that Paul's case is necessarily off the stove,"" he went on. ""It may just be on the back burner for a while."" , - 30: Joey Reed and Paula Reed, the parents of Trevor Reed, a U.S. Marine who is currently being detained in a Russian prison, demonstrate in Lafayette Park near the White House on March 30, 2022, in Washington, . Trevor Reed, a now-30-year-old U.S. Marine Corps. veteran and former presidential security guard, had been living in Russia for the summer of 2019 when was arrested by Russian police and accused of assaulting a police officer. He had been celebrating in a park with his longtime Russian girlfriend and her colleagues at the time, his father, Joey Reed, told Fox News Digital. ""He was extremely intoxicated because they’d been to a party for her law firm in a park,"" he explained. ""Everyone knew him because he’d been there all summer in and out of the office all day long."" At the time, Reed had been taking Russian language classes for an international studies degree through the University of North Texas, his father said. ""He got sick. They stopped to let him get out … They’re kind of corralling him and, one of the people called the police,"" Reed went on. ""From then on, everything else is a lie, based on witnesses, based on video, based on expert witnesses who examined what little evidence that Russians allowed in courtroom."" Police officers escort ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, into a courtroom prior to a hearing in Moscow on March 11, 2020. Reed’s girlfriend and her colleagues followed police, who had taken Reed into custody, to the police station, where they were told to return at 9 a.m. to pick him up after he had sobered up. ""He should have never gone to the police station under Russian law. He was supposed to have been taken to a hospital,"" Reed said. When the woman returned to the police station with her mother at 9 a.m., they were greeted by agents from the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation . ""She was frantic,"" Reed said. The concerned parents called the U.S. Embassy and ultimately hired the best lawyers they could. Russian law enforcement accused Reed of drunkenly grabbing an officer’s arm and elbowing another while inside a police car on the way to the station. Joe Reed, the father of former Marine Trevor Reed, stands next to a placard of his son outside the Capitol in Washington, , on July 29, 2021, during a press conference. Within months, the Reeds’ lawyers, including one who was a retired judge, told them: ""Something’s not right here."" Reed said he later heard from top government officials, ""We’re being told from the top people of Moscow to keep the heaviest charges on him and make sure that he’s convicted."" At his arraignment, Reed told the judge: ""Your honor, I don't remember anything that happened. I would never intentionally try and hurt a police officer. All my friends are police officers."" His father said. ""He said, ‘If you can show me that I did this, I'll plead guilty … and beg for mercy from the court."" Following a public trial, Reed was convicted in July 2020 of assaulting police officers and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Much like the Whelan family, the Reeds meet with the U.S. government once a week to discuss their son’s case. Joey Reed said they work with people who are assigned to nothing but handling their son’s case. He said they also speak with the Whelan family regularly. Alina Tsybulnik , girlfriend of ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, reacts during verdict hearing at Moscow's Golovinsky district court on July 30, 2020. His time in Russian prisons and labor camps has been concerning, the family said. ""He was essentially in solitary confinement, I believe, for over a year in a pretty bad prison,"" Reed said. ""Once he got to the labor camp … they would wake him up every hour. You know, they were punishing him for different things."" He added: ""My son saw the sun maybe a dozen times in two years."" Trevor pushed back against Russian authorities’ efforts to make him work at the labor camp, telling them: ""I’m not working for you. You’ve taken me hostage, and I’m not going to make stuff for you to make money on."" Absent of a stricter housing facility within the camp, authorities have begun to accuse Reed of false violations that land him in solitary confinement. ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, stands inside a defendants' cage during his verdict hearing at Moscow's Golovinsky district court on July 30, 2020. ""They send you to solitary confinement, basically because you're refusing to work. And they make up reasons for it. But the real reason is you're refusing to work,"" Reed said. ""So, my son spent the first seven months there, basically in solitary confinement for 14 to 21 days at a time, and then they let him out for two and then they put him back out on more false charges."" Trevor is sporadically able to make phone calls and communicate with his girlfriend or the embassy, but the correspondence is irregular and infrequent, Reed said. ""Our only communications for 232 days were through his girlfriend and occasionally he would call his attorneys in Moscow,"" Reed went on. ""But they would not let him call the embassy or us."" Authorities further claimed that Trevor did not have the necessary calling card, then didn’t have enough money on the card to make calls, and then would only allow him to speak on the phone in Russian. Trevor’s situation has grown recently concerning in recent months after he grew ill with active tuberculosis and then began continuously coughing up blood. Reed said Russian authorities have recently refused to re-test Reed for active tuberculosis, despite Russian-sponsored media reports that have claimed that they did so several times. He was hospitalized for 10 days before he was returned to the camp and placed in solitary confinement once again. ""He’s been sick almost the whole time he's been there,"" Reed said. ""You're not supposed to be put in solitary confinement if you're sick or injured, and he's both."" On March 28, Trevor began a hunger strike in protest of his condition, prompting his concerned parents to travel from their home in Texas to Washington, D.C. to further embark on their media campaign in support of their son. Four days after the hunger strike began, Trevor was back in a hospital, where he called his girlfriend and said he had lost seven pounds since it started. Despite that the hospital usually provides Reed with opportunities to make outgoing calls, Trevor’s girlfriend has not heard from him since. On Thursday, the family posted on a Twitter account ""Free Trevor Reed,"" writing: ""To the Russian Govt: Please let us speak to our son so we know he is alive and his condition."" Earlier this week, the family said they had not received proof that their son was alive in almost a week. ""Our son is out of time,"" the family wrote. ""We are urgently calling on the Russian government to provide proof-of-life and resume allowing Trevor to call us. Our son is critically ill – this is not the time for cruelty for cruelty’s sake."" Reed told Fox News Digital that Reed’s condition is ""getting worse and worse and we’re able to help less and less."" ""We’re just afraid that we’ve got to get our son back before he dies or has more charges put on him,"" Reed said. ""He’s innocent."" Brittney Griner is pictured in an undated photo after her arrest. Brittney Griner became most recent American to be detained by Russian authorities when she was arrested in February at a Moscow airport, where law enforcement searched her luggage and allegedly found vape cartridges that contained a cannabis-derived oil. She is believed to be detained in a facility near Moscow, U.S. State Department officials have said. At the time, Griner, a 31-year-old star with the Phoenix Mercury, was trying to return to the U.S. during a break in the Russian league. Brittney Griner #42 of the Phoenix Mercury arrives with her gold medal from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics before the game against the Atlanta Dream on August 15, 2021 at Footprint Center in Phoenix, Arizona. A sign reading ""Free Brittney Griner"" is seen on a television camera during the championship game of the Big West Conference basketball tournament between the Cal State Fullerton Titans and the Long Beach State 49ers at Dollar Loan Center on March 12, 2022 in Henderson, Nevada. Griner is serving pretrial detention until May 19, The Associated Press reported, and faces up to 10 years in prison. U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price has said the U.S. ""will do everything we can to see that she is treated fairly throughout this ordeal,"" according to the report. Griner’s wife did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for an interview. Multiple reports have indicated people close to her have chosen to stay quiet to prevent any hindrances in Griner’s case.",18

Byron Donalds reflects on President Biden's mistakes since before the Russia-Ukraine war on 'Cross Country.' Rep. Byron Donalds partially blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine on President Biden's ""weakness on the world stage"" Saturday on ""Cross Country."" . : Joe Biden has been leading from behind and frankly not leading at all when it comes to the Russian incursion into Ukraine. People need to remember: Joe Biden's White House wanted Volodymyr Zelenskyy to get on the airplane and leave Ukraine. It was Volodymyr Zelenskyy [who] told the White House, ""I'm not leaving. Just give me ammo."" And so what we have seen in the United States is weakness on the world stage. Vladimir Putin knows this, and that's why he's continuing his offensive in spite of the valiant resistance from the Ukrainian people. … Here's the key important point. Going back before Feb. 24 when Russia invaded Ukraine, there was a time period of about four months [when] Joe Biden could have supplied the Ukrainians with the armaments that they have been requesting for quite some time. He did not do that. He was more concerned about Build Back Better — and frankly, his crazy agenda, which has failed in the United States — than making sure the Ukrainians had the weapons they need to defend themselves against this Russian onslaught. So that's why I say you will see BoJo — Boris Johnson — but you won't see Joe Biden, because Boris Johnson understands that if Ukraine falls, it's a major issue for Europe. They want to make sure they do everything they can. Joe Biden has been late to the game on everything, and he has been wrong at every single point. It's no shock to me why he's not there in Ukraine right now.",9

Standing at the Ukrainian border, I watched an old man begin to sob uncontrollably as he crossed into Romania to safety. He leaned against one of the barriers and pointed at the sky, his clothes covered in mud, his body frozen by grief and unable to go on. Volunteers told us he was saying his house had been bombed. All around him, I watched the never-ending stream of refugees crossing wearily into Romania. Night was falling and the temperatures had plunged below freezing. It was a constant flow of people. Some were on foot, others in buses or cars, nearly all women and children. One of the officials said that just the day before, 15,000 people had come through this one crossing point – a vivid illustration of what has become the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War . Nineteen-month-old lana is one of many Ukrainian refugees who have stopped at the Husi camp in Romania for hot tea and snacks, and to take a break from their long bus ride. I saw so many mothers carrying babies and young children. Exhaustion was written across their faces. They were utterly worn out by the trip, the weight of the unknown future, and by the emotion of having to leave behind husbands, fathers, brothers and older sons. I' So much pain, right there on display in front of me. And probably right there on display in front of you, if you’ve been watching any news in the last few weeks. But it isn’t just limited to Ukraine. Even before Ukraine’s war, nearly 426 million children already lived in conflict zones. Even before refugees fled Ukraine, more people than ever had been forced from their homes – 84 million people. That’s more than one-quarter of the entire U.S. population. Add that to news headlines on hunger and famine and stories from our staff in places like Afghanistan, where things have gotten so bad that we’ve heard of parents making the unthinkable choice to sell one of their children just so they can afford food to save another from starvation. It’s the type of real, sometimes gut-wrenching, hard beauty that changes us forever. Heartbreaking. Chaotic. Utterly overwhelming. So much pain in the world that it feels hard to process. Our first instinct might be to turn away, but I believe that if we look into the pain, we’ll also see beauty. It’s the type of real, sometimes gut-wrenching, hard beauty that changes us forever. And for me as a Christian, it’s a beauty that brings me closer to God. Beauty like the Ukrainian children I saw hugging their mothers or kissing their cheeks to bring comfort in that rare moment when the women’s steely composure would slip. Bogdon, 16, shares a moment with his father Vladimir. They are currently at a shelter in Romania after fleeing Ukraine. Or closer to home for me, a refugee father named Vladimir. He carefully tended to his 16-year-old son Bogdon, who has special needs. It was clearly a struggle for them to take this journey, especially with Bogdon’s physical challenges. Finding a way to shower and even just moving from one area of the shelter to the next was so hard. But Bogdon’s father was unbelievably tender with son, and I could see the love between them. At regular intervals during our conversation Bogdon would call out ""Papa"" and touch his father’s face or hold his hand – craving his Papa’s attention. This reminded me of my own daughter with special needs, Andrea, who also calls me ""Papa"" and so often does the same thing. A beautiful love amid the pain. Dima, 11, and Sonia, 5, hug their mother, Marina, who gets emotional sharing the story of their journey from Ukraine. And that old man, sobbing and unable to continue on. There was beauty there too. Immediately a volunteer came over and held him in a tight embrace. In a few minutes he was able to carry on. He struggled onto a bus, heading to the next stop on his journey. Two strangers who will likely never meet again. And in that human connection – beauty. The type that I will remember for the rest of my life. As Christians, we know that God is present in the pain. That’s the starting point to embracing the beauty. And it’s realized in our response to suffering. It’s there when we look at every person in crisis and see Jesus, and we remember His words in Matthew 25:35: ""For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in …"" I saw those familiar words come vividly to life at Ukraine border as volunteers and aid workers helped those fleeing the conflict. Seeing that type of beauty changes us. And it strengthens us to be part of the solution – but only if we’re willing to first step into the pain. .",6

I’ve never had any conversation with any Democrat that makes the argument to me that Joe Biden is doing a great job as president. I’ve never had a Democrat tell me that. I’ll tell you why. Because when Joe Biden ran, he ran on a specific theme. The theme was, Joe Biden was the safe choice for America. Every three months, Joe Biden gets up there and says America is back. America is back. It’s spring break time, right? Gas is up 40%. Car rentals are up 40%. Have you rented a car lately? And paid that price, it’s amazing. You shop for a used car because a lot of new cars, you can’t get anymore because there’s not enough chips. Used cars are up 40%. A million people are getting ready to cross the border over the next six weeks. , the Biden is saying a million people are going to cross. The Democrats have had a complete party control.

""The Next Revolution"" host Steve Hilton took aim at former President Obama's ""pathetic, feeble"" approach to foreign relations with Russia. Hilton, who served as a senior adviser to former United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron, highlighted examples of Obama's weak leadership and said it's ""no wonder"" Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine after seeing the same foreign policy ""crew"" return to power under President Biden. ‘-, ’ : From day one, Obama sent a message of weakness to Vladimir Putin. Remember the pathetic reset button totally ridiculed by the Russians? Refusing to arm the Ukrainians. The humiliating climbdown from his own red line on chemical weapons [in Syria]. Not a peep from Obama over Nord Stream 2, Putin's energy lifeline from Germany. Remember how he mocked Mitt Romney when Romney rightly pointed out that Russia was a threat? Obama telling then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev when Obama thought no one was listening, that he'd be able to cut Putin some slack after the 2012 election? And then, Obama delivered on that shameful promise by ignoring Putin's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and eastern Ukraine and the Russians shooting down a Malaysian Airlines flight, killing hundreds of civilians, including 23 Americans. Oh, and ignoring Russia's cluster bombing of Aleppo in Syria in 2015 and 2016. On and on it goes, year after year after year. Weak, pathetic, feeble. No wonder Putin saw his chance when the same Obama crew was back in the White House under Biden. And, lest you think this is some kind of unfair partisan attack, guess who confirmed all of it? Obama himself in a grandiose, pompous exit interview before he left office in 2016.",9

Nuns at the Greek Catholic Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family, 100 kilometers from Lviv, have granted refuge to some 40 people fleeing fighting with Russian forces in eastern and central Ukraine. The sound of birdsong and the gentle drone of prayers are a relief for 59-year-old Ryma Stryzhko, who fled from Kharkiv. ""It seemed that the planes were flying in the middle of the house.

The monastery is in itself a symbol of resilience, built after Ukraine’s independence in the early 1990s. The previous monastery in the village had been closed by communist authorities while the area was part of the Soviet Union, and the nuns sent to Siberia. ""All our prayers are now focused on peace in Ukraine, for our soldiers, for those innocent people who died, who were murdered,"" said Sister Dominica, the head nun. Before the war, the 17 nuns led a tranquil life. In addition to their religious duties and charitable work, they also grew mushrooms, made their own pasta and painted icons to decorate the chapel. Now, they run after young children, provide support and counseling to their mothers and cook daily for dozens of guests. ""Everything in the monastery is focused on prayer and order,"" Sister Dominica explained. But when the Russian invasion began, they told local officials they could host up to 50 displaced people. ""We adjusted the prayer and work schedule to the people,"" she said. 'S : '' ' Many of the children who are now laughing and hugging the nuns arrived traumatized.

But even among these peaceful surroundings, the nuns still get air raid alerts on their smartphones. They warn the rest of the residents by ringing the monastery bells — a less traumatic sound than the loud sirens in the cities — and direct them to the basement. A makeshift chapel there is decorated with a painting of Mary and baby Jesus, a candle and a large cross made of branches. Mattresses, blankets and benches also line the basement. One of the walls had ""The Prodigy"" written in chalk, an apparent homage to the British dance-electronic band. ’s , 'S But even when there are no sirens, children happily use the cavernous underground space.

The president held a virtual meeting with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, and said the U.S. and India ""share a strong and growing major defense partnership."" - The meeting, according to a senior administration official, lasted for an hour. The two leaders had a ""very candid"" conversation to discuss ""a range of bilateral and global issues."" ""The meeting was warm and productive and they covered a lot of ground,"" the official said. The White House said that Biden and Modi ""committed to strengthening the U.S.-India relationship through cooperation on clean energy, technology and military cooperation, and expanded economic and people-to-people ties."" ""They emphasized their shared commitment, as leaders of the world’s largest democracies, to respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations in the Indo-Pacific and beyond,"" the White House said, adding that Biden and Modi also discussed the ""destabilizing impacts of Russia’s war against Ukraine, with a particular focus on global food supply."" ""President Biden and Prime Minister Modi looked forward to meeting in person later this spring, in Tokyo, for the Quad summit,"" the White House said. At the beginning of the meeting, the president detailed the partnership between the U.S. and India, saying ""at the root"" of the relationship is ""a deep connection between our people, ties of family, friendship, and of shared values."" The president also said the U.S. and India are ""going to continue our close consultation on how to manage the destabilizing effects of this Russian war,"" while adding that their ""continued dialogue are key"" to ensuring the relationship between the two nations continues to grow ""deeper and stronger."" President Joe Biden meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House, Sept. 24, 2021, in Washington.

With regard to energy, the official said that the administration has been ""very clear"" that while the United States has banned oil and energy imports from Russia, ""other countries have to make their own choices."" ""We don't think India should accelerate or increase imports of Russian energy,"" the official said, adding that the United States is ""ready to support India"" and ""remain in conversation with India"" about its ""diversification of imports."" The official said that there was ""no sort of concrete ask and concrete answer,"" but said the two leaders were able to ""step back and have a pretty detailed and candid exchange of views."" Meanwhile, a senior administration official also said that India ""has concerns about the links between Russia and China."" ""India, of course, is facing a very tense situation along the lines of actual control,"" the official said. ""And when India sees the tight links between China and Russia, that’s obviously going to impact their thinking."" The Biden administration has voiced ""deep concerns"" about Russia’s ""alignment"" with China. Intelligence officials said that the Kremlin had turned to Beijing for economic and military aid after its invasion of Ukraine Feb. 24. President Biden had a secure video call with Chinese President Xi last month for nearly two hours in which he warned of the ""consequences"" should China ""provide material support"" to Russia amid its multi front war on Ukraine. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who met with his Chinese counterpart in Rome last month ahead of Biden and Xi’s meeting, said that the administration had not seen the ""provision of military equipment by China to Russia"" in the days after Biden’s meeting with Xi. , '' Meanwhile, India is providing humanitarian relief to Ukraine, including medicine and other supplies. ""I want to welcome India and support for the people of Ukraine who are suffering a horrific assault, including the tragic shelling on a train station last week that killed dozens of innocent children and women and civilians attempting to flee the violence,"" Biden said at the beginning of their meeting. In addition to the $1 billion in military aid the United States has sent to Ukraine, the Biden administration, last month, sent an additional $500 million in humanitarian assistance. As for Modi, the Indian prime minister said, ahead of the meeting with Biden, that the United States and India are ""two democracies"" that are the world’s ""largest and oldest."" ""We are natural partners,"" Modi said, touting the ""progress"" in U.S.-India relations in the last several years. ""The new moment that has been created would have been hard to even imagine a few decades ago,"" Modi said, referring to the war in Ukraine, adding that talks with Biden are ""taking place at a time when the situation in Ukraine is very worrying."" The White House also said that Biden and Modi, during the meeting, ""committed to continue cooperation – bilaterally and multilaterally – on ending the -19 pandemic, strengthening global health security, advancing global food security, and ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific.""

The evidence is mounting,"" Biden told reporters after appearing to reference the term earlier Tuesday. President Joe Biden ' ,' '', In comments on inflation earlier Tuesday, Biden said that the prices Americans pay shouldn't depend on whether a dictator ""commits genocide"" against another country, an apparent shot at Russian President Vladimir Putin and his decision to invade Ukraine.

Biden's comments drew praise from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Tuesday, calling the comments ""true words of a true leader."" ""Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil,"" Zelenskyy said on Twitter. ""We are grateful for assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities."" Russian President Vladimir Putin Biden's remarks come after he had previously been hesitant to use the world genocide, instead referring to Russian actions in Ukraine as ""war crimes."" ""He is a war criminal,"" Biden said of Putin earlier this month. ""We are citizens of Ukraine, and we don’t want to be subdued to the policy of [Russia],"" he continued. ""This is the reason we are being destroyed and exterminated. And this is happening in the Europe of the 21st century. So, this is the torture of the whole nation.""

2022-04-12,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/new-york-times-history-reporting-ukraine-ashley-rindsberg,The New York Times must come clean about its own dark history reporting on Ukraine,"Some push for U.S. military action The war raging in Ukraine is certainly being waged with guns and bullets, but it’s also being fought with a weapon just as powerful: propaganda. With so much disinformation , it’s clear that this is a moment when transparency and accountability have never been more important. Despite this, one of the world’s most influential news sources, the New York Times, has to this day maintained a cover-up about its own historic reporting on Ukraine. The key to this cover-up is a Pulitzer Prize awarded to the Times for its own campaign of Ukraine-related disinformation. It’s time for the newspaper return that ill-gotten prize. Most of us have heard about the infamy of Walter Duranty, the New York Times Russia correspondent who went ""rogue"" by denying the existence of a devastating famine in Ukraine between 1932 and 1933. : Duranty—famous for his callous quip about the Russian revolution that ""you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs""—went so far as to deny the reporting of other reporters who knew there was a famine. One of those reporters was the brave Gareth Jones, who was likely executed by the for his truth-telling. Duranty, for his part, was awarded his Pulitzer for his ""dispassionate, interpretive reporting of the news from Russia."" : The New York Times building is seen in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 3, 2020. The reality is that the ""famine"" that rampaged through Ukraine in the early 1930s was a campaign of genocide perpetrated by Stalin against land-owning peasants that would eventually kill an estimated 5-7 million people. But, just as importantly, far from being a rogue or ""slovenly"" reporter , Duranty was a brilliant journalist who had firsthand knowledge of the crime Stalin’s Russia was perpetrating against Ukrainian civilians. : ‘ ' Why would Duranty lie? The answer is as simple as it is damning: he was instructed by his bosses at the New York Times to do just that. As I show in my book on the Times, ""The Gray Lady Winked,"" on a trip to the U.S. embassy in Berlin in the spring of 1931 Duranty made a confession to a State Department officer so stunning that the officer wrote it down verbatim and entered it into U.S. government record: ""‘In agreement with the New York Times and the Soviet authorities,’ [Duranty’s] official dispatches always reflect the official opinion of the Soviet government and not his own."" Though it seems like a shocking anomaly, in reality this was part of a deep pattern of communist sympathizing at the Times in the early 1930s. The newspaper was even instrumental in brokering formal U.S. recognition of the then-nascent Soviet government. - Marianna Vishegirskaya stands outside a maternity hospital that was damaged by shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.

For decades, Ukrainian-Americans like those who staff the U.S. Committee for Ukrainian Holodomor-Genocide Awareness have called on the Times to do the right thing and return the Pulitzer. But for just as long the paper has refused. In 2003, the Times hired a ""consultant,"" a historian, to advise it on what to do. Big surprise: the historian said it should give the prize back. But the Times’ publisher refused, saying to do so—to correct the record—would feel to him too much like a Soviet airbrushing of history. For the past five years, the Times has run an ad campaign based on the concept that ""Truth matters."" It’s time for the paper to show the world that it means it and drop its false narrative on Ukraine, first by returning the Duranty Pulitzer and then by conducting an open and honest investigation what really happened with this journalistic breakdown—and why.",6
2022-04-12,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-russia-sanctions-life-youtube-video,Life in Russia under sanctions may parallel what one reporter found in Iran,"Russia and Iran appear to be on each other’s coattails when it comes to ""most sanctioned"" while both continue to sweep the real consequences of sanctions under the rug. Russians are proud people. So are Iranians. That's not all they have in common. Theirs are the two most sanctioned countries in the world. Russia has just pushed past the Islamic Republic into first place. When Russia first launched its war in Ukraine, many Russians said they feared they would soon join the ranks of Iran and North Korea. So, Russian journalist Alexei Pivovarov traveled to Tehran to learn what life is like in a rogue state. His dispatch on YouTube got over 4 million views. ""Hi, friends,"" he said in the opening sequence. ""We're in Tehran, the capital of Iran. I think you understand why we're here."" U.S. Alexei Pivovarov in Iran. Pivovarov and his camera crew moved through the streets of the city, visiting outdoor markets, indoor markets, talking to people. He said he learned one could pretty much find anything desperately needed, but explained much of it probably took a circuitous trip to get to Iran. For luxury goods not available in stores, Iranians with means but no visas to travel abroad employ designated ""buyers"" who have filled suitcases with special orders on trips abroad. Pivovarov discovered that even though Iran managed to acquire some new desperately needed airplanes in that little window of sanctions reprieve after the Iran nuclear deal was signed but before former President Trump pulled out of it, the county won't be able to get them serviced now that things have slid backwards. So, Iran has resorted to a sort of aviation organ donor system: When one plane gets taken out of service, whatever parts remain viable are used for the next plane in need. Pivovarov talked to ' man in Tehran, Nikita Smagin, who said sanctions made Iran start refining its own gasoline, something ironically it hadn't done much before and apparently doesn't do well. ""A very big smog appeared over Tehran,"" he told Pivovarov. ""That's because the gasoline is of very bad quality, and this is one of the big environmental problems in Iran."" One of the most striking moments of Pivovarov's travels: a stop at the money changer who gave him 37 million rials for $150, he said, holding the huge stack of notes up to the camera. Russia's ambassador to Iran said at least the two countries were looking forward to expanding mutual cooperation in the current environment, but admitted Russia probably won't be a lifeline for Iran's beleaguered tourism industry largely because of the prohibition on drinking. If Pivovarov is pondering what Russia's future could look like, Maxim Trudolyubov is analyzing its past, and lessons that were not learned. Trudolyubov is editor-at-large at Meduza, one of Russia's most popular independent news organizations, labeled a ""foreign agent"" by the Kremlin and functioning in exile. He also has served as senior fellow at the Kennan Institute for Russian studies. Trudolyubov said the fact that Russia never fully dealt with and apportioned blame for crimes committed under Soviet rule meant it never has moved past a reality of lies and management of state. ‘ ’ ""What we see now in Ukraine is almost every single crime of the Soviet state resurrected, in a way, out of the grave. We've seen murder. We see attitudes towards our neighboring countries as some kind of buffer states that don't have any right to sovereignty,"" Trudolyubov told Fox News. He said Russia and Russians have long crafted their image on something easier than digging into the darker aspects of the past, and that has been their victory over Nazi Germany in World War . ""It was sort of an all-encompassing ticket to goodness in a way for many, many Russians. And it's gone. What Putin has done, essentially, is that he has killed, eliminated this narrative of Russia's goodness and being on the right side of history, the moral standing that derives from that. He still pretends that he's fighting Nazis, but everybody understands that this is a lie. This is a pretense, a smokescreen for him to feel good."" Former Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Philip Breedlove says solidarity among leaders is a ‘number-one’ priority. Fox News asked Trudolyubov whether he thought Putin's deputies, such as his urbane Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, actually believe what they are saying about this war that they won't call a war. TrudolyIubov said he believes the propagandists have made some sort of mental shift and that their posture was in the same category as the government's failure to deal with bad parts of the past. ""Blaming the state essentially kills the state. It's against Russia, it's anti-Russian, it's Russophobia, as they like to point out. So, my understanding is, Lavrov and all the propagandists, particularly those who believe partly what they say, subscribe to this kind of notion,"" he said. But, he added that he still thought they knew the truth. 'S Russia and Iran have both been defiant about the sanctions they faced, often arguing they strengthened domestic production, made them truly independent countries. But, even the correspondent in Tehran said: Make no mistake; nobody wanted them. ""Iranians hope they won't stay under sanctions. There is a consensus in Iran. No matter whether the forces are conservative or reformist, everyone says that sanctions need to be lifted and that normal development under them is not possible,"" he said. Pivovarov finished his piece with roughly the following thought: There is always a way around sanctions, a wheeling, dealing work-around. But, what's important for citizens to consider is whether the reason behind the sanctions is something worth the sacrifice.",0

""I don’t think they’re looking to help Russia execute its campaign in Ukraine,"" Jeff Smith, research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. ""What they might be interested in is getting discounted oil from Russia at a time when inflation is running high - I think they likely will pursue opportunities to do that."" India initially remained quiet on Russia's actions in Ukraine, even abstaining from the vote to condemn Russia's actions, but recently condemned Russia's actions in Bucha and called for an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine. : U.S. officials voiced concern that India and China have seemingly provided Moscow with backdoor relief from severe economic sanctions – such as through the purchase of 40 million tons of Russian coal in Oct. 2021 and the purchase of 12 million barrels of crude oil from Russia throughout the year.

He began that day's high-wattage trio of presidential photo-ops: a visit to a former home of independence leader Mohandas Gandhi, a rally at a huge cricket stadium and a trip to the famed Taj Mahal. But any business between Delhi and Moscow is born out of Russia’s vulnerability and the chance for India to profit off cheaper energy – a necessity for a nation that still ranks as a developing industrial power. ""I think in the past, India has done a pretty good job making sure it’s not in violation of any direct U.S. sanctions, and I suspect they’ll continue doing the same now,"" Smith said, noting that Russia accounts for only about 2% of India’s energy imports. ""They exported $3.3 billion of goods to Russia in 2021; they exported $71 billion to us."" Russia has managed to stabilize the ruble after a severe initial shock from sanctions, but it faces difficulty conducting business with foreign partners who have contracts to buy oil and gas with at least some portion of dollars after the U.S. froze any such assets. India, therefore, has jumped at a chance to buy oil at a cheaper cost via some creative rupee-ruble exchange mechanisms. 'S But the U.S. has spent considerable time developing a relationship with India that neither nation would want to jeopardize. India’s robust naval forces and natural opposition to China’s regional ambitions – which has occasionally boiled over into brief border skirmishes in recent years – has positioned India as a vital partner for the U.S. in the region. ""Notwithstanding this current back and forth with respect to Ukraine and Russia and India’s position, I do think there is a strong, correct view that India is part of the strategic equation with respect to our aims in the Indo-Pacific region,"" James Anderson, former undersecretary of defense for policy during the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital. 'S ‘ ’ Anderson explained that since President George W. Bush’s administration the U.S. has worked to improve ties with Delhi and develop a significant strategic partnership. India’s capabilities can put China off-balance in any potential conflict in the region, which is to the U.S.'s advantage. ""I think it’s something that needs to be promoted at all levels – diplomatic, economic, as well as military assistance,"" Anderson stressed. ""They are a natural partner to the United States…we’ve been working very hard through several administrations to ween them off their dependence on Russian weapons systems, and that’s a lot easier said than done, but there’s been progress made in that regard."" ""That effort to promote that strategic partnership…there’s some twists and turns in there, but the overall trajectory is pretty good,"" he added. ""But it’s not something that can be forced, and we cannot expect India to support us 100% - they’re their own country, they’re going to make their own decisions, and that explains in part their behavior with respect to Russia.""",5

They’ll never be able to take it away from him that he unified the Ukrainians to fight for their country,"" Penn said of the president. , He recalled first meeting Zelenskyy before Russia's invasion, and at the time believed he had met a man who was ""very charming, and very bright and very charismatic."" Penn said he remembers war was not something anyone was completely ""convinced"" about before it happened. Still, he saw a shift in Zelenskyy once the invasion began. ""So, seeing Zelensky the day before invasion, I would say, it serves to reason that he would not have felt fully tested. And then seeing him the next day, it struck me that I was now looking at a guy who knew that he had to rise to the ultimate level of human courage and leadership. I think he found out that he was born to do that,"" Penn said. Ultimately, Penn said, his ""intention is to go back into Ukraine."" But he's not so quick to do so because ""I am not certain what I can offer,"" he explained.

""I don’t spend a lot of time texting the president or his staff while they’re under siege and their people are being murdered.

You only have to answer me in one of two ways: don’t come or come and do what you’re planning, or come, but here’s where you could be more helpful,'"" he said. Through his nonprofit , Penn is still helping refugees in Poland. In addition, he is still working on his documentary, but in the same breath said he is questioning its purpose. ""People will argue this, and there’s a million debates that I understand, but long term, we don’t have any tangible evidence that documentaries really change anything. We just don’t. We only know they can give hope,"" he said. Sean Penn was in Ukraine when Russia first invaded the country in February. Elsewhere in his interview, Penn touched on his wife Leila George, who filed for divorce from the actor in 2021.

Large majorities of Americans wanted that in the wake of 9/11, which is a very traumatic attack on our country. But … many people came to realize pretty quickly, ""Wait a minute. This war seems to have no real purpose. It doesn't actually have an end. It's not actually improving the lives of the American people."" Neocons never came to that realization. They loved those wars. They think we should have had more Afghanistans and Iraq[s]. And so they were discredited by the end of the Bush administration into the Obama administration. … And they're not just back, but they're leading the way, and you see the result. ... [Y]ou look at the war in Ukraine, and obviously you're horrified by a lot of the images that you see. And that's because all wars involve atrocities. All wars involve hideous images and complete mistreatment of human beings. The question that we were supposed to ask with Afghanistan and Iraq but never did is: ""What is the purpose of this war? How does it end? What is our answer to this war? What is it that we're doing there? How do we end?"" We don't have an answer.",0

Former South Carolina governor and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley appeared on ""The Guy Benson Show"" Wednesday, where she blasted the Biden administration’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine crisis. The show host brought up how President Biden made news Tuesday for referring to Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine as ""genocide."" After playing a clip of the president defending his choice of words to the press, Benson recalled how this wasn’t the first time that the White House had sent mixed messaging on the war in Ukraine, in just this week alone. ‘’ He pointed out how the Biden administration had bungled their promise of giving additional assistance to Ukraine, by at first offering helicopters, then reneging on that promise the next day. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola in Kyiv, Ukraine, April 1, 2022. ""Zelenskyy got on the phone with Biden and basically begged for those helicopters. I mean, Biden had just said there was a genocide happening, and they scaled back what they were planning to help with in terms of combating the genocide, militarily. And then after that phone call between the two leaders, I guess now the helicopters are back into the package,"" Benson told Haley. The show host wondered if she also was concerned about the ""incoherent"" messaging and ""flip-flopping"" from the White House. Haley said it appeared there was a lack of communication and also blamed ""bureaucracy."" ""Well it comes across as the different agencies aren’t talking to each other,"" she said. ""I think this is genocide. Any time you try and eliminate the existence of a people, that’s genocide. And again, that shows bureaucracy is kind of taking time to define it as such,"" she noted. The former diplomat then rebuked the White House for forcing Zelenskyy to ""beg"" for aid. Nikki Haley stumps for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin in McLean, Virginia, July 14, 2021. ""The part that bothers me is, why is Zelenskyy having to beg for anything?"" she asked. She urged the importance of sending aid to Ukraine and rallying our allies to win this war, for global security and freedom. ""This is not just a war with Ukraine. This is a war for freedom, this is a war that we must win. If we win this war, Putin and every other thug won’t even try this again. So we have to win and win big in this fight for freedom,"" she stated. ‘ ’ . But she said Putin will continue to succeed in killing Ukrainians as long as the Biden administration refuses to put tougher sanctions on Russian energy companies.

Along with sending Ukraine any equipment they need, Haley also pushed for the Biden administration to crack down on Germany for getting ""cozy"" with Russia by making their Nord Stream 2 deal in 2018.""I think that it’s time to really put the hammer on Germany and say, ‘you know what? You got us into this by getting all cozy with Russia,’"" she blasted.All of Europe should end their dependency on Russian energy, Haley argued, and the U.S. should be there to help them do it.

Now, according to an expert on Russian intelligence services, President Vladimir Putin is looking for the spy who shafted him. ""We hear some new rumors and more information about an apparent hunt for a traitor inside the , Russia's federal security service, because lots of people are asking themselves right now in Moscow, why is it that intelligence was so exact, so precise before the invasion,"" said Andrei Soldatov. Soldatov thinks the United States and learned the details of Russian planning from more than just electronic intercepts, because he says Russia has a Byzantine system and the way decisions are made is never clear. So Putin would assume that someone sang. And it would be convenient to hang his military losses on that someone. Ukrainian independent journalist Volodymyr Solohub feels Russian President Vladimir Putin could attack the press at any moment. ""It's a very Russian way to work on your problems, like if something went really, really wrong. It's always good to blame a traitor because in this case, you are fine. You did nothing wrong. It's all about some traitor.""

According to the Bellingcat investigative group, 150 members of the have either been purged or arrested in recent weeks. , Soldatov says he is trying to confirm the information, but it would in fact fit a pattern. What Soldatov does believe is that Sergei Beseda, the head of the 's Fifth Service, tasked with keeping ex-Soviet republics sweet, has gone from being under house arrest to being put behind the bars of the notorious Lefortovo prison where murders and brutal interrogations took place at the hands of the , Joseph Stalin's secret police. If indeed Lefortovo is where Beseda is, it sends a message to anyone even considering stepping out of line. But Soldatov says there is also a practical reason to keeping him there. ""The Russian prison system is very corrupt. So once you are inside, you can find a way to communicate with the outside world. You can get your iPhone and you can make a call. So everything, almost everything is possible, but not in Lefortovo. In Lefortovo people might be kept completely incommunicado. And as far as I know, basically he's kept there under false name, and there will be no option for him to communicate with the outside world."" Soldatov says, officially, it appears charges against Beseda are embezzlement, but he thinks that may suit the powers that be than announcing an out-and-out hunt for a turncoat. Svyatogorsk Lavra in the Donetsk region after it was targeted Soldatov tells Fox News the buzz he is getting from his sources is that many in the security services and even the military are blaming not only the Fifth Service for failures in this war, but also Vladimir Putin himself. ""In 2014 when we had the first stage of the invasion of Ukraine, everybody was happy with the way it was going...happy with Putin and on the same page,"" he says. Many on the inside were in favor of the latest intervention as well, but he adds, ""they blame Putin and the Fifth Service specifically for doing it in a way that caused so much problem and damage and casualties."" Does that mean, I ask, that they are ready to turn on Putin? ""Right now, they're building this distance between them and him. But it doesn't mean that they're ready to do something about him because there are so many things are against that. The lack of tradition. The was never really good at plotting and conspiring.

Even before the war, he started by attacking and humiliating the chief of his foreign intelligence agency. Two weeks later, he attacked the . Three weeks later, he attacked the National Guard.

These checkpoints have a ton of kit. They've got a ton of tactical gear. That's great, but I personally see these groups are fighting Russians on the front. They're taking casualties daily. You can literally hear explosions, artillery going off in the background, and they're doing everything they can with the very little equipment they have.

In addition to the war, Biden has faced a slew of domestic crises, including rising crime rates in cities across the country, a 40-year-high inflation rate, record high gas prices, and ongoing supply chain issues amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Inflation reached 8.5% in March, helping drive prices of goods and services higher for consumers.

When my wife Callista Gingrich showed me the more than 2-mintue video of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy walking around Kyiv, I immediately thought of another recent video of President Joe Biden bicycling around New Castle, Delaware . I was struck by the difference in seriousness, competence, and courage. Johnson is not alone in showing a willingness to provide visible support for Ukraine’s fight against Vladimir Putin. In mid-March, the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia traveled to Kyiv on a European Union mission. Biden got within an hour of Ukraine when he was in Poland, but then he jumped on Air Force One and flew west to America instead of east to Kyiv. : Of course, failing to show leadership and seriousness is normal for the Biden presidency.

According to Newsweek, in his first year, President Biden ""has taken 42 personal trips totaling 126 days. Of those, 73 have been spent in his Wilmington, Delaware home - spread over a total of 25 trips; 16 days at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware over the course of five trips, and 37 days at Camp David over 12 different trips."" Newsweek continued: ""He has become the President who has spent the most time on personal travel in the inaugural year of their administration."" There is a war in Ukraine which may determine if the world’s future is led by democracies or dictatorships. Biden bicycles. The land of the free and the home of the brave is being represented by the timid, the cowardly, the corrupt, and the dishonest. There is a growing disaster on our southern border with an estimated 18,000 people a day expected to illegally cross the border. Biden bicycles. 'S : ' A ?' There is an artificial energy crisis with skyrocketing gasoline prices because of the Biden administration’s anti-American energy policy. Biden bicycles.

There is a growing worldwide shortage of wheat, fertilizer, and other agricultural products because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Biden bicycles. There is an epidemic of homelessness and violent crime across the country . Biden bicycles. There is a crisis of education which could soon make it impossible for the United States to compete with China. Biden bicycles. Health care costs are out of control and creating problems for nearly every American family’s budget. Biden bicycles. Day by day, we learn more about Hunter Biden’s illegal activities – and how his foreign money was passed through to his father. Biden bicycles. The abdication of leadership, indeed the abdication of responsibility, is stunning in an administration that ran on supposedly ""putting the adults in charge."" We have no evidence that Vice President Kamala Harris is as big on bicycling as President Biden. But then, we have no evidence that Harris is good at anything except inappropriate laughter and making a fool of herself and our country. So, bicycling and laughing are the two symbols of the Biden administration. Watching the British Prime Minister join the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia, while the American President hides in Delaware may be the most humiliating international performance by any American president in modern times. The land of the free and the home of the brave is being represented by the timid, the cowardly, the corrupt, and the dishonest. Surely Congress can demand more leadership, action, openness, and honesty than the bicycling president is providing. If you agree, call your congressional representative and senators. Demand that they pass legislation to get these problems solved – even if it means Biden has to sign bills in his parlor in Delaware.",9

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the Russian invasion of Ukraine should serve as a ""lesson"" for a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan, arguing President Biden needs to act sooner on beefing up Taiwan’s military so it can have a better chance of defending itself. During an Easter morning appearance on ""Fox News Sunday,"" McCarthy, R-Calif., slammed the Biden administration for being too slow to provide arms to Ukraine ahead of the invasion. ""This is going to get stronger and rougher,"" McCarthy said. ""And what really needs to happen is, Ukraine is not asking for American men and women to fight. All they're asking for is the weapons to defend themselves. If we would have taken those actions earlier, instead of waiting until after Russia invaded, they probably never would have invaded had we done that sooner."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., responds to reporters at the Capitol in Washington, Dec. 3, 2021. McCarthy said acting sooner on arming Ukrainians would have ""saved thousands of lives"" and likely would have deterred Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading in the first place. ""I had this discussion with President Biden long before, when he just would threaten sanctions after Putin entered. I believe Putin never worried about the sanctions. He only looks at, could he be deterred from entering Ukraine?"" McCarthy said. ""Ukraine was craving the ability to defend themselves. Had we moved the weapons to Ukraine earlier, that they could defend themselves, it would have saved thousands of lives and probably the decision of Putin not to enter."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California wears a Ukrainian flag in his pocket in the chamber of the House of Representatives before the State of the Union address by President Biden to a joint session of Congress at the Capitol March 1, 2022, in Washington. ""And then after Putin entered, we had President Biden tell us, ‘Well, the sanctions take a long time to work.’ And then the president denied Ukraine and denied Poland for providing MiGs to Ukraine to protect themselves on a flyover,"" he continued. ""All of that is a wrong action going forward."" McCarthy said the president must learn from his mistakes on Ukraine in the event China decides to move militarily against Taiwan. ""What we need to do is learn from here … but also look to the future of what China is doing,"" he said. ""Taiwan has been waiting more than a year for weapons they've already purchased to defend themselves. Let democracies defend themselves. This is a lesson we should learn today."" , : China continues to claim that Taiwan is part of its national territory and not an independent country after the two split in 1949. The communist country has been building up its military presence in the South China Sea, stoking fears that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will embolden Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to reclaim Taiwan.

The U.S. has been providing weapons to Taiwan since the Taiwan Relations Act was passed in 1979, but some experts argue the island needs a significant increase in support amid China's military posturing. Matthew McInnis from the Institute for the Study of War stressed that any sanctions will not prove effective unless they're accompanied by a ""full-spectrum campaign"" that includes the threat of use of force, effective political and diplomatic maneuvers, information sharing and increased weapons supplies. ""Economic sanctions simply do not work on their own,"" McInnis told Fox News Digital in an interview last month, citing his experience managing maximum pressure campaigns for the State Department. ""The other issues is … it’s very clear that increased air defense capabilities and anti-armor – the things that have proven to be so effective for the Ukrainian forces – I think we need to take a little more risk in upping the air defense and anti-armor and anti-drone capabilities in a potential Taiwan scenario.""

2022-04-18,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-lawmakers-travel-destinations-reporters-notebook-pergram,"Reporter’s Notebook: With Congress out of session, lawmakers’ travel destinations speak volumes","Oh, the places they went … What lawmakers do when they’re out of session can provide clues as to what Congress may be up to when it is in session. Look at where they go. That helps curate the narrative about what lawmakers want to talk about when Congress reconvenes. Such is the case with the two-and-a-half-week April ""recess"" this year. Congress usually ditches Washington for an extended period in March or April – depending on when Easter and Passover fall. 'T , But first, some housekeeping. Congress is like any other institution in America. There are workhorses. Members who toil around the clock on behalf of their constituents and the nation. And, like everyplace else, there are also slackers. Laggards. Clock-watchers. Those who hardly have the best interests of the country at heart. The U.S. Capitol in December 2021. As we say, in the United States, we enjoy ""representative government."" So when Congress goes on a ""recess,"" it’s not really a recess. Sure. Some members use this time to catch up with family or even take a vacation. They need a break like most others. But frankly, many lawmakers spend these lengthy ""recesses"" working. They’re back in their districts huddling with constituents, visiting machine shops, dairy farms, universities, attending church functions, talking with people at gas stations, walking picket lines. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy discusses the Russia-Ukraine war and the 2022 midterm elections. The protracted stretch of time away from Washington isn’t really ""time off."" And constituents would surely rail against lawmakers if they remained in Washington all the time. Criticism would mount that lawmakers had ""gone native"" and were now ensconced too deeply ""inside the Beltway."" So, during this recess, members are buzzing about their home states and districts. They’re also jetting around the world on what are known, in congressional shorthand as ""s."" It’s a Capitol Hill abbreviation for ""Congressional delegation"" – often led by top Senate and House leaders or committee chairs. 'S ' ' A ' ' This is where the ""recess"" part tells us a lot about what Congress will be up to when members reconvene. For instance, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., led a to Denmark, Germany, Poland and the border with Ukraine. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., also led a group of lawmakers to Eastern Europe. . : 'I ... ' Ukraine is front and center. Republicans upbraided the Biden administration for not taking more aggressive action against Ukraine – although Democrats have questioned what more the White House could have done. But the Ukraine crisis isn’t disappearing. Congress must probably approve another around of humanitarian and military assistance for Ukraine by late spring or early summer. That’s to say nothing of also freeing up money to relocate Ukrainian refugees in the U.S. or abroad. Members of the bipartisan congressional delegation at the Ukraine-Poland border during the weekend of March 4, 2022. Then word came that Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind. – a native of Ukraine – and Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., traveled to Ukraine on their own. The State Department has discouraged members from freelancing and going to Ukraine proper on their own. Some ers tried to blame not approving s to Ukraine on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Granted, the speaker must sign off on any s overseas – which of course must also be blessed by the State Department. The State Department is unwilling to allow official travel to Ukraine out of concern for the safety of lawmakers. Fox is told that such a trip could put lawmakers at risk of injury or even capture. Moreover, there is concern that if there was an incident, diplomatic and military security officials may be put in harm’s way to protect the lawmakers or evacuate them. - ' 'S Fox has spoken with at least one lawmaker who wanted to go with Spartz and Daines. But the member didn’t believe the route they took was ""secure."" Another group of lawmakers hoped to travel to Ukraine. But Fox is told they contracted while on another to Eastern Europe. We’ve written in this space about the ""Tuxedo"" variant of in Washington after the white-tie Gridiron Dinner. Now, with infected members returning from their overseas travels with one another, perhaps they have the """" variant. Coronavirus isn’t going away. It will remain an issue around the globe. This is augmented by the spike in cases among lawmakers and officials in Washington. See, I told you what members do overseas over recess tells you a great deal about what they’ll deal with when Congress returns to session. Watch to see what the numbers are among lawmakers when Congress returns to session next week. But back to the s… Some lawmakers wanted to head to Ukraine to show solidarity with the Ukrainian people. Others wanted to poke their finger in the eye of the State Department – which withdrew the diplomatic presence in Ukraine weeks ago. ' ' : . Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., noted that the U.S. never withdrew its diplomats from London during World War and the Battle of Britain. Pelosi was scheduled to lead a to Asia with a swing through Taiwan over the recess. But then the speaker tested positive for . She was asymptomatic and tested negative several days later. But Pelosi’s positive test canceled the trip. Lawmakers are dialed-in to China and potential action it may take toward Taiwan in the coming months. Especially after Russia invaded Ukraine. It’s believed that Beijing is closely watching Moscow’s successes or failures in Ukraine and what approach it may eventually take with Taiwan. : -19 42 Another good indicator of what’s on the congressional docket: the surge of lawmakers who have visited the U.S.-Mexico border. Lots of lawmakers are headed to the border as the Biden administration suspends the pandemic policy to curb illegal immigration at the border known as Title 42. A Texas Department of Public Safety officer in Del Rio, Texas, last year directing a group of migrants who crossed the border and turned themselves in. Members from both sides know the border crisis will emerge as a key campaign issue this fall. That’s why vulnerable Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., made trips to the border.

Col. Daniel Davis discusses how Russian forces are beginning an offensive in the Donbas region and how the Ukrainians might fare in the fight on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’ The liberal Washington Post rebuked President Biden’s failure to deliver on his pledge to bring in as many as 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing their war-torn country as an ""embarrassment to the country."" ""The galling disconnect between President Biden’s ringing words and the reality facing desperate Ukrainians trying to make their way here is an embarrassment to this country,"" the editorial board wrote in a scathing editorial published Tuesday. Ukraine supporters chant ""Stop the war"" outside the White House Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged President Biden to come visit Ukraine this week, but the White House has repeatedly confirmed they have no plans to send the president. The Biden administration has been criticized for sending mixed messages on delivering needed aid to Ukraine. The Post also expressed frustration at the lack of an organized, systematic plan to helping refugees. ""Even as the White House pledges to formulate an ‘expedited process’ by which Ukrainians fleeing the war may seek to enter the United States, in real life there are no processes or procedures that would permit them to do so,"" they wrote, adding that refugees ""don't have years to wait."" Ukrainians who are seeking asylum in the United States stand with their belongings at a makeshift encampment near the U.S.-Mexico border as the sun rises, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on April 6, 2022 in Tijuana, Mexico. Reporting that some Ukrainian refugees have had more success entering through the southern border, the paper slammed the White House's ""willy-nilly approach."" ""But a willy-nilly approach to waving in Ukrainians who somehow presented themselves at the border is no substitute for a systematic procedure to resettle refugees already uprooted and, in many cases, traumatized by war,"" the editorial board chided. - ‘’ 70% However, the left-leaning paper wouldn’t entirely blame the Biden administration for the dysfunctional system. ""In fact, the decision to admit Ukrainian refugees, and the refugees themselves, are running headlong into U.S. immigration dysfunction,"" the board wrote, before accusing the previous administration for causing a severe backlog.""And the nation’s infrastructure for resettling refugees was gutted by the Trump administration, whose distaste for immigrants generally was manifest. That means many Ukrainians who make it here will grapple with a chaotic non-system for finding a job, learning English and navigating a new life in an unfamiliar community,"" they complained. President Joe Biden announces the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day for the next six months from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The paper’s short but pointed rebuke of Biden ended by reminding the president of his comments promising to help European countries shoulder the burden of incoming refugees. But they said, ""so far"" that follow-through ""has been woefully lacking."" President Biden continued to blame record high inflation and gas prices on Vladimir Putin, in a speech in New Hampshire today. However, the president's approval numbers continue to fall, reaching the lowest level for his entire presidency, according to a Quinnipiac poll published last week.",9

But if we strip away pandemic-related disruptions to labor, logistics and transportation, it’s evident that there are even more insidious, intentional forces aimed at scuttling our access to global goods and services. The Cold War 2.0 reboot is far more perilous than the first Cold War’s fight against Soviet-era dogma and military expansion. Russia’s Ukraine gambit, for example, betrays a willingness to savage its neighbor, bomb civilians and destroy a nation’s critical infrastructure while holding the rest of Europe at bay by threatening a pipeline that carries 40 percent of the region’s natural gas supply. - , ' ' Likewise, Russia’s rampant, globalized cyber-attacks on electric grids, water treatment plants, municipalities and private corporations is evidence that the Iron Curtain has been replaced by a Digital Curtain that threatens the economic independence and political cohesion of democracies everywhere. We’ve arrived at the day when we must mobilize to protect our commercial, political and digital sovereignty from Russia, China and other bad actors. Equally worrying is what lies behind China’s strict zero- policies, which ostensibly were implemented in the name of public safety but have triggered manufacturing stoppages and shipping delays on an unprecedented global scale.

Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks with Russian President Vladimir Putin via a video link, from the Great Hall of the People on Dec. 2, 2019 in Beijing. Pandemic aside, Xi Jinping’s Chinese Communist Party could easily pinch off supply as a form of economic leverage to force the U.S. and other Western countries to soften their positions on China’s human rights abuses – including the genocide of its largely Muslim Uyghur population. Even a modest manufacturing pullback would threaten global economies by driving up the price of raw materials and throwing shipping schedules and delivery infrastructure into disarray. 'S '' 'T ' ' The Cold War 2.0 isn’t just targeting nation-states. Corporations that once criticized China’s civil atrocities are now targets of retaliation as the government has the power to deny them access to the country’s 1.4 billion consumers. Even Hollywood finds itself coerced into self-censorship when its content is deemed offensive to the ’s political ideology. Private citizens are similarly defenseless as China and Russia exploit the deepening political rift in the U.S. to coopt traditional and social media. These authoritarian regimes are experts at manipulating information to attack our country’s fractured social and political systems and undermine the principles upon which the U.S. was founded. For their part, democratic nations, including the U.S. and U.K., have fought back by rejecting Chinese-made 5G communications technology out of concern it could compromise data supply chains and the digital privacy rights of their citizens. This is because the open 5G cellular standard, which was designed with heavy input from state-owned Chinese firms such as Huawei and , suffers from a lack of security. 5G is riddled with vulnerabilities, nearly a thousand of which have yet to be resolved by the industry body that governs cellular standards. This raises concerns relative to China’s ability to embed spyware into global 5G wireless networks through which private, unsecured data can be siphoned off and used to weaken data privacy, global commerce and geopolitical stability. We’ve arrived at the day when we must mobilize to protect our commercial, political and digital sovereignty from Russia, China and other bad actors. Without action, these new Cold War 2.0 dangers will threaten the global supply chain and access to energy resources, curtail access to critical technology and poison the content data streams that we rely on for everything from finance and education to e-commerce and entertainment.",22

Fox News' Eric Shawn reports. – Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine arrived on the doorstep of the Russian ambassador to the United Nations. A Ukrainian activist group defiantly bathed his Manhattan townhouse in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag and anti-Vladimir Putin slogans as a protest against Putin's horrific assault on the Ukrainian people. ""The message is to show that Ukrainians are not afraid and will find any Russian official, even if they are trying to hide,"" Arthur Zgurov told Fox News. A Ukrainian activist group projected the colors of the Ukrainian flag and anti-Vladimir Putin slogans onto the Manhattan townhouse of the Russian ambassador to the United Nations. . , . - Zgurov, a Ukrainian neurosurgeon, is now a New York-based activist with the pro-Ukrainian group Razom For Ukraine. The group projected the Ukrainian flag on the front facade of the red brick Georgian style mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that is the official residence of Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia. The phrases ""#"" and ""#"" were also projected onto the mansion's exterior just after Nebenzia arrived. He remained inside, in the third-floor library. ""The message to Nebenzia would be, Mr. Nebenzia, stop lying. You lie too much. And too many things have happened because of your lies. Be the man and speak out."" said Zgurov. Razom For Ukraine provides medical supplies and assistance to the besieged Ukrainian people and has held demonstrations in New York City against the war. More than one dozen of its members gathered across the street from the townhouse on East 75th Street on Tuesday night, and used a hand-held projector to light up the building. The projection also included the phrases ""#"" and ""#."" Fox News exclusively witnessed and recorded the event. ""I am very glad that we came to his house, because he is one of the most evil spreaders of propaganda,"" said Razom member Irina Paliashvili about Putin's ambassador. Paliashvili, an American and Ukrainian-based lawyer, was able to leave Kyiv just as the war started. ""He represents an evil regime and he promotes an evil regime, so he himself is evil,"" she said. ""I think it is crucial that these people understand they are watched by the world, that they cannot get away with this criminal barbaric war that they wage against Ukraine."" Nebenzia has been branded as ""Putin's Puppet"" by critics for his loyal defense of the invasion and continued denials at the U.N. Security Council meetings on Russian atrocities, war crimes and crimes against humanity. He branded the killings of citizens in Bucha as ""as staged provocation"" and ""a false flag attack."" He has continued to blame Ukraine President Volodymry Zelenskyy and Ukrainians for starting the war. He has used the Russian veto in the Security Council to block a resolution that criticizes his government as he continues to push Putin's propaganda. Razom For Ukraine is also calling for Russia to be expelled from the Security Council because of its crimes. Zgurov has wrestled with the images from his home country that are caused by Putin and his government and he cannot come to terms with the mass destruction and killing. ""If those were aliens who would do that, I can understand. But when humans do the same thing to humans, that is just despicable, disgusting. And I cannot find the words that I am allowed to say to express my feelings."" Fox News has seen Nebenzia at the government residence. He did not emerge from the townhouse during the Razom protest, but arrived shortly before it began. : ‘ ?’ The ambassador is chauffeured to and from work by his driver in a late model black Mercedes. Fox News has also seen a chef deliver daily food and supplies in a minivan with Russian diplomatic plates and a housekeeper and other staff enter and exit the building. A sleek Ducati motorcycle has at times been parked behind its locked gate. While previous pro-Ukraine street demonstrations have targeted the Russian U.N. mission office complex on nearby East 67th Street and a Russian diplomatic apartment building in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, this is the first time that message was brought directly to the ambassador's house. Moscow bought the elegant mansion in the exclusive neighborhood for $35 million in 2008. The real-estate history blog ""DaytonianinManhattan"" reported that the building dated to 1892 and was once owned by a descendant of a signer of the Declaration of Independence. In 1915 the mansion became known as the R. Horace Gallatin house, after its patrician owner, who was a descendant of Elbridge Gerry, a founding father who not only signed the Declaration of Independence but also later served as President James Madison's vice president. Gallatin was also the great-grandson of Albert Gallatin, who served as treasury secretary under Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson, and was a U.S. senator and congressman from Pennsylvania. Albert Gallatin was sent to St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1813 to negotiate an end to the War of 1812. There are no outward signs that the mansion is the official residence of the Russian ambassador. Unlike other foreign government properties in Manhattan, there is no flag indicating what country the building belongs to, no brass plaque with the nation's name on it, and even the pair of standard ""No Standing"" parking signs flanking either side of the building's front curb are not the usual ""Diplomatic"" parking zone signs that would prevent ordinary New Yorkers from parking there. Observers believe this was all done to conceal the true identity of the home's resident. People watch as a Ukrainian activist group defiantly bathed the Manhattan townhouse of Russia's U.N. ambassador in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag. U.N.: 5 Similar protests supporting Ukraine have been staged around the globe at other Russian government properties. In London, a group of journalists projected the Ukrainian flag onto the Russian Embassy to protest the killings of reporters covering the war. In Lisbon, pro-Ukraine activists did the same, shining the Ukrainian flag on the front of the Russian Embassy to Portugal. In Washington, D.C., a large Ukrainian flag was unfurled in front of the Russian embassy and an image of the flag was projected onto that building. In Lithuania, protesters dyed the small lake in front if the Russian embassy in Vilnius red, naming it the ""Lake of blood."" An Olympic swimmer swam through the red-colored water and others floated in it to represent the dead Ukrainian civilians who have fallen victim to Putin's horrors. ""Putin is a killer war criminal, everybody knows that,"" Zgurov said. ""Zelenskyy is a hero. Our president is indeed a hero."" Paliashvili called Putin ""a war criminal"" who is ""probably something very close to Hitler and to the Nazi regime."" As the members of Razom For Ukraine wrapped up their silent protest, they quietly sang the Ukrainian national anthem. As their voices filled the soft Manhattan night, they all suddenly shouted ""Slava Ukraini!"" for ""Glory to Ukraine!"" several times.",6
2022-04-20,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-space-force-satellite-weapons-test-ban-russia-china-mark-levin,"Levin goes off on reported anti-satellite weapons test ban, says decision endangers US, empowers Russia","Former Deputy National Security Adviser McFarland weighs in on 'The Story with Martha McCallum' President Biden's reported plan to ban U.S. anti-satellite-weapons tests is of three-pronged concern, Mark Levin said on ""The Mark Levin Show on Westwood One."" Levin reported that the White House became alarmed after a similar Russian test created space junk, which if hefty enough can endanger other satellites or crash to Earth itself. The move appeared to encapsulate a trio of Biden administration priorities: spite Donald Trump, boost American rivals like Russia and China, and pursue a self-destructive extreme-environmentalist agenda, Levin said. Vice President Kamala Harris will announce the move during a visit to a Space Force installation in Lompoc, Calif., Levin noted, adding that the U.S.S.F. is indeed both the newest branch of the U.S. military — and one conceived by Trump to defend against exactly such potential attacks from enemy nations, among other reasons. Levin ""This has gone under the radar,"" Levin continued. ""President Trump, having enormous foresight, created the Space Force … because space is being weaponized by the Chinese and by the Russians,"" Levin said. ""They’re way ahead of us. Obama didn’t want to deal with it. He was too busy destroying the environment in Hawaii building a wall so the ocean wouldn't affect his property."" Levin said Harris's announcement is an alarming way to respond to a Russian space test, even if it did create such a junk field. ""So the response is to unilaterally disarm? They have killer satellites up there — the Chinese do, the Russians do, so we need to catch up,"" he said. ""So Biden says, ‘Did Trump do this?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘, can I have a vanilla ice cream? And since Trump did this I'm going to reverse it.'"" ""And that's [Biden's] people too — they're radical kooks — they hate this country — they hate the American people,"" Levin said, reiterating that Biden has proven to take any action as long as it is the opposite of Trump, even if such behavior hurt the United States or its security. Trump&amp;Biden Levin read aloud from reportage on the self-imposed ban, noting it appears Biden and Harris are chiefly concerned with Russia creating space junk, not more dire characteristics of the situation. ""Russia’s creating too much debris in space, so we have to cut back. That’s like China creating all this carbon dioxide, so what do we do? We destroy our economic system,"" he said of the Green New Deal push. Levin said the proper response to Russia's test would be to launch its own ""killer satellites"" to space in a Reaganesque peace-through-strength illustration. Addressing young liberals who might agree with Biden, Levin noted that even the most minor action from an enemy satellite would eliminate their access to social media. ""For the millennials out there, they could knock out your iPhones — ‘Oh my gosh, no — say it’s not true,'"" he said. Putin&amp;Xi More importantly, he noted, an attack from a satellite helmed by Russia or China could wreck the energy or electric grid, weapons systems and other installations — adding that Biden also appeared to blame his decision once again on Vladimir Putin. ""Joe Biden is the biggest sap and lapdog for our enemies … the Ukrainians have had to beg, borrow and steal to get the weapons they need. The United States is … late while people are being slaughtered."" ""You don’t buckle into Putin with the pipeline and all the rest of it — you don’t buckle into your Chinese masters — you don't buckle to the Iranians,"" Levin said. ""You don’t leave the border wide open where young people die from fentanyl being shoved into this country by the wheelbarrowfull."" ""What kind of a nut is this?""

2022-04-20,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reporters-notebook-sitting-tarmac-codel,Reporter's Notebook: Sitting on the tarmac,"Sen. Steve Daines joins 'Hannity' to discuss what he saw on the ground in war-torn country. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., began a Zoom call with reporters this week with a travelogue. ""I just returned from an Intelligence Committee congressional delegation trip with three other members,"" said Crow. ""We visited multiple locations within Poland, Slovakia and Romania."" Over the past couple of weeks, who hasn’t? ’S : , ’ The two-week Easter/Passover/Ramadan recess on Capitol Hill – coupled with an easing of the pandemic restrictions – prompted lawmakers to travel more overseas this month than they have since late 2019. These are official ""congressional delegation"" trips, known as ""s."" Congressional leaders, senior members and committee chairs in both the House and Senate lead members on these trips abroad. Sens. Lindsey Graham, Bob Menendez, Richard Burr, Rob Portman and Ben Sasse, and Rep. Ronny Jackson were greeted on their arrival to Taiwan, April 14, 2022. The trips are useful for fact-finding, gathering information and also escaping the ""groupthink"" that sometimes bedevils those who toil inside the Beltway. But do the jaunts actually fix problems or prompt policy changes? Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., represents part of Fort Campbell, which sits astride the southern Kentucky/northern Tennessee border. Like Crow, Green also just returned from a trip to the Ukrainian border. The congressman says he met with a French battalion commander who is meeting with a U.S. Stryker Brigade combat team in Poland under the aegis. ""I make these trips and say goodbye to my wife so that the military men and women in my community don’t have to kiss their spouses goodbye and go to war,"" said Green. One congressional delegation had the opportunity to visit the Serit border crossing between Romania and Ukraine. In addition, Green met with U.S. military personnel in Poland. ""They were short of washing machines,"" said Green, who promptly messaged the Pentagon for more. ""That’s just one of the unspoken or unseen things."" Taxpayers used to howl at lawmakers taking overseas ""official"" trips to exotic locations. The emphasis was once on the beach and pool – with a symposium or two sprinkled in to justify the affair. But that’s no longer the case. ""Congressional travel has changed dramatically in the last 30 or 40 years, in large part, because of media scrutiny that was brought on to the members of Congress who were frankly getting vacations on the taxpayer dollars,"" said Brad Fitch of the Congressional Management Foundation. Fitch notes that lawmakers are worried about criticism that they’re not really working. Or worse yet, the perception that lawmakers aren’t working when they go on these trips. Former officer and Senate aide Ron Marks helped coordinate a number of s for late Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Marks says there was one senator who demanded a certain amount of beach and leisure time on trips of yore. . : 'I ... ' ""There were squash games scheduled during all of this,"" said Marks of one particular senator. But Marks says there’s now pressure to keep an intense business program. ""You schedule from 8 in the morning until 10 at night. You don’t really have a chance to think,"" said Marks. In fact, some lawmakers don’t even like to go on s led by certain congressional leaders because the days are so grueling. Reps. John Katko and James Comer were part of a recent congressional delegation to the southern border with Mexico. ""No sleeping, even on the plane,"" said one source. ""I’ve been to a couple of these myself where they had better be pouring coffee at 3 or 4 in the afternoon,"" said Fitch. ""There’s a tedium to some of these trips that can be a little bit challenging."" But advocates of congressional travel say lawmakers can only ingest so much information from hearings or leafing through briefing dossiers. ""Sometimes just having somebody sitting there, smelling the air, hearing what’s going on on the ground, even if you’re just riding through there, give them far greater understanding than anything they’re going to get reading a newspaper or reading a briefing in Washington,"" said Marks. ""I would rather have them going out there and at least kicking the tires a little bit than sitting back and sort of making it up like an analyst."" '' - : ' ' But Marks concedes some lawmakers do take congressional trips specifically for glorified photo-ops. To see and be seen. To make a point about a given political issue. Or maybe, even make the administration of the opposing party look bad. ""I know there are political games that get played here,"" said Marks. ""I understand the 1,001 reasons why people show up in different places. Politicians want to get re-elected."" This is why lots of Republicans have flocked to the southern border over the past two weeks. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., heads to Eagle Pass, Texas, in the coming days to highlight the crisis. The Biden administration is under fire from ers – and members of its own party – for ending Title 42, the pandemic era policy that curbed migration. There’s concern that illegal immigration could explode at the border once the administration formally rescinds Title 42 in late May. Republicans want to make sure the public knows who is responsible. That’s why ers are revved up to question Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at a hearing next week. Meanwhile, vulnerable Democrats facing competitive re-election bids are also putting distance between themselves and the administration’s policy, and also drawing attention to the border. It’s good policy for those Democrats to use President Biden as a foil. , - Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee . That’s the formal panel charged with electing Democrats to the Senate. Peters also chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. And, Peters is now part of a growing list of Senate Democrats who are bucking their party on Title 42. Peters’ decision gives other Democrats air cover to challenge the administration on the policy – and use their own president as a foil. So expect a lot more lawmakers, from both parties, to head to the border. Katko and Comer were part of a congressional delegation this week to the southern border with Mexico. ""In some of these cases, members of Congress are using to showcase an issue,"" said Fitch. ""There’s no denying that some members of Congress feel there’s a symbolic value to going on a trip, whether it’s getting their picture taken with Border Patrol agents or getting their picture taken next to troops in Afghanistan or Iraq overseas."" But do the trips find solutions to big policy fights? ""They’re never going to solve the problem,"" said Marks. ""If you’re talking about really solving problems, that gets down to people and hard bargaining across a table somewhere. Discussing budgets. Discussing laws. Discussing oversight."" Nine U.S. senators, led by Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, gave a press conference from Poland on March 19, 2022. But long trips mean several things. Lots of time on airplanes. Lots of time on buses. Lots of time in hotel bars. The creation of the jet airplane made it hard for lawmakers to get to know one another in Washington. But the pandemic and the Capitol riot drove an even more stark wedge between the sides and poisoned the congressional well. Lawmakers not only couldn’t get to know one another as well because of the pandemic, but because of the riot, some had no interest in meeting members from the other side and vice versa. But, ironically the return of s could help thaw frosty congressional relations in an almost intangible, unquantifiable way. 'S : , ' ""Relationships are built if you’re on a long flight from Poland back to Washington, D.C., and you’re sitting next to a member of Congress from the other party. It may be an opportunity to build lasting relationships,"" said Fitch. ""I’ve seen legislative deals that were cut because of long congressional trips."" ""Tribalism is tearing this country apart,"" said Green just back from Eastern Europe. ""So you’re just sitting there, getting to know someone across the aisle. You’re finding out about their children. You’re finding out about their college experience. That creates relationships inside the Congress that go way beyond just the issue at hand."" So, the recent spate of travel may not end the war in Ukraine. It may not solve the border crisis. Someone may not get a brainstorm about inflation while sitting on the tarmac. Yet. But the return to extensive congressional travel could at least break down barriers between the sides. The sides can build trust if they’re talking. And if there’s dialogue? Well, that’s probably better than what’s infected the Capitol over the past couple of years.",13

Fox News contributor Karl Rove questioned President Biden's detailed breakdown of $800 million in additional U.S. military aid going to Ukraine, Thursday, arguing on ""America's Newsroom"" that revealing the information to Russia is not a useful strategy. $800 : Well, look, I'd go back if we're if we're going to be critical, let's go back and be even more critical because remember, last June, before an international meeting with Putin, President Biden paused U.S. military assistance to Ukraine and did not begin to renew it until November. So we had June, July, August, September, October and then beginning in mid-November, we began the resupply of their military needs again. So that five months, over five-month period of where we were sitting on the sidelines was very problematic. But having said that, we do need to give them everything they need and in as fast as we possibly can. It's boggling -- mind-boggling to me as to why we're laying out what we're giving them. I mean, we've been telling, you know, this latest tranche of $800 million includes 155 millimeter artillery pieces. Plus the president today said we're sending one 144,000 tactical rounds for every Russian tank. We're sending 10 anti-tank missile systems. I mean, maybe he's doing that for domestic purposes. I'm not certain it's very useful to do it for him from the perspective of telling the Russians what we're doing.",0

Macgregor, who served in the Gulf War, predicted on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that despite $1 billion in weapons and other aid being to Ukraine paid for by American tax dollars, that will not be enough to turn the tide.

'S 'S : We have an administration that would say that our test that we should have done a week or two ago was provoking Putin.

If this entire war is our government and other European countries being so shortsighted they just didn't believe Russia would do this, that's what's scary to me. I'm not going to armchair quarterback this administration in every military tactic they do during this invasion. But I'm going to look back six months ago, nine months ago and say, what red flags?

2022-04-22,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russian-cyber-threat-nato-jason-blessing,The Russian cyber threat is here to stay and NATO needs to understand it,"Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., on how the U.S. could support Ukraine during Russia’s invasion. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has escalated warnings about likely Russian cyber-attacks on American infrastructure and business. More worrying still, cyber alarmists like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., have suggested that cyber-attacks from the Kremlin could be acts of war that trigger ’s collective defense. This sky-is-falling delusion, particularly from leaders with access to classified intelligence, is at best counterproductive and at worst dangerous. Cyber-attacks are rarely acts of war, and treating them as if they are undermines ’s ability to deal with real threats short of cyber war. , has only invoked Article 5 – which triggers a collective response – once and that was after the 9/11 attacks. Cyber-attacks are unlikely to destroy buildings and kill thousands in an instant. While collective defense extends to cyberspace, few operations could realistically be a cause for war. This would include cyber-attacks resulting in death or damage like traditional military operations or coordinated assaults that take the power grid or entire economic sectors offline. These scenarios are unlikely though: such attacks require far too much time, funding, manpower, and control. Instead, most attacks temporarily overwhelm servers with traffic, deny network access, hold computers hostage, and steal or delete data. Building cyber resilience is an important step forward. It acknowledges that, in many cases, the Russians will get the best of us in cyberspace. Even if allies wanted to trigger Article 5 over cyber operations, disagreements about the definitions of threats, origins of attacks, and pain thresholds in cyberspace can derail the process. 'S ' ' Collective retaliation requires a unanimous vote across ; building unity across these points is nearly impossible for most cyber activity. Unlike missile attacks or tanks in the streets, few ""red lines"" exist to distinguish cybercrime, cyber espionage, and cyber disruption from digital acts of war. Beyond the bureaucratic and logistical limitations of elevating cyber to a casus belli, focusing on cyber-attacks as acts of war distracts from the more likely Russian digital assaults below the level of armed conflict. These include ransomware attacks and supply chain infiltrations that look like criminal activity or espionage. The Kremlin is particularly adept at the latter. In the SolarWinds compromise, Russia hacked one company’s software product to access networks of Fortune 500 companies and U.S. government agencies. Spillover from operations in Ukraine poses an additional risk. The Russians have already deployed several digital tools to destroy computer data, resulting in corrupted computers for Ukrainian companies with government support roles. The same malicious software has also affected several Latvian and Lithuanian businesses. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks to the press ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers at headquarters, in Brussels, Belgium, Nov. 26, 2021. The danger is another situation like NotPetya in 2017, where malware self-replicated, spread past Ukrainian targets to cripple networks in over 150 countries, and created $10 billion in damages. Each of these scenarios are much more likely than a ""cyber doomsday"" that would justify an Article 5 response from members. To be fair, policymakers’ fears of cyber war have led to some positive developments for the alliance. For instance, over the last several years, has developed its own framework for combining cyber and conventional military capabilities in warfighting. But allies remain unprepared to deal with ""death by 1000 cuts"" in cyberspace. Concentrating only on acts of war comes at the expense of addressing the cumulative costs of low-level cyber threats over time. It leads to an overreliance on cyber deterrence or defensive whack-a-mole strategies, neither of which are sustainable. Threats of retaliation simply don’t deter most cyber-attacks, and it is unrealistic for defensive measures to stop every hacker. Policymakers across must acknowledge that security failures are the norm in cyberspace, and that the compounding costs of failure over time are every bit as dangerous as the threat of cyber war. Building cyber resilience is an important step forward. It acknowledges that, in many cases, the Russians will get the best of us in cyberspace. The focus is on controlling failures to limit damage and quickly get networks back online. Moving from buzzword to actual strategy requires addressing several questions. Which digital assets are most significant? Where is the alliance most exposed to Russian cyber-attacks? Where should reduce operating risks, and in what areas can it assume more? How can allies track long-term trends and adapt to new technologies? The Russian cyber threat is here to stay. Collective defense is – and should remain – the cornerstone of . But time is running out for the alliance to protect itself from scenarios that aren’t all-out cyber war.",22

2022-04-23,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russians-reflections-exile-georgia,A Russian's reflections from exile in Georgia,"Exiled Russia journalist Andrei Loshak describes the state of Russia's future, while encouraging Russians to avoid supporting anything in favor of the Ukrainian war. ""At the beginning, the graffiti used to say 'F--- Russia' or 'F--- Putin,' but now it says 'F--- Russians.' It's unpleasant, of course,"" Russian journalist Andrei Loshak says. He is one of the thousands of Russians who fled to neighboring Georgia in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine and around the time that Russia criminalized independent war reporting. Graffiti aside, Loshak says he is fond of Georgia and relishes that, from there, he can say and write what he chooses. He tries to be philosophical about all the inconveniences associated with fleeing one's country in a heartbeat and having credit cards that are pretty much useless anywhere outside of Russia and the reality that he won't be able to go home anytime soon. The bigger issue, he says, is the incredible malaise about the war and what it is doing to his world, his cousins, his neighbors. ""My soul aches a lot. It aches for Ukraine. It is not a foreign country, not an abstract Syria, which is also terrible,"" Loshak says. ""War is terrible. But Ukraine is also my native country, my native land. My father was born in Kharkiv, and my grandfather was born in Odesa. As a child, I spent every summer in Odesa. All of this is sheer pain."" Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a cabinet meeting via videoconference at the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, Russia, March 23, 2022. ‘’ The former Soviet republic of Georgia is famous for its festive tables forever groaning with food and local wine, but Loshak says none of his compatriot exiles are much in the mood for all that. ""I haven't watched a single series or movie since the war began, although I used to watch a lot. And when my Netflix account was shut down because I could no longer pay for it, I didn't even notice,"" Loshak said. ""Thousands of people have written to me that they have the same condition. You open up Telegram feeds in the morning, and you're immersed in this hell, and you can't stop."" Loshak says one shouldn't hide from this condition, calling it his and Russians' ""punishment, collective responsibility at least knowing what they're doing and what's going on there."" The pandemic was probably good practice for the independent journalists in Russia who now need to do much of their work remotely. It is not easy, but many say they are determined to keep at it, countering the state propaganda in whatever way they can. Loshak is working on a documentary about how many families are fighting and splitting and no longer on speaking terms over differing opinions of the war. This is causing a big rift in Russian society. Loshak, like many, never believed the war would actually happen. Asked when he came to understand just what Russian President Putin was capable of, Loshak says it was when explosions in four apartment blocks around Russia went off, killing hundreds in the early fall of 1999. The Kremlin attributed it to Chechen terrorists. To this day, many suspect the hand of the behind those deadly bombings, creating a justification for Moscow to invade Chechnya. ""He never seemed kind to me,"" Loshak says of Putin. ""I actively disliked him from 1999, even though I was 26 at the time and wasn't interested in politics. But I felt something immediately in my bones ... his background, the way he looked, the . A soldier comforts Larysa Kolesnyk, 82, after being evacuated from Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, March 30, 2022. ""When the terrorist attacks began, on the wave of which he started the second Chechen war, intuitively I got the feeling this was a very dirty game. And from that moment, I had the feeling he was quite a bloody man,"" Loshak says. At some point, he says, that was forgotten and Putin just seemed a pragmatic, rational man who would keep Russia in a sort of gray area. ""But then,"" Loshak adds, ""there was this Dima Yakovlev law."" The law was drawn up in 2012 in retaliation for the Magnitsky Act being passed in Congress. The Magnitsky Act called for sanctions on people deemed ""human rights abusers"" in the aftermath of the death of Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian jail. It was a death the Russians tried to sweep under the table. Dima Yakovlev was a Russian orphan who died at the hands of his adoptive U.S. parents after being left in a parked car for nine hours. So the Russian retaliatory logic was that no Americans should adopt Russian children because they could not be trusted to protect them. A rather asymmetrical tit-for-tat, many, including Loshak, say. ""It was difficult to punish Americans economically, but it was possible to do this,"" Loshak said. ""It was total insanity. I don't understand how these people are made if they sacrifice children to punish some American families."" Loshak feels Russia has gotten to the point where ""it lives in the head of an elderly officer with outdated ideas about the world, his complexes and so on … the whole country finds itself in this kind of insane matrix."" Asked what Russians seeking change can do now, in the current situation, Loshak said, ""I don't have an answer right now. I can't say, 'Guys, come out to rallies' because it makes no sense now. And, anyway, I lost this moral authority when I left the country."" A resident examines destroyed Russian tanks in the village of Dmytrivka close to Kyiv, Ukraine, April 2, 2022. He believes nothing short of hundreds of thousands of people pouring onto the streets will force the Russian authorities to stand up and listen. But that's not going to happen, according to many observers, because people are afraid. ""There's no point in calling for political activism right now. Perhaps we should remember the manifesto Solzhenitsyn wrote in the 1970s — 'Live Not By Lies,' about how to remain a decent person under the conditions of a totalitarian state. You must try not to cooperate with it,"" he says. ""Do not take money from the state as far as that is possible. Don't owe it anything."" He tells his friends making the hard decision to stay or go to leave. ""Save your soul,"" Loshak said, adding Russia ""is sliding toward real fascism as a form of government.""",0

""Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly. Trevor, a former U.S. Marine, is free from Russian detention,"" President Biden said in a statement. ""I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence. And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom."" Joey Reed, the father of former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, stands next to a placard of his son outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, , on July 29, 2021, during a press conference. : In their own statement, the Reed family thanked Biden ""for making the decision to bring Trevor home"" as well as other administration officials and Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations whom the family said traveled to Moscow in the hours before the Ukraine war began in hopes of securing Reed's release. ""Today, our prayers have been answered and Trevor is safely on his way back to the United States,"" the statement read, adding that ""as soon as he's ready, he'll tell his own story"" and that the Reed family stands with ""all the other families of wrongfully detained Americans who are still waiting for their own release moment."" Reed was one of several Americans known to be held by Russia, including star Brittney Griner, who was detained in February after authorities said a search of her bag revealed a cannabis derivative, and Michigan corporate security executive Paul Whelan, who is being held on espionage-related charges his family says are bogus. ""We won’t stop until Paul Whelan and others join Trevor in the loving arms of family and friends,"" Biden also said Wednesday. U.S. senior administration officials said Wednesday that Reed, who is in ""good spirits"", is currently heading back to America to be reunited with his family and that his health was an ""intense concern"" and driving factor leading to his release. ""This is a discreet issue in which we were able to make an arrangement with the Russians,"" one official said about the prisoner swap. ""It represents no change – zero – to our approach to the appalling violence in Ukraine.""

Reed, a now-30-year-old U.S. Marine Corps veteran and former presidential security guard, had been living in Russia in the summer of 2019 when was arrested by Russian police and accused of assaulting a police officer. He had been celebrating in a park with his longtime Russian girlfriend and her colleagues at the time, his father, Joey Reed, told Fox News Digital earlier this month. Reed was sentenced to nine years in prison, though his family has maintained his innocence and the U.S. government has described him as unjustly detained. ""He was extremely intoxicated because they’d been to a party for her law firm in a park,"" he explained. At the time, Reed had been taking Russian language classes for an international studies degree through the University of North Texas, his father said. Following a public trial, Reed was convicted in July 2020 of assaulting police officers and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Joey and Paula Reed, parents of U.S. Marine Corps veteran and Russian prisoner Trevor Reed, stand in Lafayette Park near the White House on March 30, 2022, in Washington. ‘’ , His time in Russian prisons and labor camps had been concerning, the family said. ""He was essentially in solitary confinement, I believe, for over a year in a pretty bad prison,"" Reed said. ""Once he got to the labor camp … they would wake him up every hour. You know, they were punishing him for different things."" He added: ""My son saw the sun maybe a dozen times in two years."" Trevor pushed back against Russian authorities’ efforts to make him work at the labor camp, telling them: ""I’m not working for you. You’ve taken me hostage, and I’m not going to make stuff for you to make money on."" Trevor’s situation grew recently concerning in recent months after he became ill with active tuberculosis and then began continuously coughing up blood. In the other side of the prisoner swap, the U.S. agreed to return Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot serving a 20-year federal prison sentence in Connecticut for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. after he was arrested in Liberia in 2010 and extradited to the U.S. Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was arrested for alleged spying, listens to the verdict in a courtroom at the Moscow City Court in Moscow, Russia, June 15, 2020. - Russia had sought his return for years while also rejecting entreaties by high-level U.S. officials to release Reed, who was nearing his 1,000th day in custody. The two prisoners were swapped in a European country. Though officials would not say where the transfer took place, in the hours before it happened commercial flight trackers identified a plane belonging to Russia’s federal security service as flying to Ankara, Turkey. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons also updated its website overnight to reflect that Yaroshenko was no longer in custody. A person familiar with the situation told Fox News Wednesday that the prisoner swap is an ""extraordinary rarity"" with regard to the Biden administration’s strategy in bringing Americans who are held hostage and unjustly detained around the globe home to the United States. The ""very difficult decision"" made by the president was ""driven by circumstances with respect to Trevor’s health,"" the person told Fox News, adding that the Biden administration is ""committed and the president is committed to trying to find ways to bring others home around the world. ""The person said that the president was willing to make the call because of how ""strongly he feels about his commitment to bringing Americans home.""The person said conversations regarding Reed’s return to the United States were ongoing for ""months and months."" The person stressed that Yaroshenko’s return to Russia was not something that ""eradicated his conviction,"" but rather a ""commutation."" The person also noted that Yaroshenko served ""more than a majority of his sentence."" Fox News' Stephanie Pagones, Brooke Singman and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",18

What is more, the United States stopped sending lethal assistance to Ukraine between June and November 2021.

2022-05-02,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-inevitable-end-stage-russiagate,Tucker: Ukraine war is maybe the inevitable end stage of Russiagate,"Fox News host gives his take on the real motivation behind U.S. involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Here's a happy memory. By breakfast, really even brunch, on Election Day 2016,, virtually nobody in Washington, D.C. thought Donald Trump could win, and they didn't think that because the entire press corps had been telling them for months that Trump had, as they always put it, literally no chance—not even as an abstract, theoretical matter. This wasn't actually a race. In fact, come November 8th, you'll remember this. Donald Trump was going to be drowned by a towering blue tsunami and swept away forever, along with the rest of the Republican Party — the collaborators, anyway—and polling numbers seemed to confirm that this was going to happen and so, by the way, did the private betting markets. At least one of those markets had set the spread at 80-20 for Hillary Clinton that morning. In the end, of course, they were not only wrong, they were hilariously wrong. By midnight, Trump had won and a lot of highly educated, extremely well credentialed people suddenly looked ridiculous. Hillary Clinton herself was so shocked by the results that night that she refused to give a concession speech. She went to bed hoping it was just a dream. Now, you probably remember all of that very well, but it was what happened next in the days between the election and Thanksgiving that it turns out in a lot of ways was much more important. ‘ ’; Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks at a campaign event. What happened during that period set the course for where we are right now. Where we are right now is speeding toward one of the great disasters in our history. So, the leaders of the Democratic Party couldn't, in effect, handle the outcome of the 2016 election. They snapped under the strain of it, under the crushed expectation. But rather than look inward and assess their own role in the disaster —"" What did we do wrong? Why did voters reject us?"" and other questions that emotionally mature adults might have asked — Democratic leaders instead immediately set out to find somebody else to blame for the election results. And soon they settled on Russia. Vladimir Putin got Donald Trump elected, they told us. Hillary Clinton said that repeatedly. Now, at first it was hard to take any of it very seriously. We tried, but there was no evidence it was true at all and so a rational person concluded the obvious. This was a childish psychological defense mechanism. It was not a factual claim and yet they kept saying it in the face of no evidence and over time they began acting on it like it was true. Then, even over more time, they paralyzed the entire federal government for years, fruitlessly trying to prove the core claims of Russiagate, but they never could because those claims weren't true. And yet, critically, they clung to those claims. They never stopped repeating the talking point. The Russian government, ""hacked our election."" That was Jen Psaki not long ago, saying it out loud like it were true. Now, here's the context. As she said that, Psaki was trying to explain why the Biden administration is, in effect, working to overthrow the Russian government right now and for once, Jen Psaki was telling the truth. That is why. Democrats have convinced themselves that Russia stole the presidency, which rightfully belonged to Hillary Clinton, and they mean it when they say it. And that's why they are taking us to war with Russia. 'T 2024 Now, there are a lot of things going on here, a lot of threads as in any big story, but on some level, the core motivation is just that simple. Here's what we know it's not. We know the war in Ukraine is not about saving democracy. Please. We know it's not about protecting the sacred borders of a sovereign country. We know the Biden administration doesn't care about those principles because they run our country, and we see how they act. And we know for dead certain and this comes as sad news to a lot of Americans who are compassionate, but we know now that the war in Ukraine is certainly not about helping the Ukrainian people, those poor people. Many more Ukrainian civilians will die certainly, thanks to the Biden administration's policies. If you wanted to save Ukraine, its people, its infrastructure, its nation, you would push for a settlement now. You would have done it two months ago, but they're not doing that. They've rejected it out of hand. So that's not their goal, saving Ukraine, saving human lives. No, that's not their goal. Instead, the war in Ukraine is designed to cause regime change in Moscow. They want to topple the Russian government. That would be payback for the 2016 election. So, this is the logical, maybe the inevitable end stage of Russiagate. Now, we should have seen this coming because they said it out loud years ago. Here's Adam Schiff from two years ago, predicting it, saying it. Watch this. : As one witness put it during our impeachment inquiry, the United States aids Ukraine and her people so that we can fight Russia over there and we don't have to fight Russia here. ‘ ’; Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting on the current situation in Russia's iron and steel industry via videoconference in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on Wednesday. So, we arm Ukraine so we can fight Russia. Now, how many Americans , but how many Americans then or now want to ""fight Russia?"" A very small group, but Adam Schiff said it out loud at the time in the House of Representatives. We don't arm Ukraine so we can help the Ukrainians. They're merely unfortunate pawns in all of this. We arm Ukraine so that we can punish Russia. Why? For stealing Hillary Clinton's coronation. If only we had taken Adam Schiff seriously, as he said it again, and again, and again. But now we can't help but take Adam Schiff seriously because he's one of the prime movers of this war. Adam Schiff spent this weekend in Eastern Europe checking on the progress of the war he has done so much to bring about. He traveled there with Nancy Pelosi and a number of other of the most conspiracy-minded Democrats in Congress. These are the Russiagate true believers seeing their theory come to fruition. That's what this is. Here's the group, Pelosi, Schiff and the rest, meeting with the president of Ukraine. : Welcome. Nice to meet you. Thank you for coming. : My pleasure to see you. : Jim McGovern, Massachusetts. - 'S : Nice to meet you thank you. : Good to see you again, Mr. President. : Hi again good to see you too. You’re welcome. : Jason Crow from Colorado : Nice to meet you. : Adam Schiff from California. Honor to meet you How did Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi wind up in charge of America's foreign policy as we stand on the cusp of a third world war? And why are Republicans supporting them? What happens when you put people with a demonstrated lack of boundaries or self-control or wisdom in charge of something as important as the fate of nations? Well, here's what happens. Watch as one after the other, the Democrats you just saw on tape, announce that this regime change is not nearly over. In fact, this war has just begun. Watch. : But one thing is really clear that this delegation wanted to send, but also President Biden has made very clear with his most recent aid package request. It is a historic request that we're going to push hard in the United States Congress to help pass and it sends a very simple message. We are not interested in stalemates. We are not interested in going back to the status quo. The United States of America is in this to win and we will stand with Ukraine until victory is won. - That was Congressman Jason Crow, a confirmed buffoon, telling us that we are not in it to achieve a stalemate. ""We're?"" Really? Some of us were under the impression, based on their public statements, that we were defending the sovereignty of another country, Ukraine, that it's not up to us, it's up to the voters of Ukraine because Ukraine is a democracy, but here's Congressman Crow telling us we're not going to accept a ""stalemate."" We're in it to win it. We're going to win. We're here until we get victory. Well, that raises the obvious question. What is winning? What is victory? How do we know when we've won? Well, Jason Crow didn't tell us and neither, by the way, did Nancy Pelosi. She just said, we're going to keep sending weapons to Ukraine ""until the fight is done."" : We believe that we are visiting you to say thank you for your fight for freedom, that we are on a frontier for freedom and that your fight is in fight for everyone and so our commitment is to be there for you until fight is done. How did we get here exactly? Do you feel betrayed? If you're one of the millions of good-hearted Americans who put a Ukrainian flag pin on your lapel or put one in front of your house expressing solidarity with the poor, oppressed people of Ukraine, you probably didn't think you were signing up for this. Nancy Pelosi telling us we're in a war with a nuclear-armed power with no clear end date. Seen that movie before? Oh, we just finished one after 20 years in Afghanistan. Will it look like that? This is an open-ended conflict, said Nancy Pelosi. Just like the war on terror and just in case you missed it, they all repeated that line. Here's your nightmare again. Adam Schiff in charge of the war against Russia. Watch. : All of the freedom loving world has an interest in the outcome of this war and ensuring that Ukraine is victorious and we are determined to do everything in our power to make it so. We are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and will until victory is won. These people are playing dress-up. They have no idea what they're talking about, and they don't care. They get to pretend to be statesmen for a day. But when Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi— again people with a demonstrated years long record of being willing to say anything for personal power, anything to improve the fortunes of their political party—when they're standing up with a foreign head of state saying, ""Here's an open check, you fill in the number,"" you've got to wonder where this is going. We know where it could go. This is the most reckless foreign policy in our lifetimes, in American history. You are watching a group of decadent, in some cases senile leaders, casually dismiss the consequences of going to war with the nuclear-armed nation, dismiss the consequences of nuclear war, like it's not even worth thinking about, but it is worth thinking about. They tell us daily, Vladimir Putin is evil and insane and that may well be true. But this same man has threatened to use nuclear weapons against the United States and western Europe if this continues and why don't we believe him? You may have missed this. The New York Times didn't seem to have time to cover it, but here's Russia's foreign minister just last week, underscoring the point. . 'S '' , : Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a chilling warning, The risk of nuclear war is a real one. Speaking to state run media, Lavrov said, ""The danger is serious. It is real. It cannot be underestimated. ""He added that he did not want to see these risks of nuclear war ""artificially inflated."" He does not see it as an artificially inflated sense risk, says Lavrov. So, what they're saying is ""we will use nuclear weapons against you and your allies if you don't back off."" If, for example, this seems existential like you're trying to overthrow our government. It's hardly a defense of Russia to say that's a real possibility and has been for quite some time. So, it's two years ago that Vladimir Putin revised Russia's nuclear deterrent policy. Now the new policy allows Russia to use nuclear weapons in response to a conventional strike. That means some sort of non-nuclear provocation. Now, in March, Russia's former president, Dmitry Medvedev, who sits on Russia's Security Council, reminded our country of this policy. He warned Joe Biden that Russia would indeed use nuclear weapons against the West in response to any ""act of aggression that is committed against Russia and its allies."" Now, what would that look like? Would it include helping to shoot down a Russian transport plane carrying hundreds of Russian troops? The Pentagon has admitted doing that. You don't have to be for Russia to see that as a pretty reckless act and not just doing it, but then bragging about it to News. Where does that get us? We should find out. We do know that Putin has placed Russia's nuclear forces on high alert and again, Russia has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world and again, why wouldn't he use those weapons? They tell us daily he is evil and insane and he may well be a risk. Yeah, but no one in Washington seems worried in the slightest. In fact, Congressman Adam Kinzinger, who has clearly something to live for at this point, is now calling for a blank check, an open-ended conflict in Ukraine using the same legal justification that got us into Iraq for nearly 20 years. He wants an authorization to use military force. Watch. 'S 150K : Senator Kaine was with us and he said it is too soon to begin talking about potential use of force in Ukraine. Do you think he's right? : No, I don't. I don't think we need to be using force in Ukraine right now. I just introduced an , an authorization for the use of military force, giving the president basically congressional leverage or permission to use it if s, nuclear, biological or chemical are used in Ukraine. It doesn't compel the president to do it. It just says if it is used, he has that leverage. There may be a point that we have to recognize, you know look, this is, prior to World War , there were moments nobody ever wanted to get involved and eventually came to realize they had to. I hope we don't get to that point here, but we should be ready if we do. ""Prior to World War ,"" says Adam Kinzinger. So last year, Adam Kinzinger was a guy who'd been redistricted out of his own district and was trolling for some kind of cable news contributor. The future looked grim for Adam Kinzinger. Now, Adam Kinzinger is on the Sunday shows every weekend doing his Winston Churchill imitation. So, you can see there's a built-in incentive for mediocre and intellectually limited members of Congress to play the war hawk. But you have to ask yourself: why, all of a sudden, is everybody talking about chemical and biological weapons? ' ' '' It was just a couple of weeks ago that Joe Biden, the United States, promised to respond ""in kind"" to the potential use of chemical weapons by Russia. In other words, United States would use its chemical weapons against the Russians if they used theirs against the Ukrainians. And then because you're supposed to admit that you have chemical weapons, Joe Biden's national security adviser, whose memory still works, walked it back and told us. ""Oh, no, no, the president misspoke"" just like he did when he told us this was a regime change war. We would never use chemical weapons, said Jake Sullivan, but for some reason, a lot of people in Washington, in both parties, are still talking a lot about the U.S. using chemical weapons in Russia. Here's one of the most limited members of Congress Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, widely regarded as a mouthpiece for the Intel agencies. Listen to what he says. : What would happen if a chemical weapon was dropped in Ukraine and or a short-range tactical nuke? The question there is, would the world idly sit back and watch that happen without doing anything? , : What should we do? : I just find it hard to believe, and when I talk to the secretary general of , their job is really to defend 's not trigger Article Five, but in my judgment, that's beyond the pale. That crosses a red line and I think if that happens, we would have to respond in kind. 6 So, stories like this give people like Michael McCaul a chance to give you a moral lecture on television, which is the whole appeal, but again, all of a sudden, you have sitting members of Congress with access to high-level intelligence talking casually about using chemical weapons or nuclear weapons against a nuclear-armed state. So, it's not a defense of Russia. You don't have to believe Russia was justified in invading Ukraine. They weren't. It's not a defense of Putin to think to yourself, ""Hold on a second here. How did we get here? Talking about nuclear war on the Sunday shows. Should we be? Are we ready for that?"" It's clear no one in the Biden administration cares or is worried about it at all. The escalation continues at a remarkable pace, and you know that if you watch the money. We're continuing to shovel cash to the government of Ukraine, which just last year Democrats described as one of the most corrupt in the world, but whatever and we're sending money to Ukraine at levels that are astounding. Joe Biden signed off on a funding package in March for $13.6 billion in aid for Ukraine. Then he sent an additional $1.3 billion in late April. Then he sent $350 million in February. He also said $800 million in March. In addition to all of that, Joe Biden has requested another $33 billion for Ukraine and that request includes funding for ""longer-range artillery"" of a heavier caliber than the howitzers we've already been sending there. ' ' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks from Kyiv, Ukraine on Thursday. In other words, we're sending artillery to Ukraine that could easily strike Russian territory and we're sending $33 billion to do it. Now, how much is $33 billion in a moment when Congress is writing checks for trillions? Well, to put it into context, $33 billion is more than double what the Biden administration spends protecting our national borders and that's just one check to Ukraine, but it's double the annual budget to protect our borders. The Biden administration, in fact its more than double, just requested $15 billion for the entire budget for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and just $8 billion for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. So, we're spending twice on their borders what we spend on our own in one request in one week. How much is $33 billion? Well, it's more than we spend on Veterans Affairs every month taking care of our own veterans and the saddest point of all of this is it hasn't caused the Russians to withdraw from Ukraine, and no one's claiming that it will. It hasn't bankrupted Putin. It hasn't crippled the Russian economy. It certainly hurt our economy. What's going on here? Russian President Vladimir Putin use state-run media to spread the Kremlin’s message. Well, The Daily Mail is reporting that a Russian oligarch with close ties to Vladimir Putin, he's on the bad guy list right? No, because he met with the president's son in Moscow several times to discuss investment deals. So that oligarch, strangely, is being sanctioned by the U.K., but not by the Biden administration. The Biden administration, for all its bellicose talk about Russia decided not to sanction the one oligarch who's friends with the president's son. Just to restate. This has nothing to do with Ukraine. The war in Ukraine does not have anything to do with Ukraine, The long-term fortunes of the country or the health and safety of its people. Ithas to do with a lot of other things. The Biden administration's request, for example, for Ukraine aid – didn't see this coming – includes a pathway to citizenship for Afghan refugees, their spouses and children. ""The secretary of Homeland Security in the secretary's discretion may adjust the status of an Afghan national to that of an individual lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" Oh, so in an aid package meant to defend the borders of another sovereign nation, we continue to degrade our own. Bet you didn't think defending Ukrainian democracy meant admitting tens, of thousands of more foreign nationals into this country overnight.",0

The families of Americans detained in Russia are pushing for the Biden administration to bring more prisoners home as numerous individuals remain trapped behind enemy lines. The sister of Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine detained in Russia, and the father and sister of Trevor Reed, an American released in a prisoner swap with Russia last month, spoke out against ""wrongful"" detentions Wednesday on ""America's Newsroom."" ""It does, unfortunately, take the White House, the administration, to work out what tools need to be used to bring Americans home,"" Elizabeth Whelan told co-hosts Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino. ""We were shocked and devastated, actually, that Paul was left behind,"" she continued. ""So now we're asking the administration to finish this up, bring my brother Paul Whelan home, bring Brittney Griner home as well, and overall, to try to solve this problem of wrongful detention. It's a national security issue."" , U.S. Marine Trevor Reed landed in Texas, April 28, 2022, after a prisoner swap between the U.S. and Russia. Paul Whelan is currently serving a 16-year sentence in a maximum security prison in Russia after he was accused of espionage, which he claims is false. He was arrested in December 2018. ""We just tell her to keep fighting,"" Reed's father Joey said. ""He deserves his country and his president to bring him home."" Reed returned to the U.S. following April's prisoner swap in exchange for Russian drug trafficker Konstantin Yaroshenko. Reed was arrested in Russia in 2019, accused of assaulting a police officer. He was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2020. Reed's family has maintained his innocence and the U.S. government described him as unjustly maintained. ""Trevor's main concern at this point is the other families that are going through the same thing that we've been dealing with all of this time,"" Reed's sister Taylor said.

2022-05-05,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-biden-plan-torque-up-fear,Tucker: Biden's plan is to torque up the fear,"Fox News host reflects on the left's response to the possible overturn of Roe v. Wade, the state of the Biden presidency, and gives his take on the Russia-Ukraine war on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' So, you can question whether Joe Biden actually got – what's the number? – 81 million votes in the last presidential election and actually later in the show, we will, but even if you accept that there actually were people who voted for Joe Biden voluntarily, it's hard to believe that many of them got anything like what they expected in return for their votes. Joe Biden, not to be dark about it, just to be honest, Joe Biden has turned out to be an unparalleled disaster. That's not an overstatement. In fact, it's a generous assessment. Our country has never seen anything like what Joe Biden has done. Barely 15 months into his first term as president, Joe Biden has crashed the stock market, provoked a food shortage, opened our borders to millions of illegal aliens, presided over historic rises in murder, inflation and drug s, as well as a corresponding plunge in overall life expectancy. And then, because all of that wasn't punitive enough for a country as racist as ours, he dragged the United States into an entirely pointless war with a nuclear-armed power on behalf of a corrupt foreign government that once bribed his drug-addicted son. That's all real. Joe Biden did all of that and those are the big easy-to-measure crimes he has committed. You spend virtually every night cataloging some of the rest: shuttered schools, permanent looting, Latin American levels of wealth inequality, tampons in the boy's bathroom, $7 a gallon gasoline, unprecedented race hatred, homelessness, mental illness, suicide. And above it all, across the Pacific Ocean, a Chinese government that's laughing out loud as we destroy ourselves for no reason. That's some of what Joe Biden has done so far. He promised a return to normal. He's delivered war and economic collapse. 'S : ' ' - President Biden speaks during the 2022 National and State Teachers of the Year event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, April 27, 2022. Joe Biden is old enough, unfortunately, that he'll almost never certainly be held accountable for any of what he's done, but his party should be. How will any Democrat outside West Hollywood ever get elected in this country again? In a fully functioning democracy, that would be an honest question. But Biden has a plan: Torque up the fear, ban complaining, criminalize the opposition. Just 24 hours ago, Joe Biden, the president of the United States, told us that people who don't support him are the single biggest security threat that faces this country, not al-Qaeda, not the Chinese military, not the Mexican drug cartels, not even Russia, which we are told daily is the wellspring of all evil. No, you. You're the biggest threat because you don't vote Democrat. As Joe Biden put it, ""This crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history."" The most extreme! The worst, worse than the Klan, worse than the Nazis, worse than the anarchists who murdered an American president, worse than anyone ever! That's you. You're an existential threat to the country you were born in. It's hard to believe Joe Biden said that, but he did say it and, of course, some people believed him. Here's what the Supreme Court looks like tonight. You'll notice the riot-grade security fencing around the building. Why is it there? Well, it's there to protect the justices inside from the mobs that Joe Biden has incited with the demagoguery you just heard. Samuel Alito is a 72-year-old legal scholar whose views would have been considered ordinary, mainstream, maybe five years ago. Now, according to Joe Biden, he is a dangerous extremist. He's a member of a movement more threatening than any political movement in American history. What's the result? Well, today Alito had to cancel a public appearance because there were too many threats on his life. Each one of those threats is, in fact, a threat to us and our country. , ' ' You don't want to live in a country where Supreme Court justices cower in fear for their lives if they reach the wrong conclusions. That's the definition of a failed state. Turns out we have a Justice Department that exists to prevent things like this from happening. That's the whole point, but under Joe Biden, the is too beholden to the mob to say a word about it. You can't offend Antifa. They're a vital constituency. Here's the attorney general, Merrick Garland, appearing today to tell us what he's worried about most. Watch. : Consistent with the president's executive order on tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad, we are issuing a comprehensive environmental justice enforcement strategy. Communities of color, indigenous communities and low-income communities often bear the brunt of the harm caused by environmental crime, pollution and climate change. Well, of course. The greatest threat is global warming, which, by the way, is racist like so many other weather patterns. That's what Merrick Garland is most afraid of tonight and of course, in order to fix global warming, which is existential, whatever that means, you're going to have to hand Merrick Garland and Joe Biden a lot more power over your life. Sorry, that's the only solution. Much more on that to come, but for now, here's what you should know. - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks at the Department of Justice on January 5, 2022 in Washington, . Merrick Garland didn't even mention the threats, the physical threats to this country's highest court, because those threats come from the left and therefore aren't really threats. See how that works? You're about to see more of it. A left-wing activist group has now published what it says are the home addresses of justices Amy Coney Barrett, John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch: ""We must rise up to enforce accountability using a diversity of tactics,"" explains the group's website. A diversity of tactics? What are those? Well, you can imagine. They already include disrupting Catholic Church services, not a big deal, in order to change a Supreme Court decision. That's not an attack on democracy or anything. Merrick Garland is not concerned. Now, if someone were to vehemently criticize Oprah, that'd be different. We'd have to hold a press conference and call in the National Guard, but conservative Supreme Court justices, yeah, they deserve what they get and so, of course, under these conditions, violence is already beginning. Abortion lunatics just vandalized a church in Colorado. The same thing has happened to a pro-life counseling center in Portland. In Los Angeles, demonstrators threw rocks at cops for some reason. What did they have to do with it? Who knows? War on the system and they injured one of them, went to the hospital. Merrick Garland isn't worried about any of that. His fellow Democrats support that. They're calling for it. They long have. Here's Chuck Schumer from two years ago, threatening mob action if any Supreme Court justice were ever to get out of line. Watch this. - ‘’ : I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions. ""You will pay the price."" Really? These are people with lifetime appointments. So how exactly could they pay the price? We can't vote against them. What can we do? We can hurt them. We can harass their families. We can make it impossible to live in this country through threats of violence. ""You won't know what hit you,"" said the thug from New York. Apparently, they're about to learn what's going to hit them. Remember when liberals used to oppose violence? They did. Give peace a chance. It's hard to believe there was ever a time that that was true. Maybe they were just pretending. In any case, they're now for it. Violence is their religion, here and abroad. You're seeing it on display right in front of you, whether you've noticed or not in Eastern Europe. Rather than trying to save the civilian population of Eastern Europe, Joe Biden is pushing for a hot war against Russia. In fact, he's already engaged in a hot war against Russia and so are we, whether we knew it or not. The New York Times just ran this headline, ""U.S. intelligence is helping Ukraine kill Russian generals."" Oh, no big deal. According to the paper, ""The United States has provided intelligence about Russian units that's allowed Ukrainians to target and kill many of the Russian generals who've died in action in the Ukraine war, according to senior American officials."" So, they’re bragging about it and not just that. News reports that Biden officials are also bragging about helping to shoot down a Russian transport plane carrying hundreds of Russian troops. And then tonight the administration is saying out loud that actually it helped sink a Russian warship. - , Now, why are they doing this and more baffling, why are they taking credit for it in public? Why would you tell people you're doing that? There's only one reason, because you want war with Russia. Not a fake war, not a proxy war, but a real war with thousands of American troops, trillions wasted and many dead. That's what war is and war against nuclear-armed countries is hard to imagine. There's never been one. There's no reason to have a war like this. There doesn't need to be a war like this. We wouldn't be having one if Joe Biden didn't want one, but Biden wants it. He's doing this on purpose. We're not imagining that. He's telling us what he's doing. We're just ignoring him. Many Democrats are telling us what they're doing. Here's Biden ally, Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, saying so out loud on Fox on Monday. Watch. : If they wrap this in the Senate with a Ukraine funding and a funding, you guys okay with that? Congressman Moulton? : Look, I only support it because it's the right thing to do for Ukraine. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of politics involved and there will be domestic debates here at home about all their policies and whatnot, but at the end of the day, we've got to realize we're at war, and we're not just at war to support the Ukrainians. We're fundamentally at war, although it's somewhat through proxy with Russia, and it's important that we win. ' ,' 'T ' Really? We're at war. Did you know that? Did they text you to let you know? Because wars tend to escalate and wars that are existential for one side in which the leader of a country feels he may die if he loses, tend to escalate very quickly, obviously. Seth Moulton isn't worried. It's just important that we win, he tells us. We? Really? Who's we? And important to whom exactly? Is there anyone outside Washington who wants a real war with nuclear-armed Russia? Who exactly is Seth Moulton talking about when he says ""we""? We were wondering, then we watched Biden. Yesterday, he traveled to Alabama and he visited the only constituency in America that longs for war with nuclear-armed Russia. That would be his donors. He toured a Lockheed Martin plant, and as he did, Biden boasted that we're sending so many weapons to Ukraine that mothers in the United States are naming their children after Lockheed Martin's missile systems. Watch. President Joe Biden speaks on security assistance to Ukraine during a visit to the Lockheed Martin Pike County Operations facility where they manufacture Javelin anti-tank missiles, Tuesday, May 3, 2022, in Troy, Ala. : But we build the weapons and the equipment to help defend freedom and sovereignty in Europe years ago. That's true again today. Those javelin missiles, like the ones manufactured right here in Pike County, they're highly portable. They're extremely effective against a wide range of armored targets. They can hit targets up to 400 meters away. In fact, they've been so important. There's even a story about Ukrainian parents, naming their children, not a joke, their newborn child, Javelin or Javelina. Not a joke. Hmm. It's a joke. Just a little joke about weapons systems. You know, it used to be when American presidents talked about killing people, the first thing they did was make certain it was absolutely justified. We'd been invaded, Pearl Harbor, 911. This is an entirely voluntary exercise and the second thing they did was attach some gravity to the idea of people dying, because when people die, it's sad. They leave behind spouses, parents, siblings and children. Death is sad. Acknowledge that. They don't joke about it. Joe Biden considers that an uplifting story.",0

Jack Keane reveals the evolution of the Biden administration's approach to Ukraine on 'Special Report.' Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane looked ahead to the end of the Russia-Ukraine war Thursday on ""Special Report."" . : There is a policy shift [from the United States]. Initially, first couple of weeks, [there was] limited support for the Ukrainians in terms of arms and ammunition, very specific. … And based on very good sources that I had, the Biden administration was putting pressure on Zelenskyy to make a deal, take a settlement. Zelenskyy and his troops did extraordinarily well. And as a result of that, … the Biden administration began to shift to helping Zelenskyy defeat the Russians inside of Ukraine - actually using the word ""to attain victory."" And then [it] went all out to get ammunition and supplies, not just out of the United States' depots, but organized 40 other countries to do much the same. So the policy, yeah, it has shifted. … I think [the Russians] have to come to the realization that actually occupying a significant amount of territory in Ukraine is likely not going to happen. The Ukrainians, they have an opportunity here to push the Russians out. They're going to need a significant amount of support, in my calculation, just on artillery alone. Because the Russians - the one thing they do well is artillery. And the thing that kills artillery is artillery. We're going to have to send them a lot to be able to do that - a lot more than we've already sent any other nations. There is opportunity there. But at the end of the day, it'll be probably likely that there'll be some kind of stalemate, hopefully with the Ukrainians taking back most of their territory. The opportunity is there for them to do it.",0

Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., warned on ""America’s Newsroom"" Friday that the U.S. is running low on weapons stockpiling after supplying Ukraine. ’S : I think Secretary Austin made the right call in going to Kyiv talking directly with Zelenskyy and really for the first time talking as if he believes the Ukrainians can win. I think that’s the right signal to send to our allies. It is also right to send a signal that we want Russia to be permanently hobbled by this misadventure of unprovoked aggression. … What's bad is the president himself seems at times to constantly want to remind everybody what we won’t do and putting arbitrary limits on our assistance, I think, undermines our effort. But, the real ugly is that we are running low in terms of our stockpiles. We just burned through seven years of Javelins and that’s not only important as we continue to try and help the Ukrainians win in Ukraine, that's important as we try to simultaneously defend Taiwan from aggression from the Chinese Communist Party.

Much of the conversation regarding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has understandably focused on the physical siege and assault on Kyiv, Mariupol and other cities, but the cyberwar started before any Russian troops stepped foot in Ukraine. : The country suffered a number of hacks in the days leading up to Russia’s invasion, with cybersecurity firm finding a ""data wiping program"" that hit hundreds of machines just a week ahead of the invasion. Since the invasion started, hacking collective Anonymous declared war on Russia, and Ukraine has continued to suffer cyberattacks from Russian agents. But the full scope of Russia’s capabilities remains a mystery since their targets are not operating on the same technological level. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends the Orthodox Easter service in the Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow, Russia, Sunday, April 24, 2022. Eastern Orthodox churches observe the ancient Julian calendar and this year celebrate the Orthodox Easter on April 24. U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Christopher Krebs speaks to reporters at ’s Election Day Operation Center on Super Tuesday in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., March 3, 2020. New York, - October 5, 2016: A Homeland Security vehicle late in the day in Lower Manhattan. ""The thing is that if I don't need to use my latest and greatest attack, why should I?"" Stamford explained. ""There's no need for me to do something brand new when I can just do something old that works great."" The concern lies in the nature of cyberwarfare itself: Unlike conventional weapons which can be damaged and destroyed after their use, a cyberweapon – such as data wiping programs or viruses – can be replicated and repurposed and spread. ""If you look back to stuff like the WannaCry and NotPetya events ... bad guys took them, tweaked them and throw them right back at you, so we get into this dangerous situation where if Russia did decide to use something that we hadn't seen before, somebody else would undoubtedly get hold of it, do some research, break apart, figure out what they could do with it,"" Stamford said. 'S : ‘ ’ - The issue grows more complicated due to the fact that Moscow appears to operate with a model that allows free reign for individual operators to attack foreign targets without explicit direction or acknowledgment from the government. The U.S. has faced a few different hacking crises that officials tied back to Russian actors, such as the SolarWinds hack - tied to hackers acting at the direction of Russia's intelligence service - and the Colonial Pipeline hack - believed to be the act of a lone Russian hacker that local police arrested. Putin also recently signed an initiative to bolster Russia's cyber defenses, which former defense official James Anderson said could be a move to further entangle state and business enterprises in the country. ""The public effort to ban Russia from using cyber security tools from ""unfriendly countries"" appears, at least in part, to be a face-saving measure, since many major Western technology firms have already withdrawn from the Russian market in response to Moscow's brutish invasion of Ukraine,"" Anderson explained. ""In addition to helping Russia to better protect itself from hackers, the cyber security decree probably reflects Putin's desire to further extend his authoritarian tentacles, since state corporations and other strategically important enterprises will be required to provide the state's security services with ""unhindered access to information resources."" , But the U.S. should remain confident in its ability to defend against attacks from foreign actors, especially with the implementation of quantum computing, according to Martin Moore, a retired Special Forces Sergeant Major and Owner of ZeroOneAngus . ""I think quantum computing and having that post-quantum encryption is better than relying on a firewall to protect us - that is a higher priority,"" Moore said. ""A firewall can only protect traffic and data leaks. We need protection and systems that don't have back and side doors build in."" Quantum computing simply allows for an increase in the already incredible number of calculations a machine could make, going through ""a million keys"" in moments. ' The U.S. may not provide a national firewall in the way that Russia and China have aimed to do, but companies and government agencies can start to wrap quantum encryption around what is already ""robust"" encryption that is widely used. The Department of Homeland Security leads the national effort to improve cybersecurity through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency . Moore attributes the success of American companies to their approach, which assumes that companies and users operate in a ""zero trust environment."" ""We know everything is vulnerable and it's always going to be vulnerable and we have to stay ahead of that, and it's tough to stay ahead of that when there's so many variables at play,"" Moore said. ""So I think developing a system that cannot be penetrated is going to be almost impossible."" ""We have to put more effort into understanding the threat and the potential threat and doing something about it, because we think that even though we think we're secure, we're not,"" he added. ""You can never know, and we should treat everything as if it is a ‘Zero Trust’ environment.""",22
2022-05-08,https://www.foxnews.com/world/no-we-dont-want-to-occupy-ukraine,Kremlin looks to hire ex-military pensioners to oversee claimed Ukrainian land: journalist,"Independent Russian journalist and editor Roman Anin of Important Stories explains Russia's recent move to hire ex-military pensioners to oversee claimed Ukrainian land and the arrests of anti-war Russian citizens. A Russian journalist has information that Moscow is actively trying to recruit people to administer territory it has taken in Ukraine. And it is not just looking for anyone. It is begging military pensioners to return for the task. ' ' , 'T ' ,' ""It looks like they don't have enough resources to manage those occupied territories. And that is why they are looking, trying to hire pensioners who are 60 years old. And it looks like they are having problems,"" Roman Anin tells Fox News. Anin is editor of ""Important Stories"" or ""tories,"" part of Russia's bold and mostly now-exiled independent media world. He claims potential recruits are being offered salaries that are twice the national average, around $500 a month. ""Since they are having problems in these territories,"" Anin says, ""in terms of managing people, organizing those referendums, they need people with military experience to work in what is actually a civil job."" Police officers detain a demonstrator with a poster that states ""I'm against the war"" in Moscow, Russia, Feb. 24, 2022, after Russia's attack on Ukraine. ""Istories"" was declared an ""undesirable organization"" by the Russian government, which means those who collaborate with the outfit can be fined or jailed. The outlet puts a warning label on its stories cautioning that reposting stories could be a criminal offense. ""Imagine a journalist who comes to his audience and says, 'Please don't repost us. Please don't spread the information.' But read and think is what we have to tell our readers,"" said Anin, whose team, like most other independent journalists in Russia, had to leave after the war began. Anin already had a case pending against him for some of his investigative work. He said there are essentially three options. ""Stay in Russia and go to jail. Stay in Russia and stop working. And option three is to immigrate and continue your work,"" Amin explained. ""We decided all three options are bad. But we thought, 'You know, we can't be silent in these times.'"" Russians who speak out are not safe at home, he says, but not welcome in other countries often either. ""Having a Russian passport is a big challenge,"" Anin says. ""In other parts of the world, sanctions don't distinguish between journalists and propagandists."" 9 : ? We see that police are so quick to arrest anyone who utters even a whisper of dissent — even those who go out with a blank placard or simply say ""Nyet."" Anin was asked why he believes Russian President Putin is so paranoid. ""I think the main reason is because of Putin's background. People from the secret services — the — this is their modus operandi. This is something hardwired in their brains,"" Amin said. ""They don't trust anybody. They don't believe anybody can have their own beliefs."" Anin says Putin and company believe those who are not in ideological lockstep with the Kremlin are controlled by the or the U.S. State Department. ""The other reason is they're getting older,"" he added. ""They have been in power more than twenty years. You are losing your sense of reality when you are constantly surrounded by an army of bodyguards and you constantly live in a bunker."" Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, meets with his Belarus' counterpart Alexander Lukashenko at the Kremlin in Moscow March 11. ""You know, I think this is a war of the young against the Soviets,"" Anin, born in the dying days of the , added. ""The average age of Ukrainian politicians is about 40. The average age of Russian politicians is 67."" Anin wouldn't speculate on what will happen Monday, when Russia will mark victory over Nazi Germany in World War . It has been increasingly said that Putin's Russia has modeled its identity on this part of its past, and that the more it perpetuates a false narrative about the presence of latter-day Nazis and genocides, the more it tarnishes the glory of past heroism. ""They never talk about the future,"" Anin says of the government, ""because there's nothing they can offer the Russian audience or other people in the world. There is nothing behind this idea of the ‘Russian World.’ You know, that's why they are so focused on the 9th of May and on other symbols of the Soviet Union.""",0
2022-05-09,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-nicolle-wallace-jan-6-ukraine-invasion-russia-vladimir-putin,MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace says Jan. 6 'made everything about invading Ukraine easier for Vladimir Putin',"Gen. David Petraeus discusses Putin's public relations and tactical failures in his war on Ukraine on 'The Story.' star Nicolle Wallace suggested that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is directly linked to the Capitol riot on January 6. The conversation began with Wallace citing remarks former National Security Council adviser Fiona Hill made arguing that Russian President Vladimir Putin would have been emboldened to go into Ukraine himself if then-President Trump was successful in maintaining power following the events of Jan. 6, saying how Putin would view the U.S. as ""no different from any other country in the world that just had a coup."" 'S ‘: ’ Wallace then referred to ""some experts"" who believe the extreme politician divisions that unfolded that day in Washington D.C. ""solidified Vladimir Putin's ambitions to go to war in Ukraine, because even though Trump had not succeeded, Putin saw a window of opportunity in January 6 to strike while America wrestled with its own deep conflicts."" host Nicolle Wallace. legal analyst Daniel Goldman agreed with Hill, calling Jan. 6 a ""triggering moment"" that ""opened the door"" for Putin to invade Ukraine because of perceived instability in the U.S. ""What Fiona, I think, puts into undeniable and uncomfortable reality for Republicans is that everything about January 6 made everything about invading Ukraine easier for Vladimir Putin,"" Wallace said to Puck News correspondent Julia Ioffe. ""And I remember the first time I heard Vladimir Putin say Ashli Babbitt's name. I thought, ‘Why is he talking about Ashley Babbitt?' Just talk about how January 6 Is this? It's almost like a record on repeat in Russia."" 'S - Ioffe pushed back at the notion that Jan. 6 was the ""deciding moment"" for Putin to invade Ukraine, pointing to Trump's first impeachment and the fallout about how Americans felt about Ukraine at the time as well as the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan , saying ""all of it"" showed Putin that the U.S. is ""not a reliable partner"" to geopolitical allies and that ""we were too busy chasing our own tails internally."" Russian President Vladimir Putin. Wallace, who hosts ""Deadline: White House,"" might as well rename her program ""Deadline: Mar-a-Lago"" because she dedicates overwhelming coverage to former President Trump in comparison to current President Biden. A Grabien transcript search found the word ""Trump"" was uttered on the show 11,668 times from Jan. 20, 2021, when Biden succeeded Trump, to Dec. 30, 2021. As for Biden, his name was mentioned just 4,710 times, nearly 2.5 times less often on Wallace's program, which airs weekdays from 4-6 p.m. and features a mixture of reporters and left-leaning pundits. The word ""insurrection"" was said on ""Deadline: White House"" 2,260 times, an average of nine times per show, according to Grabien, while ""January 6th"" was mentioned 2,852 times, including more than 800 times in November and December combined. In all but five weeks last year, Wallace's show led off at least one program with references to or direct news about the Jan. 6 attack. Only major news stories like the Derek Chauvin murder trial, the chaotic Afghanistan troop pullout, or significant -19 updates could take Wallace away from her preferred story of the day.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby claimed the Biden administration sent ""lethal assistance"" to Ukraine before the war started Tuesday on ""Your World."" : I've been around military intelligence for my entire adult life. And I can tell you it's never perfect. It's a mosaic. And you do the best you can with the information you can collect, put it together, try to analyze it. Sometimes you're closer to the mark than others. With respect to Ukraine, the United States was literally leading the world in making clear what we saw Russia do since the fall in terms of amassing forces and their intentions to go into Ukraine. And we said it loud and clear from the podium here at the Pentagon and from all over town, as well as international capitals around the world and particularly in Europe. And not everybody believed us at the time, but we were very right about what Russia was about to do. And we also worked hard in the lead-up to that invasion. … One, the Biden administration was flowing in weapons well before the invasion. The first billion dollars that the president committed to Ukraine did include lethal assistance. And that was before Putin decided to move in. Plus, we were very open and honest about what we were seeing the Russians do. And then the last point, which I don't think we keep in mind as much as we should, Neil, is the training and effort that went into getting the Ukrainians ready for this kind of war over the last eight years. The United States, Canada, Britain, other allies really helped train the Ukrainians in small unit leadership, command and control, operational maneuver.",0

But I also understand what's happening here in this country with record levels of crime, the border that's wide open, attorney general who treats the very moms and dads you were talking to as if they were domestic terrorists. And what have the Democrats done in the last two weeks? Last week they gave us the Disinformation Governance Board and came after our First Amendment liberties. And this week they spend $40 billion on a foreign country. So that's the concern that I have and I think so many Americans have. I voted for all kinds of help for Ukraine thus far. But this bill, we said, ""No, look, we got to focus on the issues that count here in America, that matter to American families and also help Ukraine, but do it in a way that makes more sense than I think this piece of legislation did.""

Jim Jordan calls for fixing U.S. problems while also helping Ukraine on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was blasted by critics overnight following her speech late Tuesday on the House floor in which she quoted the Gospel of Matthew in order to shore up support for the $40 billion Ukraine aid bill that was later approved by the chamber. ""The brutality of Putin is not just what he's doing in Ukraine, but the impact that it is having on food for the world. So when you're home thinking what is this all about, just think about, 'When I was hungry, you fed me,' in the Gospel of Matthew,"" Pelosi said. Her comments came as part of a speech largely centered on what the massive amount of financial aid would do for the Ukrainians amid food shortages in the country due to the war with Russia, despite shortages being felt by Americans here at home.

2022-05-11,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-our-leaders-believe-protecting-ukraine-is-more-important-than-protecting-you,Tucker: Our leaders believe protecting Ukraine is more important than protecting you,"Fox News host voices his concerns about lawmakers prioritizing solving Ukraine's problems over America's on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight. There is nothing in the world worse than finding out that your deepest fears are justified. That's the nightmare scenario, learning there really is a zombie in the closet. Let's say you're a kid and you've convinced yourself that your parents don't really love you. They claim they do. They say it all the time, usually without looking up from their iPhones, but you can tell they don't really mean it. They don't seem sincere. And then one Christmas morning, confirmation. You discover they've forgotten to buy you presents, any presents. They were busy and it just slipped their mind. Instead, they spent all their time and all their money buying gifts for a kid down the street. All the things that you asked for, they gave to another nine-year-old you have never met. How would that make you feel? Well, you would be crushed, but you would also be vindicated. You would know for a dead certain fact that your parents really didn't love you. They're not even very interested in you. That's how a lot of Americans felt last night watching the House of Representatives approve yet another massive aid package for Ukraine. Nothing against Ukraine, but we could probably use that money here right about now. After 100 years of virtually uninterrupted wealth generation, the American economy appears to be faltering in ways that are scary to anyone who's paying attention. Even people who aren't paying attention can sense there's something really wrong. Lots of people are not working. Those who are working are getting poorer quickly, thanks to inflation. All of a sudden everything is wildly more expensive. Have you noticed? We literally have a shortage of baby formula right now. Did you think that would happen in America ever? And yet it is happening and so is the deadliest drug epidemic in our history. About 107,000 of your fellow Americans, most of them young people who should have had long, productive lives are instead dead. They've died from drug s over the past year. This is the saddest thing that has happened to our country in a very long time, and yet Congress, which claims to run the country, can't be bothered even to acknowledge it, much less do anything about it. Instead, your representatives in Washington just voted to send yet another $40 billion to Ukrainian oligarchs who paid off the president's son. That's what happened, and it's just the latest check that Congress has cut them. You can add it to the approximately $14 billion they've already spent on Ukraine. That brings the total as of tonight to more than $54 billion. How much is that? Well, for perspective, it is more than we spent per year on average on the war in Afghanistan, a war that began with a direct attack on the United States. $54 billion – that's about as much as Russia, the country, spends on its entire armed forces over the course of a full year. It is a ludicrous amount and yet Congress happily approved it. In fact, they allocated $7 billion more than Joe Biden asked for. That's how excited they were to do it. Where is this money going? Oh, that's the best part. Congress has decided to fix all of the pressing problems that need to be fixed except fix them in Ukraine, not here. The main course of all this funding from day one has been to secure Ukraine's borders because, you know, you can't have a country without borders. They have to be secure. Nancy Pelosi strongly believes that about Ukraine and so do her friends on the Republican side. Ukrainian border security is the main goal. Then there's the problem of ""food insecurity."" Not here, in Ukraine. Food is getting expensive in Ukraine, so we're going to spend $760 million to fix that just in this check and not just in Ukraine. Congress, who was feeling kind of sporty, also added $150 million for something called the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program because while we're feeding Ukraine, why not feed the rest of the world? We've got more food than we can use. And of course, that will obviously include baby formula, too, because kids in other countries need to eat. Then there's another huge chunk of cash to ""combat human trafficking."" Now, not combat human trafficking in Texas, where it is now ubiquitous thanks to the open border with Mexico, but to combat human trafficking in Ukraine, because it's sad what's happening there. But not here, that's not sad. We're ignoring it. There's still more money to make sure Ukrainians have emergency shelter because apparently more than a million Americans aren't homeless tonight. There's $900 million to make sure Ukrainians have access to ""entitlement programs"" our entitlement programs. They'll need them when they arrive here, as many will. In other words, you can't afford to fill your truck, but you now get to pay the living expenses of anyone who shows up in your country claiming to be from Ukraine and you will. And then because paying off your friends is always the real point of these exercises in Washington, there are billions more dollars for Lloyd Austin's former employers in the weapons business. That would include $72 million for something the bill describes as ""research, development, test, and evaluation in Ukraine."" Hmm. Now, don't say biolabs because that's not a lab, but honestly, this is weird. Ukraine is a war zone and therefore probably not a great place for scientific research right now, but whatever. We're funding some kind of science experiments in Ukraine. No more questions from you. And the bill goes on like this and on and on. : '24/7' Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures while addresses a meeting of the Council of Legislators under the Russian Federal Assembly at the Tauride Palace, in St. Petersburg, Russia, Wednesday, April 27, 2022. As Congressman Thomas Massie has pointed out, Congress has now spent more money on Ukraine in six months than the U.S. government spent on all roads and all bridges in the United States over all of last year. The $40 billion we're sending to Ukraine so they can secure their borders, by the way, is more than double what Joe Biden has asked to fund Customs and Border Security in the United States. One bill, more than double what we're spending this year on our borders and then in the middle of this historic drug emergency, and it is, the bill spends more than ten times the entire budget of the . Just in case you're wondering how your leaders feel about you, they're not fans at all, and now we know for sure. You should know that every single Democrat in the House of Representatives voted for this bill. That would include even Barbara Lee of Berkeley. Now, if you remember her name, it may be because in 2001, Barbara Lee of Berkeley was the only member of Congress to oppose the war against the Taliban. But a war in Ukraine is a war that Barbara Lee can support. Why? Because there's no potential chance that war could help the United States. Here's her reasoning. . : This war is not only about Ukraine. This war is about the rest of the world and Putin trying to establish autocratic governments throughout, throughout the world, and we know that this is taking place through disinformation campaigns, through all kinds of misinformation that's taking place. ' ' , So it's not really about Ukraine. It's about something bigger than Ukraine. Thanks, Barbara Lee, for being dim enough to tell us that, to say it out loud. This is a war on disinformation, which at some point in some way is dead certain to be a war on you. No question about it, because you're a font of disinformation, meaning you disagree. But we know for certain that wars against things you can't really identify, against people who don't exist, wars against concepts, one thing we know about those wars, like the war on terror, is they last forever. So it's a little weird to see Tim Ryan of Ohio vote for this. Tim Ryan was supposed to be a working man's Democrat, a guy who cares about bread-and-butter issues. Tim Ryan represents Youngstown and Akron. Take a look at Akron some time. It's like a war zone itself. These are the cities that built America, crumbling and desperate now from total neglect. But don't you worry. Tim Ryan is totally committed to rebuilding Kyiv. And so is Nancy Pelosi. For Pelosi, funding Ukraine at any cost is more than a foreign policy objective. It's a kind of religious observance. : The brutality of Putin is not just what he's doing in Ukraine, but the impact that it is having on food for the world. So, when you're home thinking, what is this all about? Just think about, ""When I was hungry, you fed me"" in the Gospel of Matthew. : '' Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., meets with reporters at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 25, 2021. Oh, so Jesus wants to send more missiles to Ukraine and the more missiles we send to Ukraine, the less hungry people are going to be? Wait a second, wouldn't Jesus want to do everything possible to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, you irreligious little twit? How dare you quote that book. By the way, there was a time when Nancy Pelosi didn't want to spend billions of dollars to secure a country's borders. She said it was wasteful and morally wrong. It wasn't that long ago, by the way, it was April of 2017. See if you notice the difference. She's for spending billions at borders now. She was opposed to it then. What changed? Watch. : The wall is, in my view, immoral, expensive, unwise and when the president says, ""Well, I promised a wall during my campaign,"" I don't think he said he was going to pass billions of dollars of cost of the wall onto the taxpayer. Oh, did you catch that? Border security in United States is immoral, but Jesus is strongly for border security and Ukraine and abortion, by the way. It's a sacrament. As usual, Democrats, as ludicrous this may sound, are united on this point. They stand as one, but also, as usual, a sustained propaganda campaign in the American media has managed to divide the Republican Party. Now, why does this happen every single time? Here's why, because Republican officeholders, no matter how conservative they tell you they are, believe The New York Times. They care deeply what legacy media say. They read The New York Times every day. They don't want to be criticized by The New York Times. And that's how the left controls them every single time. 'S , If you don't believe it, think back the last two years. You saw the same dynamic in the early days of both the riots and the lockdowns. Nancy Pelosi was out there first taking the most extreme possible position and then a lot of Republican leaders agreed with her. Do you remember that two years ago this month, Nikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina, running for president told Americans in the first days of the riots that they deserved to suffer after George Floyd died? ""In order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone,"" she wrote. In the end, it was personal and painful. A lot of people died and that was good because your racism killed George Floyd. That was Nikki Haley's first reaction. She read it inThe New York Times, and she believed it. They all do. o it shouldn't shock you that Nikki Haley's first reaction to the Russia invasion and Mitch McConnell's first reaction too and the first reaction of so many other Republican leaders was that protecting Ukraine is way more important to protecting you, than protecting America. Mitch McConnell hasn't, to his credit, moved from that. He still thinks it. Here he was yesterday. : I think we all agree the most important thing going on in the world right now is the war in Ukraine. I had a chance to call the president last week and request that the Ukraine package move by itself and quickly. He said, let me think it over. He called back in about 15 minutes and agreed that we need to do this Ukraine only and quickly. I think we're on the path to getting that done. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, walks to the Senate floor at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, on Tuesday, Jan. 18, 2022. You got to hope that there's some sincere billionaire out there who's going to fund a primary challenge against every single one of those Republican state senators standing by Mitch McConnell, as he said, and we'll quote again, ""I think we all agree the most important thing going on in the world right now is the war in Ukraine."" No, the most important thing going on in the world right now is the state of your country, the one you're supposed to run, the people you're supposed to represent, whose lives are supposed to care about, the ones who can't buy food or gas, the people ing on fentanyl, 107,000 in a year dead, young people, Americans. ""But that's nothing compared to Ukraine. We all agree Ukraine is the most important thing."" Really? If you agree with that, you should not be sitting in the United States Senate as a Republican and yet that's their position. Of course, it's Lindsey Graham's position. Just to give you yet another example. . : And if Putin's still standing after all this, then the world is going to be a very dark place. China is going to get the wrong signal and we'll have a mess on our hands in Europe for decades to come. So, let's take out Putin by helping Ukraine. : -'S , "" "" : Alright, so you're saying that that's how this ends, that Putin is removed? Is there any way? : There's no off-ramp. : There is no off-ramp? : No, off-ramp. ""Let's take out Putin."" It's weird to see a guy live out his strange little fantasy life on live. Lindsey Graham won't come on the show. He's afraid. We could spend the next hour playing clips of Lindsey Graham going back 20 years, making predictions that didn't come true and resulted only in the death of American servicemen and the impoverishment of the United States. He's gotten wrong every single time and he's still out there. Let's just take out Putin. Really? What would happen then? The country has 6,000 nuclear weapons. Would they be unsecured? You thought we had a mess on our hands when Saddam's arsenals fell into the hands of lunatics and extremists. What would happen to those 6,000 nuclear weapons if we just take out Putin? They don't even think about it. They don't care. They're high on their own supply. . - Representative Dan Crenshaw, a Republican from Texas, listens during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, June 26, 2019. Dan Crenshaw of Texas, for example, not a stupid guy, just announced that we're, ""investing in the destruction of our adversaries' military"" when we spend $40 billion on Ukraine. Investing in the destruction of our adversaries' military? Since when do we declare war on Russia? Did anybody vote for that? Our adversaries' military? That's what you do in war. Since when are we fighting Russia? Well, since Putin stole the election from Hillary Clinton. Glad to see that Dan Crenshaw has signed up for this new campaign, but you got to wonder at what cost? Not just the peril, the real peril, that this could escalate into something crushing for the West, but what immediate cost to the United States and our own ability to defend ourselves? All these people who love the military, do they ever ask that question? Right now, Joe Biden and the U.S. Congress have sent so much military aid to Ukraine that our country, the United States, is running out of weapons. According to Bloomberg, ""Pentagon officials say that Kyiv is blowing through a week's worth of deliveries of anti-tank munitions every day. It's also running short of usable aircraft as Russian airstrikes and combat losses take their toll. Ammunition has become scarce in Mariupol and other areas in Ukraine. This is presenting Western countries with a stark choice between pouring more supplies into Ukraine or husbanding finite capabilities they may need for their own defense."" That's the line ""they may need for their own defense."" It's a scary world and if you blow it all on Ukraine with finite resources, which we have, sorry, where does that leave you? Undefended. Now this is happening because senior leaders of the Republican Party instantly bought the New York Times' position on Ukraine, as they instantly bought the New York Times’ position on the riots, as they instantly bought the position of the New York Times on the lockdown. They didn't question what they read. And the consequences - now, we are short on weapons to defend our own country. - , Now, no Democrat ever goes against his own herd, ever. The first reaction of every Democrat is always to read whatever talking points Nancy Pelosi provides. They never listen to the other side. They always go farther in one direction and the Republican Party is always led by people who join them. Here, for example, is how Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland responded when Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia raised an objection with ""Oh, wait, what about our country?"" she said. Here's what he said back. . : $40 billion, but there's no baby formula for American mothers and babies. An unknown amount of money to the in the Ukraine supplemental bill, but there's no formula for American babies and mothers. We should be paying attention to our country right now. I yield back. Thank you. . : Gentlelady, yield back. The gentleman, gentlewoman from Minnesota reserve, gentleman from Maryland is recognized. . : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Here's a formula for the destruction of democracy – repeating Putin's propaganda and disinformation and appeasing imperialist assaults on sovereign nations. - , So, you can't buy baby formula in the United States and maybe you think you can do both at once. You can fund Ukraine and get baby formula for American babies. Maybe you can fix inflation and also fund Ukraine. Speak slowly and tell us how that works. Maybe there's an answer to the question, but notice they don't answer. They just accuse the person asking the question of working for Putin. ""You're working for Putin. You're against democracy."" They don't tell us how Ukraine is a democracy. They banned the opposition party. That's a democracy? But maybe there's an answer. What is it? Stop name-calling and answer the question, but Jamie Raskin won't do that. None of them will. He screams about Putin. Now, 57 Republicans did vote against last night's bill and God bless them for doing it, but many more voted for it. Of course, there was Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and their friend Elise Stefanik. But there was also Republican leadership, top leadership, McCarthy and Scalise. Shameful. And the worst part is this bill will almost certainly pass in the Senate, which is way more left wing even than the House on the Republican side. Chuck Schumer is promising a swift vote on it. That means as soon as tomorrow. We reached out to every Republican in the Senate to find out what they plan to do. Most of them didn't bother to reply. None of them will come on the show. That would include Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Chuck Grassley, Mitt Romney also did not respond. We're hoping they'll vote the right way. But a handful of senators did respond and we want to let you know where they stand. Voting ""no"" will be Mike Braun, Roger Marshall, Marsha Blackburn, Bill Hagerty and Josh Hawley. Rand Paul has also indicated he's opposed the bill. He wouldn't say so, but of course he's against it. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, waits to speak to reporters following bi-partisan passage of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, at the Capitol in Washington, Feb. 10, 2022. Lindsey Graham, needless to say, is a yes. He's thrilled. As his office put it, ""Senator Graham has made it clear he supports additional military aid to Ukraine"" because it makes him feel so good inside. Oh, he didn't say that, but that's the truth. Rob Portman of Ohio is leaving, thank heaven. He's also a yes. So, is Steve Daines of Montana, ""The senator is leaning yes,"" his office said. They also told us that Daines thinks Russian oligarchs somehow will pay the $40 billion, ""He wants to make Russia cover the costs. He wants to use the seized assets of oligarchs to cover the costs."" Right, okay. A few senators dodged. Pat Toomey, Tim Scott, Cindy Hyde-Smith all refused to give us a direct answer. We want to invite any Republican senator who plans on voting for this to come on this show and explain why. Please tell us. We'll let you talk as much as you want. We're not going to sandbag you. We want to know why this is in America's interest, why this is more important than the pressing crises all around us that the rest of us notice and apparently you don't.",0
2022-05-12,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reporters-notebook-its-a-bad-bad-bad-bad-world,"Reporter's Notebook: It’s a Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad World","Fox News contributor reacts to China running military drill near Taiwan on 'America Reports.' It was called the ""Worldwide Threats"" hearing on Capitol Hill. With an homage to the 1963 comedy starring Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett and Ethel Merman, a better title for the hearing may have been ""It’s a Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad World."" Two of the nation’s top intelligence officials — Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier — laid out for the Senate Armed Services Committee all of the trouble brewing around the globe. North Korea. Iran. The Philippines. The southern border. Central America. Even cyberspace. But one thing was clear from the hearing. Two countries represent two major flashpoints: Ukraine and Taiwan. Haines and Berrier explained the problems facing these two nations as one hot war rages and the potential for another one simmers. Haines cautioned that China is willing to seize Taiwan militarily. She says Taiwan is entering a critical period between now and 2030. ""Whatever lessons China learns coming out of the Russia-Ukraine crisis might affect that timeline,"" said Haines. ""Taiwan's capabilities, other decisions that will have to be made between now and then, that will affect the timeline."" , President Biden is clear that the U.S. harbors no plans for the U.S. to fight Russia in Ukraine. But this is a war. Things evolve and change. And that’s why intelligence experts believe that Russian leader Vladimir Putin is settling in for a protracted conflict. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier confer before testifying in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on ""Worldwide Threats"" at the U.S. Capitol in Washington May 10, 2022. Haines told senators that Putin believes Russia can ""endure challenges"" for a greater period. Moreover, she observed that part of Putin’s strategy is to patiently wait for reverberations from the war away from the battlefield. Haines said Putin is essentially ""counting on U.S. and E.U resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse."" That’s what prompts a ""more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory"" in the conflict as the war extends its tentacles beyond physical borders. This is why there is lingering concern that something could unfold, drawing the U.S. closer to the battlefield. That has consequences for Taiwan. ""Do you worry that Beijing might see an opportunity to invade Taiwan in the very near future, should the United States get drawn into an actual conflict, a kinetic conflict with Russia?,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asked. ""China would see that as a window to open, to take advantage of that,"" Berrier replied. , ' ' In other words, from a geopolitical standpoint, an impasse could be the worst scenario. ""The Russians aren’t winning, and the Ukrainians aren’t winning,"" Berrier testified. ""We’re at a bit of a stalemate here."" The deadlock comes as multiple U.S. figures descended stealthily into Ukraine to show support for Ukrainian leader Volodomyr Zelenskyy. Recent visitors included first lady Jill Biden; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Greg Meeks, D-N.Y; Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Ca.; Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass.; and Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also sought an audience with Zelenskyy. - Just a few weeks ago, some Republicans groused that President Biden hadn’t visited Kyiv. They pointed out that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson boldly parachuted into Ukraine to meet with Zelenskyy in April. They also complained that more Republican lawmakers hadn’t visited Kyiv. First lady Jill Biden, left, greets Olena Zelenska, spouse of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, outside School 6, a public school that has taken in displaced students in Uzhhorod, Ukraine, Sunday, May 8, 2022. But at least one senator is concerned that these drop-ins are provocative. ""What is our intelligence community doing to lessen the risk of a high-ranking official? How are we protecting these people going to Ukraine?"" Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala, asked. Berrier told Tuberville that conversation was best conducted in a ""closed session."" But Tuberville continued. ""We’re kind of poking the bear here,"" Tuberville said. ""It looks like to me that we’re taking too many chances of sending people over there for a photo op other than doing the right things."" Tuberville characterized these visits as ""bragging"" by the U.S. But there are other ""swagger"" issues. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., pose for a picture before their meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine, April 30, 2022. There are concerns that the U.S. publicly boasted about how much intelligence it shared with Ukraine. This steamed Director William Burns. ""It is irresponsible. It’s very risky. It’s dangerous when people talk too much, whether it’s leaking in private or talking about specific intelligence issues,"" Burns said at a forum hosted by the Financial Times. : Shortly after the war began, the intelligence community also crowed that it correctly predicted that Russia would invade Ukraine. Keep in mind that former President Trump repeatedly dissed the intelligence community during his term. So, it may be expected — although not wise — for intelligence officials to blow their horn about intelligence successes. However, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine., said intelligence community gloating is misplaced. ""The assessment was that Ukraine would be overrun in a matter of weeks. That was grossly wrong,"" King sad at the hearing. ""I think the intelligence community did a great job on this issue,"" said Berrier. ""General, how you can possibly say that when we were told explicitly that Kyiv would fall in three days and Ukraine would fall in two weeks?"" an incredulous King asked, his voice rising. ""You’re telling me that was accurate intelligence?"" ""We were really focused on the Russian forces at the time,"" Berrier said. ""We were wrong about that, too, weren’t we? We overestimated the Russians,"" King replied. ""If you don’t concede there was a problem on this, then we’ve got a problem."" In short, the U.S. is only as good as its intelligence. Which brings us to the most apocalyptic scenario of them all. Haines told senators that Moscow would only fire a tactical nuclear weapon at Ukraine if it faced an existential threat. With a caveat. ' ' ""With tensions this high, there is always an enhanced potential for miscalculation. Unintended escalation,"" said Haines. President Biden meets virtually with Chinese President Xi Jinping from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington Nov. 15, 2021. Even so, the U.S. is committing itself more and more to the conflict in Ukraine. Ukrainian Ambassador to Washington Oksana Markarova lunched with both Democratic and Republican senators on Tuesday, making her pitch for another wave of military and humanitarian assistance. President Biden requested $33 billion in aid late last month. House appropriators beefed up that package to nearly $40 million. Included in the bill was money for the U.S. to reload its weapons stockpile. After all, the U.S. military sent multiple missiles to Ukraine, dwindling the supply here. The House put the $40 billion Ukraine aid bill on the floor for a vote Tuesday night. ""Talk is cheap. This victory for democracy is not,"" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. ""Let us not let Putin achieve a victory over democracy and liberty and freedom."" The House passed the bill 368-57. All no votes came from Republicans. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Tex., was one of the nays. ""You want to have a debate on the floor of the people’s House instead of the garbage of getting a $40 billion bill at 3 in the afternoon,"" Roy yelled on the floor. ""We’ve got $40 billion that is unpaid for. And you want to sit here and lecture this body about what we’re going to do, or not do, about standing alongside Ukraine."" The Senate is now trying to figure out how to pass the Ukraine package. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced that the Senate needed to act ""today."" This is just the second major wave of funding from Washington for Ukraine. Fox is told to expect another appropriation later this summer or fall depending on how the war goes. And there are whispers about what the U.S. and international community must do to rebuild Ukraine once the war is over. That could cost hundreds of billions if not trillions. But the end of the conflict is a long way off. The longer it drags on, the greater the chance for global bedlam. Be it in the European energy markets, food shortages — or what China decides to do in the coming months about Taiwan. None of it is good, which is why ""It’s a Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad World.""",0

Lindsey Graham blasts baby formula shortage on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., defended his support for U.S. aid to Ukraine, saying Thursday that China is watching how Russia fares and that the world writ large will benefit by Vladimir Putin being stopped. On ""Jesse Watters Primetime,"" host Jesse Watters shared many Americans' concern that billions in Ukraine aid could be better spent domestically while the United States is in the throes of record inflation, food shortages and gasoline shortages. ""Americans are looking around like, ‘Hey, Congress, what about us?’ Do you feel that?"" he asked the lawmaker. Sen. Lindsey Graham. ) ""I totally get it, [but] here's the problem with Ukraine. They run out of money in terms of buying weapons, I think, in the middle of May. So the Ukrainian army is delivering a whoop-a-- on the Russian army [but] they're about to run out of ammunition,"" he said. ""They're not asking for any soldiers — they are not asking for us to take over the skies anymore,"" he added. Watters responded by pushing back that the working class believes their own behinds are being ""whooped"" at home as well. Graham said the prospect of Putin continuing his invasion further into Europe from Ukraine is ""common sense"" if he isn't rebuffed. Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""If I thought pulling the plug on Ukraine would make any problem better here, I would entertain it,"" he said. ""But our problems here don't get better by allowing Putin to win in Ukraine because he won't stop."" ""If we can win in Ukraine — and I think we can — we can stop Putin, the world gets better overnight. If he takes Ukraine, he doesn't get prosecuted as a war criminal, he'll keep going. He wants to rewrite the map of Europe."" ""And China is just waiting to see what to do with Taiwan. All the chips in the world for our high-tech industry come from Taiwan.

2022-05-12,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-inflation-is-too-obvious-to-deny,Tucker: Inflation is too obvious to deny,"Fox News host voices his concerns over record-high inflation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Usually when there is a scandal or a crisis in this country, the people who are responsible for it respond to it by averting their gaze. They just ignore it on the principle that if you don't see something, it can't bother you. ""What opioid crisis?"" That usually works. But if it doesn't work and people start to complain about what they've done, our leaders just move to the next stage and deny it's even happening. Racist curricula in your kid's school? Come on, there's no such thing. You're a conspiracy nut. Better call the . Mandatory vaccines that don't actually work as advertised? Please, you're just imagining it. You must be an anti-vaxxer. U.S.-funded bio labs in Ukraine? Shut up, traitor, that's pure Russian disinformation and so on. They do this with everything because it almost always works. You may be the injured party in whatever disaster they've managed to cook up, but by the time The Washington Post gets done explaining it, you're a criminal for noticing it happened. It's very effective. Unfortunately for them, it doesn't work with inflation. Inflation is just too obvious to deny. Everybody knows when inflation hits, when the prices go up, because everybody goes shopping. So when you get inflation, you're stuck with it. Our leaders know this, obviously, so their first move when we got inflation was to reassure us there was nothing to worry about because actually inflation is a good thing. We've been longing for inflation, and thank God we finally got it. ""American needs higher, longer-lasting inflation,"" declared Bloomberg News. Well, when that didn't work, as it was never going to, because apart from big institutional debt holders, no one in the world actually wants inflation. When that failed, they tried a new tactic. ""Yes, inflation is not ideal,"" they admitted. ""but it's like fog in the morning. It's inconvenient, but it's temporary. It burns off and won't last long."" The word they used to describe this was ""transitory,"" and they used that word a lot. Watch. White House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Wednesday, April 20, 2022, in Washington. , : Our economists have conveyed that they feel that the impact of our proposals will be transitory. , U.S. : All of the economists that the president has been relying on suggest that there is a transitory nature to the inflation problem. : Economists call all these things transitory effects. . , D-.: This inflation that we are experiencing is transitory. It is not going to be here long. , U.S. : We've had several months of high inflation that most economists, including me, believe will be transitory. , : We don't expect that those, that upward pressure will produce substantially higher prices or that the effects will be persistent. We expect that they'll be transitory or temporary. 8.3% , 40- It wasn't just Maxine Waters and Joe Biden and Joe Biden's flack, none of whom can do math, obviously. You just saw the head of the Federal Reserve and the former head of the Federal Reserve tell you this was going to be transitory. Transitory. That was the best they could do, but behind the reassuring happy talk they were, in fact, starting to panic because this was not at all what they had expected or predicted in public. In fact, in September, 17 winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics, an award that suggests the winner understands economics, signed a public letter urging Joe Biden to spend $2 trillion more because inflation was no longer a concern. There was no way we would get inflation and we're quoting, ""The Build Back Better package,"" wrote these economists, ""will transform the U.S. economy to be more efficient without presenting an inflationary threat."" So, trillions of new government spending, were going to make this country more efficient, but we would never get inflation? It was hard to see, even to not an economist, how that could be true. So, this spending, these trillions, were on top of trillions that Joe Biden had already spent, a bill that he'd already signed. That's many trillions. And it turns out when you spend that much, you get inflation. - : The Fed has found that that first bill raised inflation by at least three points, because when you print more dollars, each dollar is worth less. You don't need to be an economist to understand that, but these economists wanted even more spending, and they assured us it would not cause inflation, but of course it did. It was always going to, and by March of this year, that was obvious to everyone so Bloomberg News, which told us inflation was good, now kind of got a little more honest. They wrote a piece offering tips on how to deal with inflation because now inflation was bad. Bloomberg told its readers to eat lentils instead of meat and to kill their dogs because pets are expensive. As Bloomberg put it, ""Nobody said this would be fun."" And they were right about that. It hasn't been fun. In fact, inflation has been a disaster for virtually everyone except the big debt holders. Officially, according to numbers out today, the inflation rate is 8.3%, but that's a fake number. It's based on , which is a rigged measure. In every real-life scenario, the ones that you go through when you buy things to live, the numbers are much higher. For example, this year, the price of breakfast ceeal, which many people eat in the morning, has gone up by 10%. The cost of chicken nuggets is up 18%. Stick to lentils, Powell. Canned fruit and vegetables are up more than 10%. Juice, snacks and clothing for your kids is up 9%. The price of baby food, if you can find it, is up 13%. Fertilizer prices – being the basis of all agricultural products – is up 61% over last year. ' ,' A ' ' Corn, for example, was at $589 a bushel at the beginning of this year. It's now at $815 per bushel. That's a 38% increase, higher than the . Want to visit your family? Want to take a vacation? Want to take a work trip? The average cost of an airline ticket is now up more than 33% for the year. Gas prices—and you know this well—are up 50%. The average price of a used van was in May of last year was about $23,000. It's now $34,000. That's a 47% increase in a real product that you might have to buy, a used van. It's not 8.3%, according to the . The average price of a used crossover is up from $22,000 to $27,000—27% increase. Want to buy a house? Well, you're in trouble. Median home prices are up 16%. And the higher value zip codes are up a lot more than that, hundreds of percent in a lot of places. Here's the bad news for you. If you want to buy one, the 30-year mortgage rate is a 13-year high. So, this really is worst-case scenario. Interest rates get high so people can't afford to buy houses, but home values don't go down because all the houses are being snatched up by big investors, which are converting them to rental units so you will owe nothing and be happy. These are very distressing trends and everybody feels them and that explains why a recent poll from Pew found that inflation is at the very top of Americans' list of concerns. Ukraine, which everyone in Washington is obsessed with is not even in the top ten concerns of American citizens. So, you look at a poll like that and many more like it, and you reach the obvious conclusion. You have no choice. If you live in Washington, you are responsible for inflation, you pretend that you care about inflation and you think it's bad. It's been pretty easy for Joe Biden to say this because you can blame food inflation, just like he blamed Donald Trump's election, on Vladimir Putin. So, that's what he's doing. 'S ' ' , 'T ' ' President Biden speaks during the 2022 National and State Teachers of the Year event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, April 27, 2022. , 12: I'm doing everything within my power by executive orders to bring down the price and address the Putin price hike. , 10: Let me start with the Putin price hike. High gas prices and energy prices. , 21: 70% of the increase in inflation was a consequence of Putin's price hike because of the impact on gas and energy prices. I'm doing everything I can to bring down the price to address Putin's price hike. Not only did Vladimir Putin singlehandedly hack the and embarrass the Democratic Party, which is the greatest felony one can commit, but he wrecked our economy. How did he do that from the other side of the world when he runs an economy totally detached from ours? Good question, but that's really all they have at this point and you can see, given that, why Democrats are encouraging war in Ukraine, why they want that war to last forever. If the war in Ukraine ever ended, who would they blame for the effects of their deranged policies? They'd have to pick a new person – probably you. ' ', ' ,' But in point of fact, Vladimir Putin, for all of his faults, did not cause inflation in the United States. The people who run our economy in the U.S. government caused inflation in the United States, and they did it the old-fashioned way by printing a ton of money very quickly and that devalued our currency as printing a ton of money very quickly always does. Now the way this is measures with something called M2, that's the data set that the Federal Reserve uses to measure money supply. Our M2 money supply is not just going up. Our money supply is going up faster than it ever has in American history. As of today, M2 stands at more than $22 trillion. For reference, on February 3, 2020, it was at 15.3 trillion. That is, if you don't have a calculator handy, a 43% jump in our nation's money supply in just over two years. What's the result? The result is predictable and obvious. Inflation is going up much faster in the United States than is in, say, Europe, where they didn't spend as much on stimulus. Whatever Putin did or didn't do, none of this is his fault. This pre-dates Putin's invasion of Ukraine and you don't need to be a right winger to acknowledge that. Even is acknowledging that. : Biden called it the Putin price hike. I mean, is the pain at the pump all because of the war in Ukraine? Not really, right? , : They like to talk about the Putin price hike, but of course, energy prices were soaring even before the war began. Inflation was an issue before we ever started talking about Ukraine. , : So, there we heard that White House line that it's due to President Putin's price hike. One thing that is still out there is whether or not this is working, especially when it comes to a recent poll that showed that less than a third of Americans really feel that this party's economic vision aligns with their own. So, that is something, a crushing thing for this administration to deal with as it really prepares to take on the midterm elections. : Everyone understands what's going on here. Sorry, it's not Putin's fault. It's the fault of the people currently in charge and that makes Joe Biden very much like the classic arsonist firemen. He created the disaster he now claims he will fix. ""Oh, I just happened to be here. I'll put it out."" Biden caused this and not just Biden, Janet Yellen, his whole economic team and by the way, the legacy economic team. This has been going on for a long time. It's not just Biden, but he has made it much worse and he's done it on purpose. Biden is shutting down domestic energy production. The administration just canceled sales of federal oil leases. Why are they doing this? Why are they making it worse? Everything depends upon the price of energy. Everything you buy was trucked there or brought by ship or plane or rail. You need energy to bring you the products that you buy. And if the price of energy goes up, so does the price of those products. It's really simple. So, when you hike the price of energy, which they've done on purpose, you're increasing inflation, period. You don't need to be an economist to understand that, much less a Nobel Prize-winning economist. Why are they doing this? Well, there are three reasons. First, they have to do it. America's sovereign debt levels are way, way too high. We basically nationalized the debt, which is, say, we transferred it to taxpayers from the, oh, wait, meltdown. So, we have way too much debt and the only way out of that is to devalue the U.S. dollar. Otherwise, the U.S. government won't be able to afford the interest payments on the money that it owes. No one says it out loud, but it's absolutely true. We have to have inflation or else the U.S. government will default. You have to pay the price for their bad policies. Okay? So, the morons who mismanaged the American economy need inflation. Thank you, Janet Yellen. The rest of us could have seen this coming ten years ago, but somehow you didn't. . O' The second reason is that rising energy prices justify their transition to the Green New Deal. Nobody in America would ever choose to transition to green energy, which is to say to put trillions of U.S. tax dollars into the pet investment projects of Democratic donors. No one would ever do that voluntarily. But they're hoping that the price of fossil fuels will go so high that you have no choice. ""Oh, you can't afford to fill your truck. Guess you're going to need a Prius now, and we're definitely going to need to control the thermostat in your home."" Now, if that sounds too sinister to be real, it is real. Yes, it's sinister. It's also real and here's Joe Biden's commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, who ran the state of Rhode Island, of all places. Shouldn't that be disqualifying? Yes, it should. Somehow, she got a cabinet post. Here she is, still employed amazingly, telling you that climate change is existential and therefore more important than your picayune concerns, like putting clothes on your kids. Watch this. , R-.: While Americans are struggling and seeing their paychecks shrink, a 24% increase over our 21 levels for doesn't really help families put food on the table or clothes on the back at a time when inflation is at a 40-year high. Can you talk about how this massive allocation of funds helps to combat inflation or deal with supply chain issues that you say are so important? : Yes. So, look, we believe climate change is an existential threat so, you know, children won't, forget about clothes on their back. They're not going to be able to have a life if we don't deal with climate change. ""Forget about clothes on your back . Forget about your children. Climate change is existential. We can use it to justify anything, any power grab, any failure, any disaster that we caused and should have stopped before it got completely out of control and take the whole economy. Climate change! Climate change!"" President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the debt ceiling during an event in the State Dining Room of the White House, Monday, Oct. 4 in Washington. Pressing the U.S. economy to the brink actually has uses for the Biden administration. They will use your economic suffering as a pretext for assuming control over every aspect of your life and that's the third reason they're doing this to our economy. As Samantha Power, who has no grounding whatsoever in even balancing a checkbook – she's a lady who became famous for writing a book that informed us that genocide is bad. Really? Did you know that? Samantha Power discovered genocide is bad. ""Oh, she cares more than you."" As she put it just the other day, ""never let a crisis go to waste."" She actually said that out loud. Now, Democrats in Congress recognize that this is an opportunity. It's an opportunity for them, not simply to get more power, but to make certain their preexisting obsessions become law and, of course, always to lecture you. Here's Congresswoman Katie Porter of California explaining that because inflation is so high, we need more abortion. Watch. . , D-.: The fact that things like inflation can happen and it can become more expensive to feed your kids and to fuel your car is exactly why people need to be able to be in charge of how many mouths they're going to have to feed. So, I think the fact that we're seeing this jump in expenses, that we're seeing people having to pay more in the grocery store, pay more at the pump, pay more for housing, is a reason that people are saying, ""I need to be able to make my own decisions about when and if to start a family."" Now, she said that live on and the other side of the camera was a host called Larry O'Donnell over at and she just said out loud. This member of Congress said, ""Yeah, I mean, it's sad that you can't afford to have children in this country, but the upside is now you get to end their lives early so you shouldn't have to feed them. So really, there is kind of a silver lining in that cloud."" ""We're upset about the economy,"" say the American people. Lady from California goes,"" Have an abortion."" That's her answer? What country is this? What are you even talking about? That's insane and so dark. But you can be certain this is the one thing you can count on, that the left will never propose a solution to problems, even problems they caused, that, in the end, disempowers the Democratic Party.

McCaul,"Ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said he worries China may be able to take over Taiwan with non-military tactics. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas warned that the United States has been slow in delivering military equipment to Taiwan, leaving the country vulnerable to a Chinese invasion. ""Putin has always wanted Ukraine, it’s no secret. And President Xi has always wanted Taiwan,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital at the Milken Institute 2022 Global Conference. ""He’s watching very carefully what is taking place in Ukraine to determine his calculation as to what the next steps should be."" McCaul said he signed off on weapons systems to be delivered to Taiwan two to three years ago, but they have ""yet to land in Taiwan to protect them in the event there’s a military invasion by Chairman Xi."" ""It's unconscionable,"" McCaul said. McCaul said the ambassador from Taiwan has asked when the weapons are being delivered, but the Texas congressman ""can’t get a straight answer."" He speculated the weapons, which would be critical for Taiwan’s defenses, have gotten bogged down in a bureaucratic government procurement process. China's President Xi Jinping Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen McCaul said the United States should have delivered weapons to Ukraine in the fall and is now playing ""catchup."" ""With Taiwan, we’ve got to get those weapons in as well to provide deterrence to Chairman Xi,"" he said. . : A 21ST 'S McCaul noted that China was able to take over both Hong Kong and the Solomon Islands without a shot fired, and President Xi may attempt something similar to Ukraine. ""And that’s very concerning,"" he said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did not go as quickly as Putin had planned, possibly making Xi ""think twice"" about a similar military invasion of Taiwan, McCaul said. ""He’s probably looking at this route that would be more along the lines of deception, possibly overturning an election, trying to find ways to economically take Taiwan without a military invasion itself. We’ve got to keep our eyes on this very closely."" ‘ ’ Any Chinese takeover of Taiwan would have far-reaching consequences, McCaul noted. ""Ninety percent of the advanced semiconductor chips are manufactured in Taiwan,"" he said. ""Imagine if President Xi got his hands on that – everything from the iPhone to automobiles to our most advanced weapons systems would be in jeopardy."" Taiwan makes 92% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, according to a 2021 report from Boston Consulting and the Semiconductor Industry Association. The solution, according to McCaul: Manufacture more chips in the United States. ""We can incentivize manufacturing in the United States through a grant program and through tax incentives,"" he said. Last year, Samsung announced plans to build a $17 billion chip factory in Texas, and Intel announced plans earlier this year to invest at least $20 billion in an Ohio chip-making factory.",5

""Bud"" McFarlane passed away this week. His resume was long and distinguished – Naval Academy graduate, decorated Vietnam war hero, military aide to Henry Kissinger in the Nixon and Ford administrations, and President Reagan’s National Security Advisor. But Washington being Washington, commentators have focused on McFarlane’s role in the Iran Contra affair, the scandal du jour of the later years of the Reagan administration, when U.S. officials tried unsuccessfully to reestablish a relationship with Iran. – Robert 'Bud' McFarlane, National Security Advisor to President Ronald Reagan, walks through the lobby at Trump Tower, December 5, 2016 in New York City. To focus primarily on the scandal misses the role McFarlane played as an unsung hero in Reagan’s ultimate Cold War victory over the Soviet Union. Many others took the credit, but few deserved it more than Bud McFarlane. , - , Reagan famously said his policy toward the Soviet Union and the Cold War was simple – ""We win, they lose."" It was left to McFarlane, Reagan’s National Security Advisor, and a handful of others to figure out how to do it. Pres. Reagan having cozy summit chat w. Soviet ldr. Gorbachev. ) In the early days of the Reagan administration, they crafted a comprehensive, carefully engineered and sequenced series of steps that would make the Soviet Union’s ultimate demise inevitable. They began by: *Restoring America’s economic health and growth *Rebuilding and modernizing America’s military *Revitalizing the alliance *Halting transfer of American technology to the *Blocking Soviet access to the western capital and banks. The next step was Reagan’s ""Star Wars"" initiative. McFarlane was instrumental in Reagan’s proposal to develop a missile shield that would protect us from a Soviet nuclear attack. 'S Once these elements were in place, McFarlane and other aides set out to stress the Soviet economy by reducing revenues. They convinced the Saudis to pump more oil into the world market, which drove the price from $27 to $10 a barrel in mid-1980s. Ronald and Nancy Reagan greet Raissa and Mikhail Gorbatchev for a gala dinner given at the White House. The Soviet Union, already stressed from an expensive military buildup and bled by proxy wars, suddenly saw its revenues cut in half. When the Soviet Union experienced several years of bad harvests in the late 1980s, they could not take out loans to buy wheat to feed their people. The Soviet empire collapsed, seemingly overnight. President Reagan won the Cold War without firing a shot. But he didn’t do it alone. McFarlane played a crucial role in developing the strategy and laying out the steps to make it happen. But he was too modest to claim the credit. Today, America is consumed by another economic crisis, and once again confronted by powerful adversaries. Few at home or abroad have much confidence in our current batch of leaders to reverse course. Today, Washington is filled with men and women who refuse to take blame for failures of their own making, yet scramble to take credit for successes they had nothing to do with. McFarlane was just the opposite. He owned up to his mistakes, yet let others take credit for his successes. It’s a tragedy there aren’t a few more people like Bud McFarlane in Washington today. Although no relation, McFarlane was my mentor and friend for the last 50 years. I will sorely miss him. So will America. McFARLAND",6
2022-05-15,https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukrainian-band-wins-eurovision-song-competition-war-russia,Ukrainian band wins Eurovision song competition as war with Russia continues,"Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra won the Eurovision Song Contest in the early hours of Sunday in a clear show of popular support for the war-ravaged nation that went beyond music. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the victory, Ukraine's third since its 2003 Eurovision debut, and said ""we will do our best"" to host next year's contest in the hotly contested port city of Mariupol. He underlined ""Ukrainian Mariupol,"" adding: ""free, peaceful, rebuilt!"" ' ' , : Kalush Orchestra from Ukraine celebrate after winning the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest at Palaolimpico arena, in Turin, Italy, Saturday, May 14, 2022. ""I am sure our victorious chord in the battle with the enemy is not far off,'' Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram messaging app. Kalush Orchestra's frontman, Oleh Psiuk, took advantage of the enormous global audience, last year numbering more than 180 million, to make impassioned plea to free fighters still trapped beneath a sprawling steel plant in Mariupol following their performance. ""Help Azovstal, right now,″ Psiuk implored from beneath a bright bucket hat that has become the band’s trademark among fans. He later told a news conference that people can help by ""spreading information, talking out this, reaching out to governments to help."" Kalush Orchestra's song, ""Stefania,"" was the sentimental and bookmakers' favorite among the 25 competing performers in the grand finale. The public vote from home, via text message or the Eurovision app, proved decisive, lifting them above British Tik Tok star Sam Ryder, who led after the national juries in 40 countries cast their votes. The 439 fan votes is the highest number of televote points ever received in a Eurovision contest, now in its 66th year. Psiuk thanked the Ukrainian diaspora and ""and everyone around the world who voted for Ukraine. ... The victory is very important to Ukraine. Especially this year."" ""Stefania"" was penned by Psiuk as a tribute to his mother, but since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion it has become an anthem to the motherland, with lyrics that pledge: ""I’ll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed."" Kalush Orchestra itself is a cultural project that includes folklore experts and mixes traditional folk melodies and contemporary hip hop in a purposeful defense of Ukrainian culture. That has become an even more salient point as Russia through its invasion has sought falsely to assert that Ukraine's culture is not unique. ""We are here to show that Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian music are alive, and they have their own and very special signature,'' Psuik told journalists. The plea to free the remaining Ukrainian fighters trapped beneath the Azovstal plant by Russians served as a somber reminder that the hugely popular and at times flamboyant Eurovision song contest was being played out against the backdrop of a war on Europe’s eastern flank. The Azov battalion, which is among the plant's last 1,000 defenders, sent their thanks from the warren of tunnels beneath the plant, posting on Telegram: ""Thank you to Kalush Orchestra for your support! Glory to Ukraine!"" The city itself has been the site of some of the worst destruction of the 2 1/2-month war, as Russia seeks to secure a land bridge between separatist-controlled Donbas and Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Kalush Orchestra from Ukraine arrives for the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest at Palaolimpico arena, in Turin, Italy, Saturday, May 14, 2022. The six-member, all-male band received special permission to leave the country to represent Ukraine and Ukrainian culture at the music contest. One of the original members stayed to fight, and the others will be back in Ukraine in two days, when their temporary exit permit expires. Before traveling to Italy, Psiuk was running a volunteer organization he set up early in the war that uses social media to help find transportation and shelter for people in need ""It is hard to say what I am going to do, because this is the first time I win Eurovision,'' Psuik said. ""Like every Ukrainian, I am ready to fight and go until the end."" . While the support for Ukraine in the song contest was ultimately overwhelming, the contest remained wide open until the final popular votes were tallied. And war or not, fans from Spain, Britain and elsewhere entering the PalaOlimpico venue from throughout Europe were rooting for their own country to win. Still, Ukrainian music fan Iryna Lasiy said she felt global support for her country in the war and ""not only for the music."" Russia was excluded this year after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, a move organizers said was meant to keep politics out of the contest that promotes diversity and friendship among nations. Back in Ukraine, in the battered northeastern city of Kharkiv, Kalush Orchestra’s participation in Eurovision is seen as giving the nation another platform to garner international support. ""The whole country is rising, everyone in the world supports us. This is extremely nice,″ said Julia Vashenko, a 29-year-old teacher. ""I believe that wherever there is Ukraine now and there is an opportunity to talk about the war, we need to talk,″ said Alexandra Konovalova, a 23-year-old make-up artist in Kharkiv. ""Any competitions are important now, because of them more people learn about what is happening now."" Ukrainians in Italy also were using the Eurovision event as a backdrop to a flashmob this week to appeal for help for Mariupol. About 30 Ukrainians gathered in a bar in Milan to watch the broadcast, many wearing a bright bucket hat like the one Psiuk sports, in support of the band. ""We are so happy he called on helping to save the people in Mariupol,'' said lawyer Zoia Stankovska during the show. ""Oh, this victory brings so much hope."" : '' Cornelia Jakobs from Sweden arrives for the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest at Palaolimpico arena, in Turin, Italy, Saturday, May 14, 2022. The winner takes home a glass microphone trophy and a potential career boost — although Kalush Orchestra's first concern is peace. The event was hosted by Italy after local rock band Maneskin won last year in Rotterdam. The victory shot the Rome-based band to international fame, opening for the Rolling Stones and appearing on Saturday Night Live and numerous magazine covers in their typically genderless costume code. Twenty bands were chosen in two semifinals this week, and were competing along with the Big Five of Italy, Britain, France, Germany and Spain, which have permanent berths due to their financial support of the contest. Ukrainian commentator Timur Miroshnichenko, who does the live voiceover for Ukraine’s broadcast of Eurovision, was participating from a basement in an undisclosed location, rather than from his usual studio. ""On the fifth or fourth day of the war, they shot our tower in Kyiv,"" he said. To keep broadcasting, ""we had to move underground somewhere in Ukraine."" Showing Eurovision in Ukraine was important, online and on , he said. ""This year, I think it’s more symbolic than ever,"" Miroshnichenko said.",6

Lindsey Graham blasts baby formula shortage on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' : Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is warning that a measure by Congress to give Ukraine $40 billion additional funding in its war against Russia is evidence of the Biden administration's ""misplaced priorities"" and will be detrimental to the security of the U.S. The Senate advanced a $40 billion Ukraine aid bill on Monday evening, despite opposition from a handful of Republican senators, in a vote tallying 81-11. Hawley told Fox News Digital Tuesday during an exclusive interview that the reason why he voted ""no"" to advance the aid package is due to the fact that it will harm the United States' standing domestically as well as on the world stage and doesn't represent a ""nationalist"" foreign policy view. ""My biggest concern is that I don't think this represents a nationalist foreign policy. I mean, it seems to me to be part of this unfocused globalism that unfortunately many in my party have embraced in the last couple of decades,"" Hawley said. Sen. Josh Hawley speaks during a Senate Judiciary Committee business meeting to vote on Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Capitol Hill, April 4, 2022 in Washington, . A confirmation vote from the full Senate will come later this week. ""The amounts we're talking about are astronomical. I think $40 billion would be about three times as much as Europe has contributed combined, all of the European states, for a war that's happening on their continent,"" the senator stated, saying he's worried it will continue allowing Europe to ""freeload."" ""I'm concerned that it shortchanges priorities here at home. We could build a border wall twice over with this amount of money,"" Hawley continued, stating that the U.S. needs to be more focused on the threat that illegal immigration poses, rather than fueling billions into a war and adding to our national debt. Last week, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blocked a measure that would have fast tracked the legislation to the Senate floor, and since then, other senators have come out in opposition to the legislation saying its direction is muddled and would require additional oversight. ""My oath of office is to the U.S. Constitution, not to any foreign nation,"" Paul, who has been leading on this issue, tweeted Thursday after he single-handedly delayed a unanimous consent request to move the bill forward. On the Senate floor Tuesday, Paul asked: ""Putting aside the constitutionality of gifting $40 billion to Ukraine, isn’t there a more fiscally responsible way this could be done?"" ""What about taking the $40 billion from elsewhere in the budget? The spends more on our military than the next 8 countries combined. Couldn’t Congress simply shift over the $40 billion and not add it to the debt? If the defense of Ukraine is really in our national security interest, shouldn’t their gift come from our military budget?"" Hawley also remarked to Fox News Digital that there are ""no meaningful restraints or oversight"" on the bill, which could cause many issues, he explained. $40 The Congressional Research Service has estimated that this latest Ukraine bill is $6 billion more than all defense spending by the U.S. on foreign aid and military assistance in 2019, which is another point of contention for the lawmakers. In addition, it would put the United States at above $50 billion in total aid to Ukraine — far exceeding the amount provided for by European countries, which Hawley and other Republican senators argue is disadvantageous to the international standing of the country. Hawley also told Fox News Digital that he is concerned that the package distracts from ""more pressing"" priorities abroad and at home, including the threat from China. ""I mean, what needs to happen here is we need to get out of the business of nation building, and we need to get focused on deterring our most significant adversary, which is China,"" said Hawley, who says he still supports aid to Ukraine to defeat Russia, but not in such a massive quantity. ""To do that, we've got to get in the right posture in the Indo-Pacific, which we're not currently. We've got to get serious about getting tough on China's trade cheating, which this administration is not. And, you know, we've also got to get serious about protecting our border, which is truly in a total crisis on our southern border. And, you know, that is also a national security concern, given what we're seeing coming across the border in terms of crime and drugs."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pose for a photo in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Saturday, May 14. ""It is a matter of priorities that are misplaced. It's a matter of not putting America's national security interests first and not having any clear plan,"" Hawley told Fox News Digital. Biden's funding bill for Ukraine includes over $20 billion in weapons and security assistance for Ukraine, $6 billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and $4 billion for the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing program. The bill passed the House last week despite ""no"" votes from 57 Republican congressmen. The Senate is expected to hold a final passage vote on the bill later this week, requiring just 60 votes, and then it would head to President Biden's desk. ""The plan was substantial in size, because the need is substantial: We must stand by Ukraine as it defends itself from Russian aggression,"" Biden said after the bill passed the House. ""The need is also urgent: I have nearly exhausted the resources given to me by a bipartisan majority in Congress to support Ukraine’s fighters.""

Bush delivered remarks regarding the importance of democracy and threats to democracy in the U.S. and abroad. ""In contrast, Russian elections are rigged,"" he said. ""Political opponents are imprisoned or otherwise eliminated from participating in the electoral process. The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invassion of Iraq. I mean of Ukraine."" Bush shrugged and said, under his breath, ""Iraq, too."" Russia has not invaded Iraq, and the Kremlin reportedly gave Saddam Hussein's government intelligence to combat the U.S. invasion early on. ‘ ’ ""Anyway, 75,"" Bush added, referring to his age. - In this Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017 file photo, former U.S. President George W. Bush speaks at a forum sponsored by the George W. Bush Institute in New York. Bush presided over most of the war in Iraq, authorized by a bipartisan vote in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate in Oct. 2002. The war, which lasted until 2011, claimed the lives of more than 4,000 U.S. troops, along with those of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians. Critics have long faulted Bush for the war, claiming that Iraq did not possess the weapons of mass destruction Bush feared. The 2002 authorization cited many reasons to invade Iraq, however, including Iraq's alleged noncompliance with the 1991 ceasefire agreement' the country's ""brutal repression of its civilian population;"" the country's harboring of members of al-Qaeda in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks; Iraq's payment of bounties to the families of suicide bombers; and the governments of Turkey, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia fearing Saddam Hussein and wanting him removed. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Yerevan, Armenia. Bush's gaffe clearly did not represent an attempt by the former president to acknowledge claims that the U.S. invasion of Iraq was ""brutal"" and ""wholly unjustified."" Even so, many on Twitter poked fun at the former president. ""Oof. If you were George W. Bush, you think you’d just steer clear of giving any speech about one man launching a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion,"" former Rep. Justin Amash tweeted. ""George W. Bush is a war criminal,"" Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator, tweeted. ""This is the most amazing Freudian slip of all time,"" Townhall writer Scott Morefield tweeted. ""George W. Bush didn't do a Freudian slip. He did a Freudian Confession,"" John Fuelsgang, a comedian and broadcaster, wrote on Twitter. Bush's flub came as he praised Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Dallas Morning News reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sat down with Fox News' Griff Jenkins for an interview Wednesday, May 4, 2022. ""The way countries conduct elections is indicative of how their leaders treat their own people, and how nations behave toward other nations,"" Bush said. ""And nowhere is this on display more clearly than Ukraine."" Bush noted that Zelenskyy, whom he described as a ""cool little guy,"" and ""the Churchill of the 21st century"" was empowered by electoral legitimacy before leading the defense of his country against the Russian invasion.",9

Despite some opposition, the bill passed by a final tally of 86-11, with the support of leadership from both parties and a significant majority of Republican senators. It will now go to President Biden's desk. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., led the opposition to the bill, demanding an inspector general be appointed to oversee the spending.

""Anyone concerned about the cost of supporting a Ukrainian victory should consider the much larger costs should Ukraine lose."" , 3 But the senators opposing the bill gave differing reasons for why, including opposition to the general policy and concern about a lack of oversight. ""I just think this is an exercise in nation building,"" Hawley told Fox News Thursday. ""So I'm a nationalist. I'm not in favor of nation building. I think we ought to be prioritizing American strength."" ""I'm not against the why, I'm against the how we're doing it,"" Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said Thursday.

""We would have paid for this, we could have done it easily, we should have done that. And quite honestly we should have included Rand Paul's amendment to get the special investigator in Afghanistan on the case right away to review this,"" Johnson said. ""But the fact that we need to replenish our stocks, so that's about $10 billion at least in terms of spending on that. And we simply cannot tolerate or reward Putin's naked aggression here, you know – the atrocities, the war crimes."" Johnson added: ""I know it's a third of the world away but I'm not going to let perfect be the enemy of what is necessary."" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, also noted that some of the money is going to the U.S. military. ""At least 25% directly to the military in the United States, some to strengthen our forces in Europe. And then a good deal of it is humanitarian,"" he said. ""And if you believe in the rule of law and if you believe that Putin could be on a slippery slope – is he going to stop in Ukraine and is he going to go in Eastern Europe, like they did before?

Paul, meanwhile, complained about the fact the bill isn't paid for at a time Americans are struggling with inflation. ""Those senators who voted to gift $40 billion to Ukraine argue that it is in our national security interest,"" Paul said on the Senate floor after the vote. ""I wonder if Americans across our country would agree if they had been shown the costs, if they had been asked to pay for it."" Paul added: ""By my calculation, each income taxpayer in our country would need to pay $500 to support this $40 billion, which by some accounts is a down payment and will need to be replenished in about four months."" Democrats, meanwhile, are railing against Republicans for the fact they delayed the Ukraine funding bill by a full week. ""Senator Paul’s obstruction of Ukraine funding is totally unacceptable, and only serves to strengthen Putin’s hand in the long run,"" Schumer said this week.

On ""America's Newsroom"" Friday, Allen argued Blinken delivered a ‘soft speech’ given the high stakes of China's growing threat to global security and demanded a strong approach to protect American interests. 'S , ‘ ’ : Secretary Blinken laid out a strategy yesterday that the United States should invest, align with its allies and compete with China. I thought it was a rather soft speech, given the stakes. I thought it should have been more about how to blunt and confront China. One, China has doubled the size of their military over the last ten years. I would have liked to have heard more about what the United States' strategy is to deter China in Asia. And I'd like to hear more about how American jobs are affected by the confrontation with China. At a minimum, they steal millions, sometimes billions of dollars in intellectual property here in the United States through cyber theft and other means.

2022-06-02,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putin-russia-hack-elections-cyberattack,Putin wants to hack our elections. Here's how we stop it,"Eric Noonan, Cybersheath , joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the evolving risk of Russian cyberattacks. The biggest near-term question facing America’s national security establishment is clear: When and how will Russia use its considerable offensive cyber capabilities to retaliate against the United States for sweeping sanctions as well as military aid to Ukraine? While it’s extremely difficult to predict how Russian agents may use their cyber weapons against business or even public infrastructure targets abroad, U.S. intelligence experts believe that Putin’s government will continue to engage in the kind of hacking and information warfare in which it has dabbled for years: attempting to interfere with our elections. We can only assume the threat is now greater than ever. Congress and the Biden administration have a range of options—but only a narrow window of time—to fortify our defenses. After all, the next presidential election is just around the corner. To be clear, there’s no evidence that Russia has successfully changed any votes, altered or deleted any voter records, or interfered with any election night reporting in the United States in recent years. However, there’s consensus in the U.S. intelligence community that officials — under Kremlin orders — have sought to interfere in our campaigns and elections. In addition to well-publicized information operations, Russian hackers actually probed elections websites in 21 U.S. states and breached some voter-registration databases. ‘ ’ 2016 As former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pointed out, Russian interference and disinformation campaigns were a direct response to perceived U.S. interference in Russia’s sphere of influence, including activities in support of Ukraine’s 2014 Revolution of Dignity. Beyond the partisan goals of any Russian interference operations, officials in both the Obama and Trump administrations believe that the objective has been, first and foremost, to undermine faith in America’s electoral institutions. That’s why as policymakers debate options for defending against cyberattacks, one the most important and cost-effective ways to defend ourselves is to harden targets in our election system. Our nation’s leading computer science and internet security specialists and election administrators attest that America needs investments in our nation’s election infrastructure to better ensure security. Over recent years, lawmakers from both parties have coalesced around a common agenda for election cybersecurity, sponsoring legislation to boost funding, improve security standards, ensure the use of paper ballots that provide durable records, and mainstream the use of risk-limiting audits to verify vote counts. While many Democrats have been pushing for paper ballot requirements and election security funding for more than a decade, a growing number of Republicans — including former President Trump — have been vocal in their support for these policies. In December, the leaders of prominent conservative groups — including Americans for Tax Reform, FreedomWorks, R Street Institute, James Madison Institute, and others — sent a letter to Congress calling for more federal funding for election cybersecurity. The crisis with Russia will hopefully prompt Congress to act. A significant investment in election security grants for states would substantially harden election systems as targets. Given that the security of our elections is necessary for our entire society to function, this represents an extremely cost-effective way of defending our critical national security interests. Congress should also make a commitment to offer recurring financial support so that state and local election administrators can count on reliable federal funding when developing their election budgets. The Biden administration also has options for taking immediate action. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas can require that a percentage of Homeland Security grants be used for election-related spending and request chief state election officials be involved grant applications. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency can also hire more election specialists and boost its programming to make local officials aware of opportunities to strengthen defenses. While Russia’s interest in interfering with U.S. voting is, by this point, ""old news,"" we can’t lose sight of just how devastating a cyber-attack of an election would be to the civic life of our nation. It’s time that we start investing in defenses commensurate with the seriousness of the risk.

And there's been an absence of any attempt to resolve the war diplomatically, which is what you would be doing, trying to solve it diplomatically if you actually cared about the Ukrainians. The Biden administration instead has been escalating the war seemingly deliberately, which is what you would do if you don't care about Ukrainians, but instead care about weapons manufacturers and the power of the U.S. security state.",0

It's the war in Ukraine. Well, why did Vladimir Putin invade Ukraine? Because he thought Joe Biden was weak. … It's no coincidence that it happened a few months after the catastrophic withdrawal of Afghanistan, which projected weakness on the world. So if the first part is the war on fossil fuels, if the second part isn't the Putin price hike, it's the Biden weakness tax. It's our failure to enforce our strong foreign policy around the world which led to a catastrophic war that didn't have to happen that could have been deterred if America had been strong.",9

""If the current White House fails to develop a comprehensive, coherent policy toward the region — one that emphasizes the goals and aspirations of the Latin American and Caribbean people and establishes the United States as a partner of choice for trade — it will be China that benefits from the region's growth,"" Filipetti told Fox News Digital. ""The United States needs to be a part of the region's development,"" she added.

Not many crews had made it to this battered city since the invasion. She wanted to talk about the bloodshed, the injustice. ""What do they want from us?"" she asked rhetorically. ""I still don't understand."" The sad truth is: The invading army didn’t want anything from the people of Chernihiv. They had the misfortune of being a population center between the Belarus border and Russia’s unstated but clear goal of decapitating the Ukrainian government in Kyiv. Rather than bypassing Chernihiv and risk being attacked from the rear, the invading force attempted to beat the town into submission. Donets is 76 years old. When family members piled in a car to escape, the car filled up. She opted to let younger family members, with more life ahead of them, go and she stayed behind. Ten of the people who sheltered with her were killed. Disabled people lived in her house. Three of them have died since the invasion. Like many Ukrainians in the north and east of the country, Donets is bewildered. She once thought of Russians as kin, fellow countrymen. ""They called us brothers, but they are not brothers to us,"" she said through sobs. ""They are bastards. After all, they are abusing us so much, what do they need? We did not claim their territory. It's all a lie."" As we shot scenes of destruction, cameraman Stephen Kanicka focused on a small house that had taken a direct hit. It was nothing but a pile of burned lumber and remains of a chimney. A framed picture of Jesus and several pairs of shoes had been fished from the debris and set up like a display. Vasylchenko Valentyna approached us eager to talk. ""Most of my family died here,"" she said and broke into tears. Vasylchenko had pulled her family into that house for shelter. Her grandson, granddaughter, granddaughter’s groom and son-in-law were all killed. Only Vasylchenko and one daughter survived. Given the destruction, it’s hard to understand how anyone survived. The house was flattened. Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane weighs in after Russia hit Kyiv for the first time in weeks and reflects on D-Day 78 years later. ""Such people have no right to exist,"" she said of the Russian Army. ""Such a nation must be destroyed because they came to kill innocent people, we are not military. We are civilians who lived here and did no harm to anyone."" All she has left is what she can pull from the debris, one daughter and haunting memories. ""I sleep badly. I dream of my dead relatives,"" Vasylchenko said. , : A short distance from Vasylchenko’s house is School Number 21. Inna Levchenko is the principal. She had established the school as a shelter. ""Whole families hid here. Grandparents, little kids, and students of our school,"" Inna said. She marked both the front and back with the Russian word for ""kids,"" to indicate children were inside. Inna now walks with a limp as she's recovering from a broken leg. She can see only out of her right eye. The scar from the shrapnel that went into her left eye is still red and appears tender. She has other shrapnel scars on her face and arms that are healing. A woman collecting wooden planks in a street destroyed by shellings in Chernihiv, Ukraine, April 13. School Number 21 also took a direct hit. A shell of the school remains, but most of the building is destroyed. Classrooms, offices and the cafeteria now sit in open air with piles of bricks all around. ""When the shock wave hit me, I covered my face with hands. There are still pieces of glass and metal in my body that have not yet been removed,"" Inna said. In the chaos following the blast, as she was receiving care, Inna lost track of how many people had been killed or injured. She is one of few people in Chernihiv who did not break into tears telling us her story. Inna is angry at the Russians with whom she once felt close. ""These are not human beings. I do not understand what they were guided by, because you see that it is the private sector and schools are clearly visible,"" she said. A , On the north side of town, about 3 acres of woodland has been cleared to make space for a thousand new graves. At least in Chernihiv, the freshly dead have the dignity of individual graves. Rows and rows of sandy soil have been turned up with mounds of dirt over the bodies. The wood on 988 Orthodox crosses is yet to weather. Garlands and flowers placed at the graves are fresh as relatives still make regular visits. A small section of about 42 graves is marked with Ukrainian flags and pictures of the soldiers that lie there. The other 946 new graves are all civilians. Volodomyr Bruduk held a graveside vigil for his brother, Anatoli. They laid flowers and fruit on the sand and poured Anatoli’s favorite drink there. He said Anatoli was killed by a cluster bomb. ""Why did they come to our peaceful country?"" he asked, explaining that his soul has been longing for his brother. ""Young boys, children and women died. There is nothing to think about. They must be destroyed."" Ukrainian soldiers walking next to destroyed Russian tanks in the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, March 31. This is also the town where American Jimmy Hill from Minnesota was killed, when civilians waiting in a bread line were massacred on March 16. At the time, the U.S. Embassy reported Russian forces had shot and killed 10 civilians. That was bad information which made it easy for the Kremlin to state they didn’t have forces close enough to shoot anyone. What is clear from shrapnel scars all over the area where the people were killed is that a mortar or artillery round flew in and hit where the hungry people were hoping to get some food. U.S. 'S Oleksandr Guryanov was a witness. He disputed the official account of 10 dead and said that one strike killed 14 people. Divots and holes are all over the walls and the gate that Oleksandr passes through to get to work, a daily reminder of the bloodshed. ""But what can you do about it?"" he asked. ""You won't bring people back, but I need to work."" Dozens of concrete apartment buildings are marked with black holes and shrapnel scars from artillery strikes. So many, that I told Stephen, the cameraman, he didn’t need to shoot each one. We’d never use all those shots.

I was excited for a number of reasons — the chance to swap kolbasa for a Big Mac, to see if the Soviets could pull it off and to show a Russian friend of mine at Moscow State University, where I was studying, a piece of America. Arkady was from Russia's Far East, Sakhalin Island. He asked if there was fish on the menu. ""Yes,"" I told him. ""Filet-o-Fish."" 'S ""What kind of fish is it?"" he asked. I paused. I had no idea. ""That's ,"" he said. ""I will be able to tell by the eyes."" People line up to visit a newly-opened fast-food restaurant in a former McDonald's outlet on Bolshaya Bronnaya Street in Moscow Sunday, June 12, 2022. Arkady, like many of the 30,000 who lined up on opening day, was in for a surprise. Color, bright lights, smiling cashiers. Soon Big Macs were being bought and resold, scalped at a nearby subway station. The plastic serving trays and some toilet seats disappeared. Cashiers got married. And McDonald's grew. Eight hundred restaurants and 60,000 employees in Russia. Boris Yeltsin stopped by and pushed off the top bun of a plain hamburger to eat it Russian style — buterbrody. McDonald's Russia was consistent, reliable, delicious, a thrill of sugar and salt in a gray world. 'S Over the next few years, I saw the Soviet Union fall apart. I saw protestors — ordinary men and women — gain courage and take risks. There were real elections and shows that mocked the president and that criticized the conduct of the war in Chechnya. Russia, I thought, was on track for free speech, democracy, a market economy. Alexander Govor, owner of the new restaurant chain Vkusno and tochka that opened following the exit of McDonald's from the Russian market, speaks during a news conference in Moscow June 12, 2022. I was wrong. All that disappeared. And now, the Big Mac is gone too. Corporate headquarters said doing business in Russia ""was not consistent with McDonald's values."" The Russian government had become too disgusting for American fast food. Some restaurants reopened this weekend with a Russian owner and a new Russian name, ""Tasty."" ' ,' Unconfirmed reports say the Big Mac is off the menu as the sauce is proprietary, but I doubt sauce infringement will be enforced during war. The war has also shut down the McDonald's franchises in Ukraine, collateral damage. I stood outside one in Odesa this morning. I looked at the golden arches and the shining windows. It was empty inside.",6
2022-06-13,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/finland-sweden-joining-nato-us-safer,Finland and Sweden joining NATO won't make U.S. safer,"U.S. Ambassador to Finland Douglas Hickey discusses Finland and Sweden applying for membership. In the aftermath of Russia’s immoral invasion of Ukraine, the news that Sweden and Finland are abandoning their long-held neutrality in favor of joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is being met with much exuberance by the American political elite. President Joe Biden celebrated the move with a joint press conference at the White House featuring the leaders of both countries. On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Senators Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell — leaders in two parties that seemingly agree on almost nothing these days — jointly sponsored a resolution calling for expedited accession. Much of the Beltway media predictably joined the chorus, with editorials from newspapers such as the Washington Post heralding the move. For America’s political establishment, expansion has been one of the closest things to a foreign policy holy sacrament in the post-Cold War era. But our policy-making elite are doing the American people a disservice by rubber-stamping an expansion of America’s security commitments through during a period of economic turmoil at home and emerging security challenges in other parts of the world. ’S It is not in the national interest of the United States, through , to commit to defend two wealthy European welfare states whose neutrality has kept them safe and prosperous for more than 70 years. While some insist Russia’s invasion of Ukraine changes everything, the fact remains that new security guarantees will force trade-offs, consume more resources, and increase the likelihood of a confrontation with a nuclear-armed adversary. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, center, participates in a media conference with Finland's Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, left, and Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde, right, at headquarters in Brussels on Jan. 24. Despite rhetoric from evangelists that can often give the contrary impression, adding Finland and Sweden to will lead to increased costs for the U.S. Admitting both nations to could generate up-front expenses of over $8 billion along with $1.5 billion in additional annual costs. And while U.S. military leaders are currently claiming that their membership in won’t lead to a permanent stationing of troops in either nation, they do admit that more U.S. troops will likely rotate to both Finland and Sweden on a more frequent basis. This will place further strain on a U.S. military that is already struggling to sustain deployments in support of dozens of ongoing operations including active combat missions in Iraq, Syria, and Somalia. One frequently cited justification for admitting Finland and Sweden to is that they have capable militaries that would enhance . However, the reality is that both countries have relatively small professional militaries of around 20,000 troops each that rely on large reserve forces in a time of war and which lack long-range force projection capabilities. Sweden is already requesting a larger U.S. naval presence in the Baltic Sea, calling into question the ability of their military to secure their own backyard. Additionally, neither country currently meets the 2 percent of defense spending goal that was agreed to by members. Just as in other parts of Europe, a security guarantee provided by the United States could encourage free-riding and disincentivize increased investment in defense capabilities in favor of more spending on politically popular social programs. But most dangerously, adding Finland and Sweden to will increase the risk of a nuclear confrontation with Russia. As a result of its failures in Ukraine, the threat posed by Russia’s conventional forces has been reduced. But Russia still possesses a large nuclear arsenal that, according to the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, they will likely rely on more to secure their borders — including the nearly 850-mile one they share with Finland. membership for Finland and Sweden includes extending the umbrella of America’s nuclear deterrent to both nations, thus elevating the risk that any border dispute could escalate into a nuclear exchange. Instead of enabling accession for Finland and Sweden, the United States should take actions to encourage the strengthening and development of non- security architectures in Europe like the Nordic Defence Cooperation, which Finland and Sweden are already a part of. The failures of Russia’s military in Ukraine have demonstrated that collectively Europe is more than capable of securing itself without significant U.S. support, as long they properly prioritize defense investments. At a time of record inflation and a $30.5 trillion national debt, it is hard to justify spending more American tax dollars and committing more American troops to defend two wealthy European social democracies. This is particularly true when neither state enhances U.S. security and both have benefited from neutrality for decades. The lack of robust debate around this important topic and the smearing of those who dare to question the benefits of expansion only raises the risk that the United States will become overextended, or worse, potentially sleep-walk into a war with a nuclear-armed Russia. After decades of foreign policy failures that have cost the United States dearly, America’s elected officials owe the American people better than more costly security commitments disconnected from our safety and economic prosperity.

2022-06-14,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/competition-russia-china-revives-need-soft-power,"Competition with Russia, China revives need for soft power","Fox News’ Trey Yingst talks with U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink on efforts to support Ukraine including supplying grain Seventy-five years ago this month, Secretary of State George C. Marshall gave a speech at Harvard University on the post-war reconstruction efforts in Europe. The speech led to the creation of the Marshall Plan, named after the World War hero serving as secretary of state under President Harry S. Truman . Marshall was almost universally revered. Formally known as the European Recovery Program, the Marshall Plan was the first U.S. government-sponsored foreign assistance initiative. In 1947, Europe remained largely in ruins, transportation was stalled, food was scarce, and there were increasing fears that local communist parties with support from Moscow would take advantage of the situation. The plan was targeted toward economic recovery and rebuilding institutions in 16 countries and was in effect from April 1948 to December 1951, costing the American taxpayers up to $13.3 billion . The Marshall Plan was designed to rebuild Europe and push back against the Soviet Union, creating political and socioeconomic stability needed for these states to sustain democratic and market institutions. In many ways, the Marshall Plan can be described as an act of enlightened self-interest as it created strong and strategically vital partners in Europe while providing key market access to U.S. businesses. '' , As Benn Steil described in his excellent book, The Marshall Plan: Dawn of the Cold War, Marshall saw an inextricable linkage between issues of security and development, ultimately creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the secretariat of the Marshall Plan: the Organization for European Economic Cooperation . Emergency workers clear up debris after an airstrike hit a tire shop in the western city of Lviv, Ukraine, on Monday. Besides helping Europe return to the path of economic self-sufficiency and development, the Marshall Plan also marked the beginning of America’s formal and sustained use of soft power, namely foreign assistance. One of the foremost champions of this approach was Senator Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican from Michigan who served in the United States Senate from 1928 to 1951. Despite being the party’s favored candidate for the presidential nomination in 1948, Sen. Vandenberg chose to stay in the Senate, where he chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and shepherded the Marshall Plan and through the Senate. Sen. Vandenberg, a former isolationist shaken by World War and the threat of Soviet Communism, set a new internationalist orientation for the Republican party. At a 1943 conference in the Grand Hotel in Mackinac Islands, , Sen. Vandenberg steered Republican leaders to commit to an internationalist vision. Vandenberg’s belief in American leadership in international affairs, peace through strength, and working with allies remained the leading perspective in the Republican party for more than 60 years. Nearly 75 years later, the United States faces a different but daunting challenge — this time in the form of great power competition with China and Russia. Perhaps it is too strong to say we are in a second Cold War, but China and Russia fill vacuums that the United States leaves behind. Both countries rushed to provide Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries at a time when the West was getting organized on vaccine distribution efforts. Similarly, China has helped developing countries close their digital divide through and Huawei, although working with these companies means providing data to China. China is now the largest trading partner to more than 100 countries. While the world is freer, healthier, and more prosperous than 75 years ago, the world still looks to the United States for leadership. Today, developing countries want to access infrastructure , close their digital divide, and solve -19, among other challenges. If the West does not offer a compelling and affirmative alternative, many of these countries will take their business to China and Russia. That is why great power competition will not happen in Beijing or Moscow but in Kyiv, Nairobi, Tashkent, Jakarta, or Guatemala City. We need to update our toolkit for a new era and a new world. Just as at the time of the launch of the Marshall Plan, American diplomacy and soft power matter. American leadership still matters. At the same time, the toolkit and approaches that worked in the Cold War will not work today because the world has changed, and the needs are different. We need to think creatively and update what we offer and how we offer it. We should work toward supporting countries to stand on their own and become global burden sharers just as the countries that received the Marshall Plan’s assistance did. The Marshall Plan was a political and economic success. Not only did the assistance help restore and increase the production capacity for the countries to pre-war levels, but the Plan also liberalized and boosted the trade between Europe and America and used U.S. government-backed guaranties to help mobilize private capital in Europe and strengthened its markets and private sector. In other words, our monies were a catalyst. For us to prevail again in the long run against China and Russia, we will need non-military power most of all and the 75th anniversary of the Marshall Plan reminds us that we have been here before and can do this again.",22

An individual’s location is typically known to someone or thing at any given time whether using a smartphone or device – such as a drone. This issue has become one of tremendous strategic importance for Ukrainians in their battle against Russian aggression. Allegations have arisen that Da-Jiang Innovations , a Chinese company that is the world’s largest civilian drone manufacturer, has been providing the Russian military with software to track Ukrainians piloting drones used to conduct operations.

While the polls are razor-thin between Petro and his populist opponent, Rodolfo Hernández, a win for the left will be just the latest of several victories across the continent. Critics say a socialist win in Colombia will undo years of sacrifice and effort to implement and maintain a policy of democratic security, respect for freedom, strengthening of the rule of law, free trade, greater openness to the world and even a commitment to become an innovation hub and pioneer of the orange economy . They note, that all these milestones, stability and institutions are at risk. ‘,’ This combination of photos shows Colombian presidential candidates Gustavo Petro, left, June 17, 2018, and Rodolfo Hernández on June 2, 2022, in Bogota, Colombia. The United States has had in Colombia a strategic ally and a reliable partner, the jewel in the crown that some observers say could be at risk in a world that is rapidly reconfiguring itself. Petro has reportedly tried to distinguish himself from other leaders on the left across Latin America, promising to seek only one term. ""Rest assured that I will not seek re-election,"" Petro said, according to The Associated Press, while adding he ""will respect the laws. ... Listen carefully, this includes respecting the right to private property."" McCAUL: ‘ ’ Opponents of Petro say he is not afraid to hide his views, and they worry that he threatens to reverse and completely change the reality of Colombia by aligning himself with the socialist agenda of the São Paulo Forum, an organization of leftist politicians from the continent and the Caribbean. They worry a close relationship with Venezuela, Russia and China or allies such as Iran could, from there, expand its malign influence throughout the region. Maria Clara Escobar, executive director of Instituto de Ciencia Política , told Fox News Digital ""a Petro government represents the opportunity for the Latin American left to consolidate a regional bloc with the ability to influence at the geopolitical level in its efforts to achieve a change in the international order by legitimizing the region's dictatorships, facilitating the penetration of authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China and Iran, weakening the inter-American institutional framework and creating new regional political and diplomatic blocs, from which they will support the weakening of regional democracy and the rule of law."" A woman cleans the capital's main voting center in preparation for the presidential runoff election in Bogota, Colombia, Friday, June 17, 2022. Sunday's runoff is between the man who could become the first leftist to lead the nation and a populist millionaire who promises to end corruption. With the onset of the pandemic, commentators say anti-establishment sentiment has grown in Latin America because of a lack of inclusive growth and prosperity. The economic and political effects generated by -19 have caused discomfort and frustration in people, something Petro and other politicians have taken advantage of. Yet while Petro won the first round handily, polls have become much closer in recent weeks as his challenger, Rodolfo Hernández, who some in the media describe as Colombia’s answer to Donald Trump, has narrowed Petro's lead to a statistical tie and now has every chance of winning. The millionaire businessman became a social media phenomenon and has positioned himself among those who reject politics as normal. And, to the surprise of many, he came in second place, beating the establishment conservative candidate last month. Still, Hernández has taken differing positions and is seen largely as a populist candidate. At 77, he's a former mayor who made his money from farming and real estate and has said he wants to target corruption and wasteful spending. Yet others say he has more in common with the president of Mexico, López Obrador , than Petro. This is a concern to some Colombians because, to them, Petro represents a greater threat. Rodolfo, as he is known, is viewed as not so different. Some in the media have compared populist candidate Rodolfo Hernández to former President Donald Trump. Hernández is not affiliated with either political party, and his campaign to become president profited greatly by his use of social media, where most of his campaign was said to be waged. 'T , Rodolfo has repeated ´s slogans such as ""Do not steal, do not lie and do not betray … There cannot be a rich government with poor people."" And Rodolfo does not hide his admiration for the Mexican president, who in turn, openly supports Petro. Observers believe that while the choices are far from ideal, a Petro presidency will be problematic for the U.S. Colombian Senator Paola Holguin, a member of the conservative Centro Democratico party, told Fox News Digital that ""Rodolfo is an engineer and businessman from Bucaramanga who had good results during his tenure as mayor; he likes to be politically incorrect, but now he is the only guarantee to maintain democracy, freedom and . ""His main flags are austerity and fighting against corruption. On the other side, Gustavo Petro is an amnestied former M-19 guerrilla, former mayor of Bogotá with a questionable administration who has received support from criminal structures such as , and Clan del Golfo can be defined as a radical left populist who has been close to the leaders of the São Paulo Forum and the Puebla Group."" , Analysts worry that if Petro wins, the United States could lose a great ally in the hemisphere and witness the continued growth of influence of Russia, China and Iran among its closest neighbors. Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president, delivers a State of the Union address at the National Assembly in Caracas, Venezuela, Jan. 15, 2022. The growing wave of triumphs by the left in Latin America runs from Mexico through Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, Chile and Argentina. After Colombia, Brazil could be the next domino to fall in a leftward direction if early polls in Brazil are to be believed for the upcoming October presidential election. Commentators say there is a lot at stake in Sunday’s election. ""No president of Colombia will be able to break this alliance that easily,"" said Joseph Humire, executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society. ""Gustavo Petro may try to do so if he is elected, but like Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, he will need more than four years to radically realign Colombia's foreign policy. Colombia shares more than government policies with the United States, we share culture."" Whoever wins Sunday, Colombian presidential politics will change drastically, and Washington will need to adjust and prepare, whatever the outcome.",22
2022-06-20,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bromance-putin-kim-take-world-critics-fear-ukraine-war-boosted-alliance,"Bromance? Putin and Kim take on the world, critics fear Ukraine war has boosted alliance","Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow Brent Sadler expects North Korea to launch another missile test as President Biden finishes his visit to Japan. On Sunday, North Korean President Kim Jong Un sent a ""warm"" message to Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulating him on Russia’s National Day, a holiday that marks Russia’s independence from the , according to both countries' state news agencies. , The Korean leader expressed ""full support"" to the Russian president, the ""friendly"" Moscow government, and the Russian people, praising Putin for his ""leadership and great success in carrying out the just cause of protecting justice and his country’s dignity and security,"" in an apparent reference to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin and Kim Jong Un's relationship has become closer. Kim’s gesture on Sunday is the latest sign of a deepening relationship between the two countries, which view the United States as their mortal enemy and which both present a serious and deeply frightening nuclear threat to the United States. The ties between Kim and Putin have been growing for the past several years, but since Moscow launched its military offensive against Ukraine, the relationship appears to be strengthening and has the potential to turn into a long-term partnership of a strategic nature. Both Russia and North Korea are under severe economic sanctions because of their disruptive geopolitical behavior. 9 : ? Russian Army soldiers stand in a military vehicle rolling during a dress rehearsal for the Victory Day military parade in Moscow, Russia, Saturday, May 7, 2022. On May 9, Russia’s Victory Day, which marks ’s defeat of Nazi Germany, Kim also sent a congratulatory note to Putin expressing ""decisive solidarity"" with Russian efforts to eliminate ""political and military threats and blackmail by hostile forces."" This was most likely a reference to the West’s placing what is seen as ""draconian economic sanctions"" on Russia. On May 26, Russia joined China in vetoing a U.S.-sponsored U.N. Security Council resolution proposing new sanctions on North Korea over its resumption of missile tests. Russia and North Korea are two of the key four state actors that present top security threats to the United States, a group that also includes China and Iran, according to the 2022 annual Threat Assessment by the . Both Russia and North Korea view nuclear use as a viable option to deter the United States from what Moscow and Pyongyang perceive as meddling with their domestic affairs in pursuit of their national interests. They each view the United States as their top threat. Both Kim and Putin have combative personal styles and seem to enjoy provoking Washington, as Moscow and Pyongyang seek to challenge U.S. global dominance. Russia has a formidable nuclear arsenal, rivaling that of the United States. It has ratcheted up frequent nuclear threats amidst its brutal war on Ukraine, signaling its potential use if either the U.S. or intervene as active combatants on behalf of Ukraine. It’s also quite probable that North Korea has some 45 nuclear warheads, according to Dr. Siegfried Hecker, a prominent U.S. expert on the country's nuclear program. Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un pose for photographers during their meeting in Vladivostok, Russia, Thursday, April 25, 2019. Pyongyang recently has stepped up its missile testing, having conducted 31 tests this year already, compared with eight in all of 2021. In May, North Korea launched a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile , in addition to two shorter-range missiles, just hours after President Biden departed from South Korea. On June 5, North Korea fired another eight short-range missiles, the most it has launched in a single day. Days later, the Biden administration warned that North Korea was capable of carrying out a seventh nuclear test ""at any time."" In addition to increasing the pace of test missile launches, Kim’s forces broadened the variety of the missiles fired this year - short-range, intermediate-range, long-range missiles capable of reaching the continental United States, and tactical missiles—as well as submarine-launched, train-launched, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. : According to corporation, which assists the U.S. government with technical analysis, North Korea is on track to obtain 200 nuclear warheads within a few years, making it a mid-level nuclear power. Kim’s apparent decision to accelerate his nuclear program may have stemmed from his observation of the U.S. and ’s reluctance to engage militarily on behalf of Ukraine because of the fear of Russia’s employment of tactical nuclear weapons to thwart such Western intervention. Kim’s ultimate goal is a robust nuclear weapons delivery system that can be mated with warheads that can target the U.S. homeland, with the intent of deterring the United States from ever attacking North Korea. His secondary objective is to demonstrate to South Korea and U.S. regional allies that Washington will face a tough choice of sacrificing one of its own cities if it decides to intervene against a North Korean attack. Sharing a border with North Korea, Russia is not thrilled with Pyongyang becoming a nuclear state, but it understands that expecting Kim to abandon his nuclear ambitions is unrealistic. The Biden administration appears to be ill-prepared to deter either of the highly risk-tolerant leaders from using nuclear weapons. U.S. warnings of a ""swift and forceful response"" in the event of an expected seventh nuclear test by Pyongyang, or if Russia uses atomic weapons in Ukraine are unlikely to change Putin’s and Kim’s plans and behavior. The U.S.’s nuclear modernization appears to be behind what is required to protect the homeland from the North Korean nuclear threat. Air Force Gen. Glen Van Herck, the head of the U.S. Northern Combatant Command , which is in charge of defending the U.S. and Canada from missile attacks, has warned that ""going forward, I do believe that [the North Koreans] could exceed my capacity and capabilities."" Meantime, Moscow has conducted nuclear mock-attacks on the U.S. homeland. - In this file photo taken from a video distributed by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service, on Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2020, a rocket launches from missile system as part of the drills, a ground-based intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Plesetsk facility in northwestern Russia. While neither Russia nor North Korea have actionable plans to attack the United States in a surprise ""bolt out of the blue sky"" strike, both envision employing nuclear weapons to deter the United States from attacking them, or if it intervenes directly on behalf of Ukraine and South Korea, in a regional conflict. Russia has already operationalized a limited nuclear warfare doctrine that envisions a detonation of a low-yield tactical nuclear warhead to signal to the U.S. and its resolve to climb the escalation ladder to achieve its objectives on the battlefield. Recently North Korean officials also indicated a willingness to use small-sized tactical nuclear weapons, making the Putin-Kim partnership a grave concern. In addition to posing a serious nuclear danger, Russia and North Korea have launched cyber-attacks on the United States and conduct cyber espionage. In recent years, Moscow has escalated cyberwarfare on U.S. soil, having struck various sectors of the economy and our critical infrastructure, including nuclear facilities, and the beating heart of the U.S. government: the White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon. North Korean cyber-crime has been ""extensive and long-running,"" and the range of these crimes is ""staggering,"" as described by government officials."" Russia has the most formidable foreign arsenal of cyber weapons. Although North Korean cyber tools are not as sophisticated, they are capable of inflicting serious damage. Consistent with Kim’s vision of cyber as ""all-purpose sword,"" Pyongyang’s military intelligence hackers have conducted ransomware attacks, phishing campaigns, digital bank heists and money laundering operations. Putin and Kim will almost certainly use their growing relationship to challenge U.S. policies, especially since both feel that Washington is responsible for devastating damage to their economies because of sanctions. Moscow believes that the U.S. seeks Russia’s destruction and regime collapse, based on several statements from Biden administration officials who indicated that U.S. goals in the Ukraine conflict are to defeat Russia, degrade its military, and weaken its economy. In his congratulatory message to Putin on Sunday, Kim expressed confidence that the relations between Russia and North Korea will only deepen, calling them ""tactical-strategic collaboration"" for the cause of defending global justice."" As the Russia-Ukraine war drags on, the danger from this combined nuclear and cyber threat is only likely to deepen.",5

The shift left, analysts claim, could be yet another foreign policy headache for the Biden administration. Petro is a former guerilla leader. His victory will change politics domestically, and the balance of power in Latin America as it adds to a wave of triumphs by the left in the region. Brazil could be the next triumph for the socialists if Lula da Silva wins in that country’s election in October. This would strengthen a leftist bloc whose pro-Russia and China sentiment and decidedly antagonistic views against the United States, should be a concern for the Biden and future U.S. administrations. Former rebel Gustavo Petro, left, his wife Veronica Alcocer, back center, and his running mate Francia Marquez, celebrate before supporters after winning a runoff presidential election in Bogota, Colombia, Sunday, June 19, 2022. Joseph Humire, executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society warns: ""The victory of Gustavo Petro in Colombia consolidates the gains of the Latin American left over the last decade. But while the Biden administration may sympathize with the leftist political agenda of a new President Petro, the U.S. should pay close attention to any potential authoritarian actions or efforts by the new Colombian government to dismantle, hijack or polarize democratic institutions in the country under the guise of constitutional reform."" The praise coming in from the continent’s socialist leaders was fast. Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro was quick to congratulate Petro and his running mate. ""I congratulate Gustavo Petro and Francia Márquez for their historic victory in the Presidential elections in Colombia. The will of the Colombian people, who came out to defend the path of democracy and peace, was heard. New times are in sight for this sister country."" V Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president, was one of the first leaders to congratulate Gustavo Petro on his win. Maduro’s comments were echoed by Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel: ""I express my most fraternal congratulations to Gustavo Petro for his election as President of Colombia in a historic popular victory. We reiterate willingness to advance in the development of bilateral relations for the well-being of our peoples."" 'T , Mexican president Andres Lopez Obrador, who just two weeks ago snubbed the U.S. by refusing to attend the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, said in a statement: ""Gustavo Petro's triumph is historic. Colombia's conservatives have always been tenacious and tough. The writer José María Vargas Vila recounted that the dictators of his country ‘dipped their daggers in holy water before killing...’ Today's triumph may be the end of that curse and the dawn for that brotherly and worthy people. Congratulations."" Lopez-Obrador will be visiting the White House next month. Colombian analyst Jose Penso, a former president of the Colombian Association of Political Consultants, urged caution and told Fox News Digital: ""It is time to wait for the tone of the Petro government in relation to the United States. He arrives with a commitment to unite the country through consensus, trying to appear less radical because he has been supported by groups on the center. It is still very uncertain and only with time will the tone of its relationship with the United States be seen."" During his victory speech, president-elect Petro said: ""Thanks to the strength of past generations who are no longer with us today we are the sum of resistance, of a past of struggle and rebellion against injustice and a world that discriminates."" ‘,’ Observers said that evidence that democracy in Colombia continues to be solid was Petro’s opponent Rodolfo Hernandez’s immediate response conceding defeat and congratulating the president-elect: ""I called Gustavo to congratulate him on his victory and offered my support to fulfill the promises of change for which Colombia voted today. Colombia will always count on me."" A woman cleans the capital's main voting center in preparation of the presidential runoff election in Bogota, Colombia, Friday, June 17, 2022. According to The Associated Press, Petro will have a tough time delivering on his promises as he does not have a majority in Congress, which is key to carrying out reforms. In recent legislative elections, Petro’s political movement won 20 seats in the Senate, a plurality, but he would still have to make concessions in negotiations with other parties. Yet despite the initial coming together of both candidates for president, one former president of Colombia Alvaro Uribe, whom Petro considers a political enemy, tweeted: ""To defend democracy, it is necessary to abide by it. Gustavo Petro is the President. Let a feeling guide us: Colombia First."" Critics and political opponents are afraid that Petro will still try to radicalize and move to an extreme left position. Argentina-based analyst Agustin Antonetti of the Fundación Libertad told Fox News Digital: ""The triumph of Gustavo Petro is the missing piece, perhaps the most worrying, of this new reconfiguration in Latin America, leaning towards a new wave of leftist governments."" Antonetti continued, ""A region that is in alarming political and economic decline, in a complex global context, with three terrible dictatorships that seem more alive than ever and surrounded by a large number of populist leaders, now in power, who they endorse them and are ready for anything. The big question is: Will the institutions in Latin America resist this new wave of governments in a clear rise of authoritarianism?""

Medina told Fox News Digital, ""The American beacon of light and freedom must shine brighter."" He said, ""President Biden has yet to face his hardest challenges of a full-scale China, Iran and Russia to overtake the last spaces left up in Latin America by absent U.S. policies and actions."" The former Venezuelan diplomat said that ""a pale economic future looms in the last moves of the geopolitical chess In the words of Ronald Reagan, ‘freedom and liberty are one generation away from extinction.’ Let us pray that this is not the generation that allows it to happen."" Gustavo Petro received 50.47% of the votes defeating his rival Rodolfo Hernández who obtained 47.27%. The leftist candidate, who for a long time said that there was no democracy in his country, wins an election that showed democracy does indeed exist and works, observers say the Biden administration must keep a very careful watch as Petro begins his term as president on Aug. 7.

A spokesperson for Heritage Auctions, which handled the sale, could not confirm the identity of the buyer but said the winning bid was made by proxy. The $103.5 million sale translates to $100 million Swiss francs, hinting that the buyer is from overseas. ""I was hoping that there was going to be an enormous amount of solidarity, but I was not expecting this to be such a huge amount,"" Muratov said in an interview after bidding in the nearly 3-week auction ended on World Refugee Day. Previously, the most ever paid for a Nobel Prize medal was $4.76 million in 2014, when James Watson, whose co-discovery of the structure of earned him a Nobel Prize in 1962, sold his. Three years later, the family of his co-recipient, Francis Crick, received $2.27 million in bidding also run by Heritage Auctions. : Muratov, who was awarded the gold medal in October 2021, helped found the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta and was the publication’s editor-in-chief when it shut down in March amid the Kremlin’s clampdown on journalists and public dissent in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It was Muratov’s idea to auction off his prize, having already announced he was donating the accompanying $500,000 cash award to charity. Muratov has said the proceeds will go directly to in its efforts to help children displaced by the war in Ukraine. Just minutes after bidding ended, told the auction house it had already received the funds. Online bids had begun June 1 to coincide with the International Children’s Day observance. Many bids came by telephone or online. The winning bid, tendered by telephone, catapulted the bidding from the low millions to astronomical levels. Dmitry Muratov auctioned his Nobel Prize for Ukrainian child refugees. Muratov had left Russia on Thursday to begin his trip to New York City, where live bidding began Monday evening. 'S Early Monday, the high bid was only $550,000. The purchase price had been expected to spiral upward — but not over $100 million. ""I can’t believe it. I’m awestruck. Personally, I’m flabbergasted. I’m stunned. I don’t really know what happened in there,"" said Joshua Benesh, the chief strategy officer for Heritage Auctions. ""We knew that there was a tremendous groundswell of interest in the last couple of days by people who were moved by Dimitry’s story, by Dimitry’s act of generosity, that the global audience was listening tonight,"" he said. Muratov and Heritage officials said even those out of the bidding can still help by donating directly to . Muratov shared the Nobel Peace Prize last year with journalist Maria Ressa of the Philippines. The two journalists, who each received their own medals, were honored for their battles to preserve free speech in their respective countries, despite coming under attack by harassment, their governments and even death threats. Melted down, the 175 grams of 23-karat gold contained in Muratov’s medal would be worth about $10,000.

Daniel Davis discussed President Biden's measures against Russia in Ukraine, and how Russia holds an ""overwhelming"" advantage in the war on ""Jesse Watters Primetime."" . . : I don't even think it's a long shot. I think when you look at the military fundamentals, just what has historically always been the difference between winning and losing, and when you look at the balance of power, especially the forces on the ground, they are overwhelmingly in favor of Russia. There is no rational basis upon which to hope that the war can turn around because Russia is methodically moving through and destroying the Ukrainian armed forces in the Donbas, more than capturing territory, they're destroying their ability to defend the country anywhere else. And even the sum total of all of the weapons that we have pledged, much less has shown up — it's barely a 10th of what would be the minimum necessary. And when you look at those two things right there alone, there is no rational path to a victory for Ukraine. ‘’ And therefore, even the path that we want to harm Russia is a temporary one, a short-term one, but it comes at a profound cost, like you say, to the Ukrainian people in their country, in their livelihood and in their armed forces.

We wanted to get pictures of farmers bringing in the wheat harvest. I was having doubts the farmers would do any work after the meeting, and a whole day would be wasted. I stood apart from the crowd under a tree, trying not to get sunburned.

In recent weeks, the government of President Guillermo Lasso has faced increased protests over demands to reduce the prices on certain products. Some observers claim the protesters are seeking to destabilize and overthrow the Lasso government. The protests have been mostly led by Indigenous groups who blame the government for not complying with their demand to reduce fuel prices, control prices on agricultural products and set a larger budget for education. But some conservative analysts say this is just an excuse to stage a coup against the government because leftist groups want to take power at any price. Demonstrators protest against the government of President Guillermo Lasso and rising fuel prices in Quito, Ecuador, Tuesday, June 21, 2022. Ecuador's defense minister warned Tuesday that the country's democracy was at risk as demonstrations turned increasingly violent in the capital. Experts say that reports that the government might have to close down the country’s oil wells due to the unrest won't have much impact outside of Ecuador. ""Ecuador produces less than half a million barrels of oil per day, so it can hardly influence the world price of oil. But oil and derivatives constitute more than half of Ecuadorian exports. Fuel prices are global but here they are subsidized and that is what they are negotiating now: the size of the subsidy. In Latin America, only Venezuela subsidizes them more than Ecuador,"" explained Ecuadorian analyst Gabriela Calderón, a research associate at the Cato Institute. ‘,’ Calderón told Fox News Digital from Guayaquil that, ""There are three problems: drug penetration, radicalization of the indigenous political leadership, and the largest block in the national assembly are correistas: always looking for an excuse to destabilize any government that is not theirs. They all want to overthrow the president."" Correistas are supporters of former president Rafael Correa. Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso and U.S. President Joe Biden attend a working luncheon with other heads of state during the 9th Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, California, June 10, 2022. Analysts say the political crisis and rioting has put the pro-U.S. government of President Guillermo Lasso at risk of falling. A former banker, the conservative Lasso, won last year's presidential election against his leftist opponent who was close to former president Correa. Gustavo Izurieta, a research fellow at Instituto Ecuatoriano de Economía Política explains: ""This political crisis has its genesis in drug trafficking. The drugs that go to the United States go by speedboats from the coast of Ecuador to the coast of Central America. That is one route and another is from Ecuadorian ships with export products to Europe."" Izurieta claimed that: ""There was a very strong complicity between the previous governments that were quite close to these leftist movements financed by drug trafficking."" He said symbolic drug seizures from previous governments, have changed to much larger and significant ones under Lasso’s administration. - Observers say that former leftist president Rafael Correa, who left office in 2017, is a fierce opponent of the present government and still maintains enormous influence and seeks to return to power at any price, and the radicalization of the indigenous group protesting, known as is one of his strategies to take power. One business official, who didn’t want to be named, said the violence in the streets is part of the strategy leftist radical groups use to blame the government for supposedly repressing the citizens. ""The streets are not as convulsed as the press and social media report. Most protests are in the capital Quito."" So far, seven protesters have died since the riots started earlier this month. : ‘ ’ Oswaldo Toscano a political analyst and university professor noted that ""since 2017, an institutional crisis triggered an economic and social crisis,"" he said. ""An aggressive economic policy to cut social spending reduced budgets in health and education. The pandemic contained but did not eliminate the risk of a latent social explosion. What is not resolved in politics is resolved in the streets. Lasso continued with the aggressive cut to social issues and that produced today's social outburst. People in the streets not only support the demands, but also want the impeachment of president Lasso."" Lasso who is facing one of the most decisive moments since he took office said: ""Ecuadorians who seek dialogue will find a government with an outstretched hand, those who seek chaos, violence and terrorism will face the full force of the law,"" he said, emphasizing that the country must return to normality. According to The Associated Press, the Indigenous confederation criticized the announcement and said in a press release that it shows that the government is not sympathetic to the millions of people in poverty in Ecuador. President of Ecuador Guillermo Lasso looks on during the meeting with transport union members as part of the fourth day of national strike to protest against policies of President Lasso on June 15, 2022 in Quito, Ecuador. On Saturday, president Guillermo Lasso lifted a state of emergency he imposed in six provinces after government officials held initial talks with protest leaders. It also comes as lawmakers discuss an opposition request to remove Lasso from office amid the strike, which has caused food shortages and hurt the economy. ""As the region turns to the left, Ecuador remains one of the main allies of the United States in Latin America. The collaboration between the two governments has become very strong, and a departure of president Lasso would mean that Ecuador, under the influence of the ""correistas,"" would return to the orbit of China and Russia. Those of us who believe in the West are convinced that it is better to be with the United States and the European Union than with Russia and China, which have other geopolitical interests and ambitions,"" noted Izuriet. José Isidro Morante, an analyst and partner with the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Economia Politica , told Fox News Digital that important decisions need to be made in order to revitalize the economy. Morante claimed that this was ""because the powerful groups put pressure, for example, only super gasoline could be freed from the subsidy, however the prices of other fuels cannot be freed because these powerful groups are the main beneficiaries of cheap fuel. Drug traffickers use fuel as a raw material, the indigenous have groups that smuggle cheap fuel to Peru and Colombia, they also use it for their artisanal and polluting mining extractions."" Observers believe the next few days will be crucial in defining the country’s future path and warned that Washington must keep a close watch on the outcome.",22

Wray’s warning comes just months after the Biden Justice Department, which oversees the , ended the Trump-era ""China Initiative"" program aimed at preventing spying by the Chinese Communist Party. The Biden administration, instead, replaced it with a broader approach to counter ""nation-state threats."" Wray, during a speech focused on ""common threats"" the U.S. and the United Kingdom face at the 5 building in London Wednesday, said the has ""no closer partner than 5"" and the two agencies work together on ""almost every mission"" they confront, from ""countering terrorism to cybertheft and transnational repression to espionage."" Wray pointed to the ""complex, enduring and pervasive danger"" that China poses to both nations, and other Western allies.

""The Chinese government is set on stealing your technology – whatever it is that makes your industry tick – and using it to undercut your business, and dominate your market,"" Wray said. ""And they’re set on using every tool at their disposal to do it."" Wray warned that Beijing uses intelligence officers to target valuable private sector information, multiplying their efforts by working extensively through scores of ""co-optees,"" people who aren’t technically Chinese government officials but assist in intelligence operations. But it isn’t just large corporations China is keen on targeting. Wray said the ""wants to target companies in big cities to small towns, from Fortune 100s to start-ups,"" specifically those in aviation, artificial intelligence and pharmaceuticals. Wray said the has ""even caught people affiliated with Chinese companies out in the U.S. heartland, sneaking into fields to dig up proprietary, genetically modified seeds, which would have cost them nearly a decade and billions in research to develop themselves.""

Meanwhile, Wray also warned of China interfering in elections, pointing to one example in New York this spring. ""The Chinese government went so far as directly interfering in a congressional election in New York, because they did not want the candidate – a Tiananmen Square protester and critic of the Chinese government – to be elected."" ' ' 'S '' , Wray detailed their efforts, including the hiring a private investigator to dig up derogatory info and derail the candidate's campaign. ""But when they couldn't find anything, they decided to manufacture a controversy using a sex worker, and when that didn't work out, they even suggested using violence, such as arranging for the candidate to be struck by a vehicle and making it look like an accident,"" Wray explained.

""When it comes to the threat against Taiwan… I’m confident in saying that China is drawing all sorts of lessons from what’s happening with Russia and its invasion of Ukraine,"" Wray said, noting that the has seen China ""looking for ways to insulate their economy against potential sanctions"" to protect themselves from ""harm if they do anything to draw the ire of the international community."" ""In our world, we call that kind of behavior a clue,"" Wray said. Wray warned that ""if China does invade Taiwan,"" Western allies could see ""supply chains and relationships disrupted.""

""All of us in America, in the U.K., and across the free world, are in this together,"" Wray said. ""And together, we’re an awfully formidable team."" , ' ' As for Taiwan, in March, the intelligence community annual threat assessment was released with data through January. It warned that China is increasingly a ""near-peer competitor, challenging the United States in multiple arenas – especially economically, militarily and technologically – and is pushing to change global norms and potentially threatening its neighbors.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, June 5, 2019. ""Beijing will press Taiwan to move toward unification and will react to what it views as increased U.S.–Taiwan engagement,"" the states. ""We expect that friction will grow as China continues to increase military activity around the island and Taiwan’s leaders resist Beijing’s pressure for progress toward unification."" In April, Director William Burns issued a similar warning to Wray’s – also noting that China has been ""a silent partner"" in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. Burns, at the time, said China is ""in many ways, the most profound tests the has ever faced,"" calling China a ""formidable competitor lacking in neither ambition nor capability.""

The brother of former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who has been imprisoned in a Russian labor camp since his 2018 arrest on espionage charges, pleaded with President Biden to take diplomatic action on behalf of his family and help bring his brother home. The White House announced Wednesday that Biden has been in contact with the wife of Brittney Griner, a two-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist who is facing up to 10 years in a Russian jail for allegedly trying to bring vape cartridges containing oils derived from cannabis through a Moscow airport. Dave Whelan told ""America Reports"" on Thursday that while he is ""thrilled"" Biden is working with Griner's wife to secure a safe release for a wrongful U.S. detainee, he wonders why his family was not also given the opportunity to discuss his brother's case with the president. Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was arrested for alleged spying, listens to the verdict in a courtroom at the Moscow City Court in Moscow, Russia, June 15, 2020. ""There has been an uncertainty among wrongfully detained families about what we are supposed to be doing,"" Whelan said. ""We heard from the State Department at one point a few weeks ago, maybe a month ago, that we needed to make more noise, we needed to raise more awareness around Paul's case because there were certain parts of the U.S. government or agencies that were not getting on board for trying to solve wrongful detention cases."" ""And so you hear things like that from the State Department,"" he continued. ""Or back when Trevor Reed was released, you hear the meeting that they had with President Biden was what sort of helps get that verdict to happen, and it makes you wonder as a family, what on earth you are supposed to be doing in order to be getting the U.S. government to act."" , Paul Whelan, who was arrested in December 2018, has said that he was set up, that a person he considered a friend handed him a drive allegedly containing vacation photos. Minutes later Russian authorities stormed his hotel room, claiming that the drive contained a list of names of those working at a classified security agency. Whelan and his family maintain his innocence, saying that he was only in Russia at the time of his arrest to attend the wedding of a friend from his time in the Marines. Dave said his brother has been serving his sentence in a Russian labor camp, where he has been repeatedly denied any medical treatment. Paul Whelan, a former marine accused of espionage and arrested in Russia in December 2018, stands inside a defendants' cage as he waits to hear his verdict in Moscow on June 15, 2020.

""The sanctions are starting to bite because they don’t have textiles to actually make anything, and then the corruption that we thought might be going away seems to still be there."" The Whelan family managed to send Paul Theraflu, but Dave said there is a small chance he will get it unless he ""bribes the guard who holds on to it."" The Whelans have had regular conversations with various contacts in the State Department throughout the ordeal, but no significant action has been taken on behalf of their brother, Dave said. ""It’s time to take action,"" he demanded. ""I think what we’re finding is that although the Russian government is horribly corrupt, the U.S. doesn't seem to have found a concession that that corrupt government would want, and it’s surprising to me that they haven’t been able to bring Paul and perhaps Ms. Griner home as well.""

Phoenix Mercury player Brittney Griner continues to languish in Russian custody because President Biden and his administration lack the ""gravitas"" of Donald Trump – who saw several foreign-held U.S. nationals released, ex- officer Buck Sexton said. Griner pleaded guilty to the charges against her but said she did not intentionally break the law prohibiting the contraband – vape cartridges containing hashish oil – in the Russian Federation. Sexton and his ""Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show"" co-host, Outkick founder Clay Travis, told Fox News that Griner could be home by now if the White House was operated differently. ""We just have to add 'foreign policy' and ‘clout on the foreign stage’ to the areas of utter failure of the Biden administration,"" Sexton said, adding President Obama chose Biden as his 2008 running mate due to his concentration in foreign policy – which the radio host added led to ""disaster.""

Sexton cited reports the attorney for U.S.-held Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout claimed Moscow will agree to swap Griner for the man known as the ""Merchant of Death"" if prompted. ""That would be quite a move. But from the Biden administration, would it be surprising? I don't think so,"" he said. Bout is serving 25 years on convictions of conspiracy to use anti-aircraft missiles, conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and conspiracy to kill United States nationals. Sexton said he wants all captive Americans home, not just Griner – pointing to Paul Whelan, who has toiled in a Russian labor camp since 2018. Viktor Bout in 2010. ""The Biden administration doesn't have what it takes to negotiate this deal – obviously doesn't have the kind of personal gravitas, with Vladimir Putin that would help move the needle. And the Russians know this."" Russia's knowledge of Biden's incompetence, he suggested, is another reason Bout entered the conversation. Travis later said the ""double standard"" at play with Griner is that Trump would have likely already secured her release, citing cases including the basketball players in China and rapper A$ Rocky in Sweden. Griner, 31, said in her letter to Biden that his candidacy was her first-ever vote, adding: ""I realize you are dealing with so much, but please don't forget about me and the other American detainees."" On Thursday, Travis questioned whether Griner now regrets her 2020 vote. ""Donald Trump would have had her back more than Biden has,"" he said. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

However, the actor saw a different side of Putin when he joined him on a trip to St. Petersburg to visit a home for children suffering from incurable cancer. ""I looked over at Vladimir, and I could see somebody that was genuinely concerned about where we were and someone who was empathetic, and he was there for a sincere reason,"" Rourke told Morgan. : - 'T A The idea that the same man is single-handedly responsible for the tragedies and lives lost in Ukraine ""blows my mind,"" Rourke said, adding that he wished a ""little bell would ring in [Putin’s] head or his heart and he’d wake up and just stop all this sh--."" , - 16: Actor Mickey Rourke arrives at the premiere of Open Road's ""Triple 9"" at Regal Cinemas L.A.

Schools are getting targeted, hospitals are getting targeted. All that sh--'s not right,"" he said. Rourke became tearful as he recalled seeing a particularly haunting photo of an older man who had lost five family members in the war and was left with only his pet cat. ""The image that bothered me the most,"" he said. ""I saw this old man old and a little gray kitten and the old man survived his house being bombed,"" Rourke said. ""He lost five family members and the only thing he had, it’s kind of hard for me to talk about it, the only thing he had was this little gray kitty. I looked at that image … and I said how can I have anything to worry about? Losing a movie? Or I’m having a bad day?""

""No, I don’t think it was alarmist. I’m a big believer in better safe than sorry,"" Adams said at an unrelated news conference on Tuesday. ""I take my hat off to . This was right after the attacks in Ukraine, and took a very proactive step to say let’s be prepared. It doesn’t mean just a nuclear attack."" ""It’s any natural disaster. Pack a bag. Know where your medicines are located. These are just smart things to do. Many of us, we think about , and other things that have been on the forefront, but we’re still one of the top terrorist threats,"" Adams said at the event hosted to announce a lawsuit against an illegal short-term rental operation in New York City. ""There are no imminent threats to the city that we know about,"" he added. ""But we always have to be prepared as New Yorkers, and I think did the right thing. We’re always going to be proactive – not panicked – be we’re going to be prepared."" ? New York City Mayor Eric Adams listens to a question about the Office of Emergency Management's recent Nuclear Preparedness during an unrelated press conference about illegal short-term rentals. In releasing its ""Nuclear Preparedness "" Monday via YouTube, New York City’s Office of Emergency Management stressed that ""while the likelihood of a nuclear weapon incident occurring in/near is very low, it is important New Yorkers known the steps to say safe."" The 1:31 video begins with sirens blaring in a digitized cityscape. A woman dressed in all black then appears, stating, ""So there’s been a nuclear attack."" ""Don’t ask me how or why.

The woman advises viewers, their friends and family to get inside fast, stressing that staying in a car is not an option. She instructs viewers to stay inside and shut all doors and windows. Anyone who was outside during the blast should get clean immediately and remove and bag all outer clothing to keep all radioactive dust or ash away from your body.

American country music artist John Rich was one major critic to question the timing of the . Office of Emergency Management lists steps to take in the event of a nuclear attack, including to stay indoors and away from windows.

2022-07-13,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-most-dishonest-people-yelling-loudest-war-russia,Tucker Carlson: The most dishonest people are yelling loudest for a war with Russia,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out the Biden administration for sending billions of dollars to Ukraine while Americans suffer with record-high inflation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' When we say good evening, we mean it and tonight, we want to send a special, as they say on talk radio, shout out to our most loyal and faithful viewers. We love you. We appreciate you. In fact, we think of you as all little tacos and your children as taquitos and not just tacos and taquitos, but also enchiladas and chalupas and everything else on the Taco Bell menu. That's how we think of you. So, the good news is America at this stage is getting a lot more amusing. The bad news is it's also getting a little scary. So today, in the second category, the government announced that inflation has once again set a year-over-year record. But now we're used to this. If you buy anything, you already knew it was happening. Boy, did you. But there were parts of today's Labor Department report that were not expected by anyone. In fact, they were bizarre. They seemed to defy the most basic rules of economics, but first, here are the raw numbers. This is from a Fox News report today. , : Inflation cranked up a whopping 9.1% in June, the highest yearly jump since 1981. The Consumer Price Index, released Wednesday morning, showed the price of necessities far outpacing raises. The price of gas is up almost 60% year over year. Rent went up 5.6% over last June and food at home and dining out, increasing 10.4%. If you break it down to just groceries, the annual jump was 12.2%. That includes eggs up 33% and butter up 26%. So, the biggest annual spike in inflation in more than 40 years. That's the headline. But if anything, it understates what's actually going on. The reality of it is worse than that. During the Carter years, when inflation famously hit 14.6%, wages were still going up. As Pew put it in a recent analysis, ""During the high inflation years of the 1970s and early 1980s, average wages commonly jumped seven, eight, even 9% year over year"" and that makes sense. There's more money in circulation. It's worth less, but there's more of it. But that is not what is happening right now and that's the weird thing. 'S ' ' A . According to the Labor Department report today, ""Real average hourly earnings decreased 3.6%, seasonally adjusted from June 2021 to June 2022. The change in real average hourly earnings, combined with a decrease of 0.9% of the average workweek, resulted in a 4.4% decrease in real average weekly earnings over this period."" 4.4% average decrease in earnings. This is what economic disaster looks like. Americans are making less money at exactly the moment when everything they buy from gas to groceries is more expensive and not just a little more expensive, a lot more expensive. Here's the big picture. The average American household income this year is about $87,000. Today's inflation numbers means the average household is losing nearly $8,000 a year just from inflation. By the way, that's using the government's cooked numbers, the 9.1% inflation number, which is derived from the intentionally deceptive consumer price index , so the real number is actually higher than that. Rising inflation with falling wages. This is very bad, and as we said, it's also very weird. How weird? Well, here's one measure of the strangeness. The price of gas is now much cheaper in Mexico than it is in the United States, and that's why so many Californians are now driving across the border to fill their cars. 'S '' : ''S A ' Now, why is this happening? That does not make sense. Oil prices set on the international market. But apart from a few outlier websites like ZeroHedge, which not coincidentally the left is always trying to shut down and censor, no one seems to be asking that question. We do know that gas prices in Mexico are so cheap that the Mexican government is encouraging more Americans to cross the border to refuel their cars. ""Right now,"" said the president of Mexico this week, ""a gallon of regular cost $4.78 average on your side of the border, while in Mexico, it cost $3.12."" So, you have to ask yourself if we're paying more for gas because of Putin's price hike, why isn't Mexico paying more for gas because of Putin, too? Why is inflation up when wages are down? This doesn't make any sense. So, if you want to answer those questions, you really have to look at government spending. Last month, Mexico's government did not follow the Biden administration's lead in sending the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. They did not do that. Instead, here's what Mexico did. They spent $2 billion in subsidies to keep gas prices lower for consumers. In other words, the government of Mexico in the middle of a drug war is taking better care of its citizens than Joe Biden is taking care of his citizens and that is shameful, but it doesn't mean Joe Biden is ignoring the needy. In the very same month, the gas prices shot beyond the reach of people, people aren't taking trips because of gas prices, Joe Biden, in the name of democracy, signed a $40 billion aid package, not for you or any other American, but for Ukraine and that money, Joe Biden says, is just the beginning. It's part of our unlimited commitment to funding Ukraine's corrupt and authoritarian government. Here's Biden. , , : ' ' U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during an event to celebrate passage of the ""Safer Communities Act,"" on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2022. : ""For as long as it takes."" Does it mean indefinite support from the United States or Ukraine, or will there come a time when you have to say to President Zelenskyy that the United States cannot support his country any longer? Thank you. : We are going to support Ukraine as long as it takes. We are going to stick with Ukraine and all of the allies will stick with Ukraine as long as it takes. : The war has pushed prices up. It could go as high as $200 a barrel, some analysts think. How long is it fair to expect American drivers and drivers around the world to pay that premium for this war? : As long as it takes. Russia cannot, in fact, defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine. Future generations will look at that tape and many tapes like it with their jaws open. As long as it takes! Whatever the cost for Ukraine! As the American economy heads toward total destruction, Ukrainians are dying in large numbers, who's winning? Well, Ukrainian oligarchs, they're getting richer, much richer. Since January of this year, the Biden administration has sent about $8 billion just in so-called security assistance alone to Ukraine. That would include missile systems, howitzers, ammunition, radar systems, etc., etc. $3,400 Now, defense contractors are making a ton from this, and that's why they have lobbied for it so hard, but you have to ask, once we send these weapons to Ukraine, where do they go then? What happens to them? These are sophisticated and deadly weapons systems. Well, no one knows where they go. No one's keeping track. U.S. officials, Biden administration officials have admitted that to The Wall Street Journal and we're quoting: ""Once U.S. equipment material is handed to the Ukrainian government U.S. officials said they have little direct knowledge of where that material goes. They rely instead on the Ukrainian government for such information. The administration has not agreed to allow American military troops to conduct some oversight into that country."" Huh? So, you send billions to Ukraine in the middle of a war, and then you don't bother to find out what happens to it? What will happen to these weapons? Well, the Czech defense minister knows he has said these weapons, some of them will be smuggled out of Ukraine, ""It's hard to avoid trafficking or smuggling. We didn't achieve it in the former Yugoslavia and we probably won't avoid it in Ukraine."" This is lunacy. If you wanted to make Eastern Europe dangerous and unstable for generations, ensure that war continues and many more die, this is exactly what you would do. You would treat Ukraine like we treated Afghanistan, but that's just the beginning of the money we're sending. On top of all of this security assistance, now, the head of , that would be Samantha Power – she's never left, she's still here, amazingly, after wrecking the world – she's announced we're sending $4 billion more to Ukraine to pay off that country's budget deficit. Wouldn't that be nice if Samantha Power decided to pay off our budget deficit, if anyone decided to help us? But no, no one would ever do that. 'S 'T ' ,' Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed into law legislation that could punish journalists with up to 15 years in prison for reporting so-called ""fake"" news about his military invasion of Ukraine. So, your tax dollars are now paying the salaries of Ukrainian government bureaucrats. In all, your Congress has approved more than $50 billion for Ukraine. That includes $7 billion in food assistance and health care, along with $9 billion for economic support, whatever that means. There's also $2 billion for refugee assistance. So, just as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan and I don't know, half a dozen other countries, we're sending bales of $100 bills into a war zone and hoping they find the right pockets. Again, this is nuts. And yet leaders of both parties agree we have to keep doing it, much more of it. Dozens of Democrats in Congress just signed a letter pushing the administration, as if they needed to be pushed, toward the International Monetary Fund, a total of $650 billion in new funding because Ukraine and on top of all of that, Congressman Adam Kinzinger just proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act calling for another hundred million for, ""Ukrainian military pilots and associated personnel."" Kinzinger is the guy who thought the ghost of Kiev was real. Now all of this is necessary. It's mandatory. We must, according to members of both parties, because we must defend democracy. Now we're not picking on Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a Republican state, but we want to show you this tape. He just sat for an interview with Charlie Kirk and explained that we have to send an unlimited amount of money to Ukraine. Why? To ""fight back against communist intrusion for the cause of freedom because Vladimir Putin is evil."" Watch. ' ,' ' ' : What amount of money is too much to send to Ukraine because we just did $1.7 billion more? Where is the line because we're up near $56 billion now? .: Sure. Well, I don't know that the line is a dollar amount, Charlie. I think each request or each requirement, each demand, each circumstance requires its own discovery, if you will. I don't think we should do a whole bunch necessarily at one time. I think that we should do smaller tranches just for the purpose of renegotiating, you know, reassessing. The price of letting Ukraine fall to Russia, to the United States taxpayer and to the cause of liberty, I think is very, very high. Yeah. Fighting the communist menace. These people never update their talking points. Senator Cramer invokes the cause of liberty and that's a phrase we strongly support. That's an idea we strongly support. That's why we're in favor of unfettered free speech. That's why we oppose vaccine mandates. But you have to ask yourself, what does the cause of liberty have to do with Ukraine? Well, very little. Last February, the Ukrainian government shut down opposition media. Then they arrested the leader of the main opposition party. Now, President Zelenskyy has decided to combine all television stations in Ukraine into a state-owned propaganda ministry in order to combat ""misinformation."" Now, what is that? Well, I'll tell you what, it's not. It's not the profile of a free country. Not even close. The cause of liberty. May those words burn in your mouth. ""Oh, but we have to,"" they tell us,"" because Putin is worse. He's the worst person in the world."" He's a communist, says Senator Camer, who plans to conquer the globe. You don't have to like Vladimir Putin to see how absurd this is. Putin's a communist now. Really? How communist is Vladimir Putin? Is Vladimir Putin more or less communist than, say, Sandy Cortez? More or less communist than say Joe Biden's domestic policy team? Is he more committed atheist than they are? Is Putin throwing Americans in jail for attending political rallies at the Capitol? Is he trying to confiscate the rifles from your bedroom? Is he sterilizing children in the name of trans liberation? Whatever his many faults, no, Vladimir Putin is not doing any of that. As for his apparently limitless international ambitions, ask yourself, is Vladimir Putin recolonizing Africa right now? Is Vladimir Putin trying to build military bases in the Caribbean and South America? No, he's not, but another country is. That would be China, Joe Biden's patron. Putin wants Crimea. He may succeed in getting it, but it is China that is on its way to controlling the world. Here's a graphic we saw today that illustrates the point. These are the relative sizes of the players in the global economy. The numbers are from the . As you can see, the world is completely dominated by the economic power of China and the United States. As of today, our two economies roughly equal in size, though thanks to , China is quickly pulling ahead. That is a problem. In fact, that is the biggest problem in the world by far. Nothing comes close because the Chinese empire will not be like our empire at all. So, where's Russia in this? How does it fit in? Well, get your reading glasses, because Russia is a footnote. It's not irrelevant, but it's close to irrelevant.Russia's economy is smaller than Italy's. The Italians, in other words, are in a better position to take over the world than Vladimir Putin is. This entire conversation is insane. Anyone who takes it seriously is a fool, and anyone who doesn't see the red flags is probably dishonest. The most dishonest, the most power-hungry people in the United States are the very ones yelling the loudest for a war with Russia. That would be Joe Biden. That would be Nancy Pelosi. That'd be Chuck Schumer. That'd be Adam Schiff. These are the people telling you that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal bent on world domination. Why are they saying that? Why are you suggesting Vladimir Putin's going to take over Europe? That's not true, but why are they saying it? 40--: ' ' Well, there's a reason, a reason that has precisely nothing to do with saving lives or making Ukraine a better country. Again, red flag, anyone? And yet somehow Republicans don't see it. They don't seem curious about why the worst people in America are for an endless war with Russia. In fact, apart from Marjorie Taylor Greene and a few other Republicans in Congress, they are all in. Whatever Joe Biden wants in Ukraine they support. Here, for example, is Lindsey Graham with his little friend Richard Blumenthal, that would be Connecticut's most famous Vietnam War hero. Here they are together. . : This picture ought to tell you something about America right now. There's bipartisan support to defeat Putin, to call him out as a pariah and a war criminal. . : When we get back, we're going to try to get the Senate, as a whole, to pass the resolution, hopefully leading the way for the administration to label Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism in the category of Iran, Syria and North Korea. : 'T Defeat Putin. Will that improve your life? Is it improving the lives of the Ukrainians right now? No, it's not and yet every person who has been on the wrong side of every foreign policy decision going back 40 years is on the same page and that, of course, would include John Bolton, the former national security adviser, who by the way just admitted on national television that he has personally engineered coups in foreign countries. Wait, we're not for democracy? Apparently not. John Bolton isn't. But wasn't democracy the whole point? Were those coups state-sponsored terror? No one's asking. No one's calling John Bolton a war criminal. Instead, here's what they're saying. , : Biden studiously avoids doing the one thing, though, that could really bring down the price of crude. He needs to arm the Ukrainians to the teeth so they can quickly beat Russia and put the war to bed. Can we make Ukraine safe for agriculture? Sure, but we might have to set up a no-fly zone in the western part of the country, which Biden doesn't want to do. He doesn't want to create a no-fly zone because that's American fighter planes firing at Russian ones and it's a hop, skip and a jump from there, nuclear war. I understand that. By the way, I think there's a very good argument for that, but a no-fly zone is, while extremely risky, it is the best way to get food inflation under control. Wait, what? I tuned in to find out whether I should buy Cisco on the dip and you're a foreign policy expert now. The American economy is in serious trouble. It's heading south faster than anyone anticipated, but instead, you flip on and the geniuses are talking about World War , and they're not the only ones. So, if you want to know how big this has become, how ominous this is, in the absence of attention from the rest of us, we've kind of slept walked up to this point, you should see this. This is from the city of New York, our largest city. This is a public service announcement reminding the 8 million residents of New York they could soon be nuked. : So, there's been a nuclear attack. Don't ask me how or why. Just know that the big one has hit. Okay, so what do we do? Step one: get inside fast. You, your friends, your family, get inside. Stay inside. Shut all doors and windows. Have a basement? Head there. If you were outside after the blast, get clean immediately. Remove and bag all outer clothing to keep radioactive dust or ash away from your body. What? Now, if you were drinking beer and that came on , you'd think maybe she was giving you advice on what to do if your basement floods or if there was a heat wave. Then you get to the part where she says ""radioactive dust"" and you snap to it. Radioactive dust? You're suggesting that someone might lob a nuclear weapon into our largest city? What? Why the chirpy tone? What the hell are you talking about? How do we get so close to nuclear war that the city of New York is telling me to wash the radioactive dust off my pants? This is total lunacy. This is crazy. Why are we doing this? Because Putin's bad and he's going to take over Belgium?",0
2022-07-13,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/progressive-democrats-lose-push-expand-military-abortions-cut-defense-spending,Progressives lose defense bill battle to expand military abortions but win on many 'woke' priorities,"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasts Biden administration and U.S. media after they parrot Chinese propaganda about Shinzo Abe on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Progressive Democrats were sidelined Wednesday in their bid to expand abortion within the military, but Republicans say Congress and the White House are nevertheless successfully prioritizing ""woke ideology"" over national security. Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus moved aggressively in recent days to insert partisan priorities, including abortion, into the National Defense Authorization Act . The must-pass bill sets military policy and spending levels for the Pentagon and other agencies in the country’s national defense infrastructure. ""I’ve said it before, and I’ll keep saying it until our federal budget is equitably distributed,"" said Rep. Barbara Lee, a California Democrat. ""More guns and tanks are of no use to Americans without housing, education or health care."" 'S The Pentagon, headquarters of the Department of Defense. Not everyone agreed, including the majority of Democrats. An amendment to allow abortions to be conducted on military bases was blocked from getting a vote on the floor by the House Rules Committee, a panel closely controlled by the Democratic leadership. Similarly, an amendment that would allow the Pentagon to use tax dollars to fund abortions was also tabled. ""This needs to be bipartisan,"" House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said in explaining the decisions. Progressives, likewise, will likely fail to achieve their long-held goal of cutting defense spending. While two amendments, which would keep defense spending flat at $778 billion or cut it by $100 billion, have been scheduled for a vote, few expect them to pass. The House instead is poised to advance a bill that guarantees nearly $840 billion for the Defense Department — $30 billion more than even the White House initially proposed. Senior Democrats said the boost was required to compensate for rising fuel prices and inflation, as well as the military and economic fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine fundamentally altered what our national security posture and what our defense posture needs to be,"" said House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat. ""It made it more complicated, and it made it more expensive."" U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin delivers a speech as he hosts a meeting of the Ukraine Security Consultative Group at Ramstein Air Base in Ramstein, Germany. Republicans were quick to argue, however, that just because progressives failed to secure wins in the bill does not mean it’s a good deal overall. Many excoriated the bill for indulging ""woke"" ideology, specifically pertaining to climate change and gender. The prioritizes the military transition away from fossil fuels to electric vehicles and earmarks money for allies to bolster ""climate resilience."" It also creates a gender advisory task force within the Pentagon to boost military recruitment among women. And the bill allows the Defense Department's health plan for service members to cover emergency drugs, including medications to induce abortion. Conservatives also note that the $840 billion legislation is crammed with handouts to special interests and other questionable uses of taxpayer money. The bill directs the Defense Department to create a pilot program to research and develop plant-based proteins and other alternatives to meat and poultry. , - Furthermore, the bill creates a special grant program to train foreign militaries on how to recruit women and combat sexual harassment, while allowing the Pentagon to pick up the tab for foreign officers to attend training and conferences on the topic. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican and leading figure within the House Freedom Caucus, complained that the bill did not take measures to prohibit enforcement of President Biden's vaccine mandate for troops. The mandate's implementation has been blocked in the private sector by the Supreme Court. At least 40,000 unvaccinated troops from the Army National Guard alone have been barred from taking part in federally funded exercise maneuvers and drills because of the mandate. ""This mandate is putting our national security at risk for no reason,"" said Rep. Pete Stauber, a Minnesota Republican. President Biden receives a -19 booster shot during an event in the South Court Auditorium on the White House campus on Sept. 27, 2021. While Roy and other members of the conservative Freedom Caucus plan to oppose the bill, most lawmakers will vote for passage. Many are doing so in order to advance the bill into a conference committee where deal makers have to reconcile the House version with one previously approved by the Senate. Rep. Mike Rogers, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said that process would see partisan priorities stripped out for the to secure 10 Senate Republicans needed for passage in the Senate. ""Like previous years, we'll work through those in the conference and weed out the ones that don't need to come back,"" he said.",13

Former player Enes Kanter Freedom said on Friday that he couldn’t believe LeBron James said Brittney Griner should reconsider coming back to the U.S. after being detained in Russia for over 100 days. ""It just makes me really sad and breaks my heart when people take their freedom for granted. So that's why I was like, I was very confused,"" Kanter Freedom told ""America’s Newsroom"" host Bill Hemmer. James was heard in the trailer of his show ""The Shop"" questioning whether the U.S. has the detained superstar’s back and floated the possibility that if he was in her situation he would be wondering whether he would even want to go back to the States. LeBron James #23 of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Enes Kanter #00 of the New York Knicks exchange words in the first half at Madison Square Garden on November 13, 2017 in New York City. James tried to clarify by saying his remarks were not meant to be a knock on ""our beautiful country."" Kanter Freedom was not buying it. : ' ' ""You call it a step back, we call this a walk back,"" he tweeted. ""You are free to leave buddy or you can even volunteer for an exchange for her.

""That was just so, so stupid to say, so I just couldn't believe it."" Kanter Freedom has been an outspoken voice on global issues, particularly aimed at Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who put out a warrant for his arrest over the free-agent player’s ties to Turkish scholar Fethullah Gülen.

2022-07-15,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russian-prisoner-brittney-griner-trend-hostage-diplomacy,Russian prisoner Brittney Griner and the growing trend of hostage diplomacy,"'Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show' hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton sound off on the 'incompetence' of Biden as she and other Americans languish overseas. Bad behavior by the world’s rogue actors has become so shocking that we can lose track of their full array of dirty tricks. So, it is with the age-old practice of hostage-taking, which is staging a comeback. Even one of the world’s most famous women, basketball star Brittney Griner, couldn’t escape the vicious game of hostage diplomacy. Caged since February and possibly facing a decade in prison for allegedly possessing cannabis oil, the Olympian is a pawn in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine as he pushes back at sanctions and his forces battle western weapons. She joins dozens of fellow Americans and many more westerners languishing in captivity. star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is escorted to a courtroom for a hearing, in Khimki outside Moscow, Russia, Thursday, July 7, 2022. It goes far beyond Russia. From Azerbaijan to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela, we see hostages taken again and again as bargaining chips by autocratic regimes. While Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions prohibits this, and democracies have sanctioned Syria’s Assad and Russia’s Putin for their aggression and butchery, hostage diplomacy goes strangely unpunished. Governments tend to buckle in the face of pressure by paying ransom, caving into prisoner swaps that let criminals go free, and other concessions. Indeed, autocrats know democracies are often willing to violate core values to bring home their citizens. As citizens of democracies, when our governments allow this – when we project indifference to fellow citizens stripped of the presumption of innocence – we are in effect supporting the hostage-takers. We should make the practice extremely costly for the perpetrators. basketball superstar Brittney Griner sits inside a defendants' cage during a hearing at the Khimki Court in the town of Khimki outside Moscow on July 15, 2022. We might start by remembering the lessons of the past. In medieval times, high-level hostages were used as collateral to ensure that each side followed through with commitments; we have found other ways to guarantee contracts. Ruthless rulers have also used hostage ransom as a primary financial resource. In the early 1800s, the United States and Sweden fought against four North African states to stop pirates from seizing merchant ships and holding the crews for ransom. ’S ""To the shores of Tripoli,"" the line from the Marines’ Hymn, refers to this war, which followed unfruitful diplomatic efforts by Presidents Jefferson and Adams, when the Barbary rulers miscalculated America’s military capabilities and were defeated, finally putting an end to the piracy. Force works with those who understand only force. As citizens of democracies, when our governments allow this – when we project indifference to fellow citizens stripped of the presumption of innocence – we are in effect supporting the hostage-takers. In modern times, with international law in place but only haphazardly enforced, the taking of hostages has become a weapon of diplomacy. A cheap asymmetrical weapon, rogue regimes can deploy it effectively against the U.S., Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and other powerful nations. Autocratic leaders use their state-controlled media to spin a narrative that justifies the seizing of foreigners, while the news media in democratic countries is compelled to cover the event as a public service, in effect publicizing the demands. Thick-skinned dictators and their henchmen weather the external bad press, while striking fear in the rest of the world and celebrating their impunity to the rule of law. '' - , ' ' ' In 1979, militant Iranian students and their newly installed Islamic Republic enablers stormed the U.S. embassy and took 52 Americans hostage, demanding the return of the Shah to stand trial. The terrorists failed to hang the Shah but did manage to throw the mighty United States into disarray. Emboldened, Iran has played the hostage-taking game ever since. For five years recently, Iran held Britain’s Nazanin Zahari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, on false charges of plotting an overthrow of the government and spying for Israel. While both were released after the U.K. reached a financial settlement, Iran still holds dozens of dual citizens and foreigners on various charges without due process. - : ''S ' Iran may be the most prominent practitioner of hostage-taking statecraft; however, Russia is an active violator well beyond the mighty player now powerless to the whims of the Kremlin. Two former U.S. Marines have been imprisoned on trumped-up charges in the country. Trevor Reed was sentenced to nine years for allegedly assaulting an officer in 2019. U.S. Marine Trevor Reed landed in Texas, April 28, 2022, after a prisoner swap between the U.S. and Russia.

To free Reed, the U.S. was forced to ""trade"" a Russian pilot who was serving a lengthy prison sentence on drug smuggling charges. The other prisoner, Paul Whelan, is serving 16 years on espionage charges. There is a strong suspicion in the intelligence community that Whelan is being held in the hopes of a trade for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. If diplomacy is the only way to win Whelan and Griner’s release, we should hope that any deal that the Biden administration makes would involve painful compromise by the hostage-takers as well. Russia and Iran have taught other countries that they can behave with impunity too. Following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War, Azerbaijan chose to violate a cease-fire agreement with Armenia in which s and civilians were to be released. Armenia promptly set free all Azeri prisoners of war. A year and a half later, Azerbaijan still holds some 40 Armenian soldiers and civilians against their will. Video evidence and testimony has shown that they have endured torture. Human Rights Watch, and the European Parliament has passed a resolution demanding the immediate release of the hostages. So far, Azerbaijan remains committed to the war crime of hostage-taking to exact territorial concessions from Armenia. The growing trend of hostage diplomacy needs to stop. World and business leaders, and all of us as defenders of the free world, should fight back at criminal autocrats through sanctions, boycotts, and international censure. Failing to do so puts us in even greater peril and robs far too many years of their lives. Tolerating this vicious practice diminishes us as citizens as well.",18

Inflation is floating around 8.6 percent according to the latest report by the U.S. Department of Labor – the highest it’s been since 1981. The national average price of a gallon of gasoline is $4.63 – and it’s as high as $6 in California. The Biden administration is hindering new oil production and selling oil from our strategic reserve to other countries. : ‘ , ’ Americans are experiencing once-unthinkable shortages of baby formula, personal hygiene products, fertilizer, and basic pantry staples. The Biden administration is blaming Russia’s war on Ukraine – and doing little to end it. Jan. 23, 2022: Fox News footage shows migrants being released into the . Millions of people are crossing the southern border illegally and meeting virtually no resistance. This disaster is enriching international crime cartels who benefit from illegally trading drugs and human beings. People are dying, children are being sold into sexual slavery, and the administration is doing nothing to secure the border. Speaking of enrichment, Iran is rapidly enriching uranium. Nuclear weapons experts say the world’s largest funder of terrorism is close to having weapons-grade material. The Biden administration is feebly asking Tehran to stop and come back to a flawed deal that would only delay its plans. This list goes on. Now think about each one of these problems and what state they were in two years ago just before Joe Biden took office and Chuck Schumer became Majority Leader in the U.S. Senate. In December 2020, the annual U.S. rate of inflation was 1.4 percent – more than seven percentage points lower. A gallon of gas cost $2.28 on average. America was no longer dependent on hostile foreign nations for energy. America’s only significant shortages included rare earth metals, such as aluminum and silicon, and products made with them. The southern border was secure. U.S. Border Patrol only had 40,565 encounters in December 2020 . The shortage started three months ago, when the found a deadly bacterial contamination which led to a baby formula recall, and shut down a major manufacturing plant. Meanwhile, there was largely peace abroad. Russia had not invaded Ukraine because it could expect a serious reaction from a U.S.-led international community. Bloodshed had largely been staunched in Afghanistan. And Iran was under crippling economic sanctions that hindered its ability to develop nuclear weapons. In other words, things were working. They aren’t working anymore, and there’s a simple reason: Big Government Socialism doesn’t work, and it can’t. As I wrote in my new book, ""Defeating Big Government Socialism:"" ""The core tenets of Big Government Socialism – wealth distribution, woke thought-policing, and dictatorial government control – have become the core tenets of the American Democratic Party. The few moderates who are left are either being coerced to fall in line or pushed out of office by the radical wing, which has taken over."" Big Government Socialism doesn’t work now – and no permutation of socialism ever has. More than any rhetoric or ideological argument, the reality of the last two years has shown that the Democrats’ fanatical belief that gigantic, self-interested, ideologically driven federal bureaucracies cannot solve our problems. In fact, they more often get in the way of the historic success that comes from freedom, local decision-making, and entrepreneurial activity. The Democrats’ attempts to control markets and manage foreign affairs have been disastrous failures. This is because their basic beliefs about how government and society work are just plain wrong. I wrote this book because I think America is again at a critical time for choosing. Down one road is continued decay and decline under Big Government Socialism. Down the other road is a renewal of the American faith in hard work, free enterprise, and problem-solving. I hope you will read my book and start working today to restore an America that works.",22

Imprisoned basketball player Brittney Griner’s guilty plea to drug charges may play a role in speeding up her exit from Russia, but it’s a risky gamble that may have significant downsides, a hostage expert told Fox News Digital. ""I can't say that's the right or the wrong thing to do because, in any event, the Russian system … it's not our system,"" said Hugh Dugan, the acting special envoy for hostage affairs during the Trump administration. ""But that's the gamble based on the direction that her attorneys counsel her. ""To our eyes, it looks like, , this gets her into that status where they can do a [prisoner] swap."" Griner, who pleaded guilty to drug charges July 7, has been held in Russia since February after Russian authorities say they found vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. The guilty plea does not bring an end to the case, but some have suggested it could speed up the process along with Griner’s exit from prison. She could make herself eligible for a prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington, D.C. Dugan explained that, by the books, Griner would have to return to the U.S. and finish her sentence in an American prison, something he believes would not happen in any formal manner if it occurred. basketball superstar Brittney Griner arrives to a hearing at the Khimki Court outside Moscow July 7, 2022. ""In that type of prisoner swap, you're supposed to finish your sentences and respect the judgment of each respective country,"" he said, adding that he would ""doubt that the Russians would force their guy to sit in prison there for another so many years. ""That would mean you set up a certain jail here for the next ten years, at least, if it were a bona fide prisoner swap under our consular procedures and agreements with Russia on these matters,"" Dugan added. ""We didn't see it happen with [Trevor] Reed. I didn't see it happen with any type of such arrangements when I was acting either."" 'S U.S. Rebekah Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and a former intelligence officer, explained that most details of any dealings would remain out of the public and within diplomatic channels. ""They don’t want anything public,"" she said.

""Russians are saying she isn’t unlawfully detained. She possessed drugs,"" Koffler continued. ""It’s basically the clash of two legal systems."" She added that it depends on ""what Putin wants."" : ‘ ’ Dugan worried that by pleading guilty — even if Griner does intend to make herself eligible for a prisoner swap and speed up her exit from Moscow — Griner has made Russia’s negotiating position stronger. Part of the issue arises from Griner ""admitting"" to her criminal activity, which Dugan argued makes it difficult to classify her a hostage. He noted that officials had a hard time arguing for her ""hostage"" status since she was in pretrial proceedings for months already, meaning her status would more qualify as ""wrongfully detained."" star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is escorted to a courtroom for a hearing in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, June 27, 2022. ""It's a roll of the dice as to what we're dealing with,"" he said, noting that if Griner tried to argue her innocence, the Russian courts could set her next hearing months or even years later. ""Russia will do what it wants anyway. … It's kind of a no-win situation no matter what."" And Griner is not the only American in Russian custody. Trevor Reed recently returned home, but Paul Whelan, an executive at automative supplier BorgWarner, remains in prison after he was left out of the prisoner swap that brought Reed home. The James W.

Brazilian Foreign Minister Carlos Franca described his country’s pragmatic policies with the rest of the world noting that Brazil does what is best for its own national interests, and that means having a close relationship with the U.S., Russia and China. Franca sat down with Fox News Digital in an exclusive and wide-ranging interview during a visit to New York last week. Brazil is this month’s rotating president of the United Nations Security Council. He noted that the focus of the presidency was on the consequences of the war in Ukraine, and that would likely include a closed meeting on the consequences of food insecurity caused by the war. Franca said he understood the criticism of the U.N. Security Council, and its lack of progress in halting the war, and added the best bet for peace was to increase dialogue and enforce diplomacy on the situation. In regards to his country’s position on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Franca called for an immediate ceasefire and said that ""We stand on the side of Brazil…Brazil is a global player, so we don't have to side with one side, Ukraine, or Russia…We have the right to have our own foreign policy, the one who suites best what we consider to be our national interests."" From left to right, U.S. State Secretary Antony Blinken, Brazilian Foreign Minister Carlos Franca, attend the opening session of the G-20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, Friday, July 8, 2022. He said his country has a ""very balanced position,"" in regard to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He said Brazil had criticized the Russians in the U.N. Security Council, which he said was the right and specific forum to discuss the war and the question of security and issues of peace, and questioned the need for other U.N. bodies to take up the issue. 'S ‘ , ’ He said President Jair Bolsonaro has a good relationship with Russia President Putin and could help if asked to mediate peace, but he said Turkey is the main player right now in trying to achieve a ceasefire, but Brazil stands ready to help if asked. Franca recently met with both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov at the G-20 ministers meeting in Bali, Indonesia. When asked whether he thought Lavrov was ready to end Russia’s war against Ukraine, Franca said, ""I think that our conversation was not so candid…but of course I asked him about the opportunity of peace."" Franca explained Brazil defends the sovereignty of countries and that was why there needed to be an immediate ceasefire and would be first and important step for now. Brazil is the largest country in South America and has always enjoyed close ties with the U.S., but in recent years, it has developed a very close relationship with Beijing. Franca noted that China was his country’s largest trading partner by far, and Brazilian exports to China are bigger than the trade with the U.S. As a member of the group of countries, which includes China and Russia, Franca spoke of his country's close relationship with Beijing. He praised Beijing’s help during the pandemic ""we kept the value chains open; we keep our ports open; we keep our shipments flowing. We are reliable. That is the message, you know, the Chinese understand. So they are our good partners."" A local resident walks next to a house destroyed in a Russian shelling in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, Wednesday, May 25, 2022. ) The foreign minister noted that last year Brazil exported more to Asia, not including China and Japan, than to the European Union. He said this could be a trend that is focused more on Asia including the countries and China. He suggested ""that if you are in the Western Hemisphere maybe, just maybe Brazil should be the focus of more American investments."" Franca also said it was important for more U.S. companies to come and invest in Brazil. He pointed to President Bolsonaro’s interview with Tucker Carlson earlier this month when Bolsonaro called for more investments from American companies and noted that would be a good counterbalance since, ""Brazil sees itself as a global player even in terms of global trade."" : ‘ ’ Franca said Brazil did not view China as a threat: ""We don't see China as a threat. I see China that it's a superpower that we can deal with if we were dealing with and if we have a very mutually beneficial relationship. I must tell you that who first helped Brazil with vaccines? It was China in the darkest hour of the pandemic. The first vaccines arrived were from China,"" he said. When asked about the security threat regarding China, Franca said that debate was more ""active"" in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada. ""You have Chinese companies, you have American companies, you have European companies, you know, competing side by side. I think that it's certainly a debate that its much more common than they think in those countries than countries like Brazil."" While speaking on the risks and the fallout of over-dependency on China with Sri Lanka being a prime example, Fox News Digital asked Franca how Brazil deals with China and the advice, he had to offer to U.S. policymakers in regard to the stealing of intellectual property, spying and security. Franca said it was difficult to give advice to other countries on what he said was to do in dealing with a ""superpower,"" like China. Franca said that only 20 years ago China was a developing country ""But today it's a superpower in terms of science and technology. In terms of defense, of course in terms of economy we have very good relations with China, of course, with the rate increasingly rapidly, in a very fast way, we don’t have no problems in dealing with China."" He continued ""As I told you, we see Brazil as a global player, you know, so we can have relations with the United States with China."" , ‘’ While President Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Bolsonaro shared a close bond, reports have suggested there have been some differences of opinion with the Biden administration. On the importance of the institutional relationship between the U.S. and Brazil, Franca highlighted the importance of the historic relationship. ""The most important thing is, it's the historical roots that links Brazil and the United States. We share the same common values. If you think the constitution, you know the basis and the foundation of the Brazilian constitution, you see that we have the same values that they have from the Independence of the United States."" He said that meant an independent judiciary, respect for civil rights, strong democratic institutions with a strong parliament, noting the two countries had the same foundations. - Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro and U.S. President Joe Biden chat after posing for a family photo during the 9th Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, California, June 10, 2022. ) Franca said at last month’s Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles the high-level meeting between President Biden and President Bolsonaro had some good results. ""I think that the prospects are so good. Recently, you know, the day President Bolsonaro arrived in L.A. for his meeting with President Biden and to attend, of course, the Summit of the Americas. President Bolsonaro signed a decree that was the implementation of an agreement that was signed in 2020 between the two governments."" He said the agreement will make foreign trade between the two countries easier and make things hassle-free for both importers and exporters by decreasing the bureaucracy. Speaking on trade, Franca made clear relations with the U.S. continue to be strong. He said he enjoyed a very good dialogue with Blinken. He said they recently met on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting in Bali where he said Brazil was invited to attend a conference next week on the global supply chain hosted by Blinken. President Donald Trump arrive before a dinner with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro at Mar-a-Lago, Saturday, March 7, 2020, in Palm Beach, Fla. ) He was bullish on U.S.-Brazil cooperation in the space industry. In 2019 Presidents' Trump and Bolsonaro signed the Technological Safeguards Agreement, which lets the U.S. use Brazil’s Alcantara Aerospace Launch Base for satellites. Franca said he was hopeful about the future of the Alcantara launch site. ""Look, Alcantara launching site is a real wonder if you need to send a spacecraft to outer space because it's a very efficient location. I mean, you use…less fuel compared to other launching sites, and it's so close to the United States because we are in the same Western Hemisphere that it makes perfect sense if you can join efforts to make it possible."" He said was sure that in the near future it ""will be a reality."" When asked why he thought the continent had recently shifted leftwards, Franca said it could be due to the economic consequences of the pandemic, but noted that was more ""a sociological guess,"" but he did not believe ideology ""could hinder international relations,"" and noted his country’s relationship with Peru. Peru elected a leftist President Pedro Castillo, but he and the right-wing Bolsonaro have been able to work on shared interests. He said both presidents met recently and have shared interests on tourism, border patrol, stopping drug traffickers and dealers and called Peru a good partner. He said even if there were ideological values they can still work together. However, Franca drew the line with the likes of Venezuela and Cuba, who he said did not share the values of freedom of speech and democracy and that is what prevents such a relationship. ""It would also be very difficult for us to deal with a country like Venezuela: they don't have free elections, you know, democracy, it’s a question mark, you have political prisoners…he said that makes an obstacle for a fluid relationship."" He also conceded that Iran and Venezuela had a good relationship noting it was a close one. He said Venezuela today was ""not a good example…for the region in terms of respect for democracy, freedom of speech and these values that we share with the U.S. at the moment, and the western world in general,"" he concluded.

President Biden will sign an executive order Tuesday that will authorize the U.S. to impose sanctions on foreign nations that wrongfully detain Americans while providing greater transparency to the families of hostages, including intelligence sharing, in an effort to bring Americans home. In conjunction with the new executive order, the State Department will update its travel advisory risk indicator to include a ""D"" for wrongful detention abroad, in an effort to inform Americans and highlight the countries where there is an ""elevated risk"" of wrongful detention. Senior administration officials said that the State Department on Tuesday will slap a ""D"" indicator on China, Iran, Russia, Burma, North Korea and Venezuela. A senior administration official said the president’s executive order, ""Bolstering Efforts to Bring Hostages and Wrongfully Detained United States Nationals Home,"" will help to expand the ""tool kit to help bring American hostages and wrongful detainees home."" ""Foreign states that engage in wrongful detention threaten the integrity of the international political system, and moreover, the safety of U.S. nationals and others abroad,"" the official said, stressing the U.S. government’s ""unwavering commitment to bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained."" The official said that the executive order will also allow the U.S. government to ""impose costs the culprits and provide greater transparency."" basketball superstar Brittney Griner sits inside a defendants' cage during a hearing at the Khimki Court in the town of Khimki, outside Moscow, on July 15, 2022. The costs, according to the official, include financial sanctions, visa bans and more. The sanctions can be imposed on the perpetrator whether the individual is a terrorist, or a state actor, the official explained. ""We use sanctions authority with the primary focus to secure a loved one’s release,"" the official said. ""Using sanctions may not always secure a loved one's release, but families of those held know their case best."" The official explained that the executive order draws on the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act— a bipartisan bill that bolstered U.S. government resources to bring back Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad. ""This executive order reinforces U.S. government efforts to support the families of American hostages by bolstering engagement with families, including sharing intelligence information and government efforts to secure the release and return,"" the official said. ""This isn’t a substitute,"" the official added. ""It is an addition to create transparency, impose costs and, overall, try to prevent the next set of families going through this horrible ordeal."" 'S ' ' Another official said the executive order is a demonstration of President Biden’s ""commitment to bringing home U.S. nationals,"" and is informed by the administration's ""regular communications with the families and other stakeholders who have undertaken incredible advocacy efforts on behalf of their loved ones."" ""The Biden-Harris Administration appreciates the continued diligence of such families and considers them essential partners in our efforts to bring Americans home,"" an administration official said. ""President Biden and experts across the Administration will draw on this E.O. to advance our efforts and remain committed to reuniting Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained with their families."" Officials stressed that the United States ""opposes wrongful detention,"" and stressed that the practice ""represents a threat to all U.S. citizens traveling and living abroad."" Paul Whelan, a Marine Corps veteran accused of espionage and arrested in Russia in December 2018, waits to hear his verdict in Moscow on June 15, 2020. With regard to the updated travel advisory ""D"" risk indicator, an official said the advice is ""apolitical, fact-based and transparent."" The ""D"" indicator joins the existing ""K"" indicator that covers risk of kidnapping and hostage-taking by non-state actors, as well as a range of other existing risk indicators, an official explained, noting that State Department travel advisories are ""continuously revised and updated based on a comprehensive review of all available safety information and ongoing developments."" The executive order comes as the Biden administration continues its efforts to get player Brittney Griner out of Russia where she has been detained since February. Griner was arrested in February for allegedly bringing vape cartridges containing oils derived from cannabis through a Moscow airport. Griner is currently in the middle of a trial that began earlier this month. Fewer than 1% of defendants in Russian criminal cases are acquitted, and, unlike in U.S. courts, acquittals can be overturned. She faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Biden, earlier this month, spoke to Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, over the phone, reassuring her that the U.S. government is ""working to secure Brittney’s release as soon as possible."" ""The President called Cherelle to reassure her that he is working to secure Brittney’s release as soon as possible, as well as the release of Paul Whelan and other U.S. nationals who are wrongfully detained or held hostage in Russia and around the world,"" the White House said in a statement earlier this month. Michigan corporate security executive Paul Whelan is also being held in Russia on espionage-related charges his family says are bogus. In April, the Biden administration successfully carried out a prisoner swap, exchanging Trevor Reed, a Marine veteran jailed in Moscow, for Russian drug trafficker Konstantin Yaroshenko, who had been serving time in America. U.S. Marine Trevor Reed landed in Texas, April 28, 2022, after a prisoner swap between the U.S. and Russia. A person familiar with the Reed situation told Fox News, at the time, that the prisoner swap is an ""extraordinary rarity"" with regard to the Biden administration’s strategy in bringing Americans who are held hostage and unjustly detained around the globe home to the United States. The ""very difficult decision"" made by the president was ""driven by circumstances with respect to Trevor’s health,"" the person told Fox News, adding that the Biden administration is ""committed and the president is committed to trying to find ways to bring others home around the world. ""The person said that the president was willing to make the call because of how ""strongly he feels about his commitment to bringing Americans home."" The person said conversations regarding Reed’s return to the United States were ongoing for ""months and months."" The person stressed that Yaroshenko’s return to Russia was not something that ""eradicated his conviction,"" but rather a ""commutation."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",18

Chief of Space Operations for the U.S. Space Force Gen. John ‘Jay’ Raymond stressed the need for international norms when it comes to space operations, while pointing to problems posed by Russia and China.

The other thing that they're doing, they have seen the advantages that space has provided us as: we've integrated space and cyber and multi domain operations, and to be honest they don't like what they see."" Raymond further explained that while space operations are hardly something new, the area has exploded in recent years to the point of being far more difficult to manage.

Raymond said that the U.S. is trying to lead the way, and that there have been discussions among other countries and the United Nations. , , ""This is something that we're trying to establish the the the norms, if you will, the rules of the road,"" he said. One example Raymond discussed was the issue of space debris. He mentioned how Vice President Kamala Harris announced that the U.S. will not conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing while calling on other nations to make similar commitments. These tests create long-lasting debris in space that can threaten existing satellites and pose dangers to astronauts. Russia conducted such a test in 2021, and China did the same in 2007. Chief Master Sgt. Roger Towberman displays his insignia during a presentation of the United States Space Force flag in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., May 15, 2020. Raymond said Russia's test resulted in blowing up a satellite into more than 1,500 pieces, while China's test created 3,000 pieces of debris. Raymond added that the U.S. has been trying to manage these sorts of situations. ""We act as the space traffic control for the world. We make sure that that people don't hit that debris and other things in space,"" he said. China, meanwhile, has accused the U.S. of outer space aggression. ""The U.S. is the main driver in turning outer space into a weapon and a battlefield,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Tuesday. Complicating matters over the years is the greater ability for countries and private actors to send satellites into space. When just a few years ago, there were roughly 1,500 satellites in space. Raymond said that number is now closer to 5,000, with Elon Musk's SpaceX operating more than 2,000 itself. Mary Louise Kelly, an interviewer from , likened the situation to cyber warfare, in that the rules are being written as things are happening due to the novelty of the situation. Raymond agreed. ""It's not a new domain. But the domain has changed,"" he said. ""And so, you know, what are rules of engagement, what is hostile intent? All the things that we have had years and years and years to think about in other domains, this is a new domain in that sense."" As important as he believes such ""rules of the road"" are, Raymond acknowledged that they would be difficult to enforce. Nevertheless, he believes they would be of value in identifying what types of actions would be considered improper. ""If we had a set of rules, and you run through the red light, we can say you ran through the red light,"" he said, adding that ""it helps identify bad behavior."" Another topic that came up was the role that space plays, or could play, in warfare, and why a space force is so necessary. Raymond warned that future wars could take place in space, as countries may try to jam an adversary's communications or destroy their satellites. One question from the audience dealt with the idea of ""lasers from space."" Notably, Raymond did not discount those as a threat. ""In that spectrum of conflict or threats, everything from reversible jamming to kinetic destruction, there would be directed energy threats that we'd be concerned about as well,"" he said.",22

For nearly a minute, Russian President Vladimir Putin stood alone in front of two chairs, waiting for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, shuffling in place as cameras rolled. The Russian leader fidgeted as he waited nearly a minute for Erdogan to join him, as the two leaders met in Iran. Video of Putin appearing impatient quickly spread across social media. Putin can be seen walking into the room briskly, only to then stop in front of the two empty chairs. More than 45 seconds later, Erdogan eventually joined him and the two men shook hands, posing for photographs. Erdogan's delay was reminiscent of when Putin had the Turkish leader wait outside his office in Moscow for two minutes before a 2020 meeting. , Russian President Vladimir Putin walks to greet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan prior to their talks at the Saadabad palace, in Tehran, Iran, Tuesday, July 19, 2022. The two leaders were scheduled to meet for one of Putin's planned meetings on his trip to Tehran. Another involved Iranian and Turkish leaders for the purpose of discussing the ongoing conflict in Syria. The Russian president's trip to Iran comes after warnings from the United States that Iran could provide Russia with drones for its war against Ukraine. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration had information that indicated the Iranian government was preparing to provide Russia with ""up to several hundred s, including weapons-capable s on an expedited timeline."" Sullivan was referring to unmanned aerial vehicles or drones. Putin’s visit to Iran comes after President Biden visited Israel and Saudi Arabia.

David Petraeus urges American leadership to practice deterrence against China, stay strong against Russia as the global stage faces ‘renewed great-power rivalries.’ Director William Burns suggested that China would carefully study Russia’s many failures in Ukraine, which might inform ""how and when"" Beijing may invade Taiwan. ""I think our sense is that it probably affects less the question of whether the Chinese leadership might choose some years down the road to use force to control Taiwan, but how and when they would do it,"" Burns said at the Aspen Security Forum. ""If there's one lesson I think they may be drawing from Putin's experience in Ukraine, it’s you don't achieve quick, decisive victories with overwhelming force."" Burns provided a wide-ranging interview at the forum, touching on topics ranging from Iran’s nuclear capabilities to the Russian imprisonment of American basketball player Brittney Griner. But he spent most of his time discussing the United States’ two greatest rival nations. He paid particular attention to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including Putin’s mentality and the possible factors that contributed to Russia’s many failures to quickly and decisively win the conflict, and what lessons China might glean from the experience as it looks toward a possible Taiwan invasion. ‘-’ , Director William Burns speaks during an event at the Georgia Institute of Technology Thursday in Atlanta. ""I wouldn’t underestimate President Xi’s determination to assert China’s control over Taiwan,"" Burns said. ""He’s determined to ensure his military has the capability to undertake such an action should he decide to move in that direction."" The Russian invasion of Ukraine proved a ""strategic failure"" for Putin, with Burns revealing that he believed the latest U.S. intelligence estimates would indicate around 15,000 Russian troops killed and ""maybe three times"" as many troops wounded. It was the first update in months from any intelligence source on possible Russian losses. , ‘ ’ ""The Ukrainians have suffered as well, probably a little less than that, but significant casualties is the big picture,"" Burns said, adding that he believed ""Russia is planning to dig in and keep hammering Ukraine and believe that when winter comes and the fuel costs are so high on Europe, that solidarity will weaken.""

Putin’s failure to ""fracture "" would prove his greatest misstep, according to Burns. The alliance will add Finland and Sweden, allowing it to ""strengthen its deployments."" Instead, Russia has now ""retreated to a comfortable way of war"" with its shift in focus to the Donbas region, instead relying on ""long-range firepower"" to create a standoff and compensate for weaknesses in manpower. ‘ ’ : This may have led China to take a more ""cautious"" approach to its military after seeing Putin drive Europeans and Americans closer together. It has ""unsettled the Chinese … since they banked on their ability to play off some Europeans against the Americans as well,"" Burns said. ""The Chinese leadership has been unsettled to some extent — especially in the first days of Putin's war in Ukraine — by what they saw. Unsettled by the military performance of the Russians early on and the performance of Russian weaponry. Unsettled by the economic uncertainties that the war is unleashed around the world in a year. ""I think Xi Jinping’s main concern is getting through a very important party congress in the autumn and having a relatively predictable global economic landscape."" Burns also discussed the threat of global warming and said it was a comparable challenge to that of China's. ""If you assume, as I do, that the People's Republic of China is the biggest geopolitical challenge that our country faces as far out in the 21st century, as I can see, the biggest existential threat in many ways is climate change,"" he said. Director William Burns testifies during a House Intelligence Committee hearing about worldwide threat on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., April 15, 2021. The director also repeated warnings of Iran's increased speed at acquiring a nuclear device, something repeated earlier this month by the French foreign minister. He noted that under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ""which the last administration pulled out of several years ago, that breakout time to produce that amount of fissile material was a little more than a year."" He said today that ""same breakout time can be measured not in a year-plus, but in weeks."" Burns also told the audience at the Aspen Security Forum he had been in Afghanistan the week before the U.S. had withdrawn. ""I'd say, as the president has said publicly, none of us anticipated that the Afghan government was going to flee as quickly as they did or that the Afghan military was going to collapse as fast as it did. ""Having said that, I think at least was always on the more pessimistic end of the spectrum, in terms of highlighting, you know, over the course of the spring and summer, the obvious ways in which the Taliban were advancing rapidly and how this was hollowing out in many ways, not just the political leadership, but also the military.""",22
2022-07-20,https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-graft-concerns-resurface-russia-war-goes-on,Ukraine graft concerns resurface as Russia war goes on,"Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s dismissal of senior officials is casting an inconvenient light on an issue that the Biden administration has largely ignored since the outbreak of war with Russia: Ukraine’s history of rampant corruption and shaky governance. As it continues providing tens of billions of dollars in military, economic and direct financial aid to Ukraine and encourages its allies to do the same, the Biden administration is once again grappling with longstanding worries about Ukraine’s suitability as a recipient of massive infusions of American aid. Those issues, which date back decades and were not an insignificant part of former President Trump’s first impeachment, had been largely pushed to the back burner in the immediate run-up to Russia’s invasion and during the first months of the conflict as the U.S. and its partners rallied to Ukraine’s defense. However, Zelenskyy’s weekend firings of his top prosecutor, intelligence chief and other senior officials have resurfaced those concerns and may have inadvertently given fresh attention to allegations of high-level corruption in Kyiv made by one outspoken U.S. lawmaker. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, listens to a servicemen report close to the front line in Donetsk region of Ukraine, Sunday, June 5, 2022. , It is a delicate issue for the Biden administration. With billions in aid flowing to Ukraine, the White House continues to make the case for supporting Zelenskyy's government to an American public increasingly focused on domestic issues like high gas prices and inflation. High-profile supporters of Ukraine in both parties also want to avoid a backlash that could make it more difficult to pass future aid packages. U.S. officials are quick to say that Zelenskyy is well within his right to appoint whomever he wants in senior positions, including the prosecutor general, and remove anyone who he sees as collaborating with Russia. Yet even as Russian troops were massing near the Ukrainian border last fall, the Biden administration was pushing Zelenskyy to do more to act on corruption — a perennial U.S. demand going back to Ukraine’s early days of independence. ""In all of our relationships, and including in this relationship, we invest not in personalities; we invest in institutions, and, of course, President Zelenskyy has spoken to his rationale for making these personnel shifts,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Monday. Price declined to comment further on Zelenskyy’s reasoning for the dismissals or address the specifics but said there was no question that Russia has been trying to interfere in Ukraine. ""Moscow has long sought to subvert, to destabilize the Ukrainian government,"" Price said. ""Ever since Ukraine chose the path of democracy and a Western orientation this has been something that Moscow has sought to subvert."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stands at the podium during a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, in Kyiv, Ukraine, July 3, 2022. , Still, in October, and then again in December 2021, as the U.S. and others were warning of the increasing potential for a Russian invasion, the Biden administration was calling out Zelenskyy’s government for inaction on corruption that had little or nothing to do with Russia. ""The and the U.S. are greatly disappointed by unexplained and unjustifiable delays in the selection of the Head of the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor Office, a crucial body in the fight against high-level corruption,"" said the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on Oct. 9. ""We urge the selection commission to resume its work without further delays. Failure to move forward in the selection process undermines the work of anti-corruption agencies, established by Ukraine and its international partners,"" it said. That special prosecutor was finally chosen in late December but was never actually appointed to the position. Although there are indications the appointment will happen soon, the dismissal of the prosecutor general could complicate the matter. The administration and high-profile lawmakers have avoided public criticism of Ukraine since Russia invaded in February. The U.S. has ramped up the weapons and intelligence it is providing to Ukraine despite early concerns about Russia's penetration of the Ukrainian government and existing concerns about corruption. A Ukrainian-born congresswoman who came to prominence early in the war recently broke that unofficial silence. A pallet of fuses for 155 mm shells, ultimately bound for Ukraine, is spun as it is loaded on to a C-17 cargo aircraft April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Del. Rep. Victoria Spartz, a first-term Republican from Indiana, has made half a dozen visits to Ukraine since the war began. She was invited to the White House in May and received a pen used by President Biden to sign an aid package for Ukraine, even after she angrily criticized Biden for not doing more to help. However, in recent weeks, Spartz has accused Zelenskyy of ""playing politics"" and alleged his top aide, Andriy Yermak, had sabotaged Ukraine’s defense against Russia. She has also repeatedly called on Ukraine to name the anti-corruption prosecutor, blaming Yermak for the delay. Ukrainian officials have hit back. A statement from Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry accused Spartz of spreading ""Russian propaganda"" and warned her to ""stop trying to earn extra political capital on baseless speculation."" U.S. officials gave Spartz a two-hour classified briefing on Friday in hopes of addressing her concerns and encouraging her to limit her public criticism. She declined to discuss the briefing afterward but told The Associated Press that ""healthy dialogue and deliberation is good for Congress."" ""We’re not here to please people,"" she said. ""It’s good to deliberate."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, attends a meeting July 8, 2022, with military officials during his visit the war-hit Dnipropetrovsk region. ‘ ,' Hours later, Spartz gave a Ukrainian-language interview broadcast on YouTube, which she called again for the appointment of an independent prosecutor. ""This issue should be resolved as soon as possible,"" she said during the interview. ""This is a huge problem for the West, so I think your president should address this issue soon."" Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who sits on the House Armed Services and Intelligence committees, said he had seen no evidence to support allegations that Zelenskyy's inner circle was trying to help Russia. However, as the war continues, part of the long-term American strategy in Ukraine will have to include addressing waste and mismanagement of resources, he said. ""There is no war in the history of the world that is immune from corruption and people trying to take advantage of it,"" Crow said. ""If there are concerns raised, we will address them."" Igor Novikov, a Kyiv-based former adviser to Zelenskyy, called many of Spartz’s claims a mix of ""hearsay and urban legends and myths."" Allegations against Yermak in particular have circulated for years going back to his interactions with Trump allies who sought derogatory information against Biden’s son Hunter.",22

""Presidents Putin and Xi, when they met, they came up with this agreement … with the term 'no limits,'"" Moore said. ""Now … that ‘no limits’ is a ringing phrase, isn't it? That's a ringing phrase, and I think it says, when President Xi says these things, he means them, and we ought to listen hard."" Moore, in his first-ever on-camera interview outside the U.K., presented a complex picture of the international landscape, particularly regarding the challenges of remaining ""upstream"" of China as well as a number of blunt statements regarding Russia and its actions in Ukraine. Moore criticized China for ""beating the Russian drum and selling"" Putin’s narrative on Ukraine ""without any sense of irony."" ""They’re selling their snake oil around the world,"" Moore said. ‘ ’ 'S ; ‘’T ' - He also raised the negative side of doing business with China, pointing to Sri Lanka, which made ""really misplaced economic decisions"" in trusting China and falling prey to its Belt and Road Initiative. The West, he argued, shows a greater willingness to work in an ""independent and creative"" environment. Most startling, Moore labeled China as the U.K.’s top priority – ahead even of any counterterrorism efforts. 6 Chief Richard Moore speaks at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, London, on Nov. 30, 2021, saying that Britain's intelligence agencies must open up to cooperation with the global tech sector if they are to counter the rising cyber threats from hostile states, criminals and terrorists. ) ""We are putting more effort into China,"" Moore said. ""We now devote more effort to China than any other single subject."" ""So, for example, it just moved past counterterrorism in terms of our mission, and that feels like a very big moment – post-9/11, post-7/7 in London – but it reflects the seriousness of the mission for us,"" he added. ‘’ , : The greatest challenge with China is dealing with an ""opaque"" system, especially after China crushed U.S. spy sources in 2010, killing or imprisoning at least 18 such operatives and setting the U.S. back ""decades."" ""But I would just say that … we have this huge advantage that the Chinese don’t because we have friends – we have allies, we have an ability to work in a trusted way to try and take on this challenge."" Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, June 5, 2019. The U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand share intelligence in a system known as the Five Eyes Alliance. Moore argues that in addition to this alliance, which allows free movement of intelligence between the five nations, the U.S., U.K. and their partners also offer a ""middle ground"" for countries that China and Russia do not. ""You know, there are a lot of countries out there that may not share our values,"" he said. ""They may not share our political systems, but they are a vital battleground for us as we seek to compete with the Chinese, and if we leave a vacuum in those places, the Chinese will fill it."" O' , ‘’ Moore outlined how he seeks to ""forge a relationship"" with the intelligence service of a given country that ""might fall into that category"" and try to find common ground. ""I’m not leaving my values at the door,"" he added, stressing that his values remain ""critical"" to his service. ""I will find ways of finding a common ground and I think we’ve got to do that, and part of that is frankly not seeing this as some kind of set of a 1950s cowboy movie [where] the bad guys have black hats and we all have white hats."" A Ukrainian serviceman walks by a destroyed apartment building in Borodyanka, Ukraine, Wednesday, April 6, 2022. ""It’s a messy, contested world out there, and we’ve got to be prepared."" One area in which this preparation came in handy was dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Moore once again highlighted the value of knowing ahead of the invasion what Putin intended to do, and how that led to numerous failures. ‘-’ , ""We had the enormous privilege in the U.S. and U.K. intelligence services of knowing what [Putin’s] plan was, and he had three things he wanted,"" Moore said. ""One was to remove [President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy, second was to capture Kiev, and third was to sow disunity within the alliance."" ""If you turn to those three briefly … I think that's a fail, if you completely failed to capture Kyiv."" That, he said, means Russia suffered a ""very, very bloody nose."" He echoed estimates from Director William Burns that Russia had lost some 15,000 troops – at least – during the invasion, saying it was a ""conservative"" estimate that would equal the same number of troops Russia lost in the 10-year Afghanistan operations in the 1980s. Like Burns, he also said Putin was not in poor health. He said Russia’s greatest failure of all resulted in growing in strength – once again highlighting the value of cooperation between Western allies in order to achieve their goals. With Sweden and Finland joining the alliance, Moore believes stands stronger than ever before. ""I never thought I would see Sweden and Finland join [],"" he said. ""Sweden's just giving up 200 years of neutrality to do that. So on all of those, I think they count as epic fails.""",22

The spokesperson for Russia's Foreign Ministry lashed out Thursday at the United States characterizing basketball star Brittney Griner's jailing on drug charges as ""wrongful detention,"" saying it shows disrespect for Russian law. Griner has been jailed since she was arrested in mid-February at a Moscow airport after vape canisters containing cannabis oil were found in her luggage. The Phoenix Mercury standout and two-time Olympic gold medalist acknowledged in court this month that she had the canisters, but said she had no intent to break the law. She faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Her trial is scheduled to resume Tuesday. '' : The State Department in May designated Griner as wrongfully detained, moving her case under the supervision of its special presidential envoy for hostage affairs - effectively, the government’s chief hostage negotiator. Brittney Griner was arrested in Russia for drug possession. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday that the legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational use in parts of the U.S. has no bearing on what happens in Russia. ""If a U.S. citizen was taken in connection with the fact that she was smuggling drugs, and she does not deny this, then this should be commensurate with our Russian, local laws, and not with those adopted in San Francisco, New York and Washington,"" Zakharova said. ""You understand, if drugs are legalized in the United States, in a number of states, and this is done for a long time, and now the whole country will become drug-addicted, this does not mean that all other countries are following the same path,"" she added. Russian media have persistently speculated that Griner could be exchanged for prominent Russian arms trader Viktor Bout, who is imprisoned in the United States, and that Paul Whelan, an American imprisoned in Russia for espionage, may also figure in an exchange.",18

Oliver North responds to reports that ahead of Independence Day, American patriotism is down significantly on ‘Fox News Live.’ I was born in the Soviet Union. Every July 20, I celebrate the day my mother and I arrived in America. Our family arrived in waves in the late 1970s. My grandmother and her sister were allowed out first. Then my father. Then us. We didn’t know if we would see each other again. The Iron Curtain could be pulled shut at any time. We left family behind. My mother never saw her father again. Nothing about it was easy. The late ‘70s were not America’s glory days. Inflation was high, crime was everywhere, there was an energy crisis. But more than any of that, there was a crisis of identity and the pervasive idea that America was not that great and not worth saving. There’s a reason Ronald Reagan was such a popular president, winning 49 states in his re-election bid: he reflected America’s greatness, and he did not for one moment allow Americans to forget how lucky they were. : ‘ , ’ This July 4th, so many people took to social media to say they were disappointed in their country, that they didn’t feel like celebrating it. They were mad about the Supreme Court. They were angry at their fellow Americans. First Lady Nancy Reagan looks on as President Ronald Reagan is sworn in during ceremonies in the Rotunda beneath the Capitol Dome in Washington on Jan. 21, 1985. Reagan, forced indoors by a record inaugural freeze, reenacted his oath taking and sounded a second term dedication to his conservative principles. ) The luckiest people in history somehow don’t know it. Their faces blue from holding their collective breath until they are given even more than they have already. The people who have woken up on 3rd base, who have been blessed through the accident of birth to live their whole lives in the greatest, freest country the world has ever known, are somehow still unhappy with their lot. It’s sometimes too much to bear. For those of us who have family who have never tasted this freedom, this spoiled, miserable, ungrateful class of people can be particularly galling. They don’t know how lucky they are, and they don’t know how their unappreciativeness looks to the rest of the world. Only the comfortable and the free can take to their Instagram and trash something so good. I’ve spent my life as a free person in a free place but every July 20, and so many days in between, I think about how it all could have gone so differently. Our lives were on one track and then a miracle switched us to another one. I got to grow up American. I got to have American children. The people who hate on America, on our Independence Day, have never had the discomfort that comes with the lack of freedom. Their privilege shows in every word they say. It’s easy to dismiss them, these children throwing a tantrum. But they’re moving us away from each other. They’re severing our collective binds. They target July 4th, Thanksgiving and all the other days when we should pause and reflect, so that we don’t celebrate the obvious bounty of our lives. It keeps us angry and bitter, despite having everything. Our ungraciousness is good politically. It keeps people engaged. But it tears us apart. My Americaversary is a pause for me to say a quiet thank you to the country that took us in and has given us so much. But the calendar is filled with days for all of us to pause and do the same. Don’t let the entitled few take it from us. We are lucky every single day to be Americans, and we can’t ever forget that.",0

O’Brien, who served as national security adviser during the Trump administration from 2019 to 2021, in an interview with Fox News Digital said that former President Richard Nixon used ""strategic diplomacy"" to further ""the cause of peace and ensure America’s security."" ""Today, 50 years after his trips to China and Russia — and as we approach the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War — his foreign policy represents the ultimate example of the type of strategic thinking that should again guide America today,"" O’Brien said, adding that he hopes to encourage a ""Nixonian style of thinking about world affairs and grand strategy"" in his new role.

O’Brien told Fox News that during the Nixon administration there was a hope that China would ""become wealthier, become more democratic and more liberal, and more like us."" A , ""The opposite is true today,"" O’Brien said. ""They have become more oppressive and more authoritarian — they have gone a very different route than we expected."" O’Brien warned that China is ""exercising its power to control free speech worldwide."" ""They intend to become the number one superpower in the world, and want everyone else to have to pay homage,"" O’Brien said. O’Brien stressed the importance of ""educating the public,"" reflecting on his time in the Trump administration, working alongside then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, then-Attorney General Bill Barr and Director Christopher Wray. Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, sits down with representatives of teachers and students at a symposium and delivers an important speech during a visit to Renmin University of China in Beijing, capital of China, April 25, 2022. ""We need to let the American people know the threat and build a bipartisan consensus,"" O’Brien said. ""And that is something the Nixon Foundation can be a part of."" O’Brien said he plans to work with the foundation to host seminars and programs featuring prominent officials who can help to ""educate the American people on what we face in this competition with China and how deadly serious it is to our way of life."" As for the Biden administration’s handling of the evolving threat from Beijing, O’Brien said that there is ""more continuity between the two administrations than people would believe."" ""Biden folks have left many of our policies in place, and I commend them,"" O’Brien said while stressing the importance to continue on to ""next steps."" ""They have had their attention directed to Afghanistan and Ukraine, but we need to make sure not to divert our attention from what is happening in the Pacific,"" O’Brien said, stressing the importance of ""rebuilding the U.S. Navy and having enough money in the defense budget,"" as well as a U.S. military presence in the Pacific regions to ""deter China."" 'S 'A ' 'S '' , Just this week, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley directed his staff to collect information on interactions between the U.S. and Chinese militaries in the last five years. Other Biden administration officials have also doubled down on their warnings that Beijing poses the greatest long-term threat to U.S. national security in recent weeks. Director Christopher Wray earlier this month said China poses the ""biggest long-term threat"" to U.S. economic and national security. The National Counterintelligence and Security Center also this month warned that state and local leaders are at ""risk"" of being ""manipulated"" to support ""hidden"" agendas by the Chinese Communist Party as China seeks to target officials outside of Washington to lobby for Beijing-friendly policies at the federal level. In April, Director William Burns issued a similar warning to Wray’s — also noting that China has been ""a silent partner"" in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, June 5, 2019. Burns, at the time, said China is ""in many ways, the most profound test the has ever faced,"" calling China a ""formidable competitor lacking in neither ambition nor capability."" Meanwhile, with regard to China’s ambitions in taking Taiwan, O’Brien warned that the Chinese ""have taken solace"" in the fact that Russia is still able to operate, even amidst global sanctions.

Col. Darin Gaub joins 'Fox News Live' with analysis on U.S. aid to Ukraine. Recent developments have made it easier than ever to acquire military grade drones, and the U.S. needs to focus on developing counter-drone measures, experts said Friday at the Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado. ""We do see this as a growing problem, because if you look at the availability of inexpensive drones, you find that the violent extremist organizations that we battle around the globe have easy access to this technology,"" Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Ranking Member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said. ""They don't need to develop anything. All they need to do is hop on Amazon, and they can buy a $300 drone that can be used against an adversary. And so it is a real concern."" Ernst and Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo, a member of the House Committee on Armed Services, discussed developments concerning drone technology and the need for countermeasures. Ernst noted that China and Russia have started to focus on ""swarm technology,"" a concept discussed in U.S. Air Force papers and defined as ""a group of autonomous networked small unmanned aircraft systems operating collaboratively to achieve common objectives."" The goal of such approaches focuses on overwhelming a target and ""saturating its defenses."" ‘ ’ 'S ; ‘’T ' - ""It's not just the one-offs that are being purchased on the internet, but now we have near-peer adversaries that are developing swarm technology where they can use 100 or 200 different drones — highly, highly evolved drones that can attack our service members on the battlefield,"" she said. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo. Developing to better utilize such technologies would remain important as the U.S. explores these kinds of weapons as well, Crow added. ‘-’ , ""We have some really big unanswered questions, too, that we have to have some public debate about,"" he said. ""That's just not the technology and the investment, but we have to have a discussion around what is the role of going to be, because we have discussions as a democracy and we have, we would take into consideration the moral and ethical implications of drones and ways that some of our adversaries do not.""

Introducing into the discussion also raises the question as to what role humans have ""in the kill chain,"" as removing people can help speed up decision-making and targeting in combat scenarios, Crow explained. ‘ ’ : ""As we look at great power competition, our engagement in and what the scenarios for engagement and some of the war planning look like, that is an essential part of the debate that remains unanswered,"" he said. Ernst also described the need to develop interoperable systems to handle the new landscape of air combat, especially with an eye towards Iran and its capabilities. ""With the threat that Iran poses, not only are we looking at missile defense, but now because of the drone threat, it's air defense in a way that we haven't had to think of before,"" she said. ""So we actually do have a bicameral, bipartisan act that would allow our secretary of defense to work with a number of allies and partners in coming up with interoperability systems that are tied together as far as air and missile defense throughout the Middle East and again, directed at protecting against the threat that Iran poses.""

""It turns out that the Poles and the Hungarians and others, they would remind us when we were at that this wasn't actually about 's role in Afghanistan for them - they were in because Russia would be revanchist one day,"" she added, referring Russia’s eventual desire to revive the Soviet Union.

At the same forum, former National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley stressed that Putin had ""changed a lot"" throughout his decades in power, and ultimately made it impossible for the U.S. to engage with him and integrate Russia to the international institutions. ""I would say what was the problem was the Color Revolutions, which Putin decided were basically a operation operating through s to topple governments and put in place - we would say democratic, he would say democratic governments that were anti-Russian, and that it was a dress rehearsal for what we were going to do with Russia,"" he said.

Michael Waller shares insight on 'America's News .' America must work with rival nations to develop international norms for developing technologies such artificial intelligence or face increasingly difficult challenges in tackling misinformation and cyberwarfare, experts have said. ""I like to think of this as sort of where things were 20 years ago in tech, where we were incredibly naïve,"" said Eric Schmidt, former Google and current Chairman of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, said Friday at the Aspen Security Forum. ""I was very naive about the impact of what we were doing. I now understand that information is everything: It's incredibly powerful."" Much of the security forum focused on various challenges the United States and western allies face at the international level from rival nations Russia, China and Iran. ""When we talk about information operations, we usually say the Russians are the most prolific, the Chinese are the most sophisticated, and the Iranians are the most angry,"" Brad Smith, of Microsoft, said. ""Most of their anger is not directed at the United States, but it is directed at American allies."" ‘ ’ 'S ; ‘’T ' - The three nations mainly make headlines regarding their more obvious military aggressions against neighboring countries – Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; China’s posturing on a possible Taiwan invasion; and Iran supporting Houthi activities in various Middle Eastern countries. But cybersecurity experts have tried to draw more attention to the arena of cyberwarfare, including both the use of misinformation and the development of technology to improve weapons and information technology. Microsoft President Brad Smith speaks during a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York, U.S., September 13, 2019. ""So I think the first comment I would make is I think that the government and other institutions should put more pressure on tech to get these things consistent with our values and so forth,"" he continued. ""I suspect we all agree - we can debate how to do it, but it requires a conversation; it requires engagement."" Schmidt specifically highlighted the complications surrounding negotiations of a possible A.I. agreement between countries: He argued that finding common ground between China and the U.S. would likely prove more challenging than people realize despite the apparent importance and need for such agreements. ‘ ’ , ‘’ ""How would we do it?"" he asked of the Chinese side. ""Who do we call? I’ve tried to find that person and I can’t find them. We’re not ready for the negotiations we need."" He likened artificial intelligence to nuclear weapons, with the latter showing that rival nations can come to an agreement on procedures and systems regarding vital and dangerous assets. , - 16: Eric Schmidt, former chairman and at visits Fox Business Network Studios on April 16, 2019 in New York City. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. and Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, noted that America did create the problem in the 1990s by walking away from efforts to create an international norm for cyber rules. ""I get it because there are still folks in our government, I have some sympathy for this,"" he explained. ""Say we adhere to cyber norms and the bad guys won't - I think we at least ought to have a debate about, say, if you bring down a health care system: Should there be a lower attribution rule in terms of going after the actors than if you're taking down something else?"" ‘ ’ : Smith agreed, urging the U.S. to find ways to develop ""stronger norms"" for cyberspace. - This Wednesday July 25, 2018 file photo shows Sen.

Warner and Republican challenger Daniel Gade participated in a virtual debate in Northern Virginia earlier in the day.

""The truth is, there's never been a rule that wasn't violated by somebody. That's why we have police forces and courts."" But rules alone will not limit the possibilities and uses of such technologies: The development of the physical hardware must take priority as well, according to Warner. ""America went from about 33% of the chip manufacturing - about seven or eight years ago or ten years ago - we're down to about 10 or 11%,"" he said.

Tulsi Gabbard react to Ukraine labeling them 'propagandists' on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' The Ukrainian government ""blacklisted"" several Americans as ""pro-Russian"" propagandists, including one journalist who quipped that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy somehow had time to watch Joe Scarborough's, ""Morning Joe"" program. The Ukrainian ""Center for Countering Disinformation"" was reportedly established in 2021 under Zelenskyy and aims to counter ""destructive disinformation."" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, journalist Glenn Greenwald, retired Col. Douglas Macgregor, University of Chicago Prof. John Mearshimer, and Romanian-born military strategist Edward Luttwak, have been named as ""pro-Russian[s],"" according to Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Carlson invited Gabbard and Greenwald to respond Monday, after questioning how President Biden has repeatedly claimed sending millions in American taxpayer dollars to Kyiv is ""defending democracy"" – especially if Zelenskyy banned both opposition political parties and now has taken aggressive action toward the very Americans whose money is helping Ukraine against Russia. 'S , In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office on Saturday, June 18, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends meeting with military officials. ""Now the Ukrainian government has decided that they can impose censorship in our country,"" Carlson said. Greenwald, who now writes on Substack, questioned how Zelenskyy could find time to analyze media coverage of critics in the U.S. to the point he would start blacklisting those who question the blanket statements and proverbially unquestionable allocation of U.S. funds. ""I thought President Zelenskyy had a war to run,"" he said. ""Apparently, he has a lot of time to watch ‘The Morning Joe Show’ on , where they sit around for hours accusing everybody they want to discredit of being a Kremlin agent and teaching American liberals how to do the same."" ""It's easy to mock, but it's actually quite outrageous -- The Ukrainians have a conflict with this neighboring country in Russia. They're totally free to pursue whatever war policies they want. They can fight Russia in the next 10 years if they choose. But that's not what they're doing."" ""They're begging and in a sense, demanding that other countries, including my own, the United States, provide them with a seemingly endless supply of weapons and money, which means we not only have the right, but the obligation to debate that and ask whether that's in the interest of the American people to do."" . Sen. Rand Paul speaks during the Federal Response Hearing on Capitol Hill on June 16, 2022 Greenwald said Zelenskyy is ""exporting"" the same ""repression"" he has forced on citizens in the form of censorship as mentioned by Carlson – calling it ""gall[ing]"" to hear the Ukrainians demand money and weapons from Americans while interfering in their political discourse in this way. Later, Gabbard – who Hillary Rodham Clinton similarly falsely suggested was an ""asset"" of Vladimir Putin – said the blacklist is hypocritical, and a good reason Americans should think clearly about the Biden-Harris platform toward Ukraine. ""[T]he Washington elite from both parties are continuing to be willing to impoverish the American people-- and people around the world – and push us closer and closer to nuclear war and holocaust, all to protect democracy and defeat autocracy in Ukraine,"" she said. Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough ""And all of this is happening as the Ukrainian president is frankly exposing that there is no democracy in Ukraine.

""And now he's turning his sights on Americans, not only myself and others you've mentioned, but a sitting senator,"" she continued, referring to Rand Paul.

But all of the Ukrainian people are in this situation — too many are separated, and all of us are waiting for and waiting for normal life — to be reunited again and just to lead normal lives like ordinary people live."" Zelenskyy agreed: ""This interview is one of the good opportunities for us to see each other. This is very important for us. As you know, we are all human beings, and we have to be strong. Sometimes we want to have someone close to be next to us and that is what you miss in these moments. Yes, I miss my children, I miss my wife. It is impossible to get used to it. Everything else you can get used to."" A crisis of this magnitude, with all the myriad strains it brings, could break any relationship, but not the Zelenskyys. ""I agree with the theory that marriage gets stronger with challenges,"" said Zelenska. ""I think in our case it will be the same. We have become more interested in each other. That is why I hope this challenge can make us more united."" Then she turned to her husband and asked: ""What do you think about it?"" ""My answer wouldn’t be different,"" Zelenskyy replied. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, Piers Morgan, host of 'Piers Morgan Uncensored"" and first lady Olena Zelenskyy Zelenska shook her head. ""You should have your own opinion about it!"" - : '' He smiled. ""When you are talking, your opinion has priority. What I would say is I don’t have any other experience. I’ve got only one wife and I am happy. I have one wife, one love and one family. I never got any feeling there was anything wrong with us in or in our relationship. Or maybe do you feel unhappy with me sometimes?"" ""Not with you,"" she replied, ""but without you, I am very unhappy."" ""That is why I can’t notice any big changes,"" he said. ""The war is making our relationship stronger, that’s for sure."" ""We are managing?"" suggested Zelenska. ""Yes, but managing is not the right word. We are in love with each other. ?"" "","" she smiled. Zelenska is a radiantly beautiful woman, which prompted me to ask her husband if he felt he was ""punching above your weight?"" Zelenskyy looked bemused, until the meaning of the English phrase was clarified to him by an aide, and he replied: ""I think I’m very lucky with my wife and family, and my children."" He then confirmed a story I’d heard that he and two of his friends all proposed marriage to their girlfriends, including Olena, at the same time, and got married on three consecutive weekends. ""True!"" he smiled. Zelenska laughed as she recalled the unusual mass wedding agreement. ""I remember three of you saying, ‘Let’s do it,’ and everything will be — and we agreed."" I’d come to Ukraine’s capital city, Kyiv, five days before at the invitation of Zelenska to co-host her Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen, which featured moving speeches of solidarity by many of the world’s most powerful and famous people, from America’s first lady Jill Biden to David Beckham and Richard Gere. It’s not a trip many people are making right now. First lady Olena Zelenska, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Piers Morgan in Ukraine In fact, millions of terrified Ukrainians have been fleeing their country to escape Vladimir Putin’s missiles and murderous thugs since the illegal Russian invasion five months ago. Nor is it an easy trip. My journey involved a three-hour flight from London to a town in Poland, then a 90-minute drive to a railway station near the Polish border, where I caught the special overnight presidential train that all world leaders like Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron have been forced to use since civilian air travel over the country was banned, arriving in Kyiv 11 hours later. It’s easy to be lulled into a false sense of security. I felt quite relaxed on the train until a stewardess suddenly appeared to urgently press down my cabin window black-out blinds. ""We don’t want the Russians to see any lights,"" she said matter-of-factly. She had good reason to be fearful: Numerous trains have been attacked in this war and dozens of her rail network colleagues have been killed. The center of Kyiv felt relatively normal with shops and cafes open, and locals milling around the streets, albeit amid a considerable military presence, but then I heard the air raid sirens that go off several times a day and it was an unnerving reality check that Ukraine remains a war zone and nobody is safe from Russia’s long-range cruise missiles. Before I interviewed the Zelenskyys, I spent some time with other people with deep connections to this war, including the Klitschko brothers, both former world heavyweight boxing champions, now fighting for their country’s very existence, Wladimir on the front line, and Vitali as mayor of Kyiv. The stories were horrifying, and heart-breaking, and represent just a tiny fraction of the misery so many Ukrainians have been enduring. But their resolve is strong, their resilience extraordinary, and in their leader, Zelenskyy, they have a modern-day Winston Churchill rallying them to defy the modern-day Nazis. The comparison is appropriate as both men were pint-size powerhouses, around 5 feet 7, and possessed of a fierce intelligence and sharp wit, dogged determination, resolute refusal to give up, and the ability to inspire whole nations with extraordinarily eloquent rhetoric. As I walked with Zelenskyy outside before the interview began, I told him why I thought he was Churchillian. , ""My grandmother was 19 when World War started,"" I said, ""and often spoke of how the family used to sit around the radio, listening to Winston’s rally-cry speeches and it genuinely inspired them to believe they would beat Hitler against all the odds. You have been doing the same for Ukrainian people through television and social media."" ""Thank you,"" he said, ""but I would not compare myself to Churchill."" Zelenskyy is the No. 1 target for the Russians and his family No. 2, and there have been regular plots against his highly prized life as merciless Putin tries to silence the man leading the resistance against him. ""It’s an unpleasant feeling,"" admitted Zelenska. ""I don’t want to think that they want to do this to our family. I’m trying to push these kinds of thoughts away. You can see what they did to civilians and what they are doing now, in any part of our country. I don’t understand what they’ve got in mind, and possibly we are in danger. I don’t want to allow these kinds of thoughts to go deep into my mind because I could feel scared, and this is not what we need right now."" But the fear is real. Just getting to see the Zelenskyys involves many layers of security including multiple sandbagged checkpoints, metal detectors, sniffer dogs, scores of heavily armed soldiers patrolling everywhere, snipers on the roofs, and his own elite personal protection team, who spent an hour with my production team working out exactly where they could sit, so they wouldn’t be seen on camera but would be close enough if anything untoward happened. Nothing is left to chance to keep the main man alive. After they told me some heart-stopping revelations about the night Russia invaded, and the frantic, deadly days that followed, I asked the Zelenskyys for their opinion of Putin. ""It seems to me the scariest thing about it is that he is in fact sane, and he understands what he’s doing,"" the president replied. ""I’d say that’s the scariest conclusion I can make — that he understands what he’s doing, he knows how many people he kills. He knows how many people were raped, and by who, and the number of children killed or deported. Therefore, I only understand one thing: The world allowed this situation to develop, it allowed such a person to emerge, with that ideology and attitude towards people. The world should understand that this result — this mistake, to allow this situation — is the responsibility of the whole world."" The first lady couldn’t even bring herself to describe her contempt for the Russian dictator. ""It’s difficult to put it into words,"" she said, her face etched with cold fury. ""It’s not possible to understand how one crooked idea can throw the whole of mankind into the medieval ages. I really don’t have words, and I really don’t want to say anything aloud because normal words don’t exist to describe this."" I told the president that everywhere I’d been in Ukraine, the people react with horror at the thought of him doing any deal with Russia that cedes an inch of territory. ""They hate and it is understandable,"" he replied. ""When so many families have lost for example their neighbors, their children. Can Russia give a child back? There are no emotions, only one emotion, hate."" Then he added: ""We are not prepared to exchange or trade the territory of the independent state of Ukraine."" Zelenska said she understood the hate. ""Any civilized person during this war would have terrible feelings, fear and hate towards the enemy. If you try to explain what kind of feelings the ordinary person has during the current war, I would tell them when they take their child to bed, try to imagine what is going to happen at night if they heard the sirens, and explosions next to the building where they live. What would they grab from their children’s bedroom and where would they run to if they recognize there is already a large queue of cars trying to leave the city. Are they going to take their pets with them? And imagine if you stayed there, and you are under occupation. In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office on Saturday, June 18, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, right, awards a serviceman as he visits the war-hit Mykolaiv region. ""Imagine the road you usually take your child to school with tanks on it. The grave of your close relative in your back garden because you can’t have a normal funeral to remember them. And imagine you have to search for water and your only source is a dirty puddle like it was in Mariupol. The medical service is not available. Just imagine you are in your home, and in two hours’ time, you are forced to deal with these kinds of problems just to survive and you don’t understand why this is happening."" It was the most powerful illustration of the reality of war among a civilian population that I’ve heard. As their 18-year-old daughter, Oleksandra, prepares for university, their 9-year-old son, Kyrylo, now wants to be a soldier. ""As a father, I would be proud if my son became a soldier, I can provide the support for him. I know he is wearing military-style clothing. He’s got quite a lot of weapons, not the kind of weapons we’ve got from our partners. He’s ready to protect his mother and our family."" – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in Kyiv, Ukraine As for whether he really believes he can win this war against a far larger military force, Zelenskyy was unflinching in his certainty he would defeat Putin. ""Yes, I don’t only believe it, I know it will happen. We will win, we already showed the whole world that he can kill us but to conquer our people is impossible. He can occupy these towns and villages, but all of them would be destroyed. Because without ruining them, they will not be able to take those places."" The first lady had just returned from a trip to Washington, D.C., to plead for Congress to provide Ukraine with more tools to fight the war. Yet despite donating over $40 billion worth of weaponry, President Biden still hasn’t visited Ukraine like so many other world leaders have done despite a personal invitation from Zelenskyy. And the Ukrainian leader wants that to change. ""Would like you like President Biden to come?"" I asked. ""Very much!"" he said in English. Then reverting to Ukrainian, he said: ""I believe this would be a great signal, a big signal. Everyone sees Ukraine’s attitude towards the U.S. This would be the highest support. And we had huge support from the first lady. She met with Olena, and it was the correct visit. Very, I would say, unexpected. I would say we were waiting for it a lot, but we didn’t expect it to happen. These are very important things. President Biden and first lady Jill Biden greet Olena Zelenska, spouse of Ukrainian's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in Washington, Tuesday, July 19, 2022. ""Then the trip, Olena will not say it for herself, I can say it — that was a very important moment, she did a great job. And her efforts really worked. There are quick decisions from the Congress and the White House that emerged after her speech and her visit. And these are very important things. And of course, the visit of President Biden to Ukraine would be the strongest signal which can be given in support of Ukraine."" ""Have you invited him?"" ""Yes."" ""Are you hopeful he will come?"" ""I don’t know, that is his choice. I mean, not even his choice, it’s his security, it’s their choice. I think if he has a chance, he will come."" ""Is there more America could be doing right now?"" I asked. ""As the president of a country that is in a war, I can tell you that the help would not be sufficient until the war is over, and until we win. A few times I’ve spoken with President Biden and I told him about our people and about our country, I said, ‘Forgive me if I’m quite firm in my position’ — maybe some things are not very diplomatic, but he gave me quite a dignified response, that he understands and he would do the same in my place."" When I said there were a growing number of Americans who don’t think the country should be spending so much money on a war in Europe when there are so many problems domestically, he responded passionately: ""We are fighting for absolutely communal values. The war in Ukraine is still the war against those values that are professed in the United States and in Europe. Russian rockets can fly over a few thousand kilometers. And tomorrow they will have rockets that can cover tens of thousands of kilometers. What difference does it make? They kill civilians who do not agree with the politics of the president of Russia. So, this war here and now in Ukraine, and forgive me that I’m saying it so cynically, is for the safety of Europe. ""As long as we are resisting it, the integrity of the United States will continue, therefore we are giving our lives for your values and the joint security of the world. Therefore, inflation is nothing, is nothing. Ask those people who lost their children, their peace, their property at the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion. Who is thinking about masks and ? Who is thinking about inflation? These things are secondary. The most important thing is to survive and preserve your life, your family, and your country. Therefore, at the moment we are doing this job, but the West has to help us."" Throughout the interview, the Zelenskyys turned down the use of a real-time translator device to understand what I was saying, indicating they both have a good grasp of English. But my Ukrainian is severely limited — just two words, in fact, but they were all I needed. ""Mr. President, first lady, I salute you, we’re all behind you. We need you to win this war, keep fighting. !"" ""Glory to the heroes!"" replied Zelenskyy. ""Thank you."" I don’t know if Ukraine can win this war against such seemingly difficult odds, but I do know the Zelenskyys believe they will, and this remarkable couple’s fierce certainty fills me with the same hope they’ve instilled in their people.",0

Lawmakers and foreign policy experts weighed in on the greatest threats facing the United States, and those that may be overlooked, with a focus on China, Russia, Iran and climate change. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, noted that despite near-term threats like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the long-term threat was China. ""Through technology, through their militarization of other areas, port activities, the Belt and Road Initiative … there are so many things China will engage in as a way to move around the globe unfettered, and that, I would say, is the largest threat facing the United States right now,"" Ernst told Fox News Digital at last week’s Aspen Security Forum. China's ""Belt and Road Initiative"" is the country's infrastructure program intended to link China with more than 100 countries around the world through railroad, shipping and energy projects. , 'S : ‘ ’ Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., echoed Ernst’s sentiment that Russia posed an immediate threat, with China’s rise being a long-term challenge, calling competition with China around technology the ""competition of this century."" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in Washington. Michèle Flournoy, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, told Fox News Digital the greatest threat facing the United States is ""the risk that authoritarian powers like Russia and China will actually use force to change international borders, to impose their will on other countries, and to also threaten the rules of the road that have protected our way of life for decades."" Former Democratic U.S. Representative from California Jane Harman noted that what is happening inside the United States also poses a threat to the country. ""This toxic partisanship, lack of civility, inability to even try to understand where the other person is coming from, then you add guns to this, and you have a clearly explosive situation,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""So that is one huge threat."" : ‘ ,’ Harman also said a significant threat is that, following the Cold War, the United States ""failed … to articulate a strategy for global U.S. leadership going forward."" In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a keynote speech via video for the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference, in Beijing Tuesday, April 20, 2021.

And while China and Russia topped the list of the greatest threat to the United States, there were others that lawmakers and national security experts said were not getting enough attention. Ernst said the United States should pay more attention to Iran, saying the country is becoming a greater threat ""not just to the United States, but also to our partners in the Middle East."" Flournoy said climate change is a ""very real threat,"" adding that there is a threat for future pandemics, and the country should ""do more to learn lessons from to try to be better positioned to try to prevent the next pandemics."" Flournoy also mentioned ""perennial risks like terrorism and nuclear proliferation"" that the United States should keep an eye on. 'S - ? Harman pointed out that Biden’s foreign policy has remained focused on Europe and Asia, but China and Russia ""play"" in Africa and South America, and the United States should not overlook them. Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, June 5, 2019. As evidence of this, Harman mentioned the resolution in the General Assembly to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in which 35 countries abstained from voting. ""The abstentions were from the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America,"" she said. ""We’d better understand that in a multi-polar world… we absolutely need support from countries in Africa and Latin America, and they are sadly still not at the top of our agenda."" Among the countries who abstained from voting on the resolution were China, Cuba and Nicaragua. Five countries voted against the resolution, which said the ""deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine."" . : ‘ A ’ Harman also mentioned the threat of nuclear proliferation by countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia, and the lack of international norms around cyber. ""How scared do you want to be?"" she asked. Nye echoed Flournoy’s sentiment that climate change is a long-term threat, but that it is not at the forefront of the public’s mind. ""When you poll people, and you ask them how much of a problem is climate… it sort-of ranks number 17,"" he said. Nye also added that cyber and space will be increasingly important. ""There are a lot of things of that sort that aren’t on the front page, but are very important,"" he said. 'S , 'S - Ernst called on the United States to focus more on South and Central America, saying that if we did not engage ""our own backyard"" it would be ""a free for all between the Russians and the Chinese.""

""For me, it would be China number one and Russia number two,"" he said, adding that issues ""occurring here in the country"" are not being talked about enough. ""We have extreme political partisanship from both sides that is causing dysfunction in Washington, D.C., and as a result, we’re not dealing with an exploding national debt,"" he added.

Russian officials have long pushed for the release of Bout, who is currently serving a 25-year sentence in U.S. prison after being convicted in 2011 of conspiracy to kill Americans, conspiracy to deliver anti-aircraft missiles, and aiding a terrorist organization. He was nabbed in 2008 in a sting operation at a luxury hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, where he met with Drug Enforcement Administration informants who were posing as officials with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which has been classified by officials as a narco-terrorist group. Prosecutors said that Bout was prepared to provide the group with $20 million worth of ""a breathtaking arsenal of weapons — including hundreds of surface-to-air missiles, machine guns and sniper rifles — 10 million rounds of ammunition and five tons of plastic explosives.""

Blinken announced this week that the Biden administration made the proposal weeks ago and is hoping to speak to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for the first time since Feb. 15. Blinken did not offer details on the nature of the proposal, but the possibility of a prisoner swap has been rumored.

One name mentioned as a possible candidate for a prisoner swap is Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer known as the ""Merchant of Death,"" who is serving a 25-year sentence after being convicted of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and providing aid to a terrorist organization.

2022-07-30,https://www.foxnews.com/world/raising-red-alert-over-italy-threat-putins-interference-hovers-over-upcoming-election,'Red alarm' raised in Italy while threat of Putin's interference hovers over upcoming election,"Paolucci co-authored ‘Oligarchs’ and ‘How Putin’s Friends are Buying Italy.’ , Italy – ""Putin’s Patriots"" was plastered across the front page of Italy’s La Stampa newspaper Thursday under a photo of the far-right Lega, or League, party leader Matteo Salvini giving a thumbs-up as he smiled in a T-shirt emblazoned with the Russian president’s likeness. It is an old photo. But it's a story with brand new legs. There are allegations the Russians actively pushed for certain Italian parties to pull their support from outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi, one of the European leaders who's been toughest on Russia in the wake of its war on Ukraine. Salvini insists Russia was not behind the fall of this government. But he does advocate dialogue with Vladimir Putin. Before the war, he even advertised support for the Russian leader in slightly better days. All of this adds to fears about Russia ending up somehow the winner of next month’s Italian elections. Enrico Letta, leader of the center-left , or Democratic Party, earlier this week raised the alert because he says Russia has meddled in Western elections before in the United States and the United Kingdom, and this time the stakes couldn’t be higher. Italian Premier Mario Draghi waves to lawmakers at the end of his address at the Parliament in Rome Thursday, July 21, 2022. ""I launch a red alarm on that. And I would like to have the Italian government and Italian intelligence ,"" Letta said. ""And I would also like to ask the European Union because there's a unit within the European Union focused on that to help us to have elections without any external Russian influence."" Mario Draghi resigned earlier this month because some parties in the coalition government he’d been charged with leading last year when former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte stepped down pulled their support for him. They did so partly over resistance to some of his reforms. The former central bank president, often called ""Super Mario"" and credited with saving the euro, had been considered by many a safe choice for both Italy and Europe in rocky times. But Draghi wasn’t part of all the all-important political parties. And Italy’s political landscape does not stay calm for long. The next government will be the 70th since World War . If you believe the polls, it is likely to be a coalition of the right. 'S Gianluca Paolucci, co-author of ""Oligarchs"" and ""How Putin’s Friends are Buying Italy"" doesn’t suggest, as some have speculated, that the Kremlin actually bought the no-confidence measure. But he does say those who engineered Draghi’s demise are more sympathetic toward Putin and may give him a break going forward. That may not change the trajectory of the war. But it could do a number on European cohesion. ""We all know about the relation between Mr. Salvini and the League Party and United Russia, the party of President Putin,"" Paolucci told Fox News. ""And about oligarchs and the far right here. And then there is the Five Star Movement."" Scheherazade, one of the world's biggest and most expensive yachts linked to Russian billionaires, is moored in the harbor of the small Italian town of Marina di Carrara, Italy, March 23, 2022. Paolucci recalled how the leader of that party and then prime minister invited some Russian emergency teams in to help handle the pandemic in its early days when Italy was hit hard. It turned out those Russians were not just medics and sanitary technicians but members of the military. And the images of them fanning across towns in northern Italy raised eyebrows. ""That was quite shocking to see this long queue of Russian military in Italy,"" Paolucci said. ""I mean, the whole country was closed at home at the time."" Experts and the polls say the next government will be right leaning, likely a coalition. But it is the most far-right party of the grouping that looks set to take the helm. Giorgia Meloni is the leader of the Fratelli d'Italia, or Brothers of Italy. And if that party gets the most votes as predicted, Meloni will probably be Italy's first female prime minister. The party insists it will not go easy on Russia. Party officials say they’ll be in lockstep with Europe, and the United States in standing up to Putin as long as this war rages. Fratelli d'Italia party leader Giorgia Meloni attends a rally for the elections in Piazza Roma May 30, 2022, in Monza, Italy. ""We have strongly condemned the invasion of Russia, and we have a solid sense of belonging and conviction within the Atlantic Alliance,"" said Raffaele Fitto of Brothers of Italy and co-president of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group in the European Parliament. 'S 'S , The center-left , the second-strongest single party, isn’t convinced that Brothers of Italy will work well with the country’s European allies on Russia and beyond. The party is accused of being anti-Europe. Its detractors say the party is born of the fascist tradition in this country, but Letta suggests that label may be too simplistic. ""Our electoral campaign could be an electoral campaign in which the word ‘fascism’ can be repeated many times,"" Letta said this week. ""But I think, to win this election, I have to explain to voters why it is better to vote for us because it’s in their own interests in terms of social dimension, in terms of salaries, jobs and the fight against climate change."" Leaders of the Brothers of Italy say they will effectively champion all those causes — except for fascism, which they call a smear. ""It is a party that today has the consent of one in four Italians and probably even higher in a month,"" Fitto says. ""We are a party that has deep roots in democracy, and what we strongly ask is to go and vote to have a government legitimized by the choice of citizens."" These are citizens — like many across the globe — who will ultimately be most worried about fuel bills, jobs and inflation. Russia plays big in this equation. But obviously it is just a piece of the political puzzle. And for sure, Russia will be eagerly awaiting the results of Italy’s Sept. 25 election. Maybe almost as eagerly as the Italians will be.",22

Guy Reschenthaler, a Pennsylvania Republican, sent a letter to Blinken on Wednesday asking that Fogel, a longtime teacher, be included in the government’s potential deal with Russia to exchange Marine Corps.

""I will commend the administration for including ... Whelan in this prisoner swap now. However, Mr. Fogle should always have been included.""

""Arguments to the contrary are intellectually lazy and morally bankrupt: Intellectually lazy, because data shows no correlation between the way these cases are resolved and the number of cases that follow; morally bankrupt, because the government's efforts to disincentivize and deter the taking of Americans cannot be done on the backs of those already imprisoned."" , 'S ‘ ’ ""The 'deals' do not create or destroy deterrence,"" he added.

Viktor Bout walks past temporary cells ahead of a hearing in Bangkok on Aug. 20, 2010. ""If a judgment is made … we can track this guy and make sure he never returns to his illicit ways – meaning he'll continue to be sanctioned,"" Rubin explained, arguing that Bout would be ""restless [to] get back into business.""

A 50 Rubin called Griner’s imprisonment and trial a ""horrible situation"" that Russia has repeatedly mined for propaganda. He acknowledged that Griner traveled to Russia despite U.S. warnings to the contrary – something the State Department does ""to avoid what we’re in right now."" ""Basically, it is our number one duty to take care of Americans, so here we are,"" Rubin said. ""Viktor Bout has served a lot of time, but he is a criminal – an arms trader – and has blood on his hands … and [he’s] high value for the Russians,"" adding that Russia could call it a ""symbolic coup"" to obtain his freedom.

2022-08-04,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-china-grow-closer-following-pelosis-taiwan-visit,Russia and China grow closer following Pelosi’s Taiwan visit,"Rep. Mike Gallagher has the latest on anti-U.S. threats and possible future invasion of Taiwan on ‘The Story.’ It was predictable that Russia’s Foreign Minister would rip House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan, calling it an ""annoyance"" and accusing America of the very thing the West blames Russian President Vladimir Putin of constantly flaunting: Impunity. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s point was that despite warnings from China that it did not want her in its backyard, Pelosi did what she wanted to and got away with it. China, of course, cannot dictate the travel of American lawmakers, but it can be provoked. ""Those who play with fire will not come to a good end,"" threatened China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The visit so roiled Beijing that it has apparently led to practically shore-lapping military exercises that will encircle the island nation this week. Given Ukraine is often seen as a litmus test for China regarding its designs on Taiwan, how does this play into the bigger geopolitical picture and specifically the escalating tensions between the United States and a Russia essentially being backed by China? The answer is—it does not, according to Dmitri Trenin, who served in the Soviet and Russian armies and reached the rank of colonel before going on to become a military and political analyst. Russia and the U.S., he says, are waging an indirect war in Ukraine. Trenin told Fox News, ""But, it may make the Chinese drop their lingering illusions concerning doing business with the United States. That would be good for Russia."" Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping pose during a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse on Feb. 4, 2022. 2024 : Trenin, who now holds positions at both Russia’s Institute of World Economy and International Relations and the Higher School of Economics in Russia, said that at the same time ""the Chinese interest in keeping their access to Western markets makes them very careful not to run afoul of the U.S. on the Russia sanctions issue."" Trenin says the Russians have gotten used to that. ""They know that China is always after its own interests, and they look for areas/instances when these coincide with their own."" Pelosi is the highest-ranking United States official to visit Taiwan in a quarter of a century. ""America made a promise to always stand with Taiwan,"" she said. ""Today our delegation came to Taiwan to make it unequivocally clear we will not abandon our commitment to Taiwan."" Trenin says he believes ""many if not most"" in the rest of the world actually saw the visit as ""a reckless provocation in support of pure personal/party ambitions of the Speaker, at the price of risking a direct military collision between two nuclear-armed superpowers."" But the visit does show, he said, that ""The U.S. remains the world’s top player by far. It can handle both adversaries, Russia and China, simultaneously. Essentially, Washington insists that it can do as it pleases anywhere in the world, ignoring the protests of the major powers."" On Thursday morning, deputy chairman of Russia’s security council Dmitry Medvedev even added a threatening note, saying ""The United States will now have global consequences,"" he said. ""No one can guarantee that the next flight of some restless old woman will reach the selected point."" 'S : , U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, center pose for photos after she arrives in Taipei, Taiwan, Tuesday, Aug. 2, 2022.

Shoigu and Wei signed a roadmap for military cooperation between Moscow and Beijing and called for intensifying joint drills and patrols. Trenin claims Russia-China ties are also pretty strong. They have passed the post-February 24th ""stress test,"" he says. Perhaps most significantly, Trenin concludes, the pivot East for Russia is complete, ending what he describes as a 300-year Western orientation, ""for better or for worse."" ""Moscow,"" he says, ""is already shifting resources in that direction. The ambassadorship in Beijing is going to be more important than , Delhi more prestigious than Berlin and Tehran will outrank Paris.""",5

2022-08-06,https://www.foxnews.com/world/how-kremlin-bank-account-looking,How is that Kremlin bank account looking?,"The editor of one of Russia’s most respected independent economic journals speaks to Fox News correspondent Amy Kellogg on the Russian economy. , Italy – The editor of one of Russia’s most respected independent economic journals grudgingly concedes Team Putin is riding the sanction storm well. ""We’ve had some figures for the first half of 2022 released, and the overall feeling is much more optimistic than it was in March or April,"" Peter Mironenko of ""The Bell"" tells Fox News. ""We see the figures. They are not manipulated. On the one hand, we see economic downturn in the second quarter. fell around 4%, and in the third quarter we will have about 7%. This is recession. But the scale is much more modest than it was said to be three or four months ago."" And less dramatic than it was in 2009 when war wasn't waging; it’s also less than Russia’s Central Bank’s initial prediction of an 8-10% decline this year. And there is more. Household income is down just 0.8%, according to Mironenko. Right now, there is even deflation. Some people have simply been spooked by the political situation into spending less, saving for an even rainier day. Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting on the country's transport industry via a video link in Sochi, Russia, May 24, 2022. 'S There is less foreign stuff to buy, so some Russians are writing that off, but in fact, imported items can still be bought — between brokers and the surprisingly strong ruble, Mironenko says an iPhone will cost you pretty much the same as it did a year ago. He himself was shocked to discover the fact when he recently bought one for his father. The government has, he says, sagely avoided price controls even if everything else they do feels like going back to the . Unemployment is at a historic low. Some of this is artificial. The government has increased pensions and salaries since the war began, because it can. ""The sanctions didn’t decrease the income of the Russian budget from oil exports, so the government has money,"" said Mironenko, who recently went into exile due to the immense pressures on the press. Oil storage tanks stand at the -Tuapsinsky refinery, operated by Rosneft Oil Co., as tankers sail beyond in Tuapse, Russia, March 23, 2020. ""It will in 2022 and in 2023, and as we know, historically, Vladimir Putin’s government was also very good, very cautious about people’s personal income. His whole ‘prosperity legend’ is based on the constant increase of people’s personal income. Since 2000, it was very linked with the growing oil prices."" But anyway, Mironenko adds, Putin has to keep that prosperity project up, and as long as Moscow has the funds, it will spend them on keeping Russians in the black. ? How long will that be, I ask Mironenko? He does admit sanctions are working, in theory, but he says, ""It’s a long process. Historically, there are not a lot of examples when even the heaviest sanctions do their job in a year. I don’t think we’ll see any effects, policy changes before three to five years."" The energy dance is a tricky one, according to Mironenko, who explains that oil is more important than gas for Russia’s coffers, so in some ways a commodity to be played with. The Kremlin's Spasskaya Tower and St. Basil's Cathedral are seen through the art object in Zaryadye Park in Moscow, Russia, March 15, 2022. ) Putin started a game of decreasing gas flow to Europe supposedly to see if that will make Brussels nervous enough to loosen sanctions. Pain, apparently worth enduring for now. But when the European ban on Russian oil kicks in at the end of the year, there could be a real flare-up of distress in Russia, and Mironenko will be watching that moment closely. Meanwhile, when it comes to public opinion, it’s not just the propaganda-imbibing crowd in Russia that blame the West for any woes they are experiencing even if the economy is for the moment apparently, if perhaps artificially, strong. It is harder to have a life connected to the outside world, and for many educated and democratically minded Russians, that is vital. Mironenko says there’s a lot of anger building among those who feel shut out from the West, and also much debate about how and where one should from a moral perspective live one’s life. So, while the economy may be quite solvent for the moment, soul-searching and angst are dragging many Russians down.",0

Tulsi Gabbard sounded off on Vice President Kamala Harris's hypocrisy, comparing her action toward cannabis criminals as California attorney general to her criticizing Russia over basketball player Brittney Griner. Former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard slammed Vice President Kamala Harris' record on marijuana prosecution after Harris condemned Russia's imprisonment of star Brittney Griner on a cannabis charge. ""Another note of hypocrisy coming from Kamala Harris and this administration is you mentioned during her illustrious record as attorney general in California…she kept prisoners in prison longer than their sentences to use them as free slave labor yet at the same time these very same people are condemning other countries for doing the exact same thing,"" Gabbard told Fox News host Will Cain. Griner was sentenced by a Russian court to 9 years in prison this week after being caught with a cannabis vape pen at an airport near Moscow earlier this year. The sentence earned widespread condemnation from U.S. officials including Harris who said she is working to secure Griner's release. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a meeting with North Carolina state legislators on reproductive rights at the Carole Hoefener Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, , on Thursday, July 21, 2022. ""With today’s sentencing, Russia continues its wrongful detention of Brittney Griner. She should be released immediately,"" Harris tweeted on Thursday. ""@ and I, and our entire Administration, are working every day to reunite Brittney, as well as Paul Whelan, with loved ones who miss each of them dearly."" Gabbard, who pointed out that she also opposes Griner's sentence, said that the ""thing that struck me"" about the tweet from Harris is that her administration has not expressed the same sentiment for people accused of marijuana crimes domestically. 'S Brittany Griner is escorted by police before her hearing in Russia. ""Where is your outrage for your fellow Americans who are sitting in prison today here in the United States of America for minor marijuana violations,"" Gabbard said. ""How come you are not fighting as hard for them to be returned home and reunited with their families as you are for Brittney Griner."" Gabbard added that she believes Harris is sending the message that the rich and powerful in the United States will be treated differently than average Americans when it comes to prosecuting marijuana crimes. Tulsi Gabbard, former Representative from Hawaii, speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, U.S., on Friday, Feb. 25, 2022. ""Unfortunately, like too many politicians, it seems that she puts her finger to the wind and decides the things she's supposed to be angry about on any given day and if it becomes politically inconvenient or damaging then she'll switch the other way,"" Gabbard said about Harris prosecuting marijuana offenders as California's attorney general.

The U.S. is pushing for a prisoner swap that would bring Griner back to the U.S. along with Paul Whelan, who is being imprisoned on an espionage charge. In exchange, it is rumored that the U.S. would offer up Russian arms trader Viktor Bout. Haley supported the idea of bringing Griner and Whelan home, but was firmly opposed to paying that kind of price. ""This is not a Russian hockey player that they want to swap. This is a Russian arms dealer that was giving terrorists weapons to kill Americans. Make no mistake, that is dangerous,"" Haley said. ""And if you do this prisoner swap, this is letting Russia know and every enemy we have know: get as many American hostages as you can, because that’s how we’ll get all our terrorists back home.

""It is a tremendous honor to receive this award, especially given the standing of Hardwired Global in the Human Rights community,"" Freedom told Fox News Digital. Freedom's award comes after years of advocacy for human rights, a personal mission that has often left him at odds with the and star players in the league. Freedom grew up in Turkey after being born to Turkish parents in Switzerland, moving to the U.S. when he was a teenager. He was drafted 3rd overall in the 2011 Draft by the Utah Jazz, but soon his career would become defined more by what he did off the court than on it. Freedom, who was born Enes Kanter but changed his last name to Enes Kanter Freedom when he gained U.S. citizenship last year, began speaking out against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in 2013. In 2016, he took to Twitter to call Erdoğan, who has long faced accusations of human rights violations from international observers, the ""Hitler of our century."" His support for a failed coup attempt that same year resulted in him being disowned by his family, who encouraged him to change his surname. : ' ' Boston Celtics' Enes Kanter smiles before an basketball game against the Toronto Raptors, on Oct. 22, 2021, in Boston.

The move left him stateless and in fear of traveling overseas, once refusing to take a 2019 trip with the New York Knicks over fears for his safety. A 2019 story detailed the perils of Freedom's outspokenness, reporting that the had outfitted the player with a device that allows him to alert nearby agents in an emergency because of the credible threats to his life. But Freedom's advocacy has not been limited to Turkey. He has expressed support for the Free Tibet movement on social media, and in 2021 spoke out against Chinese President Xi Jinping. The move was controversial with the , which in recent years has sidestepped speaking out against China over fears that it could alienate the league from what it sees as an important new market. The Chinese government retaliated by stopping streams of all Boston Celtics games, the team for which Freedom played at the time, but the move did not cause Freedom to back down from his outspoken approach.

Last month, Freedom took aim at James again for his comments on jailed star Brittney Griner, arguing that James took America's freedoms for granted when he argued that Griner may not want to return to the U.S. from Russia.

2022-08-09,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/three-reasons-biden-russian-prisoner-swap-bad-idea,Three reasons why Biden's Russian prisoner swap is a bad idea,"Former U.S. intel officer Rebekah Koffler provides analysis on the Russian courts’ decision to sentence player Brittney Griner to 9 years in prison on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.’ President Joe Biden recently stated that his administration will ""pursue every possible avenue"" to bring U.S. citizens Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan home to the United States. Griner, a women’s basketball star, was sentenced last week by a Russian court to nine years in prison for marijuana possession, a crime in Russia for which she had pleaded guilty. Whelan is serving a 16-year jail term in Russia on espionage charges, accused of receiving and possessing classified information on a drive. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken confirmed on Friday that the United States put forward a ""substantial proposal"" to Putin’s regime for a prisoner exchange, which reportedly would entail releasing Viktor Bout, a dangerous Russian arms trafficker, back to Russia in exchange for Griner and Whelan. Bad idea. Here are the top three reasons why this potential deal is not in U.S. interests and should not take place. 'S - First, the deal would embolden Putin to continue using ""hostage diplomacy"" to achieve his anti-American agenda. The Biden administration may bring two Americans home, scoring much needed political points -- at a time the president’s popularity is at historic lows -- but it will endanger many more Americans in the future and harm U.S. security. For years, the Russian government has used prisoner exchanges to retrieve Russian intelligence operatives, cyber criminals, and other types of Russian citizens held in U.S. prisons. Typically, however, the Russians get away with extorting much more valuable Russian nationals, in exchange for ordinary Americans who break Russian law, sometimes unwittingly. The Russians have perfected this playbook. In April, the Biden administration exchanged a former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, who was serving a 9-year sentence in a Russian labor camp, after being convicted of assaulting two Russian police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow. The Russians got back Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot who was arrested by special forces in 2010 in Liberia and sentenced to 20 years of prison time in jail in 2011 for conspiring to smuggle more than $100 million worth of cocaine into the United States. In 2021, the Biden administration quietly deported back to Russia the world’s most dangerous cybercriminal, Alexei Burkov, who had been sentenced to nine years in prison in America. An elite hacker, Burkov operated a website, which sold stolen numbers of credit and debit cards and extorted millions of dollars in ransom from businesses, in return for unlocking infected computer networks. No Americans appear to have been released by the Russians, and there’s a congressional investigation underway to determine if the Biden Administration got anything in return. In 2010, the Obama administration released ten Russian spies who had been infiltrated into the United States by Russian intelligence Service, the , ten years earlier. These deep cover agents posed as Americans, blending into regular American day-to-day life, with the goal of penetrating top echelons of U.S. government in order to influence U.S. politics. Some of the sleeper agents in this spy ring got close to infiltrating Hillary Clinton’s circle. The U.S. government did not rescue any Americans out of Russia in exchange for these Russian sleeper agents. Instead, it brought in just four Russian citizens – one nuclear scientist, two intelligence operatives, and one agent – who had been jailed by the Russians for providing secrets to U.S. government. Second, giving up Viktor Bout to the Russians would harm American security. Bout is not just a regular Russian criminal. He is a high-value asset for the Russians, having ties to Russian spy services and indirect links to Putin himself. Bout is the world’s most prolific international arms trafficker and is serving a 25-year federal sentence for conspiring to kill Americans. This former military intelligence officer was conspiring to sell millions of dollars-worth of weaponry and 10 million rounds of ammunition to a Colombian narco-terrorist organization before he was arrested in a sting operation by U.S. law enforcement officers. Bout has already spent 15 years in prison and has been thoroughly interrogated by officers. As a highly trained military intelligence officer, he is also a gifted linguist with command of five languages. Bout undoubtedly has critical insights to share with his former comrades in Russian intelligence about what he experienced in the hands of U.S. debriefers and what was of interest to them. Bout is connected to a Putin ally, Igor Sechin, who is a former deputy prime minister of Russia and currently the of Rosneft, Russia’s state-owned energy conglomerate. Despite being isolated in a prison cell for over a decade, Bout never gave up his connection the Sechin, a fellow intelligence operative with whom he had served in the Soviet military running operations abroad. Finally, by giving up Viktor Bout, President Biden would waste millions of dollars from the U.S. intelligence budget and demoralize dozens and possibly hundreds of American law enforcement officers, intelligence analysts, and support personnel who made it possible to capture this criminal. U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency officers finally arrested him in a hotel in Thailand in 2008 after almost a decade-long operation. Similarly, it took ten years of scrupulous work by counter-intelligence to nab Putin’s spy ring of sleeper agents in 2010. With a stroke of a pen President Biden, and Obama before him, undid all that hard and often dangerous work by U.S. officers. The Russians are acutely aware of President Biden’s naïveté, weakness, and his self-interest at a time his domestic popularity is at historical lows. They have floated the idea of adding another Russian criminal to the Griner-Whelan-Bout swap – Vadim Krasikov, another Russian spy who was sentenced to life in prison in Germany for having assassinated a former Chechen fighter on German soil. President Biden must prioritize American interests and security by keeping Viktor Bout in jail.",18

A majority, 70%, says life will be worse for the next generation than it is today — up 29 percentage points from July 2020. The last time voters were close to being this negative about the future was in September 2014, when 61% said it would be worse. All of this comes as voters continue to offer pessimistic views of both the national economy and their personal finances. Eight in 10 rate national economic conditions as only fair or poor, while about six in 10 rate their personal finances negatively. On top of this, three-quarters are dissatisfied with the direction of the country — the highest negative rating in a decade. Almost eight in 10 Republicans and independents say life will be worse for the next generation, a 40+ point increase from two summers ago. - Over half of Democrats are also more likely to think life will be more difficult , up 9 points since 2020. However, they are one of the only subgroups where the belief that life will get better for younger generations is up . Voters under age 30 are just as likely as voters ages 65 and over to say life will be worse for the youth of America. Overall, a quarter think life will improve for young Americans. With midterm elections three months away, voters are split on their generic ballot preference at 41% apiece. Of the 70% saying the next generation will be worse off, those voters break for the by 14 points. The 25% who say life will be better favor the Democrat by 34. Voters say some of the gravest threats to the stability of the U.S. are at home as well as abroad. Number one? Gun violence. Sixty-four percent say it is a ""major"" threat to the stability of the country. Several high-profile shootings in the last three months could well lead voters to perceive gun violence as a serious concern. China and Russia are also in the top tier of major threats. Back at home, domestic extremist groups , big government and climate change round out a second tier of perceived threats, while illegal immigration and people refusing to accept election results come in somewhat lower on the scale.

Now you see Iran trying to build a nuclear weapon, but they're also going in now trying to assassinate Americans on our own soil. That was the day America became weak. That was the day the world became less safe. And it was all because of the decisions the Biden administration made. And now you say, , what's the solution to that? The solution is to snap out of it. We need to get strong. How are these terrorists wanting to come to America through the southern border, close the southern border, start to be strong against China, start to hold and have Ukraine's back, start to make sure we get Taiwan ready.

""Just look at Wyoming, where voters this week drubbed a former senior member of the Republican establishment out of office on orders from former President Donald Trump,"" he said. The writer suggested in the article that Cheney, after losing by a massive margin in the Wyoming Republican primary, had somehow been erased from party history like somebody who had run afoul of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.

""The open question is if Cheney can jam the gear with sufficient force to at least make it lurch, or if the machine will keep grinding her further and further from real power."" Twitter users skewered the piece for saying the Republican Party had used the ""Soviet skill"" of disappearing people to oust Cheney. Examiner columnist T.

Taiwanese military personnel showed confidence in the face of a potential Chinese invasion, demonstrating some of the contested island's most powerful anti-aircraft weapons to the media. ""Our regular training is prepared for all-day, 24-hours, missile operations,"" a member of Taiwan's military told a group of reporters Wednesday. ""When the Chinese military acted, we were already well-prepared…. We were not nervous at all."" The comments came during a demonstration of some of the island's most formidable defensive weaponry on Taiwan's Matsu islands, a chain situated just over six miles from China's coast. Despite the military's confidence in the face of the recent escalation of tensions in the region, many locals on the island fear it would become the front line if a Chinese invasion ever came to fruition. ""I don't feel particularly safe - after all this island, Dongyin, would be the front line of the battlefield,"" Dora Liu, a resident of the island, told Reuters. ""A small island like ours could be taken down in a moment… If there is a war, there would be no place to hide. No matter how many tunnels we have, if they really occupied us, there would be no use in having tunnels."" Soldiers disembark from 7 amphibious assault vehicles during the Han Kuang military exercise, which simulates China's People's Liberation Army invading the island. ) Such fears have suddenly seemed more real in the aftermath of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent trip to Taiwan, a visit that China viewed as an escalation. Beijing considers the self-governing island part of its own territory. China responded by running a series of large military exercises in the Taiwan Strait aimed at showing its ability to strike at a moment's notice, a situation that only continued to escalate after five more U.S. lawmakers made a trip to Taiwan less than two weeks after Pelosi. The Matsu islands represent a potential initial target in a Chinese invasion, having been the site of shellings during a time of amplified tensions in the 1950s and 1960s. While the islands are now home to a thriving tourism industry, locals are increasingly cognizant of their vulnerability. ""I think a war is possible,"" Chien Chun-te, who owns a restaurant on Nangan Island, told Reuters. ""But I hope people in the two countries, and also both the governments, can communicate more.

Huang Tzu-chuan, who spent a month working on the islands, drew parallels to Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. ""We feel our relationship between Taiwan and China is just the same as theirs,"" Huang told Reuters. A Chinese invasion, like the Russian invasion, would force the Taiwanese to defend their country.

Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov has said he considers a pop star a friend, telling Russian media that Kirkorov has ""come forward to support his president when needed."" But Kirkorov's relationship with Putin has led to questions about why he has been allowed into the U.S. and has so far managed to avoid sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""It’s a shame that the U.S. government gave a visa to Kirkorov – who is sunning himself in Miami as Ukrainian refugees are scattered all over Europe scrambling to find food and shelter,"" Koffler said.

Former defense secretary Leon Panetta revealed the two reasons that Russia may wage attacks Wednesday on Ukraine on ""Your World."" 'S : I'm sure intelligence is trying to keep track of the growing threats from Russia. There are two things that are coming in at play here. One is Independence Day tomorrow, which celebrates 31 years of their independence. And the second is obviously the killing of the daughter of this ultra-nationalist. And the Russians say they're blaming Ukrainian intelligence for having conducted that assassination. Those two things obviously raise concerns that Russia is going to use tomorrow as a target for basically going after Ukraine. And I think it's for that reason that the alerts are going out not only to our citizens, but President Zelenskyy is also warning Ukrainians as well that there may be attacks.",0

David Petraeus reveals the terrorist group that is of true concern on ‘Your World.’ This article is part of a Fox News Digital series examining the consequences of the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan one year ago this week. The Taliban control of Afghanistan presents numerous opportunities for Russia and China to extend their influence in Central Asia and gain an ally in an important region on the international landscape, according to experts. Afghanistan spiraled into a staggering humanitarian crisis following the U.S. withdrawal in Aug. 2021. The United States Agency for International Development has provided assistance to Afghanistan – through non-profits and international aid groups - to help with food, shelter and health care. However, the country continues to struggle with a number of issues stemming from a lack of international recognition, which has resulted in a lack of support from other nations as the Taliban struggle to stabilize the political and economic problems within its borders. ""Many countries, particularly neighboring countries around Afghanistan, as well as countries like Russia and China, they've moved forward with de facto engagement,"" Peter Mills, an Afghanistan Researcher at the Institute for the Study of War, told Fox News Digital. ""They haven't formally recognized Taliban government, but they have at times accepted Taliban diplomatic representatives … So essentially, they've stopped just short of that formal recognition, but they've continued to engage with the Taliban."" ‘ ’ , The U.S. has remained a significant roadblock to any efforts at international recognition – even freezing $7 billion in assets that sit in Afghanistan’s banks – which could allow other nations to step in and exert influence in a nation that is as vulnerable as it is vital to regional stability. Lisa Curtis, former deputy assistant to the president and senior director for South and Central Asia and current Vandenberg Coalition advisory board member, has argued that the U.S. should condition any engagement with the Taliban, but acknowledges that other nations without the same scruples will step in to achieve their own operational goals in the region. Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi meets with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, political chief of Afghanistan's Taliban, in north China's Tianjin, July 28, 2021. ""I think we have to ask, what are we trying to achieve? We're not just engaging the Taliban for engagement’s sake,"" Curtis said. ""We have to be achieving our objectives, which are cracking down on terrorists and [ensuring] they're not repressing human rights, particularly the rights of women and girls."" ""Now, the Chinese and the Russians, they're going to try to accomplish their own objectives,"" she continued. ""For instance, the Chinese want the Taliban to crack down on the , the Islamic Turkistan Movement … Russia will focus on and its concerns about , so each country will have its own concerns with the Taliban, but the Russians and the Chinese are not going to care about women and girls’ rights. That's not something that they'll condition their engagement on."" , ‘’ ‘’ . 'T Afghanistan’s economic weakness provides China with the ideal opening to utilize its Belt and Road Initiative to establish influence over the country. The initiative, which some critics have labeled as debt-trap diplomacy, involves Beijing authorizing loans to struggling and developing nations with huge penalties in the event that the debts cannot be repaid. That economic approach has helped China establish a widespread and deeply-enmeshed influence in various areas around the world, including countries on the other side of the planet, but any such projects remain in the early stages, according to Mills. Taliban representative Anas Haqqani sits ahead of a meeting, in Oslo, Norway, on Jan. 24. Western diplomats were meeting with Afghan women’s rights activists and human rights defenders in Oslo ahead of the first official talks with the Taliban in Europe since the Taliban took over in August. ""Despite this continuing engagement and continuing talks, you know, we're still not really seeing China put forth substantive investment,"" Mills said, noting that there is ""a lot of talk"" but not much movement on several project ideas, including mining in the country or establishing a power plant in northern Afghanistan. ""We haven't so far seen large numbers of Chinese engineers or construction workers or, you know, equipment – all the things that you would expect if you were to actually start a major mining project or build major infrastructure … this could change in the near future, but so far, we haven't seen concrete action so far,"" he added. ‘ ’: . China has more of an interest in Afghanistan than does Russia – especially with the continued conflict in eastern Ukraine - but that does not mean Moscow is not paying attention to what is going on in the country. Russia might not have the economic capital to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis, but it does have other offerings. ""One just basic big one is, frankly, food,"" Mills explained. ""The fundamentals of the situation really haven't improved: We're still expecting potential famine conditions for this coming winter, which bottom line means Afghanistan is going to continue to need quite a bit of food aid to avoid that worst case scenario where, frankly, you have millions of people starving to death."" China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Brazil's Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo are pictured during a foreign ministers meeting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil July 26, 2019. /Ricardo Moraes Russia and Ukraine together account for roughly 30% of the world’s wheat supply – something that Moscow could leverage to gain some influence within Afghanistan. Mills also raised another, and potentially more problematic offering Russia could exploit: Military equipment and weapons. ""The Taliban continue to really prioritize both in maintenance and development of their military capabilities, including, you know, the vast quantities of military equipment that they captured when they conquered the country last August,"" he said. ""So that very much is a priority for them."" $7 , ""We are seeing them prioritize, for example, restoring to an operable status for like helicopters and including fixed wing aircraft,"" Mills continued. ""They have all fixed wing aircraft, which they are returning to service and actively using to support their military operations against anti-Taliban rebels, particularly in northeastern Afghanistan … this is an area where Russia for relatively low cost, could provide spare parts and equipment."" However, a relationship with the Taliban also provides benefits at a time when a significant number of countries maintain strict sanctions against Russia in response to the Ukraine invasion. President of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and former intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler noted that Russia continues to develop closer ties with the Taliban despite still listing the group as a terrorist organization, highlighting how desperately Moscow needs allies at this time. 'S 'S ""Although the Taliban is officially still designated as a terrorist organization in Russia, Putin is being pragmatic in fostering partnership with Kabul,"" Koffler told Fox News Digital. ""There are economic and other reasons for this, not the least of which is the fact that millions of dollars worth of sophisticated military hardware was left in Afghanistan during the chaotic withdrawal of forces from the country, driven by the Biden Administration’s self-interest to stick to artificial timeline."" The best course for the U.S. to possibly pursue would see it building partnerships with other countries in the region as a way to deter Chinese and Russian influence, especially after Russia showed a willingness to invade another, smaller nation on pretense alone in order to expand its sphere. ""We should definitely be engaging in that region, which is becoming even more important by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, because now you've got countries like Kazakhstan that shares, a 4000-mile border with Russia and has ethnic Russians in its northern areas,"" Curtis argued. ""So it is concerned that Russia might try to make a move in northern Kazakhstan like it's done in Ukraine."" ""So we certainly do need to be engaged in the Central Asian countries and competing with Russian and Chinese influence there,"" she added.",22

Editor's Note: This story first ran on Fox News April 9, 2013, but has been republished following the Tuesday announcement of Mikhail Gorbachev's death. The calendar read June 2004. But it was definitely the ‘80s. A trio of the world’s preeminent leaders from the waning days of the Cold War came together for the final time. Icons, they were as indelible from the cultural fabric of the decade as ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Family Ties"" airing back-to-back on Thursday nights, cult movies like ""Heathers"" and ""The Breakfast Club,"" and little old ladies demanding ""Where’s the beef?"" But this wasn’t like a rock band hitting the road for a reunion tour. The flag-draped casket flanked by an honor guard in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda explained that. This was farewell. 'S - , 'S - Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, left, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney attend the state funeral of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. They would visit their friend one last time in a moment. But for now, they waited. They were part of a line of people who stood in the hall running between the Rotunda and the Old Senate Chamber. The men wore dark suits. The women, dark dresses. But this duo stood out among the other mourners. For him, there was the vascular, port-wine birthmark. And for her, there was the purse. The purse. In other times, the purse might dangle from the left forearm as she waved to the crowd or photographers. But on this day, she clutched it close to her body like a satchel filled with diamonds. U.S. President Ronald Reagan, left, and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev leave Hofdi House after finishing their two days of talks during a mini-summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, on Oct. 12, 1986. Amid the murmuring, no one really thought much about it. But this was the ‘80s. And here you had Mikhail Gorbachev, the former general secretary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Right Honorable Baroness Margaret Thatcher, former prime minister of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland … To say goodbye to Ronald Wilson Reagan, the 40th president of the United States. Gorbachev moved to the Rotunda and patted the coffin of the man who declared his nation ""The Evil Empire."" 'S ' ' Reagan and Gorbachev were the ‘80s prime figures as leaders of the world’s only superpowers. But it was Thatcher who brought them together. It was Thatcher who first met Gorbachev upon his ascendency in the Kremlin. Thatcher said, ""I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business together."" Such a iron-clad endorsement from the Iron Lady went a long way with Reagan. That prompted arms summits in Geneva and even a failed set of talks in Reykjavik, Iceland. Some argue Reykjavik was ultimately successful — because the two sides learned how close they were to getting a treaty. It was Gorbachev — and his station in life at the helm in the Kremlin — that brought Thatcher and Reagan together: united in their disdain for communism. And here it was Reagan’s passing that brought them together under the Capitol Dome on this somber occasion. Thatcher stood quietly in the Capitol corridor, waiting to pay her respects to her friend. For Reagan trusted her like no other foreign leader. She approached Reagan’s coffin in the Rotunda deliberately — and with some assistance. Ruby red lipstick and a single strand of thick pearls stood out against her black ensemble. Thatcher reached out delicately, stroked her right palm across the American flag that swathed Reagan’s casket as though she were petting an animal. Other mourners looked around the Rotunda. They spoke in hushed tones. They dabbed at their eyes with Kleenex. Reagan’s coffin never left Thatcher’s steely gaze. U.S. President Ronald Reagan, center, and his wife, Nancy, listen to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev speak at the White House on Dec. 10, 1987. In February 1985, Thatcher’s embrace of Reagan was on display during her speech to a joint session of Congress. At the time, Thatcher became the first British prime minister to address both the House and Senate since Winston Churchill in 1952. She applauded Reagan’s approach with Gorbachev, saying it ""brought the Soviet Union to the bargaining table in Geneva."" Thatcher also stood foursquare behind Reagan’s plan for a space-based missile defense system to guard against a Soviet attack, much to the pleasure of Republican lawmakers. The formal name of the missile system was the Strategic Defense Initiative . But the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., had dubbed it ""Star Wars"" for its seemingly sci-fi concepts of shooting lasers into outer space. , 'S An economic conservative, Thatcher drew the ire of Labour with her budget cuts and social service reforms — to say nothing of bands like Pink Floyd and The Clash who took their grievances with her directly to vinyl. And Thatcher took the occasion on Capitol Hill to implore Washington to harness spending. ""We support so strongly your efforts to reduce your budget deficit,"" Thatcher said. ""No other country in the world can be immune from its effects — such is the influence of the American economy on us all."" The message still resonates today as lawmakers grapple with out-of-control spending and blunt spending mechanisms like sequestration. Ronald Reagan statue in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. But in her presentation to Congress, Thatcher saved her praise for Reagan, speaking just days after his second inauguration . ""There is a new mood in the United States,"" Thatcher told lawmakers. ""A visitor feels it at once. The resurgence of your national pride is almost tangible. Now the sun is rising in the west."" Thatcher went on to declare her speech before the joint session of Congress was ""one of the most moving occasions of my life."" This week, the House returned the favor, approving a resolution honoring Thatcher ""for her life-long commitment to advancing freedom, liberty, and democracy and for her friendship to the United States of America."" 'S , When the House finished for the night, it adjourned in honor of Thatcher — the same gesture it made to Winston Churchill when he passed away in 1965. Then-House Speaker John Boehner called Thatcher ""the greatest peacetime prime minister in British history."" Mikhail Gorbachev and Chad Pergram Then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., hailed Thatcher for her ""steady hand in our fight to win the Cold War, helping bring down the Berlin Wall, brick by brick."" Perhaps that sentiment is only appropriate. In the Capitol Rotunda stands a statue of Reagan. The base is lined with pieces of the Berlin Wall — forever linked to Reagan with his 1987 exhortation ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."" Reagan’s line is without question one of the most seminal moments of the decade. So of that ‘80s troika, just one remained: Gorbachev, who outlived both the Soviet system and his fellow leaders. The ‘80s are long gone. Reduced to a Sirius/ channel cranking out Duran Duran and The Thompson Twins. Or you can spy reruns of ""St. Elmo’s Fire"" on cable. But politically, they rolled out the final playlist of the ‘80s in the early 2000s when the trio said goodbye to one another under the Capitol Dome.",6

The Tass, Novosti and Interfax news agencies cited the Central Clinical Hospital. Gorbachev's office said earlier that he was undergoing treatment at the hospital after a serious and long illness. No further details were given. - Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev Gorbachev was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1985 until its collapse in December 1991. As general secretary and president, he helped forge weapons reduction deals with the U.S. and other Western powers and remove the Iron Curtain. Though in power less than seven years, Gorbachev unleashed a breathtaking series of changes. But they quickly overtook him and resulted in the collapse of the authoritarian Soviet state, the freeing of Eastern European nations from Russian domination and the end of decades of East-West nuclear confrontation. 'S , His decline was humiliating. His power hopelessly sapped by an attempted coup against him in August 1991, he spent his last months in office watching republic after republic declare independence until he resigned on Dec. 25, 1991. The Soviet Union wrote itself into oblivion a day later. A quarter-century after the collapse, Gorbachev told the Associated Press that he had not considered using widespread force to try to keep the together because he feared chaos in a nuclear country. Mikhail Gorbachev ""The country was loaded to the brim with weapons. And it would have immediately pushed the country into a civil war,"" he said. Gorbachev won the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending the Cold War and spent his later years collecting accolades and awards from all corners of the world. Yet he was widely despised at home. Russians blamed him for the 1991 implosion of the Soviet Union — a once-fearsome superpower whose territory fractured into 15 separate nations. His former allies deserted him and made him a scapegoat for the country's troubles. ""Mikhail Gorbachev is as much respected in the West as he is detested in Russia,"" former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler told Fox News. ""To Westerners, he brought openness and rebuilding , and for the Russians, he destroyed the .""

Shawn celebrated her 40th birthday on July 7 and recently hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mary O’Donnell said. She spoke four languages: Arabic, Turkish, Spanish and English. After graduating from Cal Berkeley, Shawn went to Egypt for two years to perfect her Arabic. When she returned home, she was recruited by Google.

Adam Smith and Rep. Mike Waltz sound off on the United States' foreign policy on the Russia-Ukraine war on 'Special Report.' North Korea is hinting that it is interested in sending construction workers to the Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to help the Kremlin’s efforts to rebuild in the war-ravaged areas as its invasion of Ukraine enters into its seventh month. Pyongyang’s ambassador to Moscow recently met with envoys from two Russia-backed separatist territories in the Donbas region of Ukraine and expressed optimism about cooperation in the ""field of labor migration,"" citing his country’s easing pandemic border controls. The idea is openly endorsed by senior Russian officials and diplomats, who foresee a cheap and hard-working workforce that could be thrown into the ""most arduous conditions,"" a term Russia’s ambassador to North Korea used in a recent interview. Rebekah Koffler, a former U.S. intelligence officer focused on Russia and the author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital that Putin, from an optics standpoint, is attempting to show that Russia is not completely isolated and still has friends in the world despite stringent sanctions and pressure resulting from the invasion of Ukraine. , Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un shake hands during their meeting in Vladivostok, Russia ""From a practical standpoint,"" Koffler said, ""it makes sense for Putin to use these laborers because who else is going to go? Because these are risky conditions in Donbas and the Russian military is already having trouble recruiting people to go fight there."" The talks came after North Korea in July became the only nation aside from Russia and Syria to recognize the independence of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk breakaway territories, further aligning with Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. A man walks on a street in Severodonetsk, eastern Ukraine, following shelling The employment of North Korean workers in Donbas would clearly run afoul of U.N. Security Council sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs and further complicate the U.S.-led international push for its nuclear disarmament. Many experts doubt North Korea will send workers while the war remains in flux, with a steady flow of Western weapons helping Ukraine to push back against much larger Russian forces, but they say it’s highly likely North Korea will supply labor to Donbas when the fighting eases to boost its own economy. Human rights groups have reported over the past several years on North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un shipping tens of thousands of his own impoverished citizens to Russian labor camps to generate cash for his regime. This picture taken on September 3, 2017, and released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on September 4, 2017, shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un attending a meeting A report issued in 2017 by the Seoul-based Data Base Center for North Korean Human Rights estimated that about 50,000 North Korean laborers are working low-paying jobs in Russia. They send at least $120 million every year to the regime in Pyongyang. It is unclear what type of workers would potentially be sent to eastern parts of Ukraine to help Russia's rebuilding effort, but Koffler told Fox News Digital that it is ""highly likely"" the work assignment will be ""mandatory"" for North Koreans who are chosen to go.

Russia attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24. Now, six months later, Ukraine is launching a large-scale counter offensive to drive the Russian invaders off the west bank of the Dnieper River and retake the major city of Kherson. Some 5,000 miles to the east, the People’s Republic of China continues to press Taiwan. On Tuesday, China flew a reconnaissance drone near a Taiwanese-held island. Taiwan fired warning shots at it and warned that further intrusions would be met with force. Two days later, Taiwan shot down a Chinese drone in what is the first hostile fire from Taiwan since 1958.

But tenaciously holding onto your homeland and organizing an effective offensive are two very different tasks. The latter requires supplies, mechanized equipment, and large volumes of accurate artillery and missile fire. Taiwan staged military exercises to show its ability to resist Chinese pressure to accept Beijing's political control over the island. The jury is out on how well the Ukrainians will do against a Russian foe that is now low on morale and poorly supplied due to Ukraine’s attacks on Russia’s logistics train. Russians are not likely able to respond in the way in which they are accustomed — with generously supplied massed artillery. Russia may be looking at a sharp defeat that could change the calculus for a negotiated cease fire. Russia’s ongoing difficulties in Ukraine are being very closely watched in Beijing where General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping has ratcheted up tensions across the Taiwan Strait. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan on Aug. 2 merely delivered a pretext to Xi to do what he was going to do anyway: use China’s new military hardware to cow Taiwan — and those nations that might come to Taiwan’s aid should China invade. Taiwan’s importance cannot be overstated. It’s the lynchpin of the Pacific’s first island chain. Seizing Taiwan would provide China with deep-water access to the Pacific, allowing it to threaten key trade routes serving Japan and South Korea. It would also allow China to threaten Japan more readily to the north and the Philippines to the south. And things have changed since the decades when the former Chinese Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek, and his successors ruled Taiwan. Since 2000, Taiwan has seen three peaceful transfers of power between opposing parties. Taiwan’s democracy threatens the very credibility of the Chinese Communist Party’s one-party dictatorship. And Taiwan manufactures 90% of the world’s advanced computer chips. Since Pelosi’s delegation visited Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, China has significantly increased its air and naval activities around the island. Prior to the visit, China would sortie one to a dozen aircraft to within about 100 miles of the southern tip of the island three to four times a week. Larger flights of more than two dozen fighters, bombers, and intelligence aircraft were flown every two to three months. Now those larger sorties are an almost daily occurrence and are also flown across the breadth of the Taiwan Strait, which narrows to 90 miles from China at its closest distance. We know what China has done since Pelosi’s visit, but we don’t know leader Xi’s intentions. How might the lessons from Russia’s Ukraine misadventure be viewed in Zhongnanhai, the former Chinese imperial garden that serves as the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party? China has had much success over more than a decade in its unopposed effort to militarize rocks and atolls in the South China Sea. Picking up speed during President Barack Obama’s term, China dredged, fortified, and built runways on dozens of outcroppings hundreds of miles from Chinese territory. China muscled its way into waters claimed by its weaker neighbors — the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Brunei. The Philippines even brought suit against China in the international court at The Hague which ruled that China's made up ""Nine-Dash Line"" claim to vast swaths of the South China Sea was not legally binding. China ignored it — the court at The Hague has neither a navy nor an army. By its past behavior and success in the South China Sea, it might seem that China would simply ramp up the pressure on Taiwan, gradually but effectively blockading the island over time, cutting it off from trade and forcing the island to surrender. But, while China was busy grabbing a bunch of rocks in the ocean, it expected adjacent nations to be frightened into Beijing’s orbit—instead, China squandered goodwill and earned a deepening enmity from the nations it sought to pressure. Thus, an attempt to slowly muscle in on Taiwan would merely accelerate Japan’s rearmament, among other consequences. Instead, China might seek military conquest of Taiwan. If it does, Russia’s experience in Ukraine suggests three things. First, invade with overwhelming force — do not hope for a quick capitulation only to be stuck in bloody stalemate. Second, achieve information dominance — do not allow Taiwan to tell its story to the world. Third, expect that Taiwan will have friends — attack American and Japanese forces in the region that might interfere with an invasion. Unfortunately, the Biden administration continues with what appears to be a single-minded focus on Russia, while tension in the Pacific heats up to the boiling point.",5
2022-09-02,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/reagan-plan-defeated-gorbachev-communism-beat-communist-china,"Reagan's plan defeated Gorbachev's communism. It can beat communist China, too","Gipper's legacy in defeating Communism. Mikhail Gorbachev, the man who presided over the dissolution of the Soviet Empire, died this week. In the West he was hailed as the man who turned the Soviet Union away from communism and brought peace to the world. He was awarded the Nobel Prize. In the former soviet states, especially Eastern Europe, he was honored as a man who freed them from the yoke of their Russian overlords without a war. But in Russia, he is seen as the man who allowed the breakup of the Soviet Union, and condemned his own people in Mother Russia to a decade of privation and humiliation after he left office. Russian President Vladimir Putin has spent his entire twenty some years in office trying to undo Gorbachev’s legacy – to return Russia to communism, regain some of its lost empire, and restore Russian greatness. Putin blames Gorbachev personally for throwing away the Soviet Empire. But in many respects, Gorbachev had few options when he took office in 1985. In the late 1970’s the Soviet Union was at the zenith of power. By 1985 it was suffering a stunning and rapid decline. Why? Because five years before, the American people elected Ronald Reagan, who reversed the course of history. : When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980 the country was in a similar situation as today – runaway inflation, a stagnant economy, and in retreat around the world after a long running failed foreign war. The Arab oil embargo of the 1970’s had driven global energy prices sky high, giving the oil-exporting Soviet Union record profits. They used the windfall to launch a military buildup, develop a more capable and lethal nuclear arsenal and expanded globally. They launched proxy wars with Communist allies worldwide. By the late 1970s it seemed like the U.S. was in irreversible decline. American thought leaders praised the communism as the wave of the future. Even Nobel Laureate John Kenneth Galbraith, the most renowned economist of the day, said the Soviet planned economy was superior to American free markets. Ronald Reagan disagreed. He believed the fundamental flaws of communism – a centrally planned economy and self-perpetuating Communist party dictatorship – would inevitably cause the Soviet Union to collapse from within. His goal was to speed it along with Peace through Strength. It sounded like a bumper sticker slogan. Actually, it was a comprehensive and ambitious strategic plan to win the Cold War without firing a shot. Reagan wanted a strong military to deter the Soviet Union, not to defeat it on the battlefield. At the same time, he would use our economic, technological, and ideological superiority to target the Soviet Union’s inherent weaknesses. He hoped an enlightened Soviet leader would eventually come to power and make changes necessary for survival of the Russian people. Mikhail Gorbachev was that man. Reagan’s Peace through Strength rested on three pillars: reinvigorating the American economy, rebuilding America’s military strength, and restoring a sense of patriotism and purpose in the American people. The Reagan defense buildup checkmated the Soviet Union’s military buildup of the 1970s. His emphasis on creating strong alliances, especially with the British Prime Minister and the Pope. helped neutralized Soviet expansionism. That got equilibrium back into geopolitics. To take the U.S. economy and security to the next level, too not just coexist with the Soviet Union but actually win the Cold War, Reagan needed to halve their oil profits. Reagan encouraged the King of Saudi Arabia to pump more oil. Prices went from $40 to $18 a barrel in nine months, halving Moscow’s revenues. At the same time, the U.S. imposed severe restrictions on transfer of superior American technology to the backward Soviet Union and shut down third party workarounds. Reagan also urged American banks to stop extending loans to Russia. Reagan’s proposal to begin research and development of ‘Star Wars’ missile defense system shook the confidence of Soviet leaders. They were barely keeping up with the U.S. in the current arms race, they had neither the resources nor the technology to join a missile defense race. By the late 1980’s the Soviet Union was broke. Several years of failed and mismanaged what harvests exacerbated their woes. Although long considered one of the breadbaskets of the world, the Soviet Union literally could not feed their people, could not borrow from the West to pay for imported wheat, and was facing an imminent humanitarian crisis. Gorbachev advisor Anatoly Chubais later admitted the Russian president had no choice but to settle the Cold War on America’s terms. Curiously, much of the American commentary on Gorbachev’s death gives Reagan scant credit for engineering the fall of the Soviet Union. Instead, they praise Gorbachev for handling peacefully the inevitable collapse of the Soviet empire. Our Cold War victory has never been accepted by today’s generation of communist leaders. In Putin’s Russia, Gorbachev is blamed for losing the Soviet Empire. A headline in the Chinese media reads, ""Gorbachev: A Loser."" Today the United States is grappling with a new and more powerful adversary, communist China. Like the Soviet Union, China aims to replace the U.S. as the world’s sole superpower. Unlike the Soviet Union, China is technologically advanced, economically diverse, and far more single-minded in its diplomacy and disciplined in engineering its ascent. America’s victory in this new Cold War is far from certain. But a good place to start would be an updated version of Reagan’s Peace through Strength. McFARLAND",6

Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend the Vostok-2022 war games that Russia is hosting in coordination with China and other Moscow-allied nations, reports said Friday. According to Russia state owned broadcasting network , Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin will visit the active phase of the military drills on Sept. 6. The trip will come ahead of his impending travel plans to Central Asia in mid-September, when he may meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other nation’s leaders for a regional summit. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping bolster ties. ""He will work in Vladivostok itself,"" Peskov said, referring to an area along the Sea of Japan and just north of North Korea. ""The strategic command and staff exercises of the armed forces Vostok-2022 begin there."" Russia’s defense ministry said this week that the exercises will be held Sept. 1-7 in several locations across Russia’s Far East. The drills will involve more than 50,000 troops and participation from several former Soviet nations, China, India, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Syria. The exercises will take place at seven different firing ranges and utilize over 5,000 weapons units, 140 aircraft and 60 warships. The massive military drills signify not only an expanding relationship between Russia and China amid heightened tensions with the U.S., but are intended to demonstrate Russia’s ability to send tens of thousands of troops to engage in military drills amid its war in Ukraine, one expert told Fox News. ""It’s a strategic messaging campaign,"" former intelligence officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency Rebekah Koffler said, adding it signifies ""business as usual for Russia, despite the fact that war is raging on."" In this handout photo taken from video released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Monday, Aug. 29, 2022, Chinese soldiers arrive to the Grodekovo railway station to participate in war games drills, in Grodekovo, Primorsky Krai, Russia. , The Russia expert said Putin is letting Western nations know that Moscow is not as isolated as the U.S. and its allies would like to think amid its war in Ukraine. ""This is a multi-lateral war-game with China having 2,000 troops participating - plus 12 other countries, including Syria, and possibly India,"" she added. Koffler said Putin could be planning some sort of stunt to ""surprise"" the U.S. and Western allies, like a simulated ""nuclear weapons release."" The former intelligence officer pointed to the 2010 military exercises when Russian forces simulated a tactical nuclear strike against an invading force.

""These sorts of things are prone for misunderstanding, miscalculation and unintended escalation, especially during an active conflict as the relations between both Russia and the U.S., and China and the U.S. are extremely tense,"" she said. Koffler pointed out that though this year’s drills are much smaller than in previous years, she warned, ""We are in a very dangerous zone."" ""Both Russia and China are behaving recklessly, and they have no respect for the current U.S. administration,"" she added. Russia’s Defense Ministry said this week that as part of the coordinated training operations, the Russian and Chinese navies will ""practice joint action to protect sea communications, areas of marine economic activity and support for ground troops in littoral areas"" in the Sea of Japan. The naval exercises come as Western defense officials are increasingly concerned by China’s aggressive behavior directed at Taiwan. It remains unclear if Xi will be officially be traveling to the regional conference to meet with Putin, but reports last month suggested the Chinese president was considering the trip following Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei earlier in the month – which sparked outcry from Beijing.

Thousands of mourners lined up Saturday to pay tribute to former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who launched drastic reforms that helped end the Cold War and precipitated the breakup of the Soviet Union, in a farewell snubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin's refusal to declare a state funeral reflects its uneasiness about the legacy of Gorbachev, who has been venerated worldwide for bringing down the Iron Curtain but reviled by many at home for the Soviet collapse and the ensuing economic meltdown that plunged millions into poverty. On Thursday, Putin privately laid flowers at Gorbachev’s coffin at a Moscow hospital where he died. The Kremlin said the president’s busy schedule would prevent him from attending the funeral. Asked what specific business will keep Putin busy on Saturday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the president will have a series of working meetings, an international phone call and needs to prepare for a business forum in Russia’s Far East he's scheduled to attend next week. People walk past the coffin of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev inside the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions during a farewell ceremony in Moscow, Russia, Saturday, Sept. 3, 2022. Gorbachev, who died Tuesday at the age of 91, will be buried at Moscow's Novodevichy cemetery next to his wife, Raisa, following a farewell ceremony at the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions, an iconic mansion near the Kremlin that has served as the venue for state funerals since Soviet times. , ‘’ The coffin of Gorbachev, who died Tuesday at the age of 91, was brought to Moscow's Novodevichy cemetery, where he will be buried next to his wife Raisa, following a farewell ceremony at the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions, an opulent 18th-century mansion near the Kremlin that has served as the venue for state funerals since Soviet times. At the ceremony Saturday, mourners passed by Gorbachev's open casket flanked by honorary guards, laying flowers as solemn music played. Gorbachev's daughter, Irina, and his two granddaughters sat beside the coffin. The grand, chandeliered hall lined by columns hosted balls for the nobility under the czars and served as a venue for high-level meetings and congresses along with state funerals during Soviet times. Upon entering the building, mourners saw honor guards flanking a large photo of Gorbachev standing with a broad smile, a reminder of the cheerful vigor he brought to the Soviet leadership after a series of dour, ailing predecessors. The turnout was large enough that the viewing was extended for two more hours beyond the stated two hours. People stand by the coffin of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev inside the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions during a farewell ceremony in Moscow, Russia, Saturday, Sept. 3, 2022. Despite the choice of the prestigious site for the farewell ceremony, the Kremlin stopped short of calling it a state funeral, with Peskov saying the ceremony will have ""elements"" of one, such as honorary guards, and the government’s assistance in organizing it. He wouldn’t describe how it will differ from a full-fledged state funeral. Declaring a state funeral for Gorbachev would have obliged Putin to attend it and would have required Moscow to invite foreign leaders, something that it was apparently reluctant to do amid soaring tensions with the West after sending troops to Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council chaired by Putin who served as Russia's president in 2008-2012, showed up at the farewell ceremony. He then released a post on a messaging app channel, referring to the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and accusing the U.S. and its allies of trying to engineer Russia’s breakup, a policy he described as a ""chess game with Death."" Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who often has been critical of the Western sanctions against Russia, attended the farewell on Saturday. The U.S., British, German and other Western ambassadors also attended. Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting on the country's transport industry via a video link in Sochi, Russia May 24, 2022. The relatively modest ceremony contrasted with a lavish 2007 state funeral given to Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first post-Soviet leader who anointed Putin as his preferred successor and set the stage for him to win the presidency by stepping down. The farewell viewing was shadowed by the awareness that the openness Gorbachev championed has been stifled under Putin. ""I want to thank him for my childhood of freedom, which we don't have today,"" said mourner Ilya, a financial services worker in his early 30s who declined to give his last name. ""I am a son of perestroika,"" he said, using the Russian word for Gorbachev's reform, or reconstruction, initiatives.

2022-09-06,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gorbachev-death-leaves-america-missing-reagan-era-leadership,Gorbachev death leaves America missing Reagan-era leadership,"Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reflects on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's legacy on 'Special Report.' Mikhail Gorbachev’s recent passing brought back many memories of the man, the Cold War and America’s eventual triumph over the Soviet Union in 1991. Praised by many in the West and reviled by many more back home, Gorbachev led the through unprecedented turmoil, eventually opening Russian society and embracing freedoms that Americans take for granted today. But I can’t think of Gorbachev without remembering a U.S. president whom I was honored to serve: Ronald Reagan. In many ways, it’s impossible to mention Gorbachev without Reagan, who was friend in some cases and foe in others. President Ronald Reagan stands with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House, Dec. 8, 1987. Both men were change agents, with Reagan ushering in a new wave of American conservatism and Gorbachev introducing Russians to ""glasnost"" and ""perestroika"" . Both men wanted peace and were dismayed by the looming threat of nuclearization and determined to avoid a war that could not be won. 'S 'S . , But the similarities stop there. In 2022, the legacies of Reagan and Gorbachev couldn’t be more different. Gorbachev’s death inevitably reminds me of Reagan’s unprecedented popularity – which endures today. On the campaign trail and throughout his presidency, Reagan understood that enhancing America’s military strength was integral to restoring America’s standing in the world. From high-tech weapons systems to expanded military training, he supported the largest peacetime defense buildup in U.S. history. By making America strong again, Reagan’s message to Gorbachev was clear: We will win the Cold War. His famous words – ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall"" – only reinforced a message of strength that was backed by action. , - Former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev meet in Moscow, Russia, on Sept. 16, 1990. With strength came support. Reagan was more popular than his three immediate predecessors – Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon – and his popularity only grew by the late 1980s, as Gorbachev struggled to reform the from within. When Reagan left office, nearly two-thirds of Americans approved of his job performance – cemented further by the Soviet Union’s impending collapse. By 2002, Reagan’s approval rating had ballooned to 73%. Reagan’s oratory prowess allowed him to explain his plans clearly and effectively, and more Americans came to admire the Great Communicator over time. As it became clear that Reagan’s plans worked, their admiration only grew. America’s admiration is still growing. People stand by the coffin of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev inside the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions during a farewell ceremony in Moscow, Russia, Saturday, Sept. 3, 2022. Unfortunately, Gorbachev could not say the same. His efforts to alter the Soviet Union ultimately won him the Nobel Peace Prize, but he lost the respect of his people in the process. As Russian analysts rightly claim, Gorbachev was ""loathed"" at home before his death. Last year, more than 70% of Russians said their country had moved in a negative direction under Gorbachev. Vladimir Putin’s refusal to attend Gorbachev’s funeral is telling. In truth, Putin’s Russia is a remnant of Gorbachev’s failure to pick a worthy successor. By choosing the ineffectual Boris Yeltsin and leaving a fledgling democracy to falter under his watch, Gorbachev laid the foundation for future tension between America and Russia. Today’s resurgent Russia can be tracked back to the mid-1990s, when Gorbachev only managed 1% of the vote in his post- presidential election. President Biden delivers a speech at Independence National Historical Park, Sept. 1, 2022, in Philadelphia. Gorbachev is the President Biden to Reagan’s, well, Reagan. Drawing parallels to today, the Gipper’s legacy is all the more remarkable given the current lack of leadership in the White House. Like Carter before him, President Biden is leading America from behind, with a 38% approval rating and no semblance of a national mandate. Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a news conference, Aug. 4, 2022, in Tampa, Florida. An alternative is clearly needed, and worthy up-and-comers like Gov. Ron DeSantis exhibit many of the same leadership qualities that made Reagan so successful. Americans are ready for a leader like DeSantis to reclaim Reagan’s vision for America, follow in Donald Trump’s footsteps, and lead from the front. But, until then, Americans can only hope and pray for another Ronald Reagan, who will go down as one of our strongest leaders. Mikhail Gorbachev – rest in peace – will surely be viewed as Russia’s weakest and worst. May we only hope for one and not the other in 2024.",6

Now, because of what Amy talked about a moment ago, the so-called is now a household word in Ukraine, apparently. The missiles. Yeah. Yeah. These are missile launching systems that enable the Ukrainians to reach those Russian positions and to reach their ammo depots, their command and control centers. , And they are taking them out one after another.

In an address to world leaders at the East Economic Forum, the Kremlin chief claimed that Washington’s ""waning dominance"" was the reason the U.S. and its European allies had hit Moscow with severe sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine. ""Western countries are seeking to preserve yesterday’s world order,"" Putin claimed in a speech that centered on his belief that Moscow has been economically targeted as an attempt to restore U.S. dominance at the cost of European success, not as a repercussion to his deadly war. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2022. , ""Europe is about to throw its achievements in building up its manufacturing capability, the quality of life of its people and socioeconomic stability into the sanctions furnace, depleting its potential, as directed by Washington for the sake of the infamous Euro-Atlantic unity,"" Putin claimed. ""This amounts to sacrifices in the name of preserving the dominance of the United States in global affairs."" Putin’s address coincided with the announcement Wednesday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping will be meeting face to face next week for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine. The meeting underlines Russia’s and China’s efforts to bolster their alliance as tensions with the U.S. and Europe have mounted over what Western officials have warned is a rise in authoritarianism. In the weeks leading up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow and Beijing declared the two countries had ""no limit"" to their partnership and have since engaged in war games and renegotiated gas deals to curb reliance on the dollar and euro. Chinese President Xi Jinping is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission.

Andy Biggs, R-Ariz. lawmakers say that the timing of the funding request must be taken in context with Biden's recent conduct, especially attempts to paint Republicans as a threat to democracy. , ""We all want to help,"" said Rep. Scott Perry. ""But we also have to stand up for accountability for the American taxpayer and how their money is being spent and where."" ""In the last five weeks, the federal government raided the former president's home … [forgave] student loans at the same time the president is out speaking about half the country being ‘semi-fascists,'"" said House Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry, R-Pa. ""The timing seems very political, the issues [around this aid bill] seem very political."" A spokesman for the White House National Security Council told Fox News Digital that the funding request is based solely on what Ukraine needs on the battlefield to defend itself from Russian aggression. Biden is requesting that lawmakers approve $11.7 billion in military and economic assistance to Ukraine by Sept. 30 – the deadline by which Congress must pass a government funding bill or risk a shutdown. The $11.7 billion is on top of an additional $2 billion the White House is requesting to address the impact that the war between Russia and Ukraine has had on the U.S. energy supply. $3.8 The new funding request comes after Congress passed $40 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in May. The legislation was $7 billion more than the White House initially said was needed to help Ukraine stave off collapse. Overall, 57 Republicans in the House and 11 in the Senate opposed the package. Many argued it lacked sufficient accountability measures to prevent corruption. A last-minute push within the Senate to create an inspector general to oversee the aid was blocked by Democrats. ""It appears more and more Republicans are on the same soft-on-Putin playbook that we saw used by former President Trump,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., after the bill passed. President Biden is requesting that lawmakers approve $11.7 billion in military and economic assistance to Ukraine by Sept. 30. Republicans now worry Biden is setting them up to face similar attacks directly before the midterms. Part of that distrust centers on the fact that the White House never explicitly expressed how long it would take for the initial round of Ukraine aid to run out before needing to be replenished by Congress. ""We all want to help, we're all appalled by what Russia has done in Ukraine,"" said Perry. ""But we also have to stand up for accountability for the American taxpayer and how their money is being spent and where."" Administration officials have argued that the ambiguity results from the fluid nature of the war. Although unable to determine how long the aid will last, White House officials have an estimate of how much has already been used. The new funding request comes after Congress passed $40 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in May. Shalanda Young, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, put out a statement last week saying that approximately ""three-fourths of the aid that Congress previously provided for Ukraine has been disbursed or committed."" ""The imperative here is recognized by a large bipartisan coalition in Congress and across the country, in the name of bedrock American values that go beyond any political party: Ukraine is calling for this aid in the name of democracy and sovereignty, as innocent people are being slaughtered,"" an administration source close to Biden's orbit told Fox News Digital. Republicans say the White House has done little to provide Congress with transparency on how the money is being spent. They also say the administration has failed to explain their strategy for ending the war, arguing that voters have started to notice. ""You use it all you want as an election issue,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""I can tell you that voters in Missouri – I'm asked about this constantly – why is it that we're nation building in Ukraine, but can't secure our own border?""",13

Col. Bob Maginnis provides insight on China’s latest threat against the U.S. vowing military action if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan, on ‘Cavuto: Live.’ Chinese leader Xi Jinping will travel outside of China for the first time in more than two years to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week. Xi and Putin will meet face-to-face in Kazakhstan on Wednesday at a time when both of their countries are facing staunch international criticism — Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and China for its increasing aggression toward Taiwan. The two countries are the leading global opponents of Western power, and Xi has sought to establish himself as the autocratic counterpart to the U.S. President Joe Biden has stated that the competition between the U.S. and China will determine whether the world turns toward democracy or autocracy. The meeting comes days after Putin's forces suffered a devastating defeat in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces retaking swaths of northeastern Kharikiv in a sharp counteroffensive. Multiple reports say Russian soldiers dropped their weapons and fled in disguise ahead of the Ukrainian advance. 'S ' , ' President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping pose during a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse on Feb. 4, 2022.

Two of them pointed guns at my ex-husband until he handed them his car keys."" Meanwhile, Xi's regime is conducting increasingly aggressive military drills surrounding the island of Taiwan. China has long claimed sovereignty over the island, despite it having its own sovereign and democratic government. ' ' ' ' ' ' The U.S. has sought to dissuade China from using Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an excuse to do the same in Taiwan.

While Pelosi's visit outraged China, it is far from uncommon for U.S. lawmakers to visit Taiwan. A group of six members of Congress flew to the island in April. Five more made the trek a week after Pelosi. Nevertheless, China argues the visits violate America's One China Policy, which states that the U.S. acknowledges the Beijing government as the only government of China. It also states that the U.S. will not hold formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.",5

The first theory Stern offered was that Trump flaunted his access to classified documents as a means of showing his legitimacy as the United States President. ""I think he was trying to prove to the Russians, like, ‘I’m really in control here. I’ve got top-secret papers.’ Meanwhile, he’s showing to them to Russians,"" he said during his SiriusXM’s ""The Howard Stern Show."" ""Just like, to prove that he was president in a way he doesn’t even believe it. That’s the most safe explanation.""

""Imagine if he says to them ‘look man, give me a couple billion dollars, and I’ll show ya where France keeps their nuclear weapons, and you guys can see all this sh*t if you do business with me."" Stern observed that this theory has grim implications. ""That would be a real dubious kinda horrible thing,"" he noted. The Kremlin's Spasskaya Tower and St. Basil's Cathedral are seen through the art object in Zaryadye park in Moscow, Russia March 15, 2022. ) 'S -A- He then added that his third theory was that Trump was saying, ""Hey, you guys wanna buy this from me, I can sell it to you, Russia, for like $50 billion-you’ll know everyone’s nuclear secrets."" Stern then appeared to conclude with a far less nefarious theory, suggesting he thinks that Trump just wanted the nuclear documents purely for the sake of having them.

""The Chinese side is willing to work with the Russian side to continuously implement high-level strategic cooperation between the two countries, safeguard common interests and promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction,"" Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committe Yang Jiechi said Monday, according to Bloomberg. The comments come amid Russia's ongoing war with neighboring Ukraine, which has resulted in international outrage and an effort by many western governments to sanction Russia and cut off its influence around the globe. But the international influence campaign has seemingly brought Russia and China closer together, with Chinese President Xi Jinping set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this week in Xi's first foreign trip since the start of the -19 pandemic. , Chinese President Xi Jinping While China has not provided Russia with direct support or relief from sanctions, it has extended its trade partnership with a Russian economy struggling to find international partners. About 81% of Russian car imports during the second quarter came from China, Bloomberg reported, while China's Xiaomi phone brand became the most popular in Russia during the same time period. China has also been a dependable consumer of Russian fuel, buying up liquefied natural gas at a steep discount from Russia. The arrangement has benefited both countries, giving Russia a buyer for its energy resources while China has used the windfall to sell energy sources at a markup to a European economy that has found itself short of resources amid sanctions against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin ""Russia and China are building a massive $55 billion pipeline called the ‘Power of Siberia,’ delivering gas from Siberia to Shanghai,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former intelligence officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital.

Keith Kellogg gave his take on the efforts of the Ukranian forces' counteroffensive and potential strategy against Russia on ""Your World"" Wednesday. . . : Look, there's an ebb and flow to every war and right now we're seeing the flow go to Ukraine. They've made massive incursions into territory that the Russians held 3,000 miles. , But look, Russia still had about 20% of Ukrainian territory, but they have lost a lot of equipment. They've let the Russians have a lot real good units [that] have been shattered. The morale is bad and the leadership is bad on the Russians part. And Putin needs to be concerned. , , ‘’ But I'll tell you, here's the key, though, Neil, and I really believe this. Look to the South. That's where this whole war is going to be decided around Kherson, around Nikolaev. If the Ukrainians can push and they can move those offensive down there and they cut off Crimea from there, from the Russian offensive that started a few months ago. And they can hold onto that and then put penetrations into Crimea. ‘’ , Then I think the Russian army falls and I think after the Russian army falls with their strategic defeat, Putin falls as well. So if I was Ukraine right now, if I could advise, you know, I said I got kind of got it in the North around Kharkiv now make a big effort in Nikolaev and around Kherson. Try to close that gap, cut off Crimea and then take Crimea. You take a part of that nation back – Ukraine that was given up in 2014 – I think that's when you see the end of Putin. :",0

2022-09-14,https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-gates-says-scariest-thing-war-ukraine-because-distraction-from-climate-change,Bill Gates says 'the scariest thing of all' is Ukraine war because it is a 'distraction' from climate change,"Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., weighed in on Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' purchase of several thousand acres of farmland across multiple states on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said during an interview that was published on Wednesday that the ""scariest"" thing about the war in Ukraine was it being a distraction from climate change. New York Times opinion writer David Wallace-Wells interviewed the billionaire, where he asked about a progress report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that tracks progress on several issues like poverty and food security. The report shows progress is lagging in most data points. When asked about the progress report, Gates said he is concerned that the war in Ukraine and economic troubles are distracting the world from confronting what he perceives as the threat from climate change. ""We’re in a worse place than I expected,"" Gates said. ‘ ’ : ‘ ’ Bill gates speaks at an event. While other commentators have expressed concern that the war in Ukraine can inadvertently lead to nuclear weapons conflict, Gates is concerned it will distract the world from climate change. ""But the scariest thing of all is not that we’re behind. We just have to accept that. It’s the ongoing distraction of the war in Ukraine from helping poor countries and making progress on both climate adaptation and mitigation,"" he continued. Wallace noted how the report shows that the world is on track to achieve almost none of the goals that were first outlined in 2015 by the United Nations. , ‘ ’ Bill and Melinda Gates are guests on ""Good Morning America,"" Tuesday, February 13, 2018, airing on the Walt Disney Television via Getty Images Television Network. , ) Gates also pointed to economic troubles - the possibility of a global recession, rising interest rates sparked by rising inflation, and high debt levels as things that will reduce the importance of climate change in the eyes of the public. ""That’s a huge thing — whether it’s defense costs, electricity costs, refugee costs, fertilizer costs. With the war on top of the pandemic, and now with interest rates going up, with high levels of debt everywhere, but including in Africa, the next five years are going to be challenging just to maintain the world’s attention,"" he said. The Microsoft founder beamed into a conference Wednesday for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- where he got on camera at one point to make some remarks. It's one of the first times we've seen Bill since he and Melinda announced their split. In addition, Gates predicted because of the rising costs of fertilizer, Africa will experience lower productivity when it comes to agriculture due to being priced out of the market. ""The cost of fertilizer, though, is a gigantic setback, because when the world makes less fertilizer, who uses less fertilizer? Africa’s not buying nearly as much fertilizer as they did a few years ago,"" he said. ""And so they’re the ones who are being priced out of the market. And what that does is, it means a season from now or two seasons from now, three seasons from now, your productivity is actually down from where we are right now. In the near term, it’s a pretty bleak picture for African agriculture.""",22

2022-09-15,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/five-reasons-why-growing-russia-china-strategic-partnership-presents-existential-threat-to-us,Five reasons why the growing Russia-China strategic partnership presents an existential threat to the US,"Author Rebekah Koffler describes the relationship between China and Russia as not being 'natural allies,' claiming there is 'suspicion' between the two nations on 'Fox News Live.' Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping met Thursday in Uzbekistan during the Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a sort of Asian version of . Amid devastating setbacks on the battlefield, the Russian president prioritized the trip to see his Chinese counterpart in a meeting the Kremlin described as ""quite a significant nature, for obvious reasons."" The rendezvous follows a seven-day joint strategic war-game, ""Vostok-2022,"" in which Russia and China practiced aviation and naval drills in the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk. Individually, these countries, both of whom the Pentagon has designated as America’s near-peer competitors, present a formidable threat to the homeland. In combination, the threat multiplies. Here are five reasons why the Russia-China strategic tandem poses an existential threat to the U.S. Chinese President Xi Jinping, left, and Russian President Vladimir Putin pose for a photo on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Thursday, Sept. 15, 2022. 1. Both regimes have masterminded long-range strategies to destabilize American society through espionage, covert influence operations, subversion and election interference. Whether it is Confucius Institutes indoctrinating American students or deep cover agents infiltrated by Russian intelligence to the U.S., these threats are hard to detect and neutralize in a democratic society. These operatives steal U.S. secrets, cultivate access to influential persons, and infiltrate business, political, and activist groups, with the goal of fomenting discord and transforming America into an undemocratic authoritarian state. 2. Russia and China developed doctrines that seek to defeat America on the battlefield, should Washington intervene in a regional conflict, such as the war in Ukraine or a potential attack against Taiwan. However, if Moscow and Beijing synchronize the timing of their combat operations, they could pose a significant risk of two-theater war scenario. Officially, the Pentagon’s ""two-war doctrine"" is designed to deal with such a threat. However, concerns about the depletion of U.S. weapons supplies as a result of expanding shipments to Ukraine, coupled with Washington’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, casts doubt on U.S. forces’ combat readiness to fight in two theaters simultaneously. Russia and China may even step in to help each other in a conflict if either faces defeat by . They have been practicing joint combat drills since 2005. Most recent ly, ""Vostok-2022"" simulated a Russia-China ""joint special operation,"" responding to the perceived threat from Japan, South Korea,and the U.S. Such joint military planning augments interoperability between the two militaries. Soldiers attend strategic military exercise ""Vostok-2022"" in Moscow Sept. 1, 2022. Soldiers and military observers from 14 countries, including Russia, China, India and Azerbaijan are participating in the military exercise. Nuclear warfare is a potential component of Moscow and Beijing’s battle plan. Russia’s post-Cold War doctrine no longer views nuclear weapons as psychological deterrent to avert a catastrophic conflict, but rather as a battlefield capability that Moscow is prepared to use to stave off U.S. intervention in a regional crisis or defeat by forces. Russia already holds advantage over the U.S. in tactical nuclear weapons. China is pursuing the largest ever nuclear force expansion in its history, while the U.S. force is in need of modernization, not being able to counter new missile defense technologies. 3. Both adversaries have identified America’s reliance on technology as a critical vulnerability to be exploited. Both have developed cyber-attack and space warfare doctrines and weapons to degrade or destroy U.S. military and civilian networks. Critical U.S. infrastructure, from banking and transportation to hospitals and nuclear plants, are vulnerable to attacks. Having realized the problem, the Pentagon is holding classified deliberations regarding the threat of China and Russia's space weapons. 'S , 4. The Russia-China accelerating economic cooperation is boosted by their forecasts that the center of gravity in international commerce and investment is moving to Asia. The two nations have already set up a method to make bilateral transactions in rubles or yuan instead of euros or dollars, bypassing the Western system. Plans are underway to integrate China’s Belt & Road Initiative with Russia’s Eurasian Economic Union. This trend plays into China’s long-range goal of replacing the dollar with Chinese yuan as the preferred international reserves currency. Other authoritarian regimes, which seek to decouple business from human rights, will likely favor an international transactions alternative. In the meantime, China is providing a critical economic lifeline to Russia which is hit by stringent Western sanctions. China’s trade with Russia and Moscow’s energy exports to Beijing are surging. The massive joint $55-billion pipeline, the Power of Siberia, already sends Russian gas to parts of China and will become fully operational in 2025. With these new revenue streams, Russia may decide not re-open Nord Stream, the main natural gas pipeline to Europe, which Moscow recently shut down. Chinese soldiers arrive to the Grodekovo railway station Aug. 29, 2022 to participate in war games drills, in Grodekovo, Primorsky Krai, Russia. Russia said Monday it will launch sweeping war games drills in the country's east that will involve forces from China — a show of increasingly close military ties between Moscow and Beijing amid tensions with the West over the Kremlin's action in Ukraine. 5. To be clear, Russia and China are not natural allies. They share a tumultuous history full of border disputes, cultural prejudices, and suspicions. However, they are united by a common cause, having aligned their aggressive policies to diminish America’s role in the world and promote an authoritarian system of governance. Moreover, Putin and Xi enjoy a comfortable relationship. While not exactly friends, they see eye to eye on many issues, having adopted a pragmatic and non-confrontational approach to dealing with each other. They project mutually while being engaged in a raw pursuit of national interests and the survivability of their regimes. What makes this strategic tandem more dangerous is that both men have clearly laid out their anti-U.S. strategic ambitions. Putin seeks to rebuild a -like alliance in Eurasia. Xi is implementing the century-old ""China Dream"" concept of economic prosperity and military strength. In line with it, Xi is taking China along the ""Road to Rejuvenation"" to turn it into the dominant global power, supplanting the U.S. by 2049, the centennial anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Both men have a sense of urgency to accomplish their goals, securing their legacies. Xi is 69 and Putin is turning 70 in October, with the former being in power for almost a decade and the latter for two decades. Each likely sees an opportunity to assert his own and his country’s power today. Putin is willing to gamble more, especially now that he could be facing defeat in Ukraine, and accept higher risk now, for more gain in the future. Xi, who has been reluctant to employ military means to achieve his goals, could rationalize doing so because of the perception that Washington is unprepared to handle two wars simultaneously. The growing alliance of two nuclear-armed U.S. enemies, both ambitious for their countries’ futures and one potentially becoming desperate for survival, presents great peril for the homeland.",5

Alex Drueke, 40, and Andy Huynh, 27, went missing in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine near the Russian border June 9. Both had traveled to Ukraine on their own and became friends because both are from Alabama. The families announced their release in a joint statement from Dianna Shaw, an aunt of Drueke. ""They are safely in the custody of the U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia and after medical checks and debriefing they will return to the states,"" the statement said. Shaw said both men have spoken with relatives and are in ""pretty good shape,"" according to an official with the U.S. embassy. The Saudi embassy released a statement saying it helped secure the release of 10 prisoners from Morocco, the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Croatia. Shaw confirmed that Drueke and Huynh were part of the group. The United Kingdom said five British nationals had been released, and lawmaker Robert Jenrick said one of them was Aiden Aslin, 28, who had been sentenced to death after he was captured in eastern Ukraine. ""Aiden’s return brings to an end months of agonising uncertainty for Aiden’s loving family in Newark who suffered every day of Aiden’s sham trial but never lost hope. As they are united as a family once more, they can finally be at peace,"" Jenrick tweeted. British Prime Minister Liz Truss heralded the release on social media. ""Hugely welcome news that five British nationals held by Russian-backed proxies in eastern Ukraine are being safely returned, ending months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families,"" she tweeted. U.S. military veterans Andy Huynh, left, and Alexander Drueke who disappeared while fighting Russia with Ukrainian forces on June 9, 2022, have been released after about three months in captivity. Russian state television had previously said Drueke and Huynh were being held by Russian-backed separatist forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The U.S. does not recognize the sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and has no diplomatic relations with them, which made it necessary for others to lead efforts to get the men released. Drueke joined the Army at age 19 after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and he believed he could help Ukrainian fighters because of his training and experience with weapons, Shaw said previously. Drueke left in mid-April. Druke's mother received a call from Saudi Arabia on Wednesday morning and an embassy worker handed the phone to the man, Shaw said. ""He got on the phone and said, ‘Hi mom, it’s your favorite child,’"" she said. Huynh moved to north Alabama two years ago from his native California and lives about 120 miles from Drueke. Before leaving for Europe, Huynh told his local newspaper, The Decatur Daily, he couldn’t stop thinking about Russia’s invasion. ""I know it wasn’t my problem, but there was that gut feeling that I felt I had to do something,"" Huynh told the paper. ""Two weeks after the war began, it kept eating me up inside and it just felt wrong. I was losing sleep. ... All I could think about was the situation in Ukraine.""

2022-09-21,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ukraine-china-problem-how-solve-it,"Ukraine's China problem, and how to solve it","Paul Gigot interviews military analyst Seth Jones. In a recent Wall Street Journal column, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy extolled his country’s potential to become ""a major hub for information technology."" Certainly, all civilized people are rooting for Ukraine to repel the Russian invasion and have its war-shattered economy roar back stronger than ever. But before U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent on Ukraine’s reconstruction, there’s a serious problem that must be addressed: The People’s Republic of China. The Ukrainian resistance has been truly heroic. Moscow expected it to crumble rapidly. Instead, Putin’s three-day war turned into a protracted slog. Indeed, Ukraine now may even be in the process of turning the tables on Russia with a counter-offensive. Much of this success has been supported by robust military and economic aid from the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Asian allies such as Japan. At war’s end, this will doubtless be followed by investments in and contributions to the sort of modernizing reconstruction Zelenskyy envisions. As he points out, there will be considerable profits to be made in this new Ukraine, especially if the country uses the transition to break the grip of endemic corruption that has bedeviled it for so long. Those profits should be the purview of Ukraine, as well as the free societies that have been so unstintingly supportive. The United States, for example, has already delivered or pledged $53 billion in aid, with no end in sight. Washington understands the strategic advantage of handing Putin a defeat, but the Biden administration appears to have no idea how to achieve this happy outcome beyond asking for more money from the Congress, which has precious little oversight of how and why it is being spent. : 5 - A U.S. This disconnect raises a potential—and significant—problem with the . Zelenskyy has opened the door to Chinese participation in the reconstruction, thus setting up an unacceptable scenario in which American funds are used to pay Chinese state-owned companies for economic rebuilding and development projects. Zelenskyy may hope that by being inclusive of the , he will dissuade Chairman Xi from providing direct military aid to Russia despite the ""no limits"" partnership Putin and Xi announced shortly before the beginning of the war. He should immediately disabuse himself of this notion. Military intervention is not Xi’s style. But he is currently financing Putin’s war effort by gobbling up cheap Russian energy supplies Putin has diverted from Europe. We can expect that new levels of cooperation will be announced next week when the two leaders meet in Uzbekistan, none of which will be beneficial to Ukraine. Xi does not see the conflict in Ukraine as an either/or proposition and will try to profit from both sides of the conflict. He will continue to bankroll Putin even as he angles for fat reconstruction contracts to go to state-owned Chinese entities that promise advantages, especially in information technology. Ukrainians need to know that a Chinese presence in their systems will not only invite perfidy into all aspects of their lives, it will also deter U.S. technology firms from participating for fear of losing intellectual property. The United States and our allies must therefore place conditions on reconstruction assistance to Ukraine to keep China out of the reconstruction process—and taxpayer dollars out of the ’s coffers. As Congress debates President Biden’s most recent request for Ukraine funding, they should bear in mind that assistance disallowing Chinese contracts has precedent in U.S. foreign aid. In the 2019 Section 889, for example, Congress determined that foreign assistance dollars could not be spent in countries that have Huawei, , Hikvision, Dahua, and other Chinese technologies as part of their infrastructures. This legislation reflects the U.S. government’s recognition that Chinese technology systems may be used by Beijing to steal valuable personal, commercial, and national security information wherever they are in use. This recognition should be broadened in any legislation related to funding for Ukraine reconstruction. Similar restrictions should be placed on assistance from the , the , Japan and others focused on rebuilding Ukraine. While Congress can control the disposition of American taxpayer dollars only, Washington can and should wield tremendous influence over how our allies apportion assistance to Ukraine. The administration should bend every effort to assure than free countries to not deploy their aid in ways that could advantage China. President Zelenskyy has built a deep reservoir of international support for his people and their future. He should maintain that level of backing by understanding that China is not a friend—indeed the has sided with the bad guys. They should not be allowed to profit from the destruction in which they are complicit. A Ukrainian parliamentarian recently sounded the alarm about the ""strategic partnership"" Ukraine formed with China 2011, given the ’s predatory role in the conflict with Russia. The U.S. Congress should heed the clarion call, and make sure that any reconstruction aid flowing to Ukraine does not wind up in the pockets of Xi and his cronies.

' ' U.S.-China relations have become increasingly strained for a litany of reasons, ranging from Beijing's aggressive actions in the South China Sea and its continued allegiance to Russia amid the illegal war in Ukraine to frustration over the climate, human right abuses and the trade war.

2022-09-22,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-point-ukraine-war-regime-change-russia,TUCKER CARLSON: The point of the Ukraine war is regime change in Russia,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on the Russia-Ukraine conflict on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' This week marks the seven-month anniversary of the beginning of the war in Ukraine, something that is still going on and isn't talked about quite as much anymore. The day that war began, which was February 24, two things were very obvious. The first was that there was no way the Ukrainian army would be able to win a decisive military victory over Russia and the reason was simple. Russia is too big. Ukraine is too small. The Russian military is many times the size of the Ukrainian military. Plus, of course, it has nuclear weapons. Russia itself is the largest country on planet Earth. It's got a relatively huge economy for the region and it's got 145 million people who live there. Ukraine has a population of about 40 million. It's the poorest country in Europe. It's got an average annual income that is much lower than Albania's. So, just by looking at the most basic Wikipedia level numbers, it was clear right away that if Ukraine wanted to remain a sovereign country and of course, all of us wanted that for Ukraine, Ukraine was going to have to reach some kind of negotiated settlement with Russia. Pitched battles were not going to do it. Now, that's not a moral judgment. You can root for the Ukrainian military all you want, but it's still a fact and there's no getting around it. The second thing that was immediately evident about this war was how unusually destructive it was and was going to be. It wasn't just Ukraine that was getting pummeled, though it certainly was. It was the entire Western economy, including our economy. Russian energy fuels Europe. A recession in Germany was certain to lead to a recession here and in the months since, it has, a bad one. The longer this war goes on, inevitably the poorer everyone is going to be, with the exception probably of Vladimir Putin. We are breaking things that are very hard to rebuild. Again, this was very obvious the first day of the war. You weren't allowed to say it at the time. Anyone who did was denounced as a Russian spy. But it was still clearly true and the Ukrainians certainly understood it. Back in April, according to an account in Foreign Policy magazine, negotiators from the governments of Russia and Ukraine met secretly and ""appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement to end the war."" Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting on the country's transport industry via a video link in Sochi, Russia May 24, 2022. The terms of the deal were simple. Russia would withdraw its troops from Ukraine. Ukraine would promise not to join , so each side would get the thing that it wants most simple and effective, and it might have worked. But the Biden administration adamantly opposed this settlement. Biden's advisers didn't just want the Russians to leave Ukraine. That's what they told us they wanted on television, but no. Biden's advisers wanted a total regime change war against Russia, apparently to avenge the election of Donald Trump, which they believed Putin was responsible for, and they were willing to fight to the last Ukrainian to get it. On April 9 of this year, the White House dispatched its hapless cutout, then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to Kyiv, according to Ukrainian news media, Johnson communicated two messages to the Zelenskyy government, ""The first is that Putin is a war criminal. He should be pressured, not negotiated with and the second is that even if Ukraine is ready to sign some agreements on guarantees with Putin, the West is not."" In other words, who cares what the Ukrainians want. America and the U.K. demand total war with Russia, regime change war with Russia and of course, the Ukrainians caught in the middle had no choice but to concede. So, days later, the peace negotiations fell apart. This was virtually unreported at the time, but it was the turning point in the war in Ukraine. This was the moment where the goal changed from restoring Ukraine to what it was before the invasion – and that seems reasonable to everyone in the West – to something very different, to a war designed to topple Vladimir Putin, just like we toppled Saddam Hussein and then hoping for the best afterward. That is clearly insane and dangerous, but that's where we are and from that point on, everything changed and that is how we got to where we are today, which is the closest we have ever been to nuclear conflict in history. . ' ' : ' A ' This week, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine gave an interview to the left-wing newspaper, The Guardian and in it, he casually called for the United States to nuke Vladimir Putin. ""The other nuclear states need to say very firmly that as soon as Russia even thinks of carrying out nuclear strikes on foreign territory, in this case the territory of Ukraine, there will be swift retaliatory nuclear strikes to destroy the nuclear launch sites in Russia."" Parse that, and we're quoting, ""as soon as Russia even thinks of carrying out nuclear strikes"" – meaning before Russia actually launches missiles – ""the U.S. needs to launch nuclear weapons against Russia."" In other words, we need to launch nuclear weapons now. Why now and how do we know that's what Zelenskyy meant? Because the Zelenskyy was responding to this warning from the Russian government on Wednesday. : I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction and for separate components, more modern than those of countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use means at our disposal. It's not a bluff. ""It's not a bluff,"" says Putin, who we are told is insane, so we probably should take it seriously. He is, after all, running a country with the largest nuclear arsenal on the planet and he's talking about using nuclear weapons if the West continues to threaten Russia's territorial integrity. It's a conditional warning and, of course, threatening Russia's territorial integrity was never part of the deal. Right? You remember this? It's why you wore a Ukrainian lapel pin or put a Ukrainian flag in front of your house. Ukraine was invaded. The point was to kick the Russians out. That seems reasonable by any standard of fairness and decency, but that's not what the Biden administration is pushing for. They're pushing for toppling the government of Russia and once again, hoping that everything will be fine after that, someone better will somehow take over. ""He's bad. Let's kill him."" Heard that story before? 'S $1.3M In response to what Putin just said, Ukraine's government called for an immediate nuclear attack on Russia, an attack that would without question result in the immediate destruction of New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, the deaths of tens of millions of Americans. That's what he just said. Sane people do not talk this way, ever. If there was a moment for the Biden administration to shut this whole thing down and force negotiated peace, which they could do in an instant, that moment is right now before huge numbers of people die, but that's not what the Biden administration is doing. They are moving in the other direction at high speed and doing all they can to bring the West to the brink of destruction. At the U.N. yesterday, Joe Biden accused Russia, not Ukraine, of making overt nuclear threats. Watch. : This war is about extinguishing Ukraine's right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine's right to exist as a people. Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should not, that should make your blood run cold. President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the nonproliferation regime. We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine. We will stand in solidarity against Russia's aggression. Period. . Putin is bad. Fine. Agree, but Putin is making nuclear threats. Whatever the reason, he is making them, the fact he is making them and the Ukrainians, of course, are also making explicit nuclear threats, is enough for any responsible person to say, ""now we stop,"" especially if that person is the leader of the United States, the country which is funding this war and that could end this war tonight by calling Ukraine to the table. Russian troops leave. Ukraine promises not to join , everything is as it was in January of this year, and everything's fine. We don't have to worry about New York getting nuked. But that's not what they want. So, Joe Biden didn't say a word about America's responsibility here. Again, we are funding this war. We could end it. They're choosing not to. He didn't say a word about that at the United Nations, of course, because they want war and neither did Secretary of State Tony Blinken. Watch. : President Putin picked this week as most of the world gathers at the United Nations to add fuel to the fire that he started. Shows his utter contempt for the U.N. Charter, for the General Assembly and for this council. The very international order that we have gathered here to uphold is being shredded before our eyes. We cannot, we will not, allow President Putin to get away with it. Every council member should send a clear message that these reckless nuclear threats must stop immediately. ' ,' ' ' . So Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, is a buffoon and a failed rock musician, reading some paper posturing like a cable news segment about how Putin's bad. Yeah great. Got it. But sitting behind him in the shot you just saw is someone who is not a buffoon at all and that would be Toria Nuland, one of the people responsible for the disaster in Iraq. Now in a functioning country anyone who had a hand in the 20-year tragedy of Iraq in which America's prestige was gravely degraded, in which thousands of Americans died, in which we got much poorer for no good reason, anyone who was involved in that, including the lie that got us into it, would be disqualified from participating in American foreign policy forever, but Toria Nuland just ascended, ascended, ascended until she brings us to the brink of nuclear war with Russia. So Tony Blinken is telling the United Nations and the rest of us that it's okay for Ukraine to threaten nuclear war on behalf of the United States and the rest of the world looks on with their jaws open, including China, of all places. Here's China's foreign ministry spokesperson yesterday. Watch. , 'S : We call on all parties to achieve a cease-fire and stop the war through dialog and negotiation and to find a solution that takes into account the legitimate security concerns of all parties as soon as possible. We also hope the international community will create the conditions and space for this. We call on all parties to achieve a cease-fire like the one they nearly had in April before the Biden administration blew it up because they want regime change in Russia. Now, that's coming from China, which has a human rights record that help makes Russia seem like Sweden and of course, China has benefited almost as much from this war as Putin has and Raytheon and Lockheed has, but even the Chinese are not crazy enough to want nuclear Armageddon. In the end, all they want to do is do business and dominate through business. They don't want their customers to blow themselves up and they understand they're coming incredibly close. Only Tony Blinken and lunatics like Toria Nuland really want that and they are fully behind Ukraine's president as he declares that his goal is not ending the war and getting his country back, which is a fine and admirable goal, that most Americans support. No, his goal is toppling Vladimir Putin and turning Russia into another failed state. Oh, good plan. Here he is. , ' ' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks with President Biden on Thursday, Aug. 25. : A crime has been committed against Ukraine and we demand just punishment. The crime was committed against our state borders. The crime was committed against the values that make you and me a community of the United Nations and Ukraine demands punishment for trying to steal our territory. This is the first item of our peace formula, comprehensive item punishment. So, a corrupt Eastern European authoritarian leader in a t-shirt is lecturing us about the community of nations and telling us this is really about the punishment that Ukraine demands. It's not about self-defense or getting their territory back. It's about regime change. Specifically, they're demanding a nuclear strike from us. How do we get involved in this anyway? But almost nobody in Washington is standing back to ask that question. They're full speed ahead on this. This is insane, but they're all for it. Adam Kinzinger just tweeted this: ""By the way, any target within Russia that contributes to the war is fair game, by law of armed conflict. There's no escalation possible by a country fighting for survival. Anyone claiming Ukraine is escalating should stop."" Anyone saying things that stupid in public should immediately resign from public office and be silent until wisdom comes, please. Then over in the Senate, Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are in agreement on just that same point. They've announced that Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism. . : Russia should be declared a state sponsor of terrorism because the events of these past days and weeks have shown the need more powerfully than ever that Russia should be designated a state sponsor of terrorism. , . : I think bipartisanship is strong when it comes to supporting Ukraine over Russia. I want to thank the administration for doing more. We have our differences about the next step, but Speaker Pelosi's in our camp. She has said from her point of view, Russia has earned the designation in U.S. law of being a state sponsor of terrorism. The fact that Lindsey Graham can go on television, as he so often does, and claim to be conservative and someone who cares about the United States, it's beyond. So, this is part of the endless posturing about how Russia's bad and sure, Russia's bad. Fine, Russia's bad, but it's the words, as always, that matter. They're telling you that Russia is now a state sponsor of terror. Why are they saying that? And you're probably nodding. ""Yeah. It seems like a bad place with a bad leader, fine, but state sponsor of terror?"" It's important for them to define Russia very specifically as that. Why? Because what do we do with terror states? We topple their governments. We go on the offensive. We take the fight to them and that's the position of Washington on a bipartisan level and it's particularly the position of people who believe falsely, speaking of election-related conspiracy theories, that Vladimir Putin stole the 2016 election and no one believes that lunacy more fervently than the lady who lost. Here she is. : They're getting the weapons they need to defend themselves and they're now on offense and I think we have to keep supporting them, helping them. They were attacked by an unprovoked act of war and they've held out and they've done better than anybody could have predicted and Zelenskyy has been a true wartime leader. I'm so impressed with him and I think, you know, the United States should stand with them. : ' ' If you're one of the millions of good-hearted Republicans who, when this broke out in February, thought ""Well, this is awful. You shouldn't invade a sovereign country"" and of course, we agreed with that, we should stand with Ukraine, you may feel a little fooled at this point, because what you're watching is classic mission creep. We arrive for one purpose and we extend the stay for an entirely different purpose that you didn't sign up for and that will absolutely hurt the United States long-term. When Hillary Clinton says we're going to stand with Zelenskyy as he goes on the offensive, that does not mean expelling Russian troops from his country, which everyone would agree with. That means toppling Vladimir Putin and creating a black hole in the center of Eastern Europe, the place where Asia meets Europe in a country with some of the biggest energy reserves on the planet and the largest nuclear arsenal. How is that going to work out? Well, let's listen to the Pentagon spokesmen. They're going on television to explain. . . : What we need to do is instead, we just need to reverse. We say, ""all in"" and we haven’t done that. For example, we haven’t given the Ukrainians systems like the attack cruise missile which can reach all of Crimea. It’s a 200-mile range, 500-pound warhead, 300 bombers to it. It really can put the Russians at threat, but we haven’t done that. And I think we should put them at threat. Until he really believes that we’re seriously going after him, he’s going to continue to make these threats So again, anybody who had a hand in, say, like the last five wars that diminished American power, killed Americans, made us poorer, hurt the United States long-term in very real ways, anyone who participated in any of that should probably bow out of the conversation about the latest war for the same reason that you wouldn't say take financial advice from someone who has gone bankrupt or go to marriage counseling with someone who's been divorced three times because they've demonstrably failed in their area of so-called expertise and that would include virtually everyone you hear talking about this stuff. ""He is going to continue making these threats,"" meaning Putin.",0
2022-09-22,https://www.foxnews.com/world/inside-saudi-arabias-role-freeing-american-pows-putins-prison,Inside Saudi Arabia's role freeing American POWs from Putin's prison,"Inside the Ukraine war release engineered by Saudi Arabia: ""I am immensely proud of what the Kingdom has achieved with the efforts of the crown prince,"" says Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan. Two Americans and eight other former prisoners of war from the Ukraine war have been freed by Russia, thanks to the intervention of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""It's a fantastic result and shows the importance of continuing to work towards achieving results through engagement and dialogue,"" said Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan. In an exclusive interview with Fox News, the foreign minister detailed the months of negotiations that went into the prisoner release by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two Americans, 40-year-old Army veteran Alexander John-Robert Drueke and 27-year-old Marine Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, both from Alabama, went to Ukraine to help defend it against the Russian invasion. They were captured by Russian proxies in June during a firefight in the Donbas region of Ukraine and held in Russia as s. They, along with five British citizens, one Moroccan, a Swede and a Croatian were released Wednesday as part of a deal that also returned Russian s captured by Ukraine. Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, left, and Alexander John-Robert Drueke, two U.S. military veterans who disappeared in June while fighting with Ukrainian forces against the Russian invasion, have been released after three months in captivity, relatives said Wednesday. ""His Royal Highness was able to convince President Putin that this is a humanitarian gesture that is worthwhile, and this is how we achieved this result,"" bin Farhan said. The foreign minister also said that Crown Prince bin Salman spent months on the issue to free the men and set up a credible communication channel between both sides. ""His Royal Highness has always been convinced that dialogue is the primary avenue to resolve differences, and he made quite clear through the beginning of this conflict when he reached out to both President Putin and President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy that we believe that there should be a negotiated settlement, and we continue to work towards that. And I think that attitude allowed for a really transparent discussion and was able to facilitate this result,"" said bin Farhan. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman smiles as he meets with President Biden at the Al Salman Royal Palace in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on July 15, 2022. He described a long, detailed negotiation that resulted in a prisoner swap, with Ukraine also releasing 55 Russian s and a pro-Putin Ukrainian member of parliament who was being held on charges of treason. ""Issues like this are always tremendously complex because there are a number of moving parts,"" bin Farhan said. ""There were many issues that had to be addressed. There were other prisoners, Ukrainian and Russian captives, that needed to be exchanged. So, there was a lot of detail that had to be ironed out and worked on. 'S 'T , ""You need to give it time. You need to give it patience. And this is, I think, what the crown prince really put into it."" The Americans' families issued a joint statement, saying, ""We are thrilled to announce that Alex and Andy are free. They are safely in the custody of the U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia and after medical checks and debriefing they will return to the States."" ""I feel great,"" the foreign minister said. ""I just look forward to seeing the pictures of them reunited with their loved ones when they return back to the United States and Alabama."" A Ukrainian tank drives over an infantryman during a training exercise near Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine, on May 9, 2022. Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a statement that said in part, ""I look forward to these U.S. citizens being reunited with their families. We also thank our Saudi partners for helping to spearhead this humanitarian initiative."" U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss tweeted that the release was ""hugely welcome news"" that ends ""months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families."" ""Prime Minister Truss is someone I respect a great deal,"" said bin Farhan. ""We are confident that through her prime-ministership we will strengthen further the bonds between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom."" He also said that bin Salman's role as a mediator between Putin and Zelenskyy could set the stage for expanded talks that he hopes will finally lead to an end to the war. ""We believe that engagement is important, that working towards a negotiated settlement is critical, a settlement that respects also, of course, Ukraine and Ukraine's sovereignty and addresses the concerns of all parties in a way that prevents further bloodshed. I think, in the end, what's most important is that we stop the bloodshed, and we stop the suffering of the civilians that are inevitably affected by any conflict,"" he said.",18
2022-09-22,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-united-nations-just-another-clown-show,Biden at United Nations is just another clown show,"President Biden called on the United Nations to expand its Security Council, in a speech to the body's General Assembly Wednesday. What to make of the annual international gabfest that is the General Assembly? No longer a stately assemblage of heads of state, the get-together has devolved into a daytime talk show, rife with drama over who shows up, who doesn’t and who bashes whom. And when the next day rolls around, we’ve all forgotten what we watched the day before. When the United Nations was chartered into being at the close of World War , three kinds of people were present. There were dreamy idealists, who envisioned the organization would evolve into good global governance like the World Federation on Star Trek. There were self-serving power brokers, scheming how to bend the to serve their ends. 'S And there were the realists who thought the assembly could, at worst, serve as a responsible forum for debates and exchanges of ideas and, at best, establish some subsidiary agencies to coordinate actions for the common good—like standards for international commercial aviation. So how did that turn out? Today, the looks nothing like a global government. Even the globalist crowd has moved on. They now meet to plan their great global reset at places like Davos, where parking is less of a problem, the scenery is better, and the common people can be kept at a safe distance. As for serving the common good, some agencies working under the umbrella actually do that. But they have been under constant assault from regimes like the Chinese who would rather treat them like puppets as they do their own peoples. Case in point: the World Health Organization. We recently saw Beijing use every ounce of its influence to get the agency to help obfuscate its responsibility for triggering a global pandemic. Many other agencies are even more in thrall to China. How? Beijing works hard to get its candidates elected to leadership posts and inserted in key staff positions for the express purpose of serving the interests of the Chinese Communist Party. What the is not is an important forum for debate and dialogue. In fact, it is more like a clown show. According to reports, Putin and Xi are not even going to show up at this week’s confab. Of course, neither should be admitted if they did appear. Not while one is waging an unprovoked, war-crime infused war on another member state and the other is conducting the world’s largest genocide. The sad thing is, if they did show, they’d be welcomed. Biden was there. He spoke on the theme: ""democracies vs authoritarians."" Thankfully, it was nothing like last week’s prime time speech where he declared the big threat to American democracy to be anyone who disagrees with him. This time, he focused on actual bad guys. He rightly condemned Russia for trying to obliterate its neighbor, reaffirmed that Iran should not be allowed to field nuclear weapons, and chided North Korea for being obstinate. Unfortunately, the speech sometimes veered off on tangents that did not make sense, such as his suggestion to expand the Security Council. This very unlikely to happen. Not much upside there. As for China, the president offered little more than weak tea. Basically, he declared that he didn’t want to pick a fight with Beijing—as if anyone though he did. The big question about the speech is: What will other nations make of it? Will it move them to actively oppose the heinous actions of Putin and other murderous authoritarians? And here, there’s a credibility issue. Biden’s track record seems at odds with his words. After all, he tried to buy off Putin with Nordstream . He failed to deter the invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. reluctantly and tentatively armed Ukrainians after the invasion. Meanwhile, Biden strove mightily to give Iran a trillion-dollar deal. And as for Beijing’s genocide, its crackdown on freedom in Hong Kong and its increasing belligerence toward Taiwan, he has done little more than finger wave. Lincoln was wrong when he said, ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,"" at Gettysburg. But he would be right if he said that about the palaver over at the General Assembly. Amid all the preening and posturing, many words will be spoken. And by next week, we will have forgotten them all.",0

Director William Burns called Russia a ""declining"" power in the first episode of the intelligence agency's new podcast, while warning that China is a ""central geopolitical challenge"" for the U.S. The 's podcast, ""The Langley Files,"" launched Thursday and featured Burns as its first guest. The podcast comes during the ’s 75th anniversary — a time, Burns said, for the agency to ""reflect on how we need to organize ourselves to navigate successfully what is an incredibly complicated international terrain."" Burns warned that terrain features a ""major power competition with rising powers like China,"" which he referred to as a ""central geopolitical challenge."" - '' Director William Burns testifies during a House Intelligence Committee hearing about worldwide threats on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on April 15, 2021. Burns pointed to the 's formation of the China Mission Center, which was created to counter Beijing and ""best position"" the agency to address current and future national security challenges posed by China. Earlier this year, Burns warned that China's Xi Jinping has even served as a ""silent partner"" in Russian President Vladimir Putin's aggression in Ukraine. Chinese President Xi Jinping talks to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, on Sept. 15, 2022. ""We have to deal with declining powers, not just rising ones, like Russia,"" Burns said. ""And Putin demonstrates every day that declining powers can be at least as disruptive as rising ones."" Burns pointed to Russia’s war in Ukraine and stressed the importance of intelligence. ""We were able to paint a pretty clear picture of Putin’s plans to mount a major new invasion of Ukraine last fall, months before he actually launched that invasion on the 24th of February,"" Burns explained. ""That enabled us to help Ukrainians defend themselves. It helped us to build allied unity."" Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting on the country's transport industry via a video link in Sochi, Russia, on May 24, 2022. ""It helped to expose the fact that what Putin was about was a naked, unprovoked aggression, and we reinforced that by the President’s decision to declassify some of our secrets as well,"" he said. Burns was referring to intelligence declassified by President Biden earlier this year that revealed Putin’s plans to stage false flag attacks to serve as a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. : : Meanwhile, Burns pointed to the ""successful"" U.S. counterterrorism operation in Afghanistan that killed the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri, last month, a strike that degrades the terror network's ability to operate. But Burns said the U.S. still faces ""the continuing challenge of terrorism."" ""It may take different forms today than it did over most of the last 20 years, but it’s still a significant challenge,"" he said. ""We still have significant capabilities at this agency working with partners across the U.S. government, and that’s going to be another of our most important priorities."" President Biden is shown on July 1, 2022, during a meeting ""to discuss the counterterrorism operation to take out Ayman al-Zawahri."" He added: ""It’s a balancing act, is what it’s going to be."" Burns went on to say that ""ingenuity and dedication"" are critical to the work of the , but also stressed that the agency is ""apolitical."" ""[O]ur job is not to bend intelligence to suit political party or policy preferences or agendas. It is to deliver the best intelligence that we can gather, the best analysis that we can put together, with honesty and integrity,"" Burns said. ""Our job is to tell policymakers what they need to hear, not what they want to hear."" 'S 'A ' 'S '' , Burns, who has worked under six presidents and both Republican and Democratic administrations, said that without working in an apolitical manner, ""we only get ourselves in trouble as a nation, and we make bad policy choices, when we forget those very basic truths.""As for the 's decision to launch the podcast, Burns acknowledged that intelligence agencies are ""supposed to collect secrets and keep them and not talk too much about them."" ""We do usually operate in the shadows, out of sight and out of mind,"" he said. ""Our successes are often obscured, our failures are often painfully visible, and our sacrifices are often unknown."" ""We have a profound obligation to protect agents and officers who risk their lives in support of our mission, which is to help protect Americans,"" Burns continued. ""But I’m convinced, as I know you are, that in our democracy, where trust in institutions is in such short supply, that it’s important to try to explain ourselves as best we can and demystify a little bit of what we do.""",22

2022-09-27,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-what-happened-nord-stream-pipeline,TUCKER CARLSON: What really happened to the Nord Stream pipeline?,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to the possibility of sabotage to the Nord Stream pipelines on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' I hate to start a Tuesday evening on a grim note, but one of the environmental catastrophes, one of the great environmental catastrophes of our time, is unfolding tonight off the coast of Denmark. The Nord Stream pipelines, which are enormous Russian owned conduits that carry natural gas from Russia to Western Europe, have been breached. As we speak, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 are pouring millions of cubic meters of natural gas into the Baltic Sea. Pictures from the air, which you can now see on your screen, show a toxic bubble field more than half a mile wide. You can only guess at how many marine mammals are being killed right now – countless. But the lasting damage may be to the atmosphere. Natural gas is comprised of up to 90% methane. Methane, as Joe Biden has often told you, is the key driver of global warming, which is, of course, an existential threat to humanity and the planet. So, if you're worried about climate change, what just happened to the Nord Stream pipelines is as close to the apocalypse as we have ever come. So, the question is, how did this happen? And it turns out it was not an accident. At the very same time that leaks in these pipelines were detected, Swedish officials recorded two powerful undersea explosions, each one of which was equivalent to hundreds of pounds of . Nothing in nature can account for that. Almost immediately, the pipelines began leaking in three separate places. So, there's only one explanation for what happened. This was an act of industrial terrorism. That was very obvious to the prime minister of Poland and he wasted no time in saying so. 'S , : Today we are also dealing with an act of sabotage. We do not know the details of what happened yet, but we can clearly see that it is an act of sabotage, an act that probably marks the next stage in the escalation of the situation we are dealing with in Ukraine. We can clearly see, he said, this was an act of sabotage, an act of terrorism. Well, yes, we can see that. So, the question is, who did it? And of course, the prime suspect is obvious. It would be the same man who caused domestic inflation here in the U.S. and stole the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton. That be Vladimir Putin. The Washington Post got right to it. ""Putin,"" they declared, ""is now weaponizing the Nord Stream pipelines."" According to the Canadian ambassador to the U.N., Vladimir Putin has decided to use ""pollution as an act of war."" Progressive Twitter strongly endorsed this conclusion. Putin did it and that makes sense until you thought about it for just a moment. Vladimir Putin may be evil. They tell us that he is evil, but is he stupid? Probably isn't stupid and yet and, here's the strange part, if you were Vladimir Putin, you would have to be a suicidal moron to blow up your own energy pipeline. That's the one thing you would never do. '' Natural gas pipelines are the main source of your power and your wealth and most critically, your leverage over other countries. Europe needs your energy now more than ever with winter approaching. If you can't deliver that energy, then countries like Germany have no need to pay attention to what you want. You're in the middle of a war, an all hands-on deck war, so you need all the leverage you can get. Under these circumstances, there is no chance you would blow up Nord Stream 1 or 2. Not now, obviously. In fact, it's so obvious that even as our famously dim secretary of State, Tony Blinken, seemed to acknowledge it, sabotaging Nord Stream, he said today is ""clearly in no one's interest."" Right, but really only half right. It is true that blowing up Nord Stream does not help Vladimir Putin. He would not do that. Why would he? But that doesn't mean that other countries wouldn't consider doing it. They would consider it and we know they have considered it because at least one of them has said so in public. In early February, less than three weeks before the war in Ukraine began, Joe Biden suggested on camera that he might take out these pipelines. Watch. : If Russia invades that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again. Then there will be, there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it. : But how will you. How will you do that, exactly, since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control? : We will. I promise you, we'll be able to do it. '' , ' ,' U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on what he calls the ""continued battle for the Soul of the Nation"" in front of Independence Hall at Independence National Historical Park, Philadelphia, U.S., September 1, 2022. Notice how he phrased it and he's the president. He doesn't phrase things by accident, particularly his reading off cards. He didn't say, I will pause the delivery of gas from Russia to Germany. He said there won't be a Nord Stream 2. We'll put an end to it. Will take it out. Will blow it up. How will you do this? He was asked. I promise you we will be able to do it. They thought this through and yet those watching, very much including us, didn't take Biden seriously when he said it. This is the president who has declared climate change the most pressing emergency in the history of the world. This is the man who lectures you about using a woodstove or driving an because of its emissions. This is the guy who spent billions trying to mitigate cow flatulence because methane. Would that guy really blow up a methane pipeline in the middle of the Baltic Sea? It was hard to imagine. That would be an unimaginably reckless act. That would be the kind of thing you would do if you wanted to start a nuclear war. It would be insane and yet in retrospect, it's obvious they were thinking about this because Joe Biden wasn't the only person to suggest it. Toria Nuland at the State Department said pretty much the very same thing. Nuland is a lifelong war cheerleader. She worked to bring about the Iraq invasion, never apologized, kept going. She helped engineer the coup that overthrew the Ukrainian government some years back. So capable, clearly she's capable of anything... but environmental terrorism? Even for Toria Nuland, that seemed too much too extreme, and yet here she is in January. 'S : With regard to Nord Stream 2, we continue to have very strong and clear conversations with our German allies and I want to be clear with you today. If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward. One way or the other, we'll stop Nord Stream. Now, looking back, those words seem chilling eight months later, as natural gas pours into the Baltic Sea and is in the atmosphere. So, you have to ask, could the Biden administration really do something like this? We can't say for sure. We don't know for sure. We can tell you that close allies of the Biden White House believe they certainly did do it. Radek Sikorski is a Polish politician who is chairman of the delegation in the European Parliament. He's connected. He's also the husband of regime stenographer Anne Applebaum of The Atlantic magazine. Sikorski is so close to Joe Biden that he's got a picture of the two of them together in his Twitter profile. So, when the pipelines blew up, Sikorski responded immediately and here's what he wrote. ""Thank you. ."" So once again, did the Biden administration really do this? It's hard to believe. Given that it's an atrocity, it's effectively an act of terrorism, we don't want to make that accusation, but we should tell you that maybe not coincidentally, today, a brand-new pipeline was unveiled, a pipeline that carries non-Russian natural gas in roughly the same areas, Nord Stream 1 and 2. This is called the Baltic Pipe. It was inaugurated in Poland. It will carry natural gas from Norway through Denmark to Poland and other countries nearby. And it's likely to do very well, since now it has less competition. Making sense? What does the White House say about this? How are they accounting for what happened today? : Well, they're not exactly enthusiastically denying responsibility for it. Instead, they're looking at the upside. Here's the president's publicist, noting that the destruction of yet another energy pipeline is yet another opportunity for you to buy an electric car. -: As you all know, these pipelines weren't pumping gas into Europe at this time and 2 was never operational, as you guys know. 1 has not been operational for weeks because Putin has weaponized energy and we have said this, many times before. This just drives home the importance of our efforts to work together to get alternative gas supplies to Europe and to support efforts to reduce gas consumption and accelerate true energy independence by moving to clean energy economy. Oh. ""Moving to clean energy"" say that people who very may well be responsible for letting methane into the Baltic Sea and into the atmosphere at a scale that most people can't imagine. The people lecturing you about your may have blown up a natural gas pipeline and created one of the great catastrophes of our time in its effect on the environment. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during a briefing at the White House, Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2022, in Washington. ' ' If they did this, this will be one of the craziest, most destructive things any American administration has ever done. But it would also be totally consistent with what they do. What do they do? They destroy. These people built nothing, not one thing. Instead, they tear down and they desecrate from historic statues to the Constitution to energy infrastructure and no one in Congress is trying to stop any of it. They're just preparing for the inevitable fallout. Tonight, the Senate just advanced a spending bill with $35 million for the Department of Energy to ""prepare for and respond to potential nuclear and radiological incidents in Ukraine."" What? The spending bill also brings the total U.S. expenditure on Ukraine, the war, but also funding its government and energy for Ukraine to $67 billion on the eve of what could be a massive economic disruption here to our economy, $67 billion. How much is that? Well, it's more than Russia's entire military budget last year, and Congress is expected to fully pass the bill later this week with Republicans nodding along like the zombies they are. What would be the effect of this? Every action has a reaction, equal and opposite. Blow up the Nord Stream pipelines? Okay, we've entered a new phase, one in which the United States is directly at war with the largest nuclear power in the world. It doesn't mean we'll go nuclear immediately, but it does suggest there could be consequences. If we actually blow up the Nord Stream pipelines, why wouldn't Russia sever undersea internet cables?",0

Russia and the Taliban are in agreement on a deal that would see Russian gas, diesel and wheat flow into Afghanistan at a discounted rate. ""The deal will provide Russia with additional export earnings, undermining Washington’s efforts to weaken Russian economy, in false hopes to compel Putin to stop his war on Ukraine,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former intelligence officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital. ""This is another example of the failed sanctions policy pursued by the Biden Administration. The sanctions have not changed Putin’s behavior in nine years, they never will."" Koffler's comments come after it was revealed that Russia will send Afghanistan two million tonnes of wheat, a million tonnes of gasoline and diesel, and 500,000 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas annually at a discount compared to global commodity prices, according to a Reuters report Wednesday. , : Taliban fighters celebrate one year since they seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, in front of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Monday, Aug. 15. The deal represents the first major international agreement the Taliban has struck since regaining power in Afghanistan last year, with most governments around the world refusing to offer the group official recognition until the country improves its record on human rights. Russia does not officially recognize the Taliban government, but is one of the few countries that kept its embassy in Kabul open after U.S. forces left, and Taliban forces swept across the country and retook its capital. Earlier this month, two Russian diplomats were killed in a suspected suicide bomb attack aimed at its embassy in Kabul. The suicide bomber's device exploded outside the embassy's visa section. The Associated Press reported at the time there was no immediate reason given for the attack by the terror group. The deal comes at a time of economic crisis for both countries, with Russia facing a limited market of buyers for its energy exports amid American and western sanctions in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine. However, Koffler does not believe the agreement will have a significant impact on the Russian economy. ""The new deal with the Taliban by itself will not release the strains placed on the Russian economy by the U.S. and European economic sanctions. Russia is in desperate need of high-tech parts, such as semiconductors, not raisins and medicinal herbs promised by Taliban to Putin in exchange for oil, gas, and wheat,"" Koffler said. Russian President Vladimir Putin. ‘ ’: . Meanwhile, Afghanistan's economy has deteriorated significantly since the Taliban takeover, with most of the country's population living below the poverty line while the Taliban government struggles with sanctions and the lack of development aid the country enjoyed under its western-supported government. ""Afghans are in great need,"" acting Afghan Commerce and Industry Minister Haji Nooruddin Azizi told Reuters. ""Whatever we do, we do it based on national interest and the people's benefit."" While details on specific prices and payment methods were not available, Azizi said that Russia would move the supplies to Afghanistan by road and rail. If both sides are satisfied with the deal during the temporary trial period, a longer term deal is expected to be signed. In this photo taken on May 4, 2022, flash flood-affected children sit outside their damaged house at Qadis district in Badghis province. - Flash floods and storms killed at least 18 people after ravaging several provinces of Afghanistan. The Russian agreement with the Taliban comes more than three decades after the end of the Soviet-Afghan War, a nine-year conflict that ended in a Soviet defeat and withdrawal from Afghanistan. In the aftermath, a civil war in Afghanistan eventually resulted in the Taliban's first take over of the country in 1996. However, despite the positive development in relations with Russia, Azizi made clear that the Taliban does not want to depend on only one country to help lift its struggling economy. ""A country ... shouldn't be dependent on just one country, we should have alternative ways,"" he said.",22

Former President Trump warned the war in Ukraine can inadvertently lead to World War and nuclear escalation during a Tuesday appearance on New York billionaire John Catsimatidis' 77 radio show. ""Mr. President, tell us, what are the things that keep you up at night right now?"" Catsimatidis asked. ""I think more than anything else, I think we can end up in World War . All of the horrible things that took place in Ukraine, looks like it's going to happen in China with Taiwan,"" Trump said. ‘ ’ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is seen on the screen delivering a speech via videoconference to the U.S. Congress at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., the United States, March 16, 2022. ""What's happened in Ukraine should've never, ever happened, and now the word nuclear is being discussed, and I think that's one of the most dangerous things, I think we're at the most dangerous time maybe in many, many years, maybe ever, because of the power of nuclear,"" Trump continued. ""For a major nation that's equal with us on nuclear power to be throwing around the word cavalierly like nuclear is a very bad time, a very bad time for this country, and a very bad and very dangerous time for the world."" Catsimatidis pointed out how some have argued that Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump were still president. Trump responded that he believed President Biden's botched Afghanistan withdrawal demonstrated weakness and incompetence that emboldened Putin to attack Ukraine. : ‘ ’ Then-President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, welcome each other at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland, Monday, July 16, 2018. Trump also pointed out that the price of oil was much lower when he was in office, and argued that elevated oil prices caused by the Biden administration's climate agenda have helped finance Putin's war. ""You wouldn't have had to talk to Putin, because the numbers would not have allowed him to do what he's done. Because at $100 a barrel, the money he makes is so enormous he can afford to fight a war that should have never started regardless of that, and it would have never started,"" Trump said. Industry leaders and experts have placed part of the blame on then-President Trump, who infamously launched his campaign with a critique of Mexican immigrants, and not long afterward called for a total ban on travel from several countries. Trump also noted that he ""filled up the national strategic reserves"" that Biden has since depleted domestically and sold to China.",9
2022-09-29,https://www.foxnews.com/world/further-trouble-russias-backyard-recent-fighting-allies-creates-new-headache-putin,Further trouble in Russia’s backyard as recent fighting between allies creates new headache for Putin,"Fox News' Greg Palkot reports on Putin's most recent nuclear threats and his call to Russian military reserves to mobilize within Russia With Russia’s war in Ukraine grabbing most international headlines, another conflict has erupted in the post-Soviet space that has major implications for both Russia and its historic sphere of influence. Nearly 100 people, including 37 civilians and four children, were killed and hundreds more injured in the recent clash at the border between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, another flashpoint, along with Ukraine, in the territory of the former Soviet Union, where Russia historically has tried to exert its influence. ""Russia has prided itself on being acknowledged as a regional security leader, including heading the , a self-styled alternative block to . However, its role has been exposed as symbolic and limited, as it has refused to intervene in live interstate conflicts involving former Soviet states, even when called upon by members to uphold its treaty obligations,"" Alexander Cooley, professor of political science at Barnard College, told Fox News Digital. Earlier this month Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards fired at each other with reports of civilian areas targeted on either side of the border. Both sides blamed the other for the latest round of violence along the border in the southern Batken region of Kyrgyzstan, much of which is disputed. It remains unclear, at this point, which country initiated the violence. Since a meeting of the two presidents earlier this month at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization a tenuous cease-fire had appeared to be holding until the Tajiks accused Kyrgyzstan of violating the agreement. Many observers of the region believe small-scale skirmishes along the border will continue as they have so frequently in the past. Vladimir Putin delivers an address flanked by men in military uniforms. , - : The underlying border feud remains unresolved. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov and Tajik President Emomali Rahmon and called on both sides to end the violence and de-escalate the situation. Beyond the rhetorical urge to end hostilities, it’s unclear how involved Putin is in the current conflict. Central Asia and the territory of the former Soviet Union is important geography where Russia has historically tried to exert its influence and flex muscle. ""Putin and his regime seek to reintegrate former Soviet states back under Russia’s control and form a U.S.S.R. like alliance. It’s the official policy and strategy and a high-stakes issue for Putin and his legacy,"" former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler and author of the book ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan remain firmly within Russia’s area of influence since they declared independence in 1991. Both countries host Russian military bases and both are members of the , a forum for Russia to exert its military presence in Central Asia. Politically, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are embedded in the Commonwealth of Independent States , a pact among the fractured former republics of the Soviet Union. Several of the members of these post-Soviet institutions are engaged in conflicts, which undermines the integrity of these organizations. With Central Asia being in Russia’s backyard, Putin has an incentive to keep the region calm and stable. As his war in Ukraine has slowed and Ukraine intensifies its counteroffenses and regains occupied territory, Putin has little time to devote to another dispute. A Kyrgyz soldier guards the ""Golovnoy"" watershed in May 2001. 4 Experts say Putin is preoccupied with his war of aggression in Ukraine and has called in foreign mercenaries from Central Asia as Russian forces have continued to experience severe setbacks in the eastern Donbas region. The United States, on the other hand, has little leverage or credibility in Central Asia, particularly after the August 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Yet analysts on the area such as Koffler say there is an opportunity for the U.S. to expand its influence, but it has to be precise and without preconditions. ""If the U.S. seeks to democratize the region, it’s a doomed project, that the Central Asian and Western cultures are vastly different. These are very authoritarian states that prioritize the primacy of the state versus the individual. Human rights is not the language they understand. If the U.S. were to pursue purely transactional relationships, then it’s possible. There’s a precedent for that, for example the U.S. previously maintaining a military base in Kyrgyzstan, operated by the U.S. Air Force. There’s always an opportunity for the U.S., being the driver of the world’s innovation and expertise in high-tech, medicine and other industries, to have business relationships with any regime,"" she noted. Protesters rally near the Kyrgyz parliament in Bishkek to demand authorities support residents of Kyrgyzstan's southern Batken province following border clashes with Tajik troops, Sept. 16, 2022. The recent conflict between two former Soviet republics reveals the tensions that remain 30 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the formation of newly independent nations. 'S , , - ""There are different Soviet maps dating from different years showing different lines and on the ground that each side pulls out from time to time to make its case. The borders never really were well-defined, especially in the more rugged and untamed parts of the border"" Gavin Helf, Central Asia expert at the United States Institute of Peace, told Fox News. The crisis between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan is not the only conflict to flare in the post-Soviet space. Armenia and Azerbaijan are also locked in a decades-long conflict over disputed territory that was inherited following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Most recently, Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed at their disputed border and saw over 100 service members killed on both sides. Normally, Russia would intervene diplomatically in its neighborhood to bring such a conflict to a resolution, but Putin isn’t even inserting himself between the two countries. This lack of interest, to some, is a clear sign of Russia’s decreasing influence. Tajikistan soldiers attend a ceremony marking the end of the mission in Almaty, on Jan. 13, 2022.",22

So if you want to laugh, if you want to laugh at the idea of like two presidents diametrically opposed coming together, Trump calling him, if Obama doesn't call him back, that's not a good sign. If they call and they go, look, you know, maybe we can talk, you know, I could talk to Putin, you could talk to Zelenskyy. If you just think that's crazy, then what ideas do you have? , ‘’",0
2022-10-01,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-trump-obama-team-up-super-friends-solve-russia-ukraine-crisis,GREG GUTFELD: Could Trump and Obama team up together like 'Super Friends' to solve Russia-Ukraine crisis?,"'Gutfeld!' panelists react to President Trump offering to solve the crisis between Russia and Ukraine, and Vice President Harris touting alliance with Republic of North Korea. I'm so excited, let me get my notes together. Oh, so many things. Happy Friday, my Friday, friends. But before I get to the monologue, I want to send our thoughts to those who are currently suffering, not him, I'm talking about people experiencing the wrath of Hurricane Ian, not hurricane Gutfeld, though what a mess I've left behind. Brian Williams. Oh, man, I'm taunting karma, aren't I? Yeah, I am. I've been fired many times. Yeah, you got Brian Williams. You got Don Lemon. You got James Corden, Samantha Bee, and now Trevor. I'd say Seth Meyers is next, but I really like her work, she's a keeper. Now, as for all of our friends down south, in all seriousness, dealing with the hurricane, our hearts are with you and especially with this guy. There he is. You know, if that doesn't reflect the spirit of America, when times get tough, I don't know what does. We're with you Florida flag guy, wherever you ended up. R.I.P. ‘!’ , - So this week, former President Trump suggested that he could lead a team to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia. Yeah, someone finally mentioned peace. He did it on his own app, Truth Social, where he wrote, ""U.S. leadership should remain cool, calm and dry on the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. This is a big event that should not entail a big solution. Do not make matters worse. Be strategic. Be smart. Brilliant."" He's got it in parentheses. ""Get a negotiated deal done now. Both sides need it and they want it. The entire world is at stake. I will head up group."" Three question marks after that, that means it's real. Vladimir Putin delivers an address flanked by men in military uniforms. Of course, being Trump, he had to remind everybody that this war never would have happened under his watch. And we'll never know if that's true, of course, but we do know he can't do worse than his bumbling successor, who only strikes fear in pre-teens with ponytails. Speaking of, let's check in on him. Not the right way to go. They did find him three hours later on an interstate clutching a teddy bear. Now, this wasn't the first time Trump called for a peace and negotiated peace between Russia and Ukraine. In April, he said they should negotiate ""now... not later,"" when everyone will be dead. Exclamation point. And as you know, it's hard to talk to dead people, as hard as Biden tries. Yeah, that's normal. But despite having no diplomatic experience, Trump understood a war's most lamentable variable, duration. The longer it goes, the worse it gets in terms of loss of human life and loss of treasure. And so he said this. : A ' ' 2019: I really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem. That would be a tremendous achievement. Look at Zelensky's face, he does not want to hear that. But that was three years ago. Of course, no one wanted to take that seriously at the time because it's Trump. So is this recent offer a crazy idea, a desperate idea, or a brilliant one? It could be all three. Like when I shaved Bill Hemmer's back, I just left his initials. That could mean a lot of things. Abraham Accords signing ceremony at the White House on September 13, 2021. Fact is, with Trump, his penchant for deal making makes him a better diplomat than most. You table the animosities and grudges in deals, and you ask both parties what they want to get out of this. Everyone needs an off ramp, including Putin, or else there isn't an end, just mountains of dead. There's no food or gas, and we're one errant missile away from America joining World War with a president who has cabbage for brains. So what do you think the biggest obstacle to world peace really is? Is it corruption? Sure. Authoritarianism? Maybe. Jesse Watters? Perhaps. But you're close with that. ' ' My guess it's ego. A subject I'm an expert in, for it's ego that keeps people in power from listening to those other people that they can't stand who can help them. Maybe because they aren't diplomats or they aren't in your party or they're Donald Trump. However, Trump's provided the world with two huge successes and it's not that The Apprentice or his signature ribeye steaks, which are delicious. You still have my address, right? You can send them there. First, North Korea, without any diplomatic experience, Trump obliterated the threat like they were Hillary Clinton's dreams. He was laughed at, but he did it. And now what do we have in his place at the ? : So the United States shares a very important relationship, which is an alliance with the Republic of North Korea, and it is an alliance that is strong and enduring. Vice President Kamala Harris, right, looks towards the north side of the border at the Demilitarized Zone . It is, is there a 25th Amendment for the vice president or as she would call it banana fufu, carrot top. Then there's the Abraham Accords, orchestrated by Trump's son-in-law, who again had no experience in diplomacy, although having Trump as a father-in-law looks better than anything on Anthony Blinken's resumé. But I'm starting to think diplomacy is like co-hosting ""Fox & Friends,"" anybody can do it. Idiots like Tony Blinken and John Kerry, they just make it look hard. But the Trump administration brokered a deal between sworn enemies. If this were a Democrat White House, the staff would have Nobel Prizes coming out of their asses, which is less painful than going in, I've heard. So now you have Trump offering to help. And I'm sure that drew dismissive laughter from all the useless nothing-crats. But why should they be laughing? It's not any funnier than Democrats believing men could get pregnant. : ‘ ’ . , R-: Dr. Kumar, can biological men become pregnant and give birth? . : So men can have pregnancies, especially trans-men. . , R-: So are you saying that a biological female who identifies as a man and therefore becomes pregnant is, a ""man""? . : Somebody with a uterus may have a capability of becoming pregnant, whether they're a woman or a man. That doesn't mean. . , R-: Okay, we're done. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left, and U.S. President Donald Trump shake hands over the military demarcation line at the border village of Panmunjom in Demilitarized Zone. I have a feeling America is almost at the point of saying, ""yeah, we're done."" At least what Trump is offering makes sense, and no wonder the Dems don't like it, they never see that stuff. Right now, they have no way forward diplomatically in ending a war that we are paying for. Fact is, Trump might be the only person to pull this one off, but perhaps with the help of another guy. Yeah, that guy who also saw the folly in picking sides between these two countries. Now, could you imagine this? A peace team that feels exactly like a buddy cop movie? One unorthodox wild man, another a by the book bureaucrat, it's like Lethal Weapon, 48 ., and Laverne & Shirley all rolled into one, that's a brilliant idea. But in order for this to happen, Obama and others would have to lose their ego. It's the same thing I tell Jesse Watters when he keeps spray-painting his bald spot. Our leaders should ask themselves, would I be okay with real peace if Trump had a role? If you say no, then that's your ego talking, and you value it more than human life, which sadly makes you another useless diplomat. Let's go to Joy Behar for a comment. It's Friday and yeah, I'm going to be milking that one for a while.",0
2022-10-01,https://www.foxnews.com/media/dan-bongino-us-slow-walking-way-world-war-iii,DAN BONGINO: The US is 'slow-walking its way' into World War III,"Fox News host Dan Bongino reacts to the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline amid the Russia-Ukraine war in the opening monologue of ‘Unfiltered.’ Fox News host Dan Bongino warned that the United States could be ""slow-walking"" into a global conflict after the damage and potential sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline in Saturday's monologue of ""Unfiltered with Dan Bongino."" : We're in a really dangerous place right now. The sabotage of the crucial Nord Stream pipeline — delivers gas from Russia to Germany — is a really big deal. It's the kind of event that can spark a world war. I'm worried that the U.S. is slow-walking its way directly into World War and the guy in the White House has his head — I'll get kicked off cable if I tell you the rest. : ? So who did it? Who blew up the pipeline or pieces of it? That's the multi-billion dollar question. The blame game's already in full swing over who's responsible. So I'm going to break it down briefly and show you why I'm concerned about, again, a slow-walk into World War , which is a really bad thing, because the Golden Rule on my show is, ""Don't get dead."" U.S. President Joe Biden.",0
2022-10-03,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-nuclear-war-means-end-world,TUCKER CARLSON: Nuclear war means the end of the world,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson voices his concerns over the use of nuclear weapons in the Russia-Ukraine conflict on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' The question of who blew up Russia's energy pipelines to Europe, which is not just a question in the news, it's a historical question, we've addressed it a couple of times already, is not really much of a question anymore. So, on television, they're assuring you that obviously the Russians did it. Vladimir Putin sabotaged his own pipelines. With his nation at war, Putin intentionally destroyed Russia's most vital national asset. Now why, you ask yourself, would Putin do that? Well, because...actually no one's explained why Putin would do something like that. Bad people do bad things. That seems to be the idea. Former Director John Brennan showed up on the other day to add his version of the story and it was clear right away that this was no ordinary cable news segment. Brennan was instead conducting a scientific experiment designed to determine just how stupid viewers are. Now, these are people who believe Joe Biden when he told them was a pandemic of the unvaccinated. These are the ones who think men can become women just by saying, so clearly, they are highly credulous, but the question remains, just how credulous are they? What won't they believe? Well, in the name of science, John Brennan decided to find out. Watch. , : Do you think Russia is behind the sabotage of the pipelines? Vladimir Putin delivers an address flanked by men in military uniforms. : Well, I think all the signs point to some type of sabotage. These pipelines are only in about 200 feet or so of water and Russia does have an undersea capability, too, that would easily lay explosive devices by those pipelines. I think this is clearly an act of sabotage of some sort and Russia is certainly the most likely suspect. Do you think the Russians did it? asked the anchor, do you think the man with four bullet holes in his head committed suicide? Oh, yes, says John Brennan. The Russians are certainly the most likely suspect. Well, of course they are. Did you ever doubt it? Once Putin got done electing Donald Trump president and then finished creating Hunter Biden's fake laptop and dropping it off at a mac repair shop in Delaware, Putin set about sabotaging his own natural gas pipelines, which were his main source of foreign currency and leverage over Europe. That's how tricky Vladimir Putin is. Obviously, his next move will be nuking Moscow, all part of his diabolical plan to achieve world domination by destroying himself. That's effectively what John Brennan told 's viewers. Did they believe him? Sure, they did. John Brennan used to run the . He knows which lies work. He's an expert. '' : Now, Tony Blinken, by contrast, is not an expert. He's a failed rock musician who somehow became the secretary of state of the United States. He's, of course, happy to lie, does it a lot, but he's not especially good at it. At the beginning of last week, Blinken was pretending to be baffled by the sabotage of Nord Stream. No one benefits from this, he said. Not in a million years could he imagine. Who would do something like that? It was just unfathomable. That was Tuesday. By Friday, Blinken had dropped the post and admitted that actually, we did it. Now, Tony Blinken didn't use quite those words, but there was no mistaking what he meant. Watch. : It's a tremendous opportunity to, once and for all, remove the dependance on Russian energy and thus to take away from Vladimir Putin the weaponization of energy as a means of advancing his imperial designs. That's very significant and that offers tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come. Now we don't have a super long attention span, but this was pretty compressed in the space of like four days. So last Tuesday, the largest act of industrial terrorism in our lifetimes was a baffling crime, said Tony Blinken, but by Friday, that same event had become ""a tremendous opportunity,"" in fact, a tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come. It's a good thing. Now that's an admission. That's the clearest admission we're ever going to get. No one could miss it, least of all the Russians. The Biden administration is responsible, either directly or through proxies, for the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines and the environmental catastrophe and the economic collapse that will certainly follow. That is true. It's done. ' ' : ' ' So the question is, where does that leave us? And that's the problem. This act leaves us, the United States, with no option but total war with Russia. There is no off-ramp now. There is no way out. We are all in, no matter what that means, no matter where it goes. Are you shocked by this? Was there a vote on this? Did someone ask your opinion? No, but it's been happening for months in slow motion. It's been hidden from public view by the near-total blackout imposed by America media outlets so you probably didn't know any of the details. For example, in March, the Turkish government tried to broker a peace in Ukraine and they came very, very close. Wasn't reported widely. Ukraine was prepared to guarantee neutrality, meaning it would not join . That's what the Russians wanted above all and in return for that, the Russian government would withdraw its forces from Ukraine and that might have been a neat solution, certainly for the rest of us. The global economy wouldn't need to be destroyed. Nobody would die in a nuclear war. Negotiations to that point advanced to the stage that Vladimir Putin pledged to meet with Zelenskyy to sign a peace treaty and Zelenskyy was ready for it, too and we're quoting, ""I'm ready for a dialog,"" he announced, but sadly, Zelenskyy could not act alone. Despite what you may hear on News, Zelenskyy is not the independent leader of a democratic nation. No, not even close. That is a fiction. Zelenskyy is a client of the Biden administration, which runs his country, and ideologues within the Biden administration did not want a negotiated peace in Ukraine. They wanted all along and it's very clear now a regime change war against Russia. Period. So, that's what they are now getting. On Friday, Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine is applying for full membership in on an expedited basis. In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office on Saturday, June 18, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends meeting with military officials as he visits the war-hit Mykolaiv region. What would happen if Ukraine were to join ? Well, by definition, there would be an immediate world war in which we would be a major participant. Article five of the 's charter, the mutual defense clause, guarantees that would happen. That's not an opinion. That is a fact and everyone knows it and yet, remarkably, Democrats in Congress cheered it on and we're quoting ""Ukraine's fight is the reason we form in the first place,"" said mouth breathing Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois. ""I think we need to support this."" Oh, yes, we do. Nancy Pelosi, peering through the fog of her own senility, agreed. ""I would be for Ukraine having a security guarantee,"" she said. Oh, no problem and of course, because he has no choice, whatever you think of him, Zelenskyy, who is the puppet of the Democratic Party the United States, read from the same script. On Friday, Zelenskyy said he will accept nothing less than the removal of Vladimir Putin as the president of Russia. Watch : Ukraine was and remains the leader of negotiation efforts. It is our country that always proposed to Russia to agree on coexistence, on equal, honest, dignified and fair conditions. Clearly, with this Russian president, it is impossible. He does not know what dignity and honesty are. Therefore, we are ready for a dialog with Russia, but with another president of Russia. So, that's the demand. Putin must be removed from office. Putin, of course, has no intention of leaving. You would have to take him out. Now, you don't have to like Vladimir Putin. You don't have to like anything about Vladimir Putin. You can hate Vladimir Putin and most Americans do, but you can still understand how totally deranged talk like this is. It's the definition of reckless. Consider their own descriptions. For years, Democrats and the defense establishment they control have told us that Vladimir Putin is crazy and evil and he may be. Let's assume it's true. They've said it. Is that the man you want to publicly threaten with extermination? This is the man who controls more than 6,000 nuclear warheads. So, if you push him hard enough, why wouldn't he use those nuclear weapons? Well, by their own description of him, he would. 4 '' We would have a nuclear war, but let's say, as a best-case scenario, you're able to kill Vladimir Putin before he could launch those 6,000 odd missiles against the United States or any other country. Where would that leave Russia, the country he controls? Russia is not Iraq. Russia represents an eighth of the world's total landmass. It is a huge country in a highly fractious country with a large and very restive Muslim population. So, that's true. Just for one second, what are the chances that in the ensuing chaos, which we are forcing on Russia in that chaos, what are the chances that one of those 6,200 nuclear weapons might wind up in the hands of someone who is truly crazy and dangerous to us and to the world? Well, let's see. What happened to Saddam Hussein's stockpiles of conventional weapons after American forces captured Saddam Hussein in Tikrit in December of 2003 and changed the regime there? Well, lots of Americans died and the country split apart. So, multiply that outcome times infinity and you understand what our leaders are proposing here and just how deranged they are and they should know better because they've done this before, but they learned nothing. They were never held to account and they never learned. If you're not punished, you don't learn and so they are ready to make the very same mistakes, but on an existential scale and not just the wackos, not just the discredited ones like Toria Nuland or buffoons like our secretary of state, the serious ones. Here's former director David Petraeus on , calmly explaining that if Russia wants nuclear weapons, no problem, well, eliminate their Black Sea fleet. : ' ' : It can still get worse for Putin and for Russia and even the use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield won't change this at all. Jake Sullivan has publicly stated that the U.S. has communicated to Russia what would happen in response to that. : And what would happen? : Well, again, I have deliberately not talked to Jake about this. I mean, just to give you a hypothetical, we would respond by leading a , a collective effort that would take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship on in the Black Sea. Oh, that's reassuring. So, Russia launches nuclear weapons. We'll just sink their ships. Really? David Petraeus, really think it'll end there? That would be the first use of a nuclear weapon in almost 80 years since 1945, but you think you'd be able to contain the inevitable chain reaction with the conventional response. We'll just sink their ships. No problem. Apparently, David Petraeus does think that and keep in mind in Washington, David Petraeus is regarded as a genius and by local standards, he certainly is. Suddenly, everyone in authority, everyone with a megaphone, everyone with actual power is thinking and talking just like David Petraeus. No problem. The Daily Beast, which is the tip sheet of the midwits who run our government, just had this piece today. ""Putin has left the world no other option but regime change."" No mention of the inevitable consequences of regime change. A crazy person with nuclear weapons and you're telling him in public you're going to kill him and you're hoping for the best and if he launches nuclear weapons, which apparently you have accepted as a possibility, let's take out two ships. Well, just sink his feet and move on to the next naughty dictator. We'll show him. That's the depth of the analysis of the looming catastrophe that we're all facing. Last night on ""60 Minutes,"" Scott Pelley again he had the opportunity to interview Zelenskyy's wife, who was a full partner, apparently in running that country, but there was no word about where this war could go, which is nuclear war. Instead, Scott Pelley used the opportunity to suck up, talk about how Ukrainian flag bumper stickers are everywhere in New York City. Mrs. Zelenskyy. Watch this. : Are you stronger than you thought you were? : Everyone has become stronger. I'm not unique. : Madam First Lady, may I show you some photographs from the United States? This is a picture I took on Fifth Avenue in New York. This is a bumper sticker where I buy my groceries. I took this picture on the east side of Manhattan. What do you say to the American people? The First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska views the coffin of Queen Elizabeth who lies in state at Westminster Hall ahead of her funeral on Monday. She was not joined by her husband amid the war in Ukraine. We apologize if you just threw up in your own mouth. That's ""60 Minutes,"" the serious news show that gets to the heart of everything. Are you ever tired of being so brave and wonderful? That's the level of analysis we're getting, showing the wife of the president of Ukraine a bumper sticker with Ukrainian flag. We're on your side. We love you. We really do. This is true lunacy. An entire country ignoring led by its leaders, leaders who specialize in ignoring the things that matter, imminent catastrophe. That's not an overstatement. This is not the inflation rate ticking up two points or a loss of 15% of your 401k and this is a nuclear war. Underneath it all, the people rolling the dice here understand exactly what's at stake even if the American public has no idea and we know that from a recent from New York City that tells you what to do when the Russians actually do lob nukes into midtown. Here it is. : So, there's been a nuclear attack. Don't ask me how or why. Just know that the big one has hit. . So, what do we do? Step one: Get inside fast. You, your friends, your family. Get inside. Stay inside. Shut all doors and windows. Have a basement? Head there. If you were outside after the blast, get clean immediately. Remove and bag all outer clothing to keep radioactive dust or ash away from your body. Oh, yeah. Keep radioactive dust and ash away. Just like one of those things. Clean the gutters. Right? Be sure to put chem lawn on in the spring and obviously keep the radioactive dust away. Just shower, go inside, no problem. Busses in New Jersey now have signs warning about radiation poisoning ""September is National Preparedness Month. Do you know what you do in a radiation emergency?"" No, you don't. It doesn't matter. This is all make believe. It's all play-acting. If you live in a big metro area, there's not anything you're going to do during a nuclear exchange because you're going to be dead along with most other Americans. The overwhelming majority of Americans will be dead and those who survive will starve to death because all agriculture will be destroyed, along with billions of people around the planet. So, it's time to update your assumptions about the technology here. These are not the bombs that flattened Nagasaki. They are incalculably more powerful. You hit New York, you take out Miami.",0

Former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley urged to continue providing Ukrainians with the tools they need to retake their country from Russia, arguing it will set the tone for China as well. On ""Fox & Friends"" Monday, Haley noted that Ukraine is ""almost there"" with regard to beating back Putin's forces. : It's hard. [Putin's] got his tentacles in every agency. He's always been paranoid. So [removing him from power] is going to be a hard thing. He's dangerous. You can't imply that he's not. He's dangerous, but he knows he's falling. And he's got to figure this out quick. The key is and the United States need to continue to support Ukraine because they're almost there. They just have to keep supporting them, not in blank checks, but give them the anti-drone equipment, give them what they need to finish the deal, because this will set the tone not only for Russia, but China. And that's key.",0
2022-10-04,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-sentences-us-marine-veteran-4-5-years-penal-colony,Russia sentences US Marine veteran to 4.5 years in 'penal colony',"Former U.S. intel officer Rebekah Koffler provides analysis on the Russian courts’ decision to sentence player Brittney Griner to 9 years in prison on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.’ A Russian court sentenced U.S. Marine veteran Robert Gilman to 4.5 years in a penal colony Tuesday, roughly a week after his conviction on charges of assaulting a police officer. Gilman was first arrested in January on a train from Sochi to Moscow after passengers complained about his belligerence. Gilman, who was drunk at the time, bruised a Russian police officer with a kick while being dragged off of the train. Gilman is one of several U.S. citizens currently serving years-long sentences in Russian prisons. The U.S. State Department did not respond to a request for comment on Gilman's case from Fox News Digital. ""This is another case that demonstrates that Americans are not safe in Russia, especially Americans of Russian descent and especially now when the relations between Moscow and Washington are at the lowest point in history, including the Cold War,"" Rebekah Koffler, a strategic intelligence expert and author of ""Putin’s Playbook"" told Fox. , Russia President Vladimir Putin. Gilman is an American of Russian descent whose parents both attended Moscow State University. He speaks fluent Russian and appealed to the Russian court for a lower sentence in a bilingual speech, Koffler added. ""The Russian authorities prey on people like that. They are looking for Russian-Americans to return to mother Russia and to serve as propaganda props, who would badmouth America and praise Russia. The Russians will likely intimidate him into cooperating with them for some anti-American activities,"" she continued. , ’S ‘ ,’ Gilman's sentencing comes weeks after the U.S. and Ukraine exchanged prisoners with Russia, securing the release of hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war and two Americans, among other nationals. Russia is currently holding several American citizens in its prisons, the most high-profile of whom is Brittney Griner. Griner is a star who was sentenced to 9 years in prison for marijuana possession earlier this year. A Russian court found Brittney Griner guilty of smuggling and storing narcotics after prosecutors requested a sentence of nine and a half years in jail for the athlete. U.S. Marine Veteran Paul Whelan is also serving a 16-year prison sentence in the country on espionage charges.",18

In a statement released by the North Korean Foreign Ministry, director-general of the department’s International Organizations Jo Chol Su claimed the referenda held last week in Ukraine signified the ""will"" of the people and was ""in keeping with the Charter."" The official’s comments echoed claims made by Putin after polls allegedly showed Ukrainians in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions ""overwhelmingly"" supported seceding from Ukraine. Kyiv and Western officials have repeatedly accused Russia of falsifying the results, which allegedly showed that 87 to 99 percent of the region’s populations supported annexation in the wake of Russia’s deadly invasion. '' Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin and Kim Jong Un's relationship has become closer. Officials from Russia and North Korea – who have banded together amid stiff international sanctions – have accused the U.S. of using Ukraine in an attempt to maintain a ""unipolar world."" ""The U.S. interferes in the internal affairs of independent countries and infringes upon their legal rights by abusing the [United Nations Security Council] ,"" the director-general said in a statement. ""This is the same old trick of the U.S., and the world has witnessed lots of similar illegal acts."" Putin has rallied his allies, including China, Iran and North Korea, behind the claim that the U.S. seeks global dominance over furry that superior U.S. and European weaponry have allowed Kyiv to defend itself effectively. Ukrainian soldiers sit on infantry fighting vehicles as they drive near Izyum, eastern Ukraine on September 16, 2022, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. , ""The days are going never to return when the U.S. can use the as its shield and means of aggression for maintaining its supremacy,"" he added, accusing the of employing ""gangster-like double standards."" The comments from the North Korean ministry coincided with Pyongyang's decision to fire an unannounced ballistic missile over Japan – which has joined the U.S. and its allies in condemning Moscow’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. The missile – the longest test fired by North Korea with a range of more than 2,800 miles – was immediately condemned by the White House, which accused Pyongyang of blatantly violating mandated international safety norms.

2022-10-05,https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-benefits-russia-relationship-international-reputation-risk-experts,"China still benefits from Russia relationship, even with international reputation at risk: experts","Fox News Chief National Security correspondent Jennifer Griffin joined 'Special Report' with the latest on Ukrainian forces recapturing a city in Russia's annexed region, Vladimir Putin's nuclear threats and foreign influence in the midterms. China still has much to gain from its current relationship with Russia even as the invasion of Ukraine drags on, turning Russia into an international pariah and threatening to rub off on China’s reputation as well. ""China has, in effect, doubled down on its support for the Putin war effort, and we saw this, for instance, last month when China's third rank leader went to Moscow, spoke to the State Duma, and in very clear terms, expressed Beijing's support for Russia,"" Gordon Change, author of ""The Coming Collapse of China,"" told Fox News Digital. ""Then, [we] see Jinping himself when he was in Uzbekistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, actually confirmed that endorsement,"" Chang added. ""The only conclusion that we can come to is that Beijing is not backing away from Russia."" The China and Russia dynamic has remained a troubling one for the United States since even before the invasion of Ukraine started in March 2022. Beijing purchased around 100 metric tons of Russian coal in the run-up to the invasion and relaxed Russian wheat imports – all of which helped provide Russia with much-needed cash as Western sanctions hit hard and fast. 'S ‘ ’ : - But the invasion did not end quickly as many expected it might, and Ukraine has continued to make gains that seemed unbelievable when the invasion started, from taking back key strategic points around Kyiv to pushing back Russia and forcing Moscow to focus only on the easternmost Donbas region. Chinese President Xi Jinping, left, and Russian President Vladimir Putin pose for a photo on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Thursday, Sept. 15, 2022. Despite the reputational damage that might come with continuing to associate with Russia – especially as allegations of war crimes keep piling up and Russian men flee the country to avoid Putin’s draft – China still benefits from its relationship with Moscow. : ‘ ’ , Chief among those benefits is the ongoing effort to continue updating and modernizing the Chinese military, which Beijing has accomplished by working to ""reverse engineer Russia,"" according to Miles Yu, Senior Fellow and director of China Center at Hudson Institute. In this handout photo taken from video released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Monday, Aug. 29, 2022, Chinese soldiers arrive to the Grodekovo railway station to participate in war games drills, in Grodekovo, Primorsky Krai, Russia. China would gain Russian weapon and vehicle designs and weapons by purchasing them, or in some cases going to Ukraine to buy the older models and figure out how to build their own, all to help build a better Chinese military. , ‘ A ’ And a lot of China’s adversaries in Asia happen to be Russian allies, meaning the two countries are working to balance their interests and try to take from each other without giving too much away. But China also seems to want it ""both ways"" and will angle for the ""postwar reconstruction in Ukraine,"" where Beijing can regain influence and control by providing Ukraine with a lot of what it will need to rebuild. Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a meeting of heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization member states at a summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan September 16, 2022. China’s main objective remains the expansion of its influence, however far that might go: Chinese President Xi Jinping has worked to grow the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a multinational trade organization that Beijing and Moscow created together with former soviet states in Asia. Iran recently joined the group, adding another foreign agitator to the ranks. Xi will be sworn in for an unprecedented third term as chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, but his ambitions could still end up rubbing his party the wrong way in the long run, according to Chang. ""We don't know what's going on inside China [as] the regime is becoming less transparent over time,"" Chang explained. ""There are certainly hints that senior Chinese leaders are not happy with Xi Jinping’s full-throated support for Vladimir Putin, but Xi’s got the power to silence dissenting voices."" ""At some point, you would think that for a variety of reasons, Xi will lose clout: It is not just Ukraine, it's not just the so-called wolf warrior diplomacy, but China losing friends around the world,"" Chang continued. ""It's not just the domestic problems which Xi is the author of: It's everything together."" ""At some point, the Chinese political system will do what's rational, and that is to get rid of Jinping, but we're not at that point yet.""",5
2022-10-05,https://www.foxnews.com/world/finnish-city-removes-last-statue-russian-leader-vladimir-lenin,Finnish city removes last statue of Russian leader Vladimir Lenin,"A city in southeastern Finland on Tuesday removed the country's last publicly displayed statue of Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin following pressure from residents in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine. A group of construction workers in Kotka, a port city of 52,000 not far from the border with Russia, hoisted the statue into a truck and drove it away to a warehouse of a local museum. City museum director Kirsi Niku told Finnish public broadcaster that the bronze bust was designed and constructed by Estonian sculptor Matti Varik in the late 1970s on orders from Moscow. It was presented to Kotka in 1979 as a gift from friendship city Tallinn, then the capital of the Estonian Soviet republic and now the capital of the Baltic nation of Estonia. Presenting such statues was a common practice by Moscow, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, to underline the Finnish-Soviet friendship in the post- era. A statue of Vladimir Lenin is being removed from the streets of Kotka, Finland, on Oct. 4, 2022. The Lenin statue is located in a central Kotka park adjacent to a wooden house where the Bolshevik party founder who became the Soviet Union's first premier is said to have stayed. The statue was vandalized over the years but remained in the park until Kotka’s city council decided to have it removed. Other European countries have moved to get rid of their remaining Soviet-era monuments since Russia invaded Ukraine more than seven months ago. 10 Finland and Russia share a 830 mile land border and a complicated history. Finland remained a part of the Russian Empire as an autonomous Grand Duchy for over a hundred years until Dec. 6, 1917, when it declared independence in the wake of the Russian Revolution led by Lenin. , Lenin and the Bolshevik leadership recognized the Nordic’s country independence on the last day of 1917. Ahead of the Russian Revolution, Lenin was exiled to Finland on several occasions, living in various cities and towns across the southern part of the country.",6
2022-10-05,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-explanation-allowed-nord-stream-government-wants-you-believe,TUCKER CARLSON: Only explanation allowed on Nord Stream is what the government wants you to believe,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson takes on the outrage to mere questions about possible U.S. involvement in the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' There are few things more infuriating than being lied to by your own government, the government you pay for, the one your ancestors risked their lives to protect. Does that happen to you? Of course, it has. It enrages you. But if it happens again and again, if it happens often enough, if your government makes a habit of lying to you, then over time it becomes something else. Over time, you realize you're not really living in a democracy. You can't be because in a democracy, the government has a moral and legal obligation to tell you the truth always. Period. That makes sense because in a democracy you are not a subject or a mere consumer. You're a citizen. You are a shareholder in the system. You are an owner of it. The people who run your government are your employees. They're like your cleaning lady. You may appreciate the work they do , but the minute you catch them stealing your cufflinks, you fire them. Those are the rules because it's your house, not theirs. 4.5 ' ' But what if the rules were inverted? What if you caught an employee stealing, but instead of seeming ashamed and penitent, he whipped around and attacked you like you were the criminal? Well, that is the experience of watching White House spokesman John Kirby talk about the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines. Anyone who imagines, who thinks for a moment the Biden administration was in any way involved with that sabotage, directly or indirectly, is not simply wrong, no. Anyone who imagines that is a bad person, a tool of Vladimir Putin. Watch. : Did the U.S. or a proxy for the U.S. have anything to do with the explosion on the Nord Stream pipeline? : The United States had nothing to do with it. That's just Russian propaganda and disinformation. Now we know it was an act of sabotage, but there's an investigation going on right now. I don't think we're going to get into credentialing that in terms of who was responsible. We're going to let the investigators take a look at that, but clearly, this was an act of sabotage. John Kirby, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications, takes part in White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre's press briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., August 1, 2022. /Leah Millis : So, you can officially say that the U.S. was not involved in any way in this attack? : That's right. That's correct. : Not to belabor this, but for the people who look at this and say, why would Russia attack its own pipeline? That creates leverage over Europe and perhaps the West, what do you say to them? : Again, I can't speak to specific accountability for this act of sabotage. I can just assure you the United States had nothing to do with it. Of course, that's just Russian propaganda. Notice Bret Baier asked the question, ""Did the U.S., did the Biden administration or any of its proxies have anything to do with the sabotage?"" To which John Kirby says we didn't do it and then moves right to the point, which is anyone who says we did it is repeating Russian propaganda. That's what John Kirby said. It's disinformation from quislings more loyal to Vladimir Putin than our own country. That's the kind of thing the only truly bad people say. Ok, if the White House says so, obviously we have no choice but to believe it, but you still have to wonder not everyone does believe that. Why? ' A ,' Where might some Americans have gotten the notion that the Biden administration might have been involved directly or through a proxy in the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines? Why would they think that? They certainly didn't watch it on Russia Today. has been pulled off the air. They didn't hear it from Putin or any of his ministers. You can barely find anything from the Russian government on Google and of course, any book sympathetic to Putin has been banned on Amazon. In fact, every piece of information that reflects the modern Russian point of view has been censored in the United States because this is a free country fighting for democracy. You just can't read what you want or think what you want. So actually, if you think about it, if Americans are deluded about what happened to the Nord Stream pipeline, the delusion didn't come from Moscow because there's no way for Moscow to get this disinformation to the United States because the U.S. government has blocked it along with the tech companies. So, where did that idea come from? Why might they think that? Well, maybe they learned it from Joe Biden himself. He's the president. Here's Biden this winter on American television pledging to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines if Russia does something he doesn't want them to do. : If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then there will be, there will be no longer on Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it. : ' ' U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during an event to celebrate passage of the ""Safer Communities Act,"" on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2022. : But how will you do that exactly since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control? : We will. I promise you we'll be able to do it. So, that's about as clear as it gets. Biden doesn't say we will shut it down. He will say, ""There will be no Nord Stream pipeline. We will put an end to it."" And the reporter says, ""But wait a second, it's not your pipeline. How will you be able to do that?"" So, he has a chance to reframe the question, to revise his answer, to be more precise, but he doesn't. He says flat out, ""I promise you will be able to take out Nord Stream."" Joe Biden, president of the United States. So, there's that clue and that is as if that wasn't enough, last week, last Friday, the secretary of state in the Biden administration, Mr. Tony Blinken, bragged about how great the sabotage of Nord Stream was and we're quoting ""It's a tremendous opportunity,"" said Tony Blinken. It's a great thing, not a tragedy, a victory, something we're in favor of. We're excited about it. Destroy the natural gas pipeline? We're for that. So, that might be another clue that the Biden administration may have had something to do with it. Oh, but no, says the White House, despite the fact that we promised we would do it, and then we crowed about how great it was after it happened, we had nothing at all to do with it. Who did it? Well, Russia did it. They blew up their own pipeline, making their own country poorer and weaker in the middle of a major war because that's how crazy but also diabolically effective the Russians are: suicidal, yet brilliant and if you don't buy that story uncritically, if you have any questions about how exactly that might work, you're a disloyal American. Shut up. Here's Chris Stewart, a Republican member of Congress from Utah, making the very same point. : John Kirby with the National Security Council was on earlier in no uncertain terms, said the U.S, was not behind and a proxy of the U.S. was not behind the explosion on the Nord Stream pipeline. From your perspective, both of you, do you agree with that? . , D-.: Oh, absolutely. This is the last thing that we want to raise gas prices further in Europe. It's pretty obvious this is a Russian sabotage operation. : And for the people, Congressman Stewart, that say, why would Russia do that on its own pipeline, what do you say? . , R-: Well, the people who are suggesting the U.S., that is exactly what Vladimir Putin wants. 'S , It's just so great. I mean, it's perfectly bipartisan here. You have a Republican from Utah, Chris Stewart, and a Democrat from Massachusetts, Seth Moulton, agreeing precisely. It's exactly what Vladimir Putin wants. He wants you to blame the Biden administration for something he did. That's the bipartisan view in Washington. What's interesting is they don't really know that. They have no evidence that that's true. Briefers from the intel agencies have, as of this afternoon, told members of Congress they have no idea who committed industrial terrorism against these pipelines. Now, that itself is a lie, of course. The has no idea at all? Right, they have no idea, but as far as members of Congress, Chris Stewart and Seth Moulton know, there is no evidence either way. They have no facts. That is a fact. They have no facts. So, again, as a factual matter, neither of those guys nor any member of Congress, no matter what committee they sit on, has any idea who did this, but if you suggest the obvious, Russia probably didn't do it, because why would they do it, it's against their own interest, no matter what dumb story you're trying to sell us, if you suggest that, if you apply common sense, you're evil, and then they go farther and say things that are like completely implausible. Seth Moulton and we're quoting, ""The last thing we want is to raise gas prices in Europe."" Really? Seth Moulton, is that true? Because isn't the Biden administration philosophically opposed to low gas prices? Aren't they opposed to all fossil fuels? Oh, right, they are. How do we know that? Is that Russian propaganda? No, because we can't read Russian propaganda because it's been banned in favor of our propaganda. We know that because Joe Biden himself has said so many times on television. Okay. So maybe there is a motive here. Maybe there's more than one motive, but don't ask because, warn the media, asking obvious questions is forbidden. : Fox News host Tucker Carlson irresponsibly claiming the United States was responsible for the leak. 'T -: '' ' , : Other than Putin and Tucker Carlson, it seems pretty clear that everyone knows that Putin did this himself. : And Tucker Carlson this past week, actually once again directly repeated Russian propaganda, suggesting it was somehow the United States behind the attack on the Nord Stream pipeline. How real is that movement? Is it growing? It's Russian propaganda! How dare they! Really? Is it really? Probably just a thought experiment here. A lot of Americans who don't feel any allegiance whatsoever to Russia, don't like Putin but care a lot about their own country and the behavior of their own government. So, their own government , is doing things contrary to their interests and then lying about it. Maybe they think they have a right to know and ask obvious questions like, ""Are you lying? And if you're not lying, speak slowly and tell us how your story, the one you're expecting us to believe, makes sense."" It's possible that asking questions is a patriotic duty of Americans. Shut up. That helps Putin. You're not allowed to say it. You're not allowed to quote the president of the United States promising to eliminate the Nord Stream pipelines. You're not allowed to quote his secretary of state celebrating that sabotage. You're required to believe that Putin took out his own infrastructure. You must. : ' ' Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting on the country's transport industry via a video link in Sochi, Russia May 24, 2022. , : How does this fit into Putin's playbook? Of course, as you would expect, Susan, Russia says, ""Oh, we had nothing to do with this. We're going to launch an investigation,"" but come on. , : Look, you know, the indications are that foul play was involved and that it appears that, you know, Russia is certainly the likeliest suspect of this. , : I think this is clearly an act of sabotage, of some sort and Russia is certainly the most likely suspect. I think this might be just the first salvo of some additional things that might be coming toward Europe. , , : What Putin is saying to us with, by blowing up his pipeline is, ""Look, I can blow up a pipeline if need be. I can blow up the Internet cables coming into your country. I can blow up functioning pipelines. I could do all sorts of stuff."" : ' F---- A ' Oh, it's Bill Browder. He's an expert on the subject. Believe Bill Browder. Don't believe your own lying eyes. There was a moment after it was very clear that the war in Iraq was not helping the United States in any way and in fact, hurting the core interests of the United States that the media engaged in a rare nanosecond of self-reflection. How do we get here? What role did we, for example, the New York Times, play in convincing the public that Saddam had when he didn't? For that one moment you thought, ""Wow, maybe they're learning something. Maybe they won't do it again."" But it turns out the opposite happened. Now they're just completely doubling down on what's very obviously a lie and attacking anyone who asks to hear it explained rationally. And it's not just the media, by the way. D.C. think tanks, whose purpose is long in telling what's the point of a D.C. think tank? Oh, to run interference for the ruling class, to bolster the regime of the Pretorian Guard. The Brookings Institution filled that role for many years. They just produced this analysis: ""U.S. podcasters spread Kremlin narratives on Nord Stream sabotage."" What's interesting about this analysis is that nowhere in it does the august Brookings Institution rebut the evidence that the U.S. or a proxy of the Biden administration had something to do with this. There's in fact, no evidence either way. Instead, they just attack anybody who ask questions. ""The theories pushed by these podcast hosts align with Kremlin messaging."" Oh, align with Kremlin messaging? They used to be called guilt by association. Vladimir Putin likes dogs, but you like dogs. What are you, a Russian sympathizer, right? In alliance with Russian propaganda? 'S '' , - The point is, it doesn't matter whether or not it's true, it aligns with Kremlin messaging. Therefore, you must be censored. But not everybody got the memo. There are tucked away in the deep recesses of American society, a few honest liberals still left. Maybe they've been, I don't know, in St. Barts for the last three years and didn't realize that you can no longer exercise free speech in this country. One of them is a professor at Columbia called Jeffrey Sachs. So, he went to Bloomberg the other day and was asked about the Nord Stream pipelines and he decided to respond rationally and he said, well, actually, there's quite a bit of evidence of the Biden administration was involved, but rather than follow up, the anchor, realizing that forbidden topics were being broached, this just shut down the segment, but not before Jeffrey Sachs said this. : The destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline, which I would bet was a U.S. action, perhaps U.S. and Poland. : Jeff, we got to stop there. That's quite a statement as well. Why do you feel that that was a U.S. action? What evidence do you have of that? ' '' - Vladimir Putin delivers an address flanked by men in military uniforms. : Well, first of all, there's direct radar evidence that U.S. helicopters, military helicopters that are normally based in Gdansk were circling over this area. We also had the threats from the United States earlier in this year that one way or another we are going to end Nord Stream. You're not allowed to say these things in in the West, but the fact of the matter is, all over the world, when I talk to people, they think the U.S. did it. Well. By the way, even reporters and our papers that are involved tell me privately, ""well, of course."" Well, it doesn't show up in our media. The anchor is clearly getting instruction. Stop him! Stop him! What evidence do you have? Well, there's radar evidence. What? Be quiet. Shut up. Just cut them off. Never invite them back. Stop.",0

""Despite regular communications with the State Department, and the U.S. Senator Bob Casey's effort to push for the reclassification of Marc Fogel’s case as ‘wrongfully detained,’ which was joined by a bipartisan coalition of legislators, Marc is yet to be declared wrongfully detained,"" Lisa Hyland, Fogel’s sister, told Fox News Digital. ""Marc's family received no explanations as to why,"" Hyland continued. ""There has been no movement from the administration. The family is deeply disappointed and frustrated by the Administration’s failure to designate Marc as wrongfully detained. We simply don’t understand it."" Fogel, a Pennsylvania native, had worked in Moscow as a teacher for 10 years when he was arrested for possession of medical marijuana while going through an airport. A Russian court rejected his appeal and upheld his current 14-year sentence, which he is set to serve out in an unknown prison colony. His family have tried to push for his status as ""wrongfully detained,"" while the State Department in August only filed for humanitarian release, citing his age and multiple debilitating health conditions. At the time, the family’s attorney, Sasha Phillips, criticized the State Department for not going far enough and leaving ""all decision-making to the discretion of the Russian government."" Marc Fogel, right, with his family Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa., highlighted Fogel’s status and compared it to the greater attention that player Brittney Griner and retired marine Paul Whelan have gotten – relatively high-profile detainee cases, compared to Fogel. ""I’m not asking for Marc Fogel to be prioritized above those two individuals,"" Reschenthaler said during a call-in appearance on the morning show. ""I just want him to be in this prisoner swap and elevated to wrongfully detained [status] so we can bring him home."" 'S ‘’ Fogel and Griner remain in Russian custody on drug charges related to possession of marijuana – an offense that President Biden this week moved to decriminalize as he ordered marijuana reclassified and pardoned all minor federal offenders. Reschenthaler, who had served as a magisterial district judge from 2013 to 2015, highlighted the Levinson Act, which established official bodies and processes to formally release hostages, and the criteria that the act outlined for someone to qualify as ""wrongfully detained."" From left to right: Marc Fogel, Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan ""I could prosecute this case any day of the week and win,"" Reschenthaler claimed. ""Fogel only had a little over half an ounce of marijuana, yet he was sentenced to 14 years hard labor – by the way, he had a prescription for that, legal in Pennsylvania, so it wasn’t like he was trafficking drugs."" Reschenthaler said such sentences were generally reserved for drug traffikers and noted that that alone ""should get him the wrongfully detained status and make him eligible in the hostage negotiation."" 70, Reschenthaler also claimed that Russian courts had denied Fogel due process. Hyland backed up this claim, asserting that Fogel had not gotten a proper chance in the Russian legal system, relaying his attorney’s report that Fogel was ""completely crushed by the lack of justice."" Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa., during a House Judiciary Committee meeting, Friday, Dec. 13, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington. ""Marc’s deteriorating health and lack of proper medical care and attention remains our main concern,"" Hyland said, adding the various concerns that a transfer to a prison colony can entail. ""All transfers between Russian detention facilities and penal colonies are incredibly dangerous and difficult,"" Hyland explained. ""The travel is never quick, the journey often takes weeks and includes long, uncomfortable hours on the road."" ""Transfer vehicles and temporary holding facilities are usually poorly supervised, with stronger and more experienced prisoners taking over the law enforcement roles,"" she continued. ""Marc’s Russian attorney created a disturbing ‘guidance’ for Marc, which is designed to caution him against offending his fellow inmates, but in reality underscores the horrors of the transfer."" ""As you would expect, we are all devastated. We are completely cut off from Marc and worried sick about his physical and mental health."" Fox News’ Stephanie Pagones contributed to this report.",18

""Outnumbered"" co-host Emily Compagno slammed President Biden Friday for warning of nuclear ""Armageddon"" at a fundraiser, saying it was an inappropriate time and place to make such a comment. Compagno said the administration has again been forced to ""clean up"" statements by the president. ‘’ : To your point about the freestyling, we rely on our commander-in-chief and the President of the United States to be diplomatic, meaning relying on his cadre of diplomats to do that behind-the-scenes negotiation for him. And also, wouldn't that be more appropriate for the State of the Union address, for something coming out of the Oval Office - somewhere big, If he is really going to invoke Armageddon rather than a Democratic elected official fundraiser at a private home? And once again, the White House and his team has to clean up. They have to walk back. In fact, reporting that a senior defense official expressed surprise, saying we haven't had signs actually of any escalation whatsoever. So not only did he sort of put another one in the lane of his minor incursion gaffe and that this guy cannot remain in power gaffe. But now he actually invoked Armageddon, which is horrifying. And again, the American people are left to be surprised, afraid, and then, oh, wait, he didn't mean it per the White House.",0

During a Thursday evening fundraiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Biden warned attendees that the U.S. was as close to ""Armageddon"" as it was during the 1960s Cuban Missile Crisis. Warning about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s latest threats of using nuclear weapons in the raging Russian-Ukrainian war, Biden said, ""[Putin was] not joking when he talks about the use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons. We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis."" 70, ""[Putin was] not joking when he talks about the use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons,"" President Biden told attendees at a fundraiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on Thursday. Fox News Digital reported last month that Putin claimed, ""I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of countries, and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal."" ""I don’t think there is any such a thing as the ability to easily use a tactical weapon and not end up with Armageddon,"" Biden remarked. Video of Biden’s claims alarmed many blue-check Twitter users, especially the president’s critics, some of whom accused him of contributing greatly to taking the country down this path. The Federalist editor-in-chief Mollie Hemingway, tweeted, ""When the media ran Biden's 2020 campaign, they promised not just the removal of the peacetime prosperity president they loathed but to replace him with what they claimed would be competent adult leadership. What they've done is stumble us to the brink of nuclear ‘Armageddon.’"" Fox News contributor Byron York wondered why Biden hadn’t given his remarks on the issue to a wider audience, or declared them on a bigger platform. ""Joe Biden's Armageddon fundraiser: There is nothing of greater import to the nation than the prospect of nuclear war. So why does the president deliver his most extensive remarks on the subject to a small crowd at a Democratic fundraiser in Manhattan?"" he tweeted. Conservative actor James Woods asked, ""As the tired policies of this bitter political hack become one sad catastrophe after another, will he finally end the world in nuclear war in his last grasp for power?""

""Biden warns of impending nuclear Armageddon. Who had this in their bingo card for 2022?"" conservative commentator Ian Miles Cheong tweeted. ""Joe Biden and the globalist ‘experts’ have led America to the brink of nuclear armageddon. They've been in charge for less than 2 years. Under President Trump, we had 4 years of peace.

This is a much more serious matter than most media outlets seem to recognize."" Former congressional candidate Matthew Foldi tweeted, ""So either Joe Biden is purposely lying about the immediate threat of ‘nuclear armageddon,’ or Americans are currently staring down the possibility of being imminently vaporized by a nuclear weapon due to this administration’s failures. How is this not a national scandal?"" ""Under Trump we had a booming economy, no new wars, and peace & prosperity.

""Oh my goodness. First of all those comments were reckless.

""He built this bridge, I remember the pictures of him driving across it — It was one of their great achievements. I think it was 2018 when that bridge was built, so it's nearly brand new and to watch it in flames, to watch the rest of the supply lines out of Crimea into southern Ukraine at risk is certainly something that is a game changer on the ground in Ukraine.

With his military stumbling, Putin has intensified attacks in Ukraine of late. Ukrainian forces took out a major bridge linking Ukraine and Crimea — which Russia annexed in 2014. Now Russian forces are launching more aggressive attacks on Ukrainian civilians and in Kyiv. Danish Defense shows the gas leaking at Nord Stream 2 seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on Bornholm, Denmark on September 27, 2022. Those incursions aren’t just directed at Ukraine but at other nations as well. There is the apparent sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline shipping natural gas to Western Europe. There’s talk that Russia could next unleash a major cyberattack against the west. ""I think it’s Putin’s way of sending a message to the Europeans that I can affect you. You may have the upper hand on me, But I can also affect you,"" said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, D-N.J. Putin is well aware that a midterm election is approaching in the U.S. It’s the first federal election since last year’s riot at the Capitol. Concerns linger about the integrity of the election and whether some candidates and voters — especially Republicans — will respect the results. ’T This creates a perfect period for geopolitical mischief by Putin, augmented by the fact that his military is getting smoked in Ukraine and morale is waning. Those who study Putin wonder if he could plot a guerilla tactic to creep into the minds of American voters as they head to the polls in November. Such a gambit could work. Even if it’s just a psychological one. Putin told Russians that Moscow would ""make use of all weapon systems available to us."" That included nuclear weapons. ""The citizens of Russian can rest assured that the territorial integrity of our motherland and our independence and freedom will be defended,"" said Putin. ""Those who are using nuclear blackmail against us should know that the wind can turn around."" In this image made from video released by the Russian Presidential Press Service, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the nation in Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2022. This brings us to the Cuban Missile Crisis in October, 60 falls ago. President John F. Kennedy and the United States stood toe-to-toe with General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev and the Soviet Union — just before the 1962 midterm elections. The U.S. failed to covertly overthrow the regime of Cuban leader Fidel Castro during the botched Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. That nudged Havana closer to the U.S.S.R. Khrushchev decided to test the resolve of the young American leader by planning to install nuclear warheads in Cuba, just 90 miles from U.S. shores. Cuba asked for the missiles to deter a potential U.S. incursion following the Bay of Pigs invasion. Khrushchev also wanted to respond to a decision by Washington to put Jupiter ballistic missiles in Turkey and Italy. 'S '' , It’s well-documented that the two superpowers edged close to nuclear blows in 1962. Even so, the Cuban Missile Crisis may have bolstered Kennedy and Democrats in the midterms. The party of the president routinely loses 25-30 seats in the first midterm. Democrats only lost five House seats in that midterm. Democrats fared much better in the Senate. Democrats already had the majority in the Senate, but enhanced their advantage by gaining a net of four seats. The 1962 midterms marked the first time since 1932 that Democrats picked up seats with that class of senators on the ballot. The Kennedy Administration believed the Soviet intentions posed an existential threat to the United States. But not everyone on Capitol Hill was convinced that the U.S. was staring at nuclear holocaust. Some suspected it was a political ploy. , - The U.S. Capitol Building is seen on October 22, 2021 in Washington, . ""I told you that the President would move on Cuba before the election,"" said late Sen. Norris Cotton, R-N.H., facing re-election in 1962 after Kennedy imposed a blockade around the island nation. Late Rep. Thomas Curtis, R-Mo., characterized the Cuban Missile Crisis as ""phony and contrived for election purposes."" Late Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., believed the foreign policy crisis was a scheme to stir up support for the November ballot. - , With just a month before the midterms, Congressional Republicans are already converting Biden’s remarks about Cuba into an election issue. ""We’re projecting weakness around the world,"" said Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., on Fox. ""He’s just spitting out talking points and then the staff cleans it up."" Tenney also declared that if the Russian threat was so grave, then Biden shouldn’t have made the case at a fundraiser. ""He’s not in the Situation Room,"" said Tenney. President Biden visits to announce $20B investment in Hudson Valley Oct 06, 2022, 7:17amUpdated 55m ago By: News 12 Staff 0:09 / 2:35 President Joe Biden visited the Hudson Valley on Thursday. ""There’s two bad options here,"" observed Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wisc., on Fox. ""One, he misspoke. And if he’s misspeaking like this recklessly about nuclear war, that is a huge problem. Two, that is actually what the assessment is — what the heck is he doing at a fundraiser this week in Delaware? If that’s the case, you should be in the Situation Room having conversations with our military leaders, working to de-escalate the situation."" There is one argument that Biden’s mention of the nuclear issue could very well be an effort to get the information into the public domain as a way to give Putin an off-ramp. Foreign policy experts have said for weeks now that the last thing they want is Putin to be backed into a corner and then actually turn to nuclear weapons. As disgusted as the west is with Putin at this stage, they want him to have options. ' ' ""I wouldn’t necessarily have chosen the words the way he did at that particular event,"" said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., when queried about the president’s ""armageddon"" comment by colleague Bret Baier. ""We understand how serious this is. All of our colleagues don’t necessarily hear all of the same things that we here. But we’re trying to educate them so they’ll be with us on board."" The Cuban Missile Crisis is viewed as one of the most defining moments in American history. The two superpowers later established a ""hotline"" between Moscow and Washington to allow direct communication between the leaders to potentially forestall a catastrophic military or political miscalculation. Foreign policy is not exactly top of mind for most voters ahead of this fall’s midterms. Most voters are tracking inflation, crime, abortion, the border and the future of democracy. But if things devolve inside the Kremlin, one can only begin to imagine how the future — and not just the future of democracy — could be top of mind. Much the same way the missiles of October did so 60 autumns ago.",13

Biden noted he doesn't believe Putin is irrational but that his remarks as Moscow was preparing for its invasion of Ukraine were miscalculated. 70, A side by side photo of President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden said he believes Putin miscalculated Russia's ability to conquer Ukraine. ""If you listen to the speech he made after, when that decision was being made, he talked about the whole idea that he needed to be the leader of Russia, I just think it's irrational,"" he said. ""I think his objective was not rational."" ""I think he thought he was going to be welcome with open arms,"" he added. ""That this was the home of mother Russia and Kyiv… I think he totally miscalculated."" The Russian military has faced multiple setbacks since its Feb. 24 invasion amid intense fighting and an unanticipated resistance against western-backed Ukrainian forces. Biden's remarks came after Ukraine took back Russian-held areas in the country's east. The failure of Russia to take the country has sparked uncommon criticism of Putin from within Moscow, prompting him to mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops and the firing of multiple generals. The announced mobilization resulted in many Russian military-age men to flee the country. Aside from failures on the battlefield, the Biden administration has said Russian forces are woefully unprepared, poorly trained and have unsuitable equipment to take on a motivated Ukrainian fighting force. Putin recently accused Ukraine of committing terrorism after a truck exploded in the middle of the bridge connecting Crimea and Russia Saturday, killing three people.

2022-10-12,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-russia-north-korea-alliance-multiplies-security-risks-america,The Russia-North Korea alliance multiplies security risks for America,"Former U.S. defense intel officer Rebekah Koffler joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the latest on the Russia-Ukraine war as rockets hit Kyiv for the first time since June. There is a Russian saying ""This is not a coincidence, Comrade,"" that could describe the current environment in which North Korea and Russia, America’s most aggressive adversaries, are ratcheting up hostilities amid President Biden’s warning of a nuclear Armageddon last week. On Sunday, Kim Jong Un completed a two-week-long tactical nuclear training operation in which Pyongyang, North Korea simulated nuclear strikes on potential U.S. and South Korean military command targets amid joint U.S.-South Korean naval exercises, apparently to ""wipe out"" enemies. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has unleashed a massive bombardment on Ukraine, in a likely retaliation for the bombing of the Crimean bridge, which Russia views as part of its territory and a critical supply route for Moscow. This escalation follows his disturbing warning last week that Russia will use all means in its arsenal against adversaries, emphasizing that he was not bluffing. This was followed by an aggressive speech in which he blamed the U.S. for setting a nuclear warfare ""precedent."" - ' ,' On Saturday, North Korea fired two short range ballistic missiles, in the seventh round of weapons tests in the last two weeks. This prompted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to instruct his officials to speed up the collection and analysis of intelligence on these tests and prepare for any contingencies. The Joint Chiefs said South Korea’s military also beefed its surveillance posture to ensure readiness in close coordination with the U.S., this as the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan battle group that had participated in the joint naval drills with South Korean forces returned to the area angering Pyongyang. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un's relationship has become closer. The Ukraine war has boosted the Russia-North Korea alliance, which has been growing for the past several years. One of the few countries that has recognized Ukraine’s breakaway territories as Russian, North Korea is selling Russia ""millions"" of artillery shells and rockets, according to the White House, as Moscow is depleting its weapons inventory in the eighth month of the devastating war. In August, Putin and Kim exchanged laudatory letters to each other in which they vowed to expand comprehensive bilateral relations with common efforts. Putin expressed interest in helping Kim stabilize the Korean peninsula and the Northeastern Asian region. Kim noted that the relations between the two nations have transformed into a ""strategic and tactical cooperation,"" helping counter ""hostile military forces,"" a veiled reference to the United States and . Both Russia and North Korea view the U.S. as their mortal adversary, with both regimes having concluded that nuclear weapons are a usable battlefield capability and the only way to deter the U.S. and from intervening in what they perceive as their respective regions and internal affairs, Putin in Ukraine and Kim in the Asia Pacific he views the whole Asia Pacific region as his internal affairs. A huge North Korean flag is displayed during a celebration of the nation’s 73rd anniversary at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea, early Thursday, Sept. 9, 2021. Putin and Kim’s combative style and high-risk tolerance for using potentially catastrophic means to challenge Washington's dominance and power projection in the world are making the current situation ever volatile. Both regimes, being under severe sanctions, have concluded that their relationship with the West is irreparable, given the diametrically opposing worldviews governance styles – authoritarianism vs pluralistic society – between the U.S. and on the one hand and Russia and North Korea on the other. Additionally, Kim has accelerated the pace of missile testing to historically unprecedented levels and increased atomic bomb manufacturing, having reached in March the capability to strike the U.S. homeland with a full-range intercontinental ballistic missile. The newly forged Putin-Kim alliance is a deeply concerning development for Washington's security. Russia has the world’s biggest nuclear arsenal and is the only country that has the capability to destroy the homeland in a strategic nuclear strike. North Korea’s march to acquire a capability to launch a nuclear strike on the United States is something the deputy assistant director of the ’s Korea Mission Center called ""very rational"" rather than crazy. The official explained that this is how Kim seeks to deter war with the U.S. rather than fight it. In April, the deputy head of the North Korean committee on space technology told Russia’s news agency that Pyongyang was interested in developing cooperation with Russia on the ""peaceful use of outer space."" Adversaries like Iran, North Korea and others routinely use the phrase ""peaceful use"" as cover for acquiring dual-use technologies – space, cyber, nuclear – to in order to develop indigenous military grade capabilities. Russian President Vladimir Putin vows to strengthen Russia's military cooperation with its allies at the Army 2022 International Military and Technical Forum in the Patriot Park outside Moscow on Aug. 15, 2022. On September 8, North Korea passed a law on nuclear forces policy which codified its mission as that of ""defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity and fundamental interests of the state, preventing a war on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia and ensuring the strategic stability of the world."" Whether Putin and Kim synchronized their provocative actions and hostile rhetoric last week is irrelevant. However, having two potential flashpoints caused by two of our most combative adversaries in two separate regions may overload the Biden administration’s crisis management ability as it is already facing a whole host of problems, on the domestic and international fronts. With multiple combat drills involving numerous armed forces and high-tempo missile tests, it also multiplies the risk of miscalculation, sparking unintentional kinetic confrontation. Air Force Gen. Glen VanHerck, who heads up the U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Command, which is in charge of protecting the homeland and Canada from missile strikes, aptly summarized the threats presented by Russia and North Korea. In March, he told the Senate Armed Services Committee that in the coming few years [the North Koreans] could exceed my capacity and capabilities."" A year earlier, Gen. VanHerck stated that Russia...remains the most acute challenge to our homeland defense mission"" and warned that it is ""rehears[ing] strikes on our homeland.""",5

The opening sequence of the Freddie Mercury biopic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" features the star being chauffeured the Live Aid concert in a silver Rolls-Royce. It is an accurate depiction of the singer's life, as he owned a 1974 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow from 1979 until his death in 1991. The Queen song ""I'm in Love With My Car"" was written and sung by drummer Roger Taylor, but Mercury also appreciated fine cars. Mercury never had a proper driver's license, according to his former assistant Peter Freestone, but did own several vehicles, including a Daimler and Lincoln Town Car, and the Rolls-Royce was his main form of transportation around London. - A Freddie Mercury purchased the Rolls-Royce in 1974. His sister Kashmira kept it from his death until 2013, when it was sold at auction for 74,600 British pounds, which is equivalent to approximately $105,000 today and was six times the pre-auction estimate. It was purchased by Ukranian celebrity Andriy Danylko, Out Magazine reported. Danylko has not publicly discussed the auction, but had refused to leave Kyiv and often speaks in support of the country's defiance against the Russian invasion. The Silver Shadow is powered by a V8 engine. The car is now being put up for auction to raise money for victims of the Ukraine war, with the proceeds being donated to the Superhuman Center, which is a medical program in Lviv supported by a Richard Branson, Sting and others, that is focused on providing prosthetic, reconstructive and post-traumatic stress disorder treatment to victims of the war in Ukraine. Freddie Mercury did not drive the car himself, but was chauffeured around London in it. The car is painted a color called Silver Chalice and has a blue interior. The V8-powered sedan's odometer shows 62,373 miles, but it has been in storage for an extended period and likely needs service before it can be safely used on the road again. - - It is equipped with a car phone from the era and an unassuming Sharp cassette deck that is a far cry from the types of stereos seen in musician's luxury cars today. The car is equipped with a Sharp cassette player. The vehicle is being offered at Sotheby's London auction on November 5, which also features a collection of 15 million-dollar supercars being sold by one owner that's billed as the Gran Turismo Collection.",6

Officials said the U.S. plans to leverage all elements of U.S. national power to ""outcompete"" strategic competitors, tackle shared challenges and shape the ""rules of the road."" ""The world is at an inflection point and the choices we make today will set the terms on how we are set up to deal with significant challenges and the significant opportunities we face in the years ahead,"" White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday. ""That’s really what this national security strategy is all about."" ‘ ’ ‘’ White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. Sullivan said the United States has entered ""a decisive decade,"" and faces two ""fundamental"" strategic challenges. Sullivan said the first focuses on competition between major powers to ""shape the future of the international order,"" while the second focuses on addressing ""transnational challenges"" that affect people all around the world, from ""climate change to food insecurity to communicable diseases to terrorism, to the energy transition, to inflation."" Heads of state met for a summit in Madrid. The Biden administration’s strategy focuses on investing in the ""underlying sources and tools of American power and influence;"" in building the ""strongest possible coalition of nations to enhance our collective influence to shape the global strategic environment and to solve shared challenges;"" and in modernizing and strengthening the United States military so that it is ""equipped for the era of strategic competition."" A , , Officials said that the most ""pressing"" strategic challenge facing the U.S. are from powers that ""layer authoritarian governance with a revisionist foreign policy.""

The Biden administration warned that the People’s Republic of China is ""the only competition with both the intent and, increasingly, the capability to reshape the international order."" ""We recognize that in the geopolitical space, the represents America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge, and while that will play out in the IndoPacific to a significant extent, there are global dimensions to the challenge as well,"" Sullivan warned Wednesday, adding that the new strategy ""makes clear that we avoid seeing the world sloped solely through the prism of strategic competition—and we will not try to divide the world into rigid blocks."" Sullivan added: ""We’re not seeking to have competition tip over into confrontation or a new Cold War, and we are not engaging each country as simply a proxy battleground."" 2024 : As for Russia, Sullivan said that the Kremlin’s recent nuclear threats and ""saber-rattling"" amid its unprovoked months-long war on Ukraine ""reminds us just what a significant and seriously dangerous adversary Russia is—not just to the United States, but to a world that is seeking peace and stability."" Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, attended the Victory Day military parade marking the 77th anniversary of the end of World War in Moscow Monday, May 9, 2022. Sullivan said Russia has ""flagrantly disrupted"" that by invading Ukraine— a war that Sullivan said ""presents in living color the key elements of our approach, the emphasis on allies, the importance of strengthening the hand, the democratic world, and standing up for our fellow democracies and for democratic values."" The strategy stresses that Russia poses an ""immediate and ongoing thereat"" to the regional security order in Europe, and warns that it is a source of ""disruption and instability globally,"" but ""lacks across the spectrum capabilities of the ."" Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Kremlin in Moscow. The strategy also recognizes that ""smaller autocratic powers"" are also acting in ""aggressive and destabilizing ways,"" pointing to Iran. The strategy acknowledges Iran’s interference in internal affairs of its neighbors, its proliferation of missiles and drones through its proxies, its plots to harm Americans, including former officials, and its advancement of its nuclear program, which officials say is ""beyond any credible civilian need."" 'S A '' , A ' ' The strategy also points to North Korea, saying it continues to ""expand its illicit nuclear weapons and missile programs."" This photo provided by the North Korean government, shows what it says is a test launch of a hypersonic missile in North Korea Wednesday, Jan. 5, 2022. Sullivan said a key tenet to the U.S. national security strategy is to build ""the strongest possible coalition of nations to enhance our collective influence, both to shape the global strategic environment and to address these transnational threats that require cooperation to succeed."" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""We have put alliances at the core of this strategy,"" Sullivan said, noting the U.S. alliances in Europe, with and in the IndoPacific with treaty allies. Sullivan also pointed to the G7, saying it has been ""revitalized as an organization that had lost some of its clarity of purpose in recent years and has now been restored as a sort of steering committee for the free world on critical issues."" Sullivan stressed that the Biden admin is prepared to work with any nation that will stand behind ""principles and the terms of the Charter, including principles relative to sovereignty and territorial integrity, to freedom of navigation and overflight."" ""And we will work with non-democracies in service of defending these principles,"" Sullivan said. A , Sullivan added that the U.S. needs to ""set the rules fo the road for the 21st century in critical areas from emerging technologies and cyberspace to trade, economics, investment and more."" President Biden, center, attends a working lunch with other G7 leaders to discuss shaping the global economy. ""Both so that the international order continues to reflect our values and our interests and so that the international order is better designed to be able to take on the challenges ahead,"" Sullivan said. ""We’re going to engage countries on their own terms and pursue an affirmative agenda to advance common interests and to promote stability and prosperity,"" he said, noting that there needs to be a ""dual-track approach"" to address competition. ""On one track, we will cooperate with any country, including our geopolitical rivals, that is willing to work constructively on shared challenges,"" he explained. ""And then, on the other track, we’re going to deepen and sharpen our cooperation with like-minded democracies."" He added: ""We believe we can accomplish both of these as we move forward.""",22

Gabbard has long been critical of the Democratic Party leadership. In a video posted to Instagram Tuesday, she accused them of ""stoking anti-white racism"" and undermining the nation's law enforcement. Gabbard also described the Democratic establishment as ""warmongers"" and has been critical of the leadership of both political parties for supporting interventional foreign polices abroad. Gabbard noted that 57 House Republicans voted against sending another $40 billion in military aid to Ukraine while not one Democrat did.

SpaceX and Tesla Elon Musk denied a report he engaged in correspondence or contact with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in regard to the Ukraine invasion, but the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee warned the world's richest man not to get ""over his skis"" in foreign affairs. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, who himself is the second-richest member of Congress, told Fox News that Musk previously interjected in the China-Taiwan situation. ""I worry in terms [of] whether Mr. Musk gets a little over his skis and thinks he can negotiate a peace treaty with Russia and Ukraine,"" Warner said. ""He's even been weighing in on Taiwan and China, which very much worries me as well."" Musk recently told the Financial Times that China should rule Taiwan similarly to the ""special administrative zone"" of Hong Kong.

2022-10-13,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-aoc-not-what-says-shes-stooge,TUCKER CARLSON: AOC is not at all what she says she is — she's a stooge,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over not speaking out on the Russia-Ukraine war on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Like all sorority girl narcissists, there is nothing the congresswoman from New York's 14th congressional district enjoys more than giving herself new nicknames. In high school, in leafy Westchester County, she was known as ""Sandy Cortez."" We still call her that because of all her various pseudonyms, that one fits the best. And then when she became a member of Congress, she adopted the Augustan faintly exotic title, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which sounds like the name of one of Che's girlfriends in Revolutionary Bolivia. Just picture her in the back of the motorcycle in a beret, and then once she ascended, still higher and became a Kardashian, this very same person began going by simply "","" Queen of TikTok. But along the way, most people do not know this, she had still another name. During the 2018 Democratic primary, in which she beat party stalwart Joe Crowley by attacking him for being White, Sandy Cortez went by the name ""Alex."" Just Alex, your friendly neighborhood, gender-non-specific bartender, Alex. On Alex's campaign website at the time, there was a section explaining what Alex believed. One of Alex's views read this way, ""Alex believes we must end the forever war by bringing our troops home and ending the airstrikes and bombings that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism and occupation throughout the world. "" Now few people notice this because for a self-described progressive, that didn't seem like a very surprising position. And on the day that Sandy Cortez, Alex, beat Joe Crowley in the primary, that statement was still on her website, but then it disappeared. No one noticed except a journalist called Sameera Khan. ""Hey, what happened to the anti-war part?"" Now Alex, who by this point had morphed into Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, blamed the deletion of this position on her supporters, who she claimed were running the website and had done it accidentally. Who knows what happened to it? But Sameera Khan sensed there might be more to the story. ""How long,"" she asked at the time, ""will we be moaning on and on about single-payer while there's bipartisan support for nuclear Armageddon?"" ' ' - Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks during a news conference to discuss legislation that would strengthen Social Security benefits on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 26, 2021. Well, that turned out to be a pretty good question, Sameera Khan. In fact, it's no longer a rhetorical question. There is indeed now bipartisan support for nuclear Armageddon. We're not making that up. Joe Biden said it out loud at a fundraiser the day. By the way, nuclear Armageddon on the way. Great. And then Republicans in Congress said nothing, which is to say they backed him up and Sandy Cortez, she stayed totally silent and that really is the point. Now, if you're watching this show, it's likely you don't really care what's going on in the so-called progressive movement. It's not one of your interests and why would you care? They're mostly trustafarian clowns. They're joke, kids with weird hair, pointless liberal arts degrees, stupid fantasy-based politics. That's who they are, but it's also true that over time, people like this can be useful. Sometimes you want principled people taking principled positions. It keeps the system in balance. You need that. Not everyone can be a mercenary. Otherwise, you wind up with what we have now, which is true insanity an iron clad consensus in Washington that we somehow have a moral obligation to destroy ourselves and our children's future in an utterly pointless war against Russia. What? Everyone seems to think that, and we mean everyone on both sides from liberals like Nancy Pelosi to conservatives like Joni Ernst and everyone in between them and that's a huge problem because it's insane. Someone needs to say it's insane out loud and break the spell, the hypnotism. 'S ' ' ; , That would be the job of a so-called radical like Sandy Cortez. That's why she exists. Now, you may despise her. Obviously, we do. We say so often, but at certain key moments, people like that have a role. They stand up and they tell the essential truth. No, we should not go to war with Russia. What are you kidding? This is lunacy. Pull back. And if Sandy Cortez did that, it might actually help. It might actually save the country, but that's not what Sandy Cortez is doing right now, because it turns out she is not at all what she claims to be. Sandy Cortez may hate White people, seems like she does, but that doesn't mean she's progressive, much less liberal in any meaningful sense. No, she's the opposite. Turns out she's just another stooge like Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, a willing tool of soulless corporate power who always side with Google, organ and Raytheon against the working people she claims to represent. On no subject is this more glaringly obvious than the Ukraine war. That war provides absolutely no benefit of any kind to her constituents or, by the way, to any other normal American. For the people of Queens and the Bronx, that war is all downside, no upside whatsoever. So last night, at a sparsely attended town hall in the Bronx, two of Sandy Cortez's constituents said that out loud. Watch this. ' A ' : Congresswoman, none of this matters unless there’s a nuclear war which you voted to send arms and weapons to Ukraine. Tulsi Gabbard left the Democratic Party because they’re war hawks. You ran as an outsider yet you’ve been voting to start this was in Ukraine. You’re voting to start a third nuclear war with Russia and China. Why are you playing with the lives of American citizens? You’re playing with our lives. : There will be no neighbors if there’s a nuclear bomb. You voted to mobilize and send money to Ukrainian Nazis. You’re a coward. You’re a progressive socialist? Where are you against the war mobilization? He’s telling the right truth. You have done nothing. Tulsi Gabbard has shown guts when you’ve shown cowardice. I believed in you and you became the very thing you sought to fight against. That’s what you’ve become. You are the establishment and you are the reason why everybody will end up in a nuclear war unless you choose to stand up and denounce the Democratic party. We could end up in a nuclear war at any minute and you continue to fund it. That’s what’s going on. : I’ll answer your question. I’ll get to the issue last. I will get to the issue. : Why not right now? : Because you are being rude to everybody around you. : You’re the liar here - ‘ ’ Those are actual progressives. Now, there's no doubt that on virtually any other issue, we wouldn't agree with them. I don't know what their beliefs are, probably don't intersect with ours. But on this specific issue, which does matter, they're absolutely right. Sandy Cortez is not a radical. She's not a progressive. She's a neocon, just like everybody else. She is a tool of the people with power. Obviously they can see that clearly because it's true. Her response? You are being rude. You're being rude now, says the very same Sandy Cortez, who instructed activists to terrorize their political opponents. ""The whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable."" Oh, is that right? So, they were kind of following your instructions, weren't they? The protesters you just saw used Sandy Cortez's preferred tactics against her. They immediately seize the moral high ground, and they started yelling. And they got no response from Sandy Cortez. Why is that? Because she has nothing to say. They're on to her. They know who she really is, and she knows that. They were right. Shortly after she took office, Sandy Cortez funded the largest expansion of our nation's military ever. In 2019, she approved an unprecedented $738 billion military budget. Now, publicly, Sandy Cortez never justified this vote. Instead, she kept demonizing the military she was funding, right? Of course -: I don't believe our whole nation's priority is to slaughter people in other parts of the world. I think it is a priority of a powerful and concentrated class in the United States that happens to have a grip of control over our government. ' ' Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks during a rally for immigration provisions to be included in the Build Back Better Act outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 7, 2021. That was the TikTok-approved version that was for all the college kids on social media. But in real life, she didn't mean a word of it. The only part she meant was America is terrible. She does believe that she does hate the country. But pulling back from a war that will hurt the country, why would she do that? She doesn't like the country. Anything that's not in our interest, she's completely for and that's why this year, Sandy Cortez, along with every member of The Squad, the progressives, voted to approve another massive $40 billion military spending bill. Cori Bush even voted for it even after she admitted it would directly contribute to, ""the increased risks of direct war and the potential for direct military confrontation between Russia and the ."" So, to even Cori Bush, probably the lowest member of the United States Congress, it was pretty obvious where this was going. It was going to war with Russia, but she voted for it anyway. They all did. Meanwhile, the leaders of the Democratic Party tried to sell this, which is, again, a step toward war, which does not help us in any way, only hurts us as a humanitarian effort. Watch. : Today, we are voting to provide nearly $40 billion to address the immediate and near-term security, economic and humanitarian needs of the Ukrainian people. : We are morally obligated to ensure the brave Ukrainian fighters and the Ukrainian people have the security and economic aid that they need. : What we're doing here is very important supplying weaponry and security assistance, government and economic assistance, humanitarian assistance. : The supplemental appropriation bill is a down payment on the security and success of democracy. ' ' : Glory to Ukraine. We want the victory for Ukraine and we want defeat for Vladimir Putin. Regime change would be great, but we realize that that will not happen, but defeat must happen. Oh. So, it's humanitarian assistance. Really? Did you look at the bill? No, it was a military funding bill. The real point of it was buying arms, more than half of it. $24 billion went to military equipment, weapons. $19 billion went directly to the war effort in Ukraine. If you're an out-of-the-closet neocon, this makes sense, but if you're Sandy Cortez, who's all over TikTok talking about the working people fighting the man, what does this tell you about her? She doesn't care about the people she claims to represent. She has contempt for them. She talks about their misery, only to leverage it for her own benefit. She hoards power in their name. They are merely the tools of her personal advancement. They're not her real constituency. How could they be? They don't benefit from this. Her real constituency is News, the editors at Teen Vogue and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the celebrity-endorsed dictator of the most corrupt nation in Europe. Zelenskyy is now shaking down our cowardly Congress for more cash at the very moment our own economy and our own borders are collapsing. Watch. : At this time, we have two key financial needs of the country. That's $38 billion to make up for the deficit of our budget for next year and other $17 billion that were verified by the World Bank and needed to rebuild the critical infrastructure. We need also targeted credits in the amount of $2 billion to rebuild the electric energy infrastructure after the destruction and to expand our export to Europe. We need credit limits to purchase gas and coal for the future heating season. The scope of this year's support should be not less than $5 billion. What? Some uppity foreigner in a T-shirt demanding money for his critical economic needs. We have critical economic needs too, buddy. Who are you, troll? Go away. What? Since when does that guy have a claim on our Treasury? So, this is the job of people like Sandy Cortez to remind us again to break the spell of hypnosis the U.S. Congress is under. We don't owe this guy anything. Not one thing. Good luck, pal. That's it. And as our economy degrades and our border is gone, that guy's lecturing us with some Christmas list, like, I want this, that, and I want a bicycle. You better send it quick. Really? Up yours, buddy. And at the same time, dragging us the entire West toward nuclear war, telling us we have to nuke Russia and what does Sandy Cortez do? She affirms it. She's not a progressive. She's a stealthy, neocon operative. The entire leadership of the so-called progressive movement is that. They're totally and utterly corrupt. Is anyone on the left pointing this out? Has Cenk Uygur said a word about it? The so-called radicals at Chapo Trap House? The Atlantic Magazine, , ? Are these left-wing media organizations always telling you how deeply they care about oppressed peoples, all them calling for radical race war every day. But when actual civilization ending war looms on the horizon, they're cheering for it right alongside the Pentagon. , : ' ?' : We're going to stay with our efforts to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. -: We will not waver from our commitment to support Ukraine as long as it takes. : We will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office on June 18, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends meeting with military officials as he visits the war-hit Mykolaiv region. , : You're already north of $15 billion in terms of those commitments. How far do you go? : As long as it takes. As long as it takes to do what? Has anyone even asked that question? Has Sandy Cortez asked that question and your progressive pals ask that question? As long as it takes to do what? How long is that? What's the goal and at what cost? What's the risk? Should we weigh those? No, as long as it takes. Why?",0

2022-10-13,https://www.foxnews.com/world/could-high-energy-prices-erode-european-support-ukraine-war-effort,Could high energy prices erode European support for Ukraine war effort?,"Fox Nation host Piers Morgan reacts to rockets hitting Kyiv and the need for more nations to stand up against Putin Russia’s war in Ukraine is having a profound impact across Europe as energy prices soar and an anticipated cold winter draws near. That pain is reportedly being felt hard in the Czech Republic, an eastern European country that is particularly sensitive to Russian aggression and has been very supportive of Ukrainian resistance. Yet some observers fear the realities of confronting Russia and forcefully backing Kyiv are setting in among the population. ""It will be a difficult winter ahead for centrist European governments, and it’s important that Europe is able to maintain solidarity to combat the energy and cost-of-living crisis amid Russia’s weaponization of energy,"" Paddy Ryan, assistant director of European energy security at the Atlantic Council, told Fox News Digital. Late last month, thousands took to the streets in Prague’s Wenceslas Square to voice opposition to the Czech Republic’s handling of the energy crisis stoked by the war in Ukraine. Angry protesters called for the resignation of Prime Minister Petr Fiala and his western-oriented coalition government. The protests included an overlap of the far right and far left, a strong indicator of the angst mounting as winter approaches. , Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is central to the recent turmoil roiling Czech politics. Many of the protesters are demanding the resignation of the prime minister and blame the government for joining the rest of the European Union and in implementing harsh economic sanctions on Russia. Protesters claim attempts by the government to alleviate the pain are inadequate. A building destroyed in Russian shelling in Kramatorsk, Ukraine. This is not the first time the government has faced stiff opposition over the growing energy crisis. In early September, Fiala's ruling coalition narrowly survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence, showing that people’s disaffection with the high price of electricity and natural gas will remain a potent political issue. 'S ' A ' While protesters may blame their government for the high price of energy and overall inflation, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s coercive decision to cut gas supplies to Europe is a major factor in the skyrocketing prices. ""The Kremlin is coupling this overt energy warfare against the E.U. with its disinformation tactics attempting to amplify these concerns among European electorates, where Moscow's objective is to sow division and dissent across Europe in an effort to get Western capitals to drop their support for Ukraine, especially as the Russian military continues to suffer defeats on the battlefield,"" Benjamin L. Schmitt, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Fox News Digital. 'S 'S Russia’s wartime decision to cut gas to Europe caused one of the worst energy crises in recent memory. The Czech Republic, as well as many other nations in Eastern Europe, rely almost exclusively on Russia for its natural gas. The E.U. got 39.2% of its natural gas from Russia in 2021. The Czech Republic consumes around 9.1 billion cubic meters of natural gas each year, most of which comes from Russia. A complete shutdown of gas by Russia could reduce by 6% in the most vulnerable E.U. countries, according to an estimate from the International Monetary Fund.

Michael McCaul says that freezing weapons sales to Saudi Arabia pushes the Middle Eastern nation closer to Russia and China. The Biden administration's policy on the Middle East has fractured some of the United States' most dependable partnerships in the region, causing typically friendly countries to build stronger relationships with China and Russia. ""That countries that historically have been close partners of the United States are turning to Russia and China is a massive failure of American leadership,"" Victoria Coates, a senior research fellow for international affairs and national security at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. Coates' comments come amid a chaotic time for U.S. relations in the Middle East, including a disastrous retreat of American forces from Afghanistan, an on-again, off-again, nuclear negotiation with Iran, and a disconnect with Saudi Arabia over global energy policy. That disconnect between President Biden and Middle Eastern partners became more evident in March, when leaders from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates declined to field a phone call from the president. Biden had hoped to discuss having the oil-rich countries increase exports amid soaring gas prices in the U.S. and a ban on imports of Russian gas, but was given the silent treatment for his efforts. + Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, right, greets President Joe Biden with a fist bump after his arrival at Al-Salam palace in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. ) The rift came to a head last week, when the Saudi-led + oil alliance opted to cut oil production, a decision the bloc said was made in the best interests of its members economies. In response, the Biden administration condemned the decision and vowed to review the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, hinting that there would be ""consequences"" for the oil-rich kingdom. The Saudis issued a statement of their own in response on Thursday, saying that Biden had attempted to nudge them toward delaying the decision, which will likely boost oil prices in the U.S., until after next month's midterm elections, a move they argued ""would have had negative economic consequences"" for the member nations. ""These outcomes are based purely on economic considerations that take into account maintaining balance of supply and demand in the oil markets, as well as aim to limit volatility that does not serve the interests of consumers and producers,"" a Saudi Foreign Ministry official said in the statement. ""In the case of Saudi Arabia, the fundamental disconnect is that they see oil as a commodity that is a key pillar of their economy, while the Biden administration sees oil as a domestic political issue,"" said Coates who is also an advisory board member of the Vandenberg Coalition. . + Russia and China have emerged in recent years as the chief geopolitical foes of the United States, a realization that has caused American leaders to pivot the country's foreign policy strategy toward addressing the emerging threats. But doing so has led traditional partners in the Middle East to look for other ways to further their own interests, which has often led them to pursue tighter ties with Moscow and Beijing. China has continued to push its influence in the Middle East, becoming the largest buyer of oil from the Gulf region, investing in the region's infrastructure, and partnering with Saudi Arabia on ballistic missile development. The Gulf states have also rebuffed a U.S.-led effort to isolate Russia on the international stage over its invasion of Ukraine, taking a more neutral stance on the conflict while standing by their agreement with Russia not to push a large increase in oil production. ""None of them want to partner with Russia and China—but they are exploring the option because they feel Washington is offering them nothing,"" Coates said. Gulf states may also have an easier time in negotiations with Russia and China, who view such partnerships as transactions more than a declaration of values. , 'S ‘’ ‘’ President Joe Biden. ""These states may be even more appealing as partners, because they are not asking the Middle East to transform. They merely seek transactional relationships."" Foundation for Defense of Democracies Senior Vice President Jonathan Schanzer told Fox News Digital. The fracturing of relationships with Middle Eastern partners started under the administration of former President Barack Obama, Schanzer argued, pointing out that American policy in the region started to become inconsistent under his leadership. ""The United States has been operating with a trust deficit in the Middle East since the Arab Spring of 2011,"" Schanzer said. ""The Obama administration went from that policy of supporting chaotic revolution to a policy in 2013 of appeasing Iran, the most destabilizing force in the region."" Making matters worse, American policy in the region became more inconsistent as power in Washington changed from party to party. ""America’s foreign policy has been one of whiplash, with Democrats and Republicans racing to undo the policies of their predecessors,"" Schanzer said. ""It should not be surprising that Middle Eastern states now seek stability, even if that means doing business with China and Russia."" A Critics have argued that America's disengagement from the Middle East and its partners in the region has accelerated under Biden, with Coates pointing to a U.S. decision last year to pull some advanced anti-missile systems from Saudi Arabia at the same time the country was combating attacks launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen. ""The Saudis are also deeply suspicious of the President’s commitment to their security after the removal of the Patriot batteries last year and the current threats to cut off arms sales,"" Coates said. Critics have long questioned the president's approach to Saudi Arabia, with Biden promising during the debates to make the traditional American partner a ""pariah"" on the international stage over their alleged involvement in the killing of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, only to take a softer stance once entering office. Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But during a trip to the kingdom that the administration said was aimed at improving cooperation between the two nations, Biden boasted that he made had clear to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that he believed the Saudi leader was to blame for Khashoggi's death. The Saudi's have denied being involved in the death of the U.S.-based journalist. Meanwhile, the administration has also made rekindling the Obama-era Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , better known as the Iran Nuclear Deal, a cornerstone of its policy on Iran, a move that is deeply unpopular with Middle Eastern partners. : ‘ F----- A ’ ""They were not happy with the deal to begin with … the scope was too narrow,"" Dr. Theodore Karasik, the Fellow on Russian and Middle Eastern Affairs at the Jamestown Foundation, told Fox News Digital. Negotiations over the rekindling of the deal have also stalled, leaving Middle Eastern partners unsure of what U.S. policy toward Iran will look like in the future. ""It is important to recognize that much of the talk about the in the last few months was really talking about a dead process,"" Karasik said. ""The Gulf states want this process to end, so they are happier about this situation. But at the same time, they have a big neighbor who is going through a catharsis right now, and they're wondering, 'Should we wait and see what happens?’"" Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant Secretary of State for the Obama administration, argues that former President Donald Trump's policy of appeasement toward the Saudi's put Biden in a difficult position. ""The Saudis basically yanked our chain for four years of Donald Trump's administration,"" Rubin told Fox News Digital. ""I think that President Biden has been dealt a hand where the Saudis were accustomed to getting everything they wanted."" 'S , ''T ' Rubin argued that Biden has made it a priority to ""stand up for American interests"" during negotiations with the Saudis, but that he also made the important step of making a trip to the kingdom in an attempt to find a beneficial path forward. Instead, Rubin said that the Saudis decided to side with Russia, a decision he argues will come with consequences. ""At the end of the day, the most important interest between the United States and Saudi Arabia is the free flow of oil and energy markets,"" Rubin said. ""New tools need to be applied to convince them and change their calculus."" President Joe Biden and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrive for the family photo during the Jeddah Security and Development Summit. ) Rubin noted that one consequence could be that Congress will no longer approve weapons and military technology sales to Saudi Arabia, leaving them with few places to turn after decades of American military assistance. ""Those are the kinds of things that need to be done to put some pressure on Saudi Arabia to understand that there are consequences for decisions,"" Rubin said. ""If Saudi Arabia wants to start purchasing Russian military hardware, have at it. How's it going for them right now?"" Rubin also questioned the timing of Saudi Arabia's decision to lead the charge against an increase in oil supply, arguing they may think they are better off with a change of power in Washington. + , ' ' ""There's a suspicion that this move is intended to spike oil prices before an election to influence the outcome, so that doesn't sit well either,"" Rubin said. But Karasik believes the relationships with Middle Eastern partners are still salvageable, pointing out that while the political situation has often been complicated, the countries are still cooperating militarily. ""That military track is still functioning,"" Karasik said. There's still exercises ongoing … so until there's some sort of action by Washington, that military track is still operating."" Coates also expressed optimism that the partnerships can be repaired, but argued the changed needed may not happen with Democrats running Washington. ""Because they would prefer to partner with the U.S., the situation is reversible,"" Coates said. ""But given the Biden administration’s behavior, it may fall to Congress after the midterms to maintain these relationships.""

Recent elections in Sweden and Italy have returned rightist, populist, nationalist, and conservative majorities. There are other similar governments in Europe. Can working with them be in America’s national interest? For some the answer is no. Led by The New York Times, much of the mass media howled, you guessed it, ""fascism!"" and even ""Nazism!"". There is some truth to it. In Sweden socialism has always been nationalistic, intended for the Swedes only until recent waves of migrations from abroad. ' ' ' ' 'S '' A broad consensus persisted on many issues among between all Swedish socialist orientations. For example, implemented in the 1920s, the official policy of eugenics targeting ""social misfits"" and minorities, continued into the 1970s under Social Democrats, who have dominated politics after 1945. The leader of the Sweden Democrats Jimmie Åkesson delivers a speech at the party's election watch at Elite Hotel Marina Tower Tower in Nacka, near Stockholm, Sweden, early Monday, Sept. 12, 2022. A few neo-Nazis were the first loudly to object to unbridled emigration and helped found Sweden Democrats. Eventually, the party got rid of them. It is now mainstream as the largest part of the center-right coalition which won the elections. Likewise, in Italy some in the three-party winning coalition can trace their origins to the post-war, post-fascist Italian Social Movement. At the same time, surveys show that, rather than the party program, the voters overwhelmingly chose the coalition’s charismatic leader, Giorgia Meloni. These shifts could be in America’s interest, but it depends: some European rightist players are as anti-American just as left-wing actors are. Some rightists openly prefer Russia for they blame America for the spread of ""imperialism,"" ""forever wars,"" ""predatory capitalism,"" and ""lifestyle revolutions,"" including identity politics and so forth. These Europeans sound pretty much like many of their counterparts at home. In Italy and elsewhere, most of them are regular folks, rather than the elites, who tend to vote left. Whom should we choose to serve our national interest best? Unfortunately, Americans cannot agree among themselves what our national interest actually is. However, if we bring back Ronald Reagan’s platform of freedom, democracy, faith, patriotism, tradition, family, and peace through strength in tandem with our European allies, then, definitely, we can use more of the like-minded across the pond. In putting together a pro-American, right-wing coalition, we would have to make wise choices predicated on, first, the knowledge of history, and second, the recent track record of our perspective rightist partners on the Old Continent. In the 1980s late General John Singlaub aided by Herbert Romerstein purged the American anti-Communist movement of neo-Nazis and their sympathizers. We must expect our prospective European right-wing allies to do the same in their ranks, if they have not done so. Bringing back the Ronald Reagan platform of freedom and democracy is a great opportunity for American conservatives to find like-minded allies in Europe. : Pres. Ronald Reagan walking; giving thumbs up gesture on S. Lawn. We must also remember that the past lingers and wafts over the Old Continent to a greater extent than over here. So, we must be very vigilant about not associating with anyone carelessly. At the same time, we must keep in mind that most of those who would like now to work with us are interested in the present and the future and, further, have made a strategic decision to disinvest themselves of ugly history to be compatible with the United States. America fought both German dictator Adolf Hitler and Russian dictator Joseph Stalin, in sequence. Most Europeans hardly resisted the Nazis and many sided with Berlin against Moscow. The shadow of institutional collaboration hangs over them. In Europe, Poland alone had the dubious distinction of counting the Third Reich and the Soviet Union as mortal enemies simultaneously. By refusing to yield to Hitler’s anti-Communist wooing, only Poland was fully crushed and subsequently, not asked to form a collaborationist, pro-Nazi government. Poland fought on: at home and abroad. Now it counts among America’s staunchest allies, in particular under its current Law and Justice government. So do the British. Britain’s Brexit executed by the Conservative Party in the name of sovereignty was in our interest. London is very keen on maintaining its special relationship with D.C. A codicil is that by leaving the , the Brits left the Poles behind in the European Parliament as America’s sole lobby. Hungary is a mixed bag, navigating among various options, including China and Russia, while remaining in and the . Beloved by , Budapest always considers its interests first before anything else. So, the U.S. remains wary of the Magyars. Sweden has just applied to join , and thus it has definitely moved closer to the U.S. In domestic policy, the new Italian winning coalition sounds like . Meloni’s fighting words were: ""Yes to the natural family, no to the lobby! Yes to sexual identity, no to gender ideology!"" In foreign policy, prime minister designate Meloni is rather hostile both to China and Russia, even when some of her coalition allies have a rather warm view of Moscow and Bejing. The Italian coalition’s animus is not anti-American, but primarily anti-. Like in most places, anti-Americanism is moderated again by the membership in . However, membership in the does not translate into Europhilia and any love lost toward Brussels, which reciprocates in kind.

The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee said Monday that talk about opposition to military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine is overblown. Rep.

Turner's comments came after a trip to Ukraine last week with Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee. During the visit, the lawmakers met directly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The trip came in the wake of statements from some lawmakers who suggested a Republican Congress would be more hesitant to approve large-scale military and financial aid to Ukraine. ""I think people are going to be sitting in a recession, and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Punchbowl News last week. Some lawmakers have suggested a Republican Congress would be more hesitant about approving large-scale military and financial aid to Ukraine. Democrats cited those comments as a sign that Republicans were preparing to abandon Ukraine as it continues to fight off a Russian invasion. ""You either stand for freedom or you bow to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin,"" said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. ""Minority Leader McCarthy is making it clear where the stands."" Turner dismissed the claims, noting that McCarthy and most Republicans have voted to provide weapons to Ukraine. He also claimed that Zelenskyy was aware of the nuance in the 's position. ""He hears of these massive, bloated bills that are being passed in the United States,"" said Turner. ""And he's very aware of the small portion, overall, that actually ends up in Ukraine… the concern is, and I used these words with him, ‘how many U.S. dollars do we have to spend to get a dollar to you.’""",13

There are a lot of faraway places in this world—Namibia for example— but Europe is not one of them. Europe is where your kids spent junior year abroad. Europe is an easy flight from the east coast of the United States to pretty much anywhere on the continent and you know this. You've been on vacation in Europe, as millions of Americans have. For the most part, they speak English in Europe. They've got Starbucks and Taco Bell and air conditioning and modern hospitals. It is not another world. Given how closely related the United States is to Europe and has always been, you would imagine our leaders would notice when Europe began to fall apart, especially when the signs were not subtle at all – and they weren't. This summer, Germans began clear-cutting ancient forests to heat their homes. In Poland, families queued up for hours to buy coal, just like they did 150 years ago. In the U.K., the government projected that more than 10,000 Britons will freeze to death, will die, this winter for lack of heating fuel—freeze to death in England! That is not supposed to happen in a first world country. Europe is moving backward at high speed and it's not clear where it will end. The question is: why is this happening? The answer for once is a very simple one: the war in Ukraine. That's why it's happening. A huge percentage of Europe's energy came from Russia. Those imports have now been banned, supposedly to punish Vladimir Putin. What's the result of this punishment? Well, the Russian ruble is now far stronger than it was a year ago. The European economy, meanwhile, is collapsing. Europeans are much poorer than they were when the war in Ukraine started. How is that a victory for Europe, the West and democracy? Well, that's a fair question. It's an obvious question, but no one in Washington appears to be asking that question. Instead, the Biden administration is doubling down on the self-destructive mistakes that are destroying the European Union. : ' A ' The White House banned Russian oil, natural gas and coal. It was our moral duty. Then at the same time, the Biden administration crushed domestic oil production here by canceling oil and gas leases and then, as if that wasn't enough, the Biden administration sold a piece of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, maybe this country's most important resource, to China. None of this hurt Putin in any way. All of it impoverishes the United States. Vladimir Putin delivers an address flanked by men in military uniforms. What could possibly be the justification for doing that? We've wondered. Anyone who's paying attention has had to have wondered that. Well, this week, Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, of Bethesda. answered that question. Russia is an orthodox Christian country with traditional social values and for that reason, it must be destroyed, no matter what the cost to us. This is not a conventional war. This is a jihad. Jamie Raskin said that out loud, but many in Washington agree with him in both parties. They would like to see World War Trans immediately. What is a jihad going to mean for you? The details are stunning. Thanks to the Biden administration's religious war in Ukraine, this country is about to run out of diesel fuel. According to data from the Energy Information Administration by the Monday of Thanksgiving week, , there will be no more diesel. What's going to happen then? Well, everything will stop. That means trucks and trains and barges all unable to move. Farm equipment will shut down. There will be no deliveries because there'll be no trucks. There'll be no diesel generators and then inevitably, our economy will crash because everything runs on diesel fuel—not on solar panels, not on wind farms, on diesel fuel. Diesel is not a negotiable commodity. You have to have diesel. What happens when we don't have it? Well, yesterday, Fox's Jacqui Heinrich, apparently alone in the White House press corps, asked the White House spokesman, John Kirby, that very question. What's the plan here? We're running out of diesel. John Kirby, standing at the podium representing the White House, the president of the United States, the administration, the largest organization in human history, the executive branch of government had no answer. But don't worry, he said. We will be exporting plenty of energy to Europe to help fight that progressive crusade in Ukraine. Watch. , , : What are we doing to increase the supply of diesel given that the Energy Information Administration said as of October 14 the U.S. only had about a 25-day supply. You have the Northeast and New York already rationing home heating oil. What are we doing to prepare for the winter and to ramp up supply of diesel? : I'll take the question on the diesel, because I just don't have the data on that in front me. So let me take that and we'll get back to you on that, but writ large, the president has been working very, very hard to make sure that we're, that not only are we ready for fluctuations that could come and of course, the prices are going down and we think that's important, but that we are also doing what we can to help our European friends and partners who are also going to be facing a long, cold winter. We have doubled our commitment, the commitment he made in March, for natural gas exports to Europe. We've doubled that commitment in terms of actual getting things over there, getting natural gas over there and we are working with foreign suppliers of natural gas and oil to see if we can't help our European partners diversify their own storage and supplies Just pause and savor the irony here just for a moment because now everything is irony. They've been telling you for decades since Al Gore left the White House, that the single greatest threat to the world was warming and because of their efforts to fight warming, you are in danger of freezing and unlike warming, freezing actually kills people, a lot of people every year, and it will kill people in the West this year, thanks to their efforts to fight warming. 'S The second thing to notice is the White House spokesman's totally uninterested, blasé response to the most basic question anyone could ask, which is ""What are we doing about the fact we're running out of diesel fuel?"" He has no idea and he's not embarrassed that he has no idea. The problem is at this point, there may not be an answer because there may not be a way to avoid a disaster. Diesel fuel is not just low in this country. It's low in every Western nation that is aligned itself with Ukraine. All these nations preparing for World War Trans are running out of diesel fuel. As New York Magazine has reported, ""The last time there was this little supply , there were about 3.5 billion fewer people on the planet."" Well, that puts it into perspective. The Biden administration responded, as you know, earlier this year to rising gas prices, which they feared above all, because the midterms are coming in two weeks by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, but that will not work here. The Northeast home heating oil reserve contains a million barrels of diesel in case of emergencies. The problem is that demand is so high across the board that, according to The Washington Post, even if the Biden administration used every single barrel in that stockpile, that stockpile would be empty in less than six hours. And of course, it's not just diesel that's running out. Jet fuel is up about 23% in just the last month. Kerosene, which if you don't live in New York City, you know perfectly well, is used to heat people's homes and keep them from dying, is now close to $7 a gallon. Who heats with kerosene, by the way? Poor people heat with kerosene, and they're the ones who can't get it. $7 a gallon! In New England, people are worried about freezing to death this winter. Here's a local Fox report. ' : : West Hartford homeowner Sharona Resnick-Kravitz has been paying for oil to heat her home for more than 35 years. -: This is New England. It gets cold here. We're cold. : Sharona is a widow living on a fixed income. She says before her husband passed away, they shared the bills. Now she is having to make sacrifices. How are you preparing and trying to figure out what can you sacrifice at this point? -: Um, food. I go to the grocery store and I'm very frugal about what I buy. : She tells me at a $6 a gallon, buying oil has become a huge burden. The average home uses 800 gallons of oil per year. That's almost $5,000 at the current rate. ' ' This shouldn't be happening in this of all countries. The United States has some of the deepest – by some measures, the deepest – energy reserves on the planet. It's our main strength. Cheap energy is the reason this is a rich country. That's the reason. That's why we're exceptional, because we have cheap energy and this country was energy independent a few years ago. Now, if you want to fix the economy, you would make this country energy independent once again. You would bring back cheap energy. That will fix the economy quicker than anything else. That's the only thing that'll fix the economy. But the Biden administration, for whatever reason, has done the opposite — depleting our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, for example. They just released another 15 million barrels the other day. Because they know that's running out, the White House is also begging foreign governments for help in the most humiliating possible way. Biden just went and begged the Saudis in secret for more oil. As the New York Times reported this week by his top aides, ""thought they had struck a secret deal to boost oil production through the end of the year."" But then the Saudi royal family decided not to go along with it. They're not ramping up their oil production. They're doing the opposite. Saudi's oil minister is now telling the West to brace for energy shortages. Watch this. : ‘ A ’ , ’S : It is my profound duty to make it clear to the world that losing emergency stock may become painful in the months to come. An energy shortage is not really a debate over whether some dude should be on the girls’ swim team. This is adult stuff. Countries rise and fall on the basis of what energy costs and when there's a real energy shortage, things fall apart. People die. Economies collapse. Poverty sets in, systemic poverty, not just in the bad part of town, but in your part of town. This is a real thing. The problem is the people running the government are children. They not only can't admit what they've done wrong, they don't even understand it. Here's Karine Jean-Pierre, the glass ceiling shattering spokeswoman at the White House, addressing the question yesterday. , : I'm anxious to get your thoughts on this New York Times report that U.S. officials thought they had a deal with the Saudis before the president went to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia for his meeting with the crown prince, but they thought they had a deal on oil supplies and oil, price of oil, but that the Saudis backed out of that deal. What can you tell us about? -: So, we have been very clear about how we believe parts of that report was mischaracterized and there has been some changes that have been made to that report. Look, we've also been clear that our trip, that the president's trip to the Middle East, was not about oil. : Was there an understanding, Karine, with the Saudis that the Saudis then backed away from? -: Again, the trip was not about oil. , , ‘’ . I’M ’ White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in Washington. This is embarrassing. She can't even conjugate the verb correctly. This is the spokesperson. It's a joke. She's doesn't know what oil is and she's lying. They're all like that. These people are not capable of running a country this big and this complex and that's why it's falling apart. Joe Biden is blaming gas stations for high prices. How's Kamala Harris responding to all of this? Well, she's responding to diesel shortage by telling you diesel is bad. Watch. : I have a particular fondness, I must tell you, for electric school buses. I love electric school buses. On a daily basis, 25 million children in our country every day go to school on those diesel fueled school busses and hundreds, thousands of school bus drivers are driving those buses, which are then these people, these children, these adults are inhaling what is toxic air. The lady who never had children is lecturing you about children. The person has never had a real job is lecturing you about energy policy. The woman who told you masks would stop is telling you about diesel fumes and their effect on your body. This is a joke. The truth is these people are bumping right smack up against reality and here's the reality. We have 25 days to avert economic catastrophe. Catastrophe is what will happen if we run out of diesel fuel. That's more important than prosecuting a jihad in Ukraine. It's more important than World War Trans.",0
2022-10-27,https://www.foxnews.com/media/tulsi-gabbard-democratic-party-completely-controlled-warmongers-washington,Tulsi Gabbard: Democratic Party is completely controlled by warmongers in Washington,"Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a former presidential candidate and Democrat turned independent, joins 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' to assess progressive Democrats withdrawing a letter sent to President Biden urging him to secure a peace deal in Ukraine. Former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard reacts to progressive Democrats withdrawing a letter urging President Biden to seek diplomacy in Russia-Ukraine war Wednesday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" : Tucker, these so-called progressives did a very simple thing that apparently can appear to be brave in Washington these days. In that letter to President Biden, they just told the truth about how this ongoing proxy war with Russia is increasing in cost and consequences, both on the Ukrainian people, but also the American people here at home, and how it's negatively impacting gas prices, increasing inflation and so on. You know, these progressives in the letter, they didn't say, ""Stop sending aid to Ukraine."" - , No, all they said was, ""Hey, President Biden, engage in diplomacy."" And the response they got, of course, from the warmongers who controlled the Democrat Party in Washington was to immediately be smashed to pieces, so much so that these Democrat members of Congress cowered in the corner with fear and now have gone so far out of their way, apologizing profusely for having the audacity to call for diplomacy in this war that's putting us all at risk.",0
2022-10-27,https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-ally-taiwan-returned-china,Putin ally says Taiwan will be 'returned' to China,"A close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and of state-owned oil company Rosneft, Igor Sechin, claimed on Thursday during an international convention that Taiwan was ""on schedule"" to be returned to China. Speaking at an international economic forum in Azerbaijan, Sechin said Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ability to secure a historic third term would enable Beijing to accomplish top priority issues. ""The position of [China's] leadership is highly respected, which calmly and openly, without false premises, sets out its positions, even on the most difficult issues, such as the problem of Taiwan, which in this regard can be assessed as somewhat exaggerated,"" Sechin said according to a Reuters report. A People's Liberation Army member looks through binoculars during military exercises as Taiwan frigate Lan Yang is seen at the rear, on Friday, Aug. 5, 2022. '' -- Xi has long said he will seek ""peaceful reunification"" with the island and mainland China, despite warnings from Western and regional officials to leave Taiwan alone and maintain the regional status quo. Taiwan identifies as a sovereign nation with democratic values, but it is officially recognized by China, the United Nations and the U.S. as part of the one-China policy. China has increased its aggressive posture against the island, and many fear the world could see another deadly conflict following Russia’s eight-month-long war in Ukraine. Shiyu, or Lion Islet, which is part of Kinmen county, one of Taiwan's offshore islands, is seen in front of China's Xiamen, on Lieyu island, Kinmen county, Taiwan Aug. 20, 2018. , Sechin argued that Western interference in the Taiwan-China relationship and investment from Washington in Taiwanese semiconductors has all but solidified that Taipei will ""return to its native harbour…on schedule."" Putin and Xi have deepened ties with one another since Russia invaded Ukraine and geopolitically blackballed itself from the West. Putin has backed Xi’s stance on reunifying the island with China and warned the West against interfering in Beijing’s agenda. President Biden prompted an international stir last month when he said U.S. forces would defend Taiwan if China invaded. When he was asked to clarify in a ""60 Minutes"" interview if he meant he would deploy U.S. men and women to the island to defend Taipei, Biden responded with: ""Yes."" President Biden meets with China's President Xi Jinping during a virtual summit from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., Nov. 15, 2021. Biden later attempted to set the record straight on U.S.-China relations and told the U.N. General Assembly, ""We seek to pull peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits and remain committed to our ‘One China’ policy, which has helped prevent conflict for four decades."" He added, ""We continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side.""",5

Workers used drills and heavy equipment to destroy the 1945 monuments at four different locations across Poland. Most of them were in the form of concrete obelisks dedicated to Red Army soldiers who fell while fighting to defeat Nazi German troops. The head of the state Institute of National Remembrance, Karol Nawrocki, has called for the removals. He said the monuments stood for a system that was guilty of enslaving and murdering its own people and other nations, including Poles. 'S ""This is a monument to disgrace, a monument of contempt of the winners over the victims,"" Nawrocki said in Glubczyce, in the south of Poland, as workers were readying to remove the figure of a Red Army soldier prior to dismantling the entire monument. ""In 1945, the Soviets did not bring liberation, they brought another captivity. They were capturing Poland and treating it as booty,"" Nawrocki said in an emotional speech. A worker stands on a crane during the dismantling of a Red Army monument in Glubczyce, Poland, on Oct. 27, 2022. Poland dismantled four communist-era monuments in a renewed drive to remove symbols of Moscow’s post-World War domination. He said the spirit of that system is still present in the Russian Federation, which is killing civilians in Ukraine. ‘’ ’ Nawrocki stressed that Russian law prosecutes and provides up to three years in prison for anyone removing Soviet army monuments, even in foreign countries. The other monuments were removed from former burial sites in Byczyna, in the southwest and in Bobolice, in the northwest. The remains of the soldiers were exhumed and moved to proper graves in the 1950s. A stone monument was also taken apart in the woods near Staszow, in the south. The institute investigates and prosecutes Nazi and communist crimes against Poles, and commemorates national heroes who fought against oppressors. Ever since shedding communist rule in 1989, Poland has been taking steps to remove from the public space the symbols of Moscow’s past domination, taking away monuments and plaques. Some have been moved to special storage. The drive does not include cemeteries or current burial sites.",6

The Tippecanoe Superior Court panel deliberated about two hours before finding Michael Barnett not guilty of three neglect charges and conspiracy to commit neglect of a dependent. The daughter, Ukrainian immigrant Natalia Barnett, said her adoptive parents, before moving to Canada, abandoned her in a second-story Lafayette apartment in which she was unable to navigate the stairs and was without a walker or wheelchair or any knowledge of the city. Natalia Barnett testified on Wednesday she learned nearly everything about life, including how to read, write and wash her hair, from a Lafayette family that took her in. Prosecutors argued she was ""entirely dependent"" on Barnett and his ex-wife, Kristine, and there was ""no one she knew she could turn to for help."" Indiana man Michael Barnett was found not guilty of three neglect charges and conspiracy to commit neglect of a dependent on Thursday. However, defense attorneys argued ""she wanted nothing to do with the Barnetts. She had moved on."" The defense showed jurors videos of Natalia Barnett running across a street, walking through a grocery store and clinging to the edge of a pool. They argued she was an able-bodied adult who was no longer interested in being a part of the family. , Michael Barnett and his ex-wife have said Natalia was an adult pretending to be a child. Michael Barnett and his attorneys declined to comment after the verdict. A judge imposed a gag order in the case three years ago. Natalia came to the U.S. from Ukraine in 2010.

I heard one blast from my hotel room just after 8 in the morning Monday. My team heard a few more. The Russians were attacking Kyiv again. Welcome back to Ukraine. This is, in fact, my fourth trip to the country this year. From guessing whether the Russians were going to invade. To the shock of it happening. The bravado of the country’s initial fight-back. The horrors. The deadly grind. And more. It has been quite a year. Now we’re more than eight months into this war, the worst Europe has seen in nearly 80 years. And it’s as edgy as ever. As different. And as familiar. It’s always good to come back and see your super local staff. Translators, drivers and security. You know you’ve been covering something a long time when the overnight hotel room service staff knows you by name. And the air raid sirens never get old. And seem to never stop. : Firefighters help a local woman evacuate from a residential building destroyed by a Russian drone strike in Kyiv, Ukraine, Oct. 17, 2022. Kyiv, one of the prettiest cities in Europe, looked elegant. A bit worn-down. Still determined. The Russian strikes on this day landed north of the center of the city. My folks pinpointed the location expertly. They’re used to it. Government restrictions keep you from showing the exact target so we go to a nearby park. A building with shattered windows was next door. And I was once again with the courageous people of Ukraine. One elderly woman said she was in her kitchen and looked out the window as one missile went over her house. And she heard more. As if she was a military spotter. Another told us her children called her to make sure she was safe. A regular routine here. Greg Palkot, Fox News' senior foreign affairs correspondent, reporting from Kyiv. -31 '' : A third simply said it was ""bad"" and she was ""scared."" We gave her a hug. And remembered so many salt-of-the-earth folks we’d met in so many horrible places this year. One had reminded me of my late mother. Next stop was to get the assessment of the situation from Kyiv’s mayor, ex-boxing champion Vitali Klitschko. He’s usually a friendly fellow and happy to chat. On this day he was grim. Small talk went right by him. He told me on this day 80% of the city was without water, 350,000 residents without power. Faltering on the battlefield, Russia is now targeting the civilian infrastructure. He feared for a long cold winter. We heard the same when we talked via Zoom to the head of the biggest utility company here. He was even scarier. He said with all things so interconnected now, Ukraine could be facing a massive humanitarian crisis. On the streets of Kyiv at night, the power cuts and energy conservation make them even darker than usual. Some venture out to go to a late night food store. Others race the 10 p.m. curfew to down last drinks. As the fighting goes on… in the eastern part of the country, where we have been tracking the Russian-fueled skirmishes of set-up separatists for eight years now. A mother and daughter in Kyiv stand in front of a damaged military vehicle. And crucially now in the south, where Ukraine is aiming to extend its latest battlefield gains, trying to win back the one regional capital Russia captured during this year of bloodshed, Kherson. Due to its proximity to the fighting goal, the mayor of neighboring Mykolaiv tells us on another call that his town has the grim distinction of being one of the most shot-up towns in the country. And then to our live shots for Fox. The balcony overlooking the beautiful golden-domed St. Michael has been our perch all this year. With everything going on in the States, especially now with domestic politics at a fever pitch, interest remains. After all these months, respect is shown for the story. Because it remains important. And bad. And could get worse. A young boy in Kyiv standing in front of a bombed out car. Along with the people of Ukraine, Fox has taken its hits this year too. Always remembered, especially when one returns here. Friend and correspondent Benjamin Hall, badly injured in a Russian missile blast, about 15 miles from where I write this, now making a strong comeback. The talented young local producer Sasha Kuvshynova. Who lost her life in the attack. And dear buddy cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski. Also gone. We cover this story for them. For our viewers. For this noble country. Keeping up a very brave fight. At a very tough time. We’ll see what the month holds.",6

Two key bipartisan senators Thursday promised continued ""broad support"" in Congress for Ukraine following a visit in Kyiv with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other top officials. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., made the comments amid increasing disagreement among Republicans over aid for Ukraine in its war against a Russian invasion. The U.S. has already provided $65 billion in aid to the country. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, traveled to Ukraine with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. $65 ""We are here today to underscore the broad support that continues to exist in Congress for the Ukrainian people,"" Portman and Coons said in a statement Thursday. ""We met with President Zelenskyy to discuss Ukraine’s needs as it continues to defend itself against this brutal Russian invasion and to show American solidarity with the Ukrainian people,"" the senators added. ""President Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the American people for the critical security, economic, and humanitarian assistance we continue to provide, and we saw how this assistance saves lives when we toured a World Food Programme food distribution center."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio. ‘’ Congress appears likely to consider yet more funding for the war in its lame-duck session after the midterms. But many Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. – who may be the House speaker in January if Republicans are able to win control of the House – are now questioning if continued high-level U.S. funding for Ukraine is wise. ""I think people are going to be sitting in a recession, and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,"" McCarthy recently told Punchbowl News. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Punchbowl News recently that he does not anticipate continuing to give Ukraine a ""blank check."" Many members of McCarthy's House conference feel the same, as do some senators. Portman, who is retiring, may be replaced by Republican candidate Vance, who opposes continued aid to Ukraine. But the vast majority of Congress – including nearly all Democrats – is likely to support an effort to sent more aid to Ukraine in the coming months.

Levin warned he's never seen people so bent on ""destroy[ing] this country"" as he has in the key swing states, which otherwise tend to trend centrist, this cycle. ""Let's all pretend we're ten points behind everywhere across the country. That's what we ought to do… But we got to get our ass and gear and defeat these people. They're going to destroy the country. This is the biggest line up of Democrat Party reprobates who want to serve in the Senate, in the House that I've ever seen in my life,"" he said. ""[This is] the worst, most extreme hate-America crowd you can imagine,"" he said, explicitly pointing to statewide candidates in Wisconsin, North Carolina and Georgia. Former Meese Chief of Staff Mark Levin Levin characterized Biden, in turn, as a ""damnable Washington bureaucrat"" who spent his entire adult life on the taxpayer's dime and allegedly that of the ""Communist Chinese payroll."" ""That goes for Pelosi and Schumer too,"" he said, as Pelosi succeeded the late Rep. Sala Burton, D-Calif., in 1987 – and Schumer has worked explicitly in politics since his 1974 election to the New York State Assembly representing Brighton Beach. Levin said the election transcends basic right-and-left politics, and that it presents voters with an even more dire choice: ""Do you like being called names by Joe Biden in his party? Did you ever have a president of the United States who's trashing the American people?"" he asked, noting Biden declared Trump voters to be dangerous to democracy. John Fetterman, Penna Gov. Tom Wolf, Joe Biden Keying into the fact Biden has repeatedly lamented Republicans as ""deniers"" of various instances such as the 2020 elections, Levin said Democrats are collectively ""gas price deniers,"" and deniers of open borders, fentanyl, and ""massive debt."" ""Of course, they're desperate. They want you to actually believe that if you vote for these wild, crazy, riotous Republicans who are well known for overthrowing the country… burning down cities… attacking cops and the military; who are well known for burning the American flag… that we will not have our country the day after the election. Really?"" Levin said facetiously. Levin however added that Republicans are not to be automatically trusted either, focusing on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. – whom he said has ""trashed"" the ""citizen candidates."" President Biden shakes hands with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, during the National Prayer Breakfast Returning to the Democratic Party's new ""Marxist"" identity, Levin said they have successfully transformed the American republic into something the Soviets failed at, and the Chinese have been unsuccessful in for 70 years. ""They did it in 20 months: I would say to Republicans, ‘unite’ – I would say to independents, ‘help us’ -- I would say to Democrats. ‘Wash this dirt off your hands and join us’.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy on Tuesday urged U.S. lawmakers to continue their ""unwavering"" support for Kyiv even if Republicans gain majority control in the House of Representatives. As Americans head to the polls Tuesday for the midterm elections, officials around the globe are watching to see if and how the balance of power will shift between Democrats and Republicans. Kyiv has relied heavily on U.S. support throughout the eight-month war following Russia’s invasion in February, but concern has mounted in the war-torn nation that Washington's support may weaken if Republicans gain control in Congress. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his official residence in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Oct. 25, 2022. ' ' Polling has suggested that the may be able to regain majority control in the lower chamber while races in the Senate remain highly contested. Zelenskyy has largely refrained from commenting on the U.S. political scene as Americans gear up for several tight midterm races, but on Tuesday he urged Congress to continue its support no matter which party makes gains. ""When this war began, Ukraine heard something very important from the world – we heard that ‘the democracies are here.’ And we see now what democracies are capable of when they act in unity,"" he said in an address after he was awarded the Medal of Liberty by Sens.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks via a video link to the opening session of the International Crimea Platform Parliamentary summit, organized by Ukraine and Croatia, in Zagreb, on Oct. 25, 2022. The U.S. has been the world’s top supplier of weapons, aid and financial support to Ukraine, providing $18.2 billion in security assistance since January 2021 – approximately $17.6 billion of which was provided since the February invasion. While support for Ukraine has largely been a bipartisan issue in the Senate, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., threw the issue into question last month when he said Republicans would not write a ""blank check"" if they win back the lower chamber. : Polls released last month by Reuters showed that 75% of Americans still support aiding Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin, but McCarthy and other hard-line lawmakers have claimed this support will not hold against rising inflation.

Once the ballots are counted, lawmakers will settle down to doing the people’s business. If Republicans can retake the House and Senate, here’s how America’s approach to foreign policy may change. Expect the new Congress to take the gloves off on fighting back against Beijing. Last month’s Chinese Communist Party Congress produced what amounted to a clear declaration that Beijing intends to take down the United States. Lawmakers will find no comfort in the administration’s recently released national strategies, which declare China to be a problem of the first order and then offer no real solutions. President Joe Biden is sticking to his mantra of ""compete where we must, cooperate where we can."" This is akin to declaring Freddy Kruger is real and then taking a sleeping pill. The new Congress won’t stand for it. 'S '' Biden’s open-border policies have seriously hindered his party’s chances of coming out on top at the polls. That lesson will not be lost on congressional leaders. Expect them to press for a return to sensible immigration enforcement policies. And don’t be surprised to see a Republican-led House try to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Drone footage from Abram-Perezville, Texas on March, 29, 2021. The Biden administration released its National Defense Strategy, Missile Defense Review, and Nuclear Posture Review all on the same day. Conservative leaders on the Hill received them with all the enthusiasm movie critics expressed for ""Ishtar."" Congress has been dissatisfied with Biden’s defense policies since day one. His proposed defense budget was so inadequate, even his own party refused to support it. Recently, The Heritage Foundation released its annual ""Index of U.S. Military Strength,"" which assessed the capability of our armed forces as lower than it has been in a decade — even though the threats they must contain have increased dramatically. Taking into account congressional attention to the report, Congress could well look to take defense policy into its own hands. Don’t expect a U-turn on U.S. policy regarding Ukraine. The new Congress won’t abandon Ukraine like Biden quit Afghanistan. That said, congressional leaders will draw a finer distinction between supporting the Ukrainian people and supporting Biden administration policies which have been both tentative and spendthrift. Expect conservative leadership in Congress to finetune both their talking points and their policy proposals. The freshman class of legislators will have not spent much time delving into the issue. After all, virtually every congressional race focused on domestic issues. The newcomers will need their leaders to articulate better both why supporting Ukraine is in America’s interests and the realities of how our policies there are working and where they are not. Expect leadership to sharpen the points of concern about the Biden response to the Russian invasion. Military aid should, in fact, have flowed faster and been more robust. Americans also need reassurance that the Europeans are providing their fair share of assistance and that U.S. non-military aid is not being wasted or enriching kleptocrats. Congress should insist on a much better plan for long-term reconstruction, one that will keep Ukraine from becoming another foreign aid-dependent basket case like Iraq and Afghanistan. Finally, Americans need to see a real and realistic long-term plan to safeguard U.S. interests against future Russian aggressions. That said, the new leadership in Congress will want to demonstrate to our allies that America is a reliable partner, one that makes good on its commitments and lives up to its responsibilities. At the same time, they will need to make clear that partnership is a two-way street, and the U.S. fully expects its allies to carry their fair share of the burden as well. More and more Americans are seeing climate-alarmism and progressive’s dystopian climate policies for what they are: a scam. Expect congressional leaders to fight back against the administration’s extremist energy and environmental. The Congress will want to restore American energy independence and put a stop to U.S. funding of a profligate and dangerous global green agenda.",22

As the Republican Party inches nearer to obtaining majority rule in the House, one Ukrainian parliamentarian is reminding current and future U.S. lawmakers of the lessons learned from World War and urging unity in Congress. ""Every responsible politician knows and understands that international law, international security system and generally established borders cannot be violated,"" Oleksandr Vasiuk, a Member of Ukraine’s Parliament, told Fox News Digital from Ukraine.

2022-11-14,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sized-up-biden-putin-invaded-ukraine-taiwan-pray-xi-similar-assessment,"Having sized up Biden, Putin invaded Ukraine. Taiwan must pray Xi doesn’t make a similar assessment","Former intel officer Rebekah Koffler provides updates on the Russia-Ukraine war as fears for Putin’s nuclear threat continue to rise on ""Varney & Co."" Prior to invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to foresee the potential U.S. response. As a former operative, Putin honed his skill at sizing up personalities while he was running spy networks in East Germany. He prides himself on his ability to ""work and communicate with people,"" calling himself a ""specialist in human relations,"" a skill he believes is critical to his role as Russian president. The meeting between Putin and Biden would have certainly been studied by the Chinese in the lead-up to Monday's Biden/Xi conversation on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. The Chinese are fully aware of the actions Putin took following his discussions with Biden. President Joe Biden shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 leaders' summit in Bali, Indonesia, Nov. 14, 2022. A lot can be gleaned from that February meeting and how Russia does its intel gathering. In 2001, during a press conference, the former Russian spymaster explained his approach to striking rapport when communicating with a wide range of individuals, from journalists and scientists to politicians and rank-and-file citizens: ""It is important to establish a dialogue and activate the best in your partner. You want to achieve results; you must respect your partner, acknowledge that he is better than you in some way. You must make him your ally ... make him feel that there is something that unites you, that you have a common cause."" This is exactly the approach that human intelligence, or , officers use to target, assess and recruit spies who are willing to betray their country in service for a foreign land. And this is the intelligence tradecraft that Putin used when he was sizing up Biden during their summit in Geneva in June 2021, as well as during subsequent phone calls and meetings by video conference. What Putin saw in President Biden emboldened him. President Joe Biden participates in a virtual meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Nov. 15, 2021, at the White House. Xi Jinping and his inner circle will also be looking to use as they, too, assess the American president following the conclusion of Monday's meeting, just as the Russians did in February. Some may fear that Taiwan could be next. Biden described the meeting as ""good"" and ""positive."" He told Putin that he wanted to have ""some basic rules of the road that we can all abide"" and handed him a list of 16 sectors of critical infrastructure that were not to be targeted with cyberattacks. Biden also reminded Putin about the importance of human rights and threatened ""devastating consequences"" if Alexei Navalny, a jailed Russian opposition activist and Putin’s vocal critic who was likely poisoned by Russian spy services, dies in prison. Here's what the Russians concluded: Biden was naive to think that Russia would change its policies because the U.S. wants it to, and that it was ""absurd"" to expect changes in Russia’s posture on cyber or on Ukraine and that Biden could ""dictate"" to Putin how things should work in Russia. Most of all, the Russians were stunned by Biden’s ""absolutely senseless tactic"" of speaking to Putin about Navalny, his opponent. For them, it was as if Putin threatened Biden with consequences if Trump were jailed and died in prison on Biden’s watch. ? - President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin greet each other in Geneva, Switzerland, June 16, 2021. Putin’s primary goal for the summit was to understand exactly who Biden is, and he believed that he had accomplished that mission. The Kremlin concluded that President Biden was a ""man of the past, in every sense of the word."" In Monday's meeting, Biden will be similarly assessed by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, during their first in-person meeting since Biden took office in Bali, Indonesia, ahead of the G-20 summit. While the White House seeks to ""deepen lines of communication,"" Xi is signaling confrontation. Having won a third term as leader of the Chinese Communist Party, he has secured total political control as the likely president for life. Last Tuesday, Xi, during his visit to the armed forces’ operational command center, directed China’s military to be ready for war. ""The entire military must … focus on combat ability as the fundamental and only criterion, concentrate all energy on fighting a war, direct all work towards warfare and speed up to build the ability to win,"" Xi said. China’s grand plan is to become the dominant world power by 2049, replacing the United States both economically and militarily. And Xi may choose to establish control over Taiwan by military force in the near term rather than by gradual integration, a concern that’s on the rise within U.S. national security circles. A screenshot of Chinese military propaganda video that was posted on Chinese state-run media. Although Putin and Xi announced a ""no limits"" strategic partnership prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it is unlikely that Moscow would share its assessments of President Biden with Beijing. Underneath the showy displays of friendship, there’s deep mistrust between the two countries that consider themselves rivals and even opponents in the long term. Biden will again likely be lecturing his counterpart, rambling on about issues that Xi has no interest in his opinion on, like global warming and oppression by his government. And again, a U.S. enemy will be sizing Biden up and potentially emboldened to start a war.",22

This war is proof that dictatorships will do whatever it takes to achieve their goal of expansionism. Regretfully, the Taiwanese people are very familiar with such aggression,"" Ing-wen stated.

Kamchatka is home to 29 active volcanoes, part of a vast belt of Earth known as the ""Ring of Fire"" which circles the Pacific Ocean and is prone to eruptions and frequent earthquakes. Most of the peninsula's volcanoes are surrounded by sparsely populated forest and tundra, so pose little risk to local people, but big eruptions can spew glass, rock and ash into the sky, threatening aircraft. According to the United States Geological Survey , these kinds of eruptions typically happen three or four times a year in Kamchatka, requiring air traffic to be rerouted.

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel traveled to Russia this week under the auspices of an official state visit, where he will attend the unveiling of a statue of Fidel Castro at the Sokol metro station in northwestern Moscow. Despite Cuba's decision earlier this year to abstain from U.N. votes condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Ukrainian territory, Cuba and Russia remain close geopolitical, economic and military allies, united by a shared anti-American vision. Russian President Vladimir Putin has lavished hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil on the island nation, and Cuba in return has installed Russian intelligence at the infamous Lourdes station near Havana, where it actively monitors U.S. communications. ? - Deputy head of Russia's Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, right, shakes hands with Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel during their meeting at the Gorki state residence outside Moscow on Nov. 21, 2022. Despite Cuba's dismal economic outlook, Russia appears happy to extend repeated financial lifelines to the Caribbean Island in exchange for a bolstered geopolitical and military presence a mere 150 miles from U.S. shores. At a time when Russia is imperiled as never before in the post-Cold War era, its commitment of critical resources demonstrates the value it places on Cuba, which many scholars believe to be the command center in the ""long game"" Russia is seeking to play as it battles for hearts and minds in the Latin American region. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital that ""The Cuban regime has struggled to stay relevant after their financial enablers in the Soviet Union stopped sending them money in the 1990s,"" yet with renewed ties they receive ""military equipment and intelligence from Russia…the Cuban regime benefits because it can further sustain itself with Russian blood money. Communism only works with other peoples’ money."" Russian-born intelligence expert Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, believes that Russian military deployment to the island is a possibility. ""Russia is probably considering deployment of military assets and personnel into Cuba to show Washington that it can mess in its backyard, too — all part of the plan to put pressure on the Biden administration to abandon support of Ukraine. Obviously, Putin would need Diaz-Canel’s consent for that."" Sixty years after 1962’s harrowing Cuban Missile Crisis, the threat of another confrontation looms large. ""Putin is maybe hoping to get permission to deploy nuclear-capable assets on the island as Moscow fears ’s intervention in the Russia-Ukraine war. This is meant as a deterrent but would likely be perceived by Washington as escalatory,"" Koffler said. Diaz-Canel’s visit demonstrates that Cuba remains firmly in the Russian geopolitical orbit, with ties between the two nations arguably closer than at any time since the end of the Cold War. The late Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Havana, Cuba, during a visit by the Russian president in 2014. As Koffler notes, ""On Jan. 24, one month prior to the so called ‘special operation’ , the Cuban and Russian presidents had a ‘friendly and productive phone call’ during which they discussed their ‘strategic partnership’ … less than a week prior to the invasion, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov visited Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, key Russian allies in Latin America, to secure support."" Despite the close relationship, Cuba and other Latin American allies like Venezuela and Bolivia surprised the world when they abstained from a U.N. vote to condemn the Russia invasion of Ukraine earlier this year and a subsequent vote on Oct. 12 regarding Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory. Koffler believes that this decision is tied to Cuba maximizing its economic standing with its historical benefactor. ""Cuba didn’t overtly vote in support of Russia, probably because it wants some negotiating leverage over Moscow. Havana likely hopes that Moscow will forgive some of its loans and get preferential terms for trade. In 2014, Moscow wrote off $32 billion of Cuba's outstanding debt. Havana probably hopes for more debt forgiveness by Moscow."" Russia and China, while sharing a hearty interest in the region, take vastly different approaches to Latin America. While China has largely confined its interests to ensuring a return on its economic investments, Russia, in a return to a Cold War-mentality, has made substantial political investments in ensuring the stability and longevity of its authoritarian allies, as well as bolstering anti-American movements and sentiments. ’S 'S ' ,' Honor guards attend celebrations marking Revolution Day in Guantanamo, Cuba. The renewed use of the Lourdes facility, whereby it actively monitors U.S. communications, is a key component of Russia's long-game strategy in the region, which primarily consists of antagonizing the United States. Yet, given Cuba’s history of aggressive military interventions around the globe, military involvement on the part of Cuba in Ukraine is not beyond the realm of possibility. Last week, popular state television host Vladimir Solovyov called for the formation of international brigades to come to Russia’s aid. ""I don’t understand why Americans, even if they’re fighting in Grenada, always improvise an international coalition. … Why do we deny ourselves that pleasure? There are units in Syria very well trained by us, there are people in Africa who support us, there is Venezuela, there is Nicaragua, Cuba, Iran and North Korea."" Citing the example of foreign volunteerism during the Spanish Civil War, he added, ""If volunteers from all over the world go and fight in Donetsk, why shouldn’t we give them the opportunity to organize and create an international body?"" Yet, Koffler deems this possibility as remote. ""I don’t see this as likely, but we cannot completely rule it out, at least, on a coercive basis rather than voluntarily,"" she said. ""Solovyov is one of the Kremlin's top propagandists and most of his rhetoric is intended to frighten the West and to galvanize ultra-nationalist sentiments within Russia. While we can’t completely dismiss what he says, we always need to take his rants with a grain of salt.""",22
2022-11-23,https://www.foxnews.com/world/boris-johnson-claims-germany-favored-ukraines-defeat-france-denial,Boris Johnson claims Germany favored Ukraine's defeat and France was in 'denial',"Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday claimed that France in the lead-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was in ""denial"" while German leaders just hoped it would be ""over quickly."" ""This thing was a huge shock,"" Johnson said in an interview with Portugal. ""We could see the Russian battalion tactical groups amassing, but different countries had very different perspectives."" Johnson specifically called out three European Union nations that he said were less steadfast than other allies in their response to Russia’s ""special military operation,"" which was launched nine months ago. Then-U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson sits down for an interview with 's Jake Tapper on June 26, 2022. : ""The German view was at one stage that if it were going to happen, which would be a disaster, then it would be better for the whole thing to be over quickly and for Ukraine to fold,"" Johnson said, alluding to ""all sorts of sound economic reasons"" for their stance. ""I couldn’t support that, I thought that was a disastrous way of looking at it. But I can understand why they thought and felt as they did,"" he added. Germany faced immense backlash for its initial lackluster support for Ukraine, infamously sending Kyiv's troops 5,000 helmets in the lead-up to the invasion as other allies deployed anti-tanks missiles, drones, ammunition and weaponry. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko notably mocked Germany’s shipment and said, ""What kind of support will Germany send next? Pillows?"" Germany has upped its defensive aid for Ukraine, though Berlin has continued to face some backlash at home and abroad for vacillating on the amount of support it has provided. France, which has been a strong supporter of Ukraine, was apparently caught by surprise when Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 – though French President Emmanuel Macron traveled to Moscow just weeks prior to the invasion to urge Putin to keep the peace. Then-U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, left, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shake hands in Kyiv on March 9, 2022. Macron returned with alleged assurances from Putin that he would not escalate the crisis that was then mounting on Ukraine’s borders, where Russia continued to amass troops. ""Be in no doubt that the French were in denial right up until the last moment,"" Johnson said. France’s head of military intelligence was fired in March for failing to predict Russia’s plans. Johnson also called out Italy’s initial response, which was then under Mario Draghi, who ""at one stage simply [said] that they would be unable to support the position we were taking"" due to its ""massive"" reliance on Russian hydrocarbons. Though once Russia invaded Ukraine, the attitudes of previously reluctant nations changed, Johnson said. Ukrainian servicemen fire a -21 Grad multiple rocket launch system on April 20, 2022, in the Kharkiv region. ""What happened was everybody – Germans, French, Italians, everybody, [President] Joe Biden – saw that there was simply no option,"" he said. ""Because you couldn’t negotiate with this guy [Putin]. That’s the key point."" ""The has done brilliantly,"" he continued. ""After all my anxieties … I pay tribute to the way the has acted. They have been united.""",0
2022-11-24,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/thanksgiving-day-deeply-thankful-to-be-american,On this Thanksgiving Day I am deeply thankful to be an American,"Former Defense Intelligence Officer Rebekah Koffler discusses the missile attack in Poland and Putin's strategy in Ukraine on 'Varney & Co.' I am an immigrant. Over 30 years ago, I fled Soviet socialist Russia and came to America, fulfilling the dream of my mother, who inspired me since I was a little girl to study hard, learn English and go to America, because this is the best place on earth. I don’t know how she knew. Traveling out of the totalitarian U.S.S.R. was nearly impossible, and she only visited America after I was here. Today, my sister and I still thank God every day we are here in America. On Thanksgiving Day, we say special prayers. We are thankful for the simple things, most of which many Americans perhaps take for granted. I am thankful for my home being warm in winter. Growing up in a small town close to Siberia, even though we had heat in the apartment, it was never warm enough. Since the government owned everything under socialism, it has full control of your living conditions. In winter, the authorities kept the heat on in apartments at a bare minimum and in summer, they turned off the hot water and sometimes both hot and cold, to save some rubles so they could keep their corrupt Soviet machine going. The Kremlin's Spasskaya Tower and St. Basil's Cathedral. : , ? Even inside the apartment in winter, we wore jackets, warm boots and sometimes mittens. My sister and I laughed at the sight of our dad wearing a big furry Russian hat, ushanka, even to bed. Today, when I come from the outside in winter, into my 72 degree warm house, I still get a feeling of surprise when warm air instead biting cool air hits my face. I get a bit of flashback, though not a trace of nostalgia. Every aspect of your life in the U.S.S.R was controlled by the government. You couldn’t just move to another city to live or study – you needed to show residency, a stamp in your passport called ""propiska."" But you couldn’t get a propiska in another city because you didn’t have an apartment, and you couldn’t just buy an apartment because the government owned everything. Renting was illegal because there was no private property. My mother rented an apartment, technically illegally, for me and my sister when we came from the provinces to study in Moscow. We had a joke back in the Soviet Union that you couldn’t get out of bed without breaking a dozen laws. Rebekah Koffler pictured here in the Soviet Union. Every bureaucrat took advantage of his position, charging bribes for everything. The policeman would hand you a fake traffic violation to get a bribe. Medical care was technically free and so there weren’t enough supplies, and the doctor would take a bribe to give you a painkiller or other medication. The manager at the grocery store would save groceries for her relatives and friends. The rest of us were often greeted by empty shelves. In America, I marvel at the ease of being able to get a driver’s license, establish a business, buy clean glowing red delicious apples in any grocery shop, even in winter, and get Novocain when the dentist drills my teeth. You can practice a religion. Back in the U.S.S.R, worshiping God was outlawed. Socialism and communism was the state religion. My sister and I were secretly baptized by our grandmother. In America, I adopted Judaism as my faith. An almost full moon at 97.6% sets behind the Statue of Liberty on March 8, 2020 in New York City. The Super Worm Moon would rise on March 9, 2020. Peace and stability is a privilege in America historically denied to Russians, especially now that Russia is waging a brutal war against Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians and Russians are dead or injured, millions have fled their homes. A friend who also fled Soviet Russia recently shared with me that she feels blessed living in America, especially for her son. He would have been drafted in the military and sent to fight in Ukraine. With no war on American soil in modern history, Americans don’t realize that historically, peace is an exception, not the rule. Russians, Ukrainians, Syrians, Afghanis, and many others know it all too well. This holiday season and always, I am counting my blessings for being an American and having the big things — like freedom, opportunity, peace, and stability — and little things, like a warm home and running water.",6

He also stated that the ""voice of the people"" Musk claimed wants free speech is ""Russian intelligence"" looking to undermine American support for Ukraine. During a recent segment on , the analyst argued that Musk’s pro-free speech attitude towards operating the company, particularly in the way he has decided to reinstate banned accounts and not suspend users for any speech, means Russian hackers will benefit. ' ' ' ' T- A analyst claims Twitter under Musk will benefit Vladimir Putin. After a Twitter poll he created earlier this week revealed that a majority of voters want previously banned accounts to be granted ""amnesty,"" Musk declared he would oblige that request. Along with his decision, he stated, ""Vox populi, Vox Dei"" – ""The voice of the people is the voice of God."" Baer also claimed that Musk’s justification of this move – calling it about free speech – is ""just nonsense"" that will benefit the Russians and other peddlers of disinformation. Speaking to anchor Boris Sanchez, who began the discussion by mentioning Musk’s decision to reinstate banned Twitter accounts earlier this week, Baer declared, ""Well Boris, I can tell you one thing, Putin is going to be all over Twitter."" He added, ""If there’s no regulations on this, fake accounts, spoofed accounts, the rest of it – this is a great opportunity for him. And so when he’s talking about the popular voice, Musk he’s really talking about Russian intelligence."" Since Musk’s announcement, several media outlets have reported on complaints that Musk’s reinstatement of previously banned accounts would make the platform a more dangerous place. An Axios piece from Thursday reported that ""activists"" are worried that the Tesla ’s will put ""lives at risk."" Many on the left are sounding the alarm about Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover. , Baer continued, stating, ""The Russians are waiting for something like this. They need a propaganda campaign against the United States and against our support for Ukraine, and they’re gonna be all over Twitter – I guarantee this – supporting the far right, plans, demands to stop arming Ukraine. You just wait."" Elsewhere in the interview, the anchor asked Baer how Twitter can counter ever more sophisticated means of spreading disinformation, to which the guest replied that the pre-Musk version of Twitter was able to handle the job. He said, ""Well that’s why the pre-Musk Twitter had 7000 people going through these accounts. You can pick ‘em out with algorithms, you can pick ‘em out by looking at ‘em. You can check s and the rest of it, and you simply block ‘em."" Baer then slammed Musk’s appeal to free speech, saying, ""And it’s not right. And you know, this freedom of speech is just nonsense, 'cause you can’t go into a movie theater and yell, ‘Fire!’ It’s against the law."" He then outlined Putin’s alleged strategy for the platform: ""What Putin’s gonna do, and the Russians, is they’re gonna use this as a vehicle to save himself in Ukraine. And you know, whether it’s gonna work or not, I don’t know. But we’re gonna see, as soon as these restrictions come off, we’re gonna see the Russians all over it.""

Gen. Keith Kellogg discusses developments in the war in Ukraine following Russia missile attacks compromising much of Ukraine’s power supply. President Biden's administration is scrambling to track the nearly $20 billion in military aid it has sent to Ukraine as Republicans warn of impending audits when they take control of the House in January. Likely future House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said his party will not be giving Ukraine a ""blank check"" to fend off Russia's invasion. A potential audit would determine how much, if any, of the U.S. aid is ending up in the wrong hands. The Biden administration's previous tracking efforts have inspected only a fraction of the aid provided to the country. The Republican push to ramp up oversight enjoys some bipartisan support in Congress. Some staunch Ukraine allies fear the party will cut off aid to the country entirely, however. Firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has vowed to ""hold our government accountable"" for Ukraine spending, and some of her colleagues across the aisle are echoing the message. ' ' President Joe Biden speaks in the State Dining Room of the White House, Friday, April 1, 2022, in Washington. ""The taxpayers deserve to know that investment is going where it's intended to go,"" Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., told the Washington Post. ""In any war, there can be missteps and misallocation of supplies."" : , The lawmakers agree that current monitoring efforts appear woefully inadequate, with the Biden administration inspecting just 10% of the 22,000 weapons the U.S. has provided to Ukraine between February and November 1, according to the Post. U.S. allies in Europe have expressed hope that Republican skepticism of Ukraine aid will not lead to a widespread cutting of funding, however. ""You’d be playing into Putin’s hands,"" U.K. Parliament member Tobias Ellwood said in October. ""If America pulls back, Putin could snatch victory from the jaws of defeat."" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy McCarthy has based his criticism of the aid packages on America's economic situation as the economy threatens to fall into a recession. ""I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,"" McCarthy said last month. ""They just won’t do it. … It’s not a free blank check."" A Ukrainian soldier stands one top of a destroyed Russian tank on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, March 31, 2022. ) Nevertheless, America's funding for Ukraine has been largely bipartisan under Biden, and many Republicans say there is no reason that funding cannot continue in some form. ""No one in Republican leadership has called for an end to aid for Ukraine,"" Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, said Monday.

The backlog of military aid to Taiwan has grown by more than $4 billion since the U.S. began its effort to support Ukraine's military in February, according to the Wall Street Journal. Russia's invasion of Ukraine already raised fears that China could use the opportunity to invade Taiwan, and the lessened support from the U.S. may only exacerbate the potential. The U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since February, so much that President Biden's administration is struggling to keep track of how the aid is being used. The volume of U.S. aid to the country has given rise to some skeptics within the Republican Party, who are calling for greater accountability. Congress is reportedly making an effort to shore up its support for Taiwan with a fast-tracked funding package aimed at making the island more readily prepared for an invasion than Ukraine was. G7 , A dog is seen in the middle of a street as Ukrainian army soldiers take part of a military sweep to search for possible remnants of Russian troops after their withdrawal from villages in the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, April 1, 2022. China has grown increasingly aggressive toward the self-governed island in recent years, conducting weeks of military exercises in an apparent simulation of an invasion this fall. Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned that Taiwan's reunification with mainland China is a top priority and has not ruled out using force to do so. , 11 , Taiwan first split from mainland China in 1949 after pro-democracy forces lost a civil war against the Chinese Communist Party. The democrats then fled to Taiwan and have governed themselves there for decades. Taiwan military forces conduct anti-landing drills during the annual Han Kuang military exercises near New Taipei City in Taiwan on Wednesday, July 27, 2022. A group of Japanese lawmakers including two former defense ministers met with Taiwan's president on Thursday in a rare high-level visit to discuss regional security. Nevertheless, China refuses to accept the island's independence, and uses its economic weight to pressure the world to do the same. The U.S. has long abided by its One China policy, which states that the U.S. acknowledges the government in Beijing as the true government of China. It also states that the U.S. will not hold formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. President Biden reacts as he walks to greet Chinese President Xi Jinping before a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit meeting, Monday, Nov. 14, 2022, in Bali, Indonesia. While the U.S. does not have a formal embassy in Taiwan, it has long had extensive trade ties with the island and delivered defense supplies. The U.S. has adopted a policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" regarding Taiwan and its relationship with China. Biden himself has vowed on four separate occasions that the U.S. would deploy its military to stop an invasion should one take place, but the White House has walked back his comments each time.",5

Jeanne Shaheen shuts down Cruz questions on Biden family corruption allegations,"During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee nominations hearing, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Ted Cruz got into a back-and-forth after Shaheen shut down Cruz's questions on President Biden's role in the 2016 firing of a top Ukrainian prosecutor. New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz got into a heated exchange Tuesday after Shaheen shut down Cruz's questions for an ambassador nominee concerning allegations that then Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire the country's top prosecutor in 2016. Cruz accused the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairwoman of ""covering"" for Biden after Shaheen prevented nominee George Kent from answering his questions during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Kent, who is Biden's choice to be the next ambassador to Estonia, had previously testified as a witness during former President Trump's first impeachment inquiry and told lawmakers that he raised concerns about Hunter Biden's lucrative service on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company – only to be rebuffed by the Biden administration. The gas company, Burisma Holdings, was under investigation in 2016 by Ukraine's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who himself faced allegations of corruption. In 2018, Biden admitted that while he was vice president, he pushed Ukrainian officials to fire Shokin by threatening to cancel $1 billion of loan guarantees. Cruz asked Kent, ""Do you think Joe Biden holding a billion dollars hostage to force the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor that is investigating the corrupt oligarch who's paying his son a million dollars a year? Did getting that prosecutor fired benefit that oligarch?"" ? - President Biden waves alongside his son Hunter Biden after attending Mass at Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Johns Island, South Carolina, on Aug. 13, 2022. However, before the nominee could answer, Shaheen intervened. ""Are you going to allow him to answer the question, Madam Chairman?"" Cruz asked. ""I am not going to allow him to answer the question,"" she replied. ""Why are you covering for the vice president? Do you not want to answer that question?"" Cruz followed up. Shaheen responded by saying she thought it was ""unfortunate"" that Cruz was putting Biden's ambassador nominees in ""uncomfortable"" positions. , : ‘ ’ Sen. Ted Cruz speaks during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., March 8, 2022. Cruz again accused Shaheen of covering for Biden. ""Was his testimony true or false that Biden did nothing to benefit the oligarch? Let him answer the question. Why are you afraid of him answering the question?"" ""I'm not,"" Shaheen said. ""I just want to move on."" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill, July 28, 2021. However, Cruz pushed for Kent to be allowed to answer his ""yes or no"" question, to which Shaheen finally assented. ""The prosecutor who was fired by the Ukrainian Parliament did nothing to investigate Zlochevsky and everything the Vice President Biden, the State Department and the U.S. Embassy did acted in good faith to reduce corruption and help the Ukrainians,"" Kent told Cruz. ""So firing him did not benefit the oligarch?"" Cruz asked, but Shaheen ended his time and moved on. ""You're protecting the president well,"" Cruz told her.",13

Sixty-two percent of respondents to a survey for the Reagan National Defense Forum expressed concern over politicization — a feeling shared by Republicans and Democrats. Half of respondents expressed concern over ""woke"" practices at the military — mostly Republicans — and 46% said that so-called far-right or extremist individuals serving in the military decreased their confidence in the armed forces. Woke practices in the military imposed by the Biden administration through diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives has sparked criticism from Republicans who say the policies decrease readiness. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, released a report in November that summarized some instances, including military members pushing critical race theory and anti-White views, and the government covering the costs of transgender surgeries for members of the armed services. By using technology developed by private companies, the Air Force says it saved time and manpower, and even saved nearly a million dollars of fuel per week. , '': The Biden administration has focused on ways to counter extreme views within the ranks of the military, in part as response to the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol. But a report from the administration titled ""Countering Extremist Activity Working Group"" later identified fewer than 100 cases of extremism from the 2.1 million active forces, a rate of .005%. American views on military Concerns over politicization of the military do not appear to have not impacted overall support. The survey found 81% of respondents trust the military — a three percent increase from last year. The military's support easily trumps that for Congress at 33%, the presidency at 40%, Supreme Court at 45%, and news media at 35%. Still, only 13% responded that they were willing to join the military. Military recruitment has slowed in recent years, with the Army missing its recruitment target by 25% this year. American views on China ' ' 36- China remains to be seen as the greatest threat to the nation, but concerns over Russia from respondents increased significantly as the war in Ukraine continues. Respondents who list China as their greatest threat dropped from 52% last year to 43% this year, with Russia jumping from 14% to 31%. American views on foreign enemies Americans want to continue to support Ukraine, according to the survey, which found 57% believe the U.S. should continue to stand for the country against Russian aggression and 33% believe the U.S. has too many issues at home to focus on the conflict. The issue shows a notable political divide, with 73 percent of Democrats favoring U.S. support for Ukraine and 51% of Republicans. $53M ’S U.S. financial aid to Ukraine, which is set to total more than $19 billion, is ""about the right amount,"" according to 39% of respondents.

2022-11-30,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-zelenskyy-yellen-bankman-fried-use-federal-investigations-celebrated,"TUCKER CARLSON: Zelenskyy, Yellen and Bankman-Fried could use federal investigations, but are celebrated","Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on the United States sending money to Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' We are going to start with a quiz. What do you have when you find Sam Bankman-Fried, Janet Yellen and President Zelenskyy of Ukraine all together in one room? A federal grand jury proceeding? That would be a good guess. Sam Bankman-Fried seems to have committed the biggest financial fraud in history. As the chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen bears direct responsibility for the destruction of the entire U.S. economy. President Zelenskyy, meanwhile, sits atop a money-laundering scheme so brazen that Democrats won't even allow it to be audited. So, yes, these are three people who could badly use a federal investigation, but they're not getting one. Instead, they're being celebrated, held up as uniquely fascinating people by The New York Times. In case you missed it, today was the annual DealBook Summit. That's a money-making event the newspaper advertises as a symposium with ""top business leaders."" Tickets went for $2,500 a piece. Sam Bankman-Fried, Janet Yellen and Volodymyr Zelenskyy were all there, apparently in their capacity as top business leaders. ""Thank you so very much!"" exclaimed the moderator, Andrew Ross Sorkin, when Sam Bankman-Fried finished speaking. ""Thank you, Sam Bankman-Fried, everybody,"" and with that, the audience applauded heartily. New York Times readers were clearly impressed by the Democratic mega-donor Sam Bankman-Fried, who also happens to be one of the most prolific thieves of all time, but whatever. He seemed like a nice kid. It was a pretty amazing display, but what's most interesting about an event like this is not what it tells us about the guests — at some point, history will render its judgment about them — but what it tells us about the people who invited the guests. If it's to treat Sam Bankman-Fried like just another naughty celebrity — ""Sam Bankman-Fried, everybody, applause, applause!"" — if you can do that, then who's off limits? Who's beyond the pale? Well, as it happens, The New York Times has spent the last few days telling us, delivering yet another hyperventilating lecture about who we're allowed to associate with and who we must avoid at all costs, and it really depends on political loyalty. - Some people, The New York Times has explained, have views that are so reprehensible these people are physically off limits. You cannot be in the same room with people like that. You can't talk to them. You can't ask them questions. Their opinions are like smallpox: communicable and deadly. These are the thought criminals and thought crimes are the only crimes that matter. Other crimes? Not such a big deal. Murder and rape and carjacking? As The New York Times has often told us, people who do those things are the victims of your racism, so they deserve compassion. So, by the way, do good liberals who stray outside the lines. Good liberals can always be forgiven, even when the things they've done are objectively very, very bad, like tanking the U.S. economy or stealing billions from investors and using it to buy Bahamian real estate or bringing the entire world to the brink of nuclear war and getting rich while you do it. Liberals can still do these things and you can still heartily applaud them because in the end, you know their hearts are in the right place. They believe the right things. With that in mind, it probably is not a surprise that no one at The New York Times bothered to ask Zelenskyy today where exactly all the money has gone. No one demanded an accounting of the billions of your tax dollars that seem to have disappeared into the pockets of Ukrainian oligarchs in tracksuits because asking would have been rude. He was our guest. So instead, The New York Times gave Zelenskyy an opportunity to demand much more of your money, which of course, he promptly took. : , : On Nov. 15, the Biden administration submitted a new aid request of $37.7 billion, which if passed, would bring the total amount that the U.S. has provided in assistance to $105.5 billion. We're going to be speaking with former Vice President Mike Pence a little bit later, and there has been a sentiment among Republicans who now control the House in the United States from Kevin McCarthy, who said there should not be a blank check. What do you tell them? : We are absolutely open and we are thankful for the assistance. It's not quite correct to speak about $100 billion as a value of the war for the United States. The value is lives of people. If Ukraine does not stand through this war, the war will spread into other territories and maybe even to other continents. For our people is the biggest value. Tell me how much our people cost. I don't know. "", so support me or Putin's going to invade Atlanta and by the way, you have no choice, because if you object to sending billions more to the very people who gave a no-show job to Hunter Biden, you're a bad person. You don't care about Ukrainian lives. You are a moral monster."" Now moral blackmail this crude does not typically work because nobody with self-respect would stand for it. What? ""Settle down, son. Get the Germans to pay for it. It's their continent."" That's what a normal person would say, someone who had self-respect. Unfortunately for the rest of us, Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas has no self-respect so he folded immediately and that matters because McCaul is the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. $2M : 'A ' Just in case that you imagine that throwing out Nancy Pelosi and electing a Republican Congress, a huge victory, would mean that somebody would push back against Joe Biden's lunatic and completely anti-American foreign policy priorities, oh, you were mistaken, because Michael McCaul just informed us that because we're good people and so is Zelenskyy, we're going to be sending Mr. Zelenskyy and his pals in tracksuits billions more of your money. : And I want to pick up where Col. Millburn left off. He believes that there should be longer-range weapons sent to Ukraine. Would you approve of that? . : 100%. He's absolutely correct. I mean, my criticism of this administration was before the invasion, we wouldn't put weapons in and since the invasion, we've slow-walked this process. We are going to provide more oversight, transparency and accountability. We're not going to write a blank check. Does that diminish our will to help the Ukrainian people fight? No, but we're going to do it in a responsible way and I think it's very important that the American people understand what's at stake here. - The U.S. Military — not Ukraine's military, our military, the one that's supposed to protect our country — is running out of equipment and manpower, but just so we're all clear about what Michael McCaul's priorities are, we're sending advanced weapons systems, yet more of them to Ukraine, and that's in addition to what we've already sent, which is bigger than the entire Russian military budget. If that's not insulting enough — and of course, the point of this is to insult you and to degrade you and to make you fully aware that your country's interests come last because you come last on the list of priorities — they're going farther than that. We've also decided to pay Ukraine's energy bills. Now, it's kind of odd that we're doing that at a time when we have our first real energy crisis since the mid-1970s, a manufactured crisis, but a crisis nevertheless, a crisis that is causing Americans to freeze in their homes because they can't afford heating oil. That means it's a perfect time to send energy to our friends in Ukraine and the whole region. Here's Tony Blinken. : I announced the United States will commit over $53 million to send equipment to help stabilize Ukraine's energy grid and keep Ukraine's power and electricity running. We've also submitted a request to Congress for $1.1 billion to secure Ukraine and Moldova's energy sector and restore their energy supply. O' $1M 'S - Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks about the launch initiative to support Afghan women during the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2022. Why is this continuing when, of course, Joe Biden could call Zelenskyy, who effectively works for him, I mean, a close family connection here, of course. His son worked in Ukraine. He could call Zelenskyy and say, you know, ""No más, get the money from Europe or let's wrap this thing up. People are dying. The rebuilding costs of this country are beyond what we can pay. This is really a dead end. Let's come to a settlement."" And of course, that could happen in about a week if they wanted it to, but they don't want that. They want the war to keep going. Why is that? Oh, because everyone's getting rich. The one thing you're not allowed to say is that, ""Hey, maybe we should stop this war,"" because, of course, the cash spigot would stop flowing and that's why at the DealBook Summit, the top business leader, Zelenskyy — in fact, he really is a top business leader if you want to be honest about it — went after Elon Musk because Elon Musk suggested maybe we should get a peace deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks with President Biden on Thursday, Aug. 25. : It seems that Elon began to change his opinion and we began to hear all kinds of appeals. I don't know if somebody is making an influence on him or he's making those choices himself. I always say very openly, if you want to understand what Russia has done here, come to Ukraine and you will see this with your own eyes, without any extra words, and after that, you will tell us how to end this war, who started it and when we can end it.",0

On the evening of Sept. 21, 1998, the 44-year-old, his wife Yelena Fedotova, 38, and their son Peter Pokhilko, 12, were found dead. The patriarch, a co-developer in the puzzle video game Tetris, appeared to have slashed his own throat. He was still clutching onto the hunting knife. A note was discovered nearby that read, ""I've been eaten alive. Vladimir. Just remember that I am exist. The davil."" Investigators ruled the tragedy as a murder-suicide. However, the case haunted Brown for decades, who insisted something more was at play. Family dinner in the Pokhilko apartment in Russia with Vlaidmir Pokhilko, left, Peter Pokhilko, little boy, visitor Kathy Hunter, and Yelena Fedotova, front of right, circa 1991. The case of the Pokhilko family is being explored in a new three-part docuseries premiering Monday on Investigation Discovery titled ""The Tetris Murders."" It features new interviews with the original homicide investigators who were on the scene, as well as loved ones, as they explore new theories that prove the brutal slayings are more complicated than once thought. ’S ‘ : ’: - ? ""I always felt that we didn’t get a clear answer to this crime from day one,"" Brown, a former tech investigator, told Fox News Digital. ""I did not think that Vladimir Pokhilko killed his family… I remember walking into that room when I slid past the sliding doors, which were already opened. And I looked at Vladimir laying on the ground, and I looked at the blood splatter on the door. I looked at the knife in his hand and I said to myself, ‘There’s no way this man cut his own throat.’"" ""The blood splatter wasn’t right,"" she shared. ""It was low. And for someone to cut their throat and get blood down there, they had to have been laying down near the door. His head was about six and a half feet away from the door and the knife was about 10 inches. There’s no way… I immediately thought that somebody held his head back to cut his throat. I knew it right then and there. I even told a colleague, ‘I don’t think he killed himself.’ That’s what I believed then and that’s what I believe now."" Yelena Fedotova appears on a local Cincinnati radio station to publicize her upcoming yoga event, circa 1994. The matriarch was a popular yoga instructor. Pokhilko, a psychologist-turned-entrepreneur, and his family immigrated to the U.S. in 1991 from the collapsing Soviet Union. He was described as a well-respected software engineer who was also the co-founder and president of AnimaTek. According to reports, the San Francisco-based company specialized in 3-D graphics software for computer animation used in games, architectural drawings and other products. His wife owned a popular yoga studio, and their son was in the seventh grade. The family was well-liked by the community. A concerned friend repeatedly tried reaching the family by phone. After not hearing from them, he headed to the home, where he stumbled upon the mutilated corpses, still in their pajamas. He frantically called the police. ‘ ’ ‘ A ,’ Brown said she was stunned that the case was closed so quickly. According to reports, a business associate insisted that Pokhilko was struggling with company woes partly brought on by the economic upheaval in Russia, where 70 of AnimaTek’s employees worked. The Santa Clara County coroner and a private forensic pathologist ruled Pokhilko’s death a suicide. Vladimir Pokhilko was a co-developer in Tetris, a puzzle game that became popular during the '80s. Initially, investigators looked into the possibility that an intruder could have committed the killings. However, they were later convinced that Pokhilko murdered his family and then took his life. They suspected the motive was possibly his business failings. ""There is no evidence to point us in any other direction,"" said Lieutenant Alana Forrest at the time, as quoted by San Francisco Gate. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Pokhilko appeared to have hit Fedotova and their son with a hammer before repeatedly stabbing them with a hunting knife as they lay sleeping. He then killed himself. ’S ‘I ’ ’S , : ‘ ’ ""Half of the team that was in that house believed [Pokhilko] killed himself,"" said Brown. ""And he wrote in that note that he was being eaten alive. When I read that note, it felt like it was in the third person. It felt like somebody else was trying to write it to me. It felt like somebody was trying to write it without understanding the use of English words properly. When I read it, I was thinking, ‘No, somebody else wrote this to make it look like Vladimir had written it.' But others from my team felt like he was under such distress that that’s why he wrote it that way… [But] it just didn’t seem like it would come from him."" Former tech investigator Sandra Brown said that several people are still afraid to discuss Vladimir Pokhilko's death decades later. According to Brown, several people are still afraid to talk about the case 24 years later. ""These people that we interviewed back in 1998 did not want their names mentioned in the documentary,"" she explained. ""We even changed their voices so that no one could recognize them. And I have empathy for their feelings because they’re still afraid… They don’t want to be tied to this case at all. They fear for themselves and their families because they think that Vladimir Pokhilko and his [family] were murdered as a message to others in this business… They would only speak under anonymity."" The quiet neighborhood was left shaken by the high-profiled tragedy. Many community members insisted that Pokhilko was a devoted family man and would not harm his wife or child. Several even speculated that Pokhilko may have been targeted by the Russian mafia. , : ‘ ’ Palo Alto Police Department officers conduct an impromptu conference at the scene on Ferne Avenue where three bodies were discovered in a home. Police would reveal little about the tragedy, but said they were looking into the possibility that it was a homicide-suicide. It was later revealed that Vladimir Pokhilko murdered his wife Yelena Fedotova and 12-year-old son Peter Pokhilko before taking his own life. During the filming of the docuseries, a producer handed Brown documents from the case. Brown said she was stunned by what she read. ""When I saw the name on the subpoena, it was from the , the Russian Racketeering Unit out in San Francisco,"" Brown recalled. ""When I saw that, I looked at her. I even asked her, ‘Are we rolling right now?’ Because that was the first time I had seen that, and that validated what I was feeling all those years ago, that something about Russia was involved in this case. Why was the looking at our case from a racketeering unit? We didn’t know about that then."" ""I’ve worked with the before – I have nothing negative to say about them,"" she continued. ""But I thought it was odd that they had this subpoena the next day. They had a full-fledge subpoena for his documents the day after we got the case… And the pathologist ruled that this was a homicide-suicide. After two autopsies, the case was closed. I didn’t feel like we had a double homicide-suicide. I felt like we had a triple homicide back then. But we go with the science… But it always bothered me… I just don’t think it happened the way the pathologist said. In ""The Tetris Murders,"" Sandra Brown reexamines new theories surrounding the shocking deaths of Vladimir Pokhilko and his family. ""… Someone told a colleague of mine that the old Soviet Union flag had a hammer and a sickle. When you look at the tools that were used in this crime, a claw hammer and a knife, some of the community members just felt this was a clue or a message. This whole Russian mob idea started coming from the community members who knew the family, who said that they didn’t think [Pokhilko] would do this."" ‘ ’ : 'A A ' Brown, who has been retired for 10 years, said the case has never left her mind. Despite her theories, Brown suspects that she will never get closure. ""I think all the parties who may have been involved are deceased,"" she said. ""The case was closed and the evidence was destroyed. So we can’t go back and look at that. I tried… Possibly, the people who may have committed this crime [if they’re still alive] are no longer in this country. We have no , no fingerprints, or anything… I don’t think we can solve it."" Classmates of Peter Pokhilko rode their bicycles to visit a makeshift memorial in front of the Pokhilko residence on Ferne Avenue in Palo Alto, California, on Sept. 23, 1998. The memorial was left by Peter's classmates the day after his body was found. There is a reason Brown said she has not been able to walk away from the case despite it being closed. ""I saw this baby’s face and I remember feeling when I walked into the house that he was there and he was confused,"" said Brown about Pokhilko’s son. ""… When we work these cases and we see these families destroyed, we take a little bit of that with us. It stays with you for the rest of your life. We just don’t forget about it… This case was tough because a child was murdered in such a heinous way. This appeared to be a good family. And for 24 years, people thought this man murdered this family."" 'S ' ' : 'A ' Today, Brown hopes the docuseries will show audiences how her team was determined to seek answers. She is still adamant that Pokhilko was murdered. The brutal deaths of Vladimir Pokhilko, 44, his wife Yelena Fedotova, 38, and his son Peter left the quiet community of Palo Alto, California, shaken. ""Even though this case was closed… we still have our personal feelings about it,"" she said. ""Hopefully, people will see that we didn’t give up. Not that we can finish it and solve [this case]. But at least the question is there. That’s what’s important."" ""The Tetris Murders"" premieres on Monday, Dec. 5 at 9 p.m. on .",6

""This is what happens when you have a fashion designer, such as Valentin Yudashkin develop Russian military uniform,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former intelligence officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital. Koffler's comments come after reports surfaced Sunday indicating that Russian forces have had trouble combating cooling temperatures with gear and clothing ill-suited for winter combat. ""For the Russian troops, there is now quite significant evidence of ill-equipped, particularly recruits getting...even in the training camps, dying of hypothermia,"" security expert Robert Fox said during an interview over the weekend, according to The 's Daily Express newspaper. ""That is really quite something. Inadequate sleeping bags, inadequate clothing and suffering from the cold. They find it difficult fighting in the cold but the fighting is going on."" A Russian soldier stands guard at the Luhansk power plant in the town of Shchastya. The struggle with cold temperatures could not have come at a worse time for Russian troops, who have faced fierce resistance and multiple counter-offensives from Ukrainian forces that have stalled the country's progress. According to Koffler, the problem Russia now faces can be traced back to the military's transition from the Soviet-era, pointing out that Yudashkin actually used to be a designer for former Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s wife Raisa Gorbacheva. ""Russian soldiers dying from hyperthermia in winter is nothing new,"" Koffler said. ""Unlike the Soviet Army uniforms that were designed for severe Russian winters, modern Russian military uniform is not optimized for freezing temperatures."" Instead, the 1994 rebranding of the Russian military caused ""dismay"" among the troops, with designs that ""prioritized style and low cost rather than pragmatism and functionality."" ' ' , ' A ' The Russian military. ""Instead of using natural textiles like cotton, linen, and heavy and coarse wool, synthetic materials were used, which kept the soldiers cold in winter and hot in summer,"" Koffler said. ""Bulky and baggy style was replaced with fitted styles. Traditional Russian footwear made of felt, valenki, which was worn by military and civilians for hundreds of years was banned by the post-Soviet military leadership."" The winter conditions could also be hindering Russia's ability to use drones the country's military recently purchased from Iran, with The Express reporting Monday that Russia has stopped deploying the Iranian-built Shahed-136 drone in Ukraine because the parts are inadequate to function in the winter temperatures. ""I believe that it is decreasing, because any aircraft, which are drones, are made of plastic and of such materials that are sensitive to frost and weather conditions,"" Yevgeny Silkin, the speaker of the Joint Forces Command for Strategic Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told the outlet. Silkin said that drones, which have been used near population centers and caused heavy casualties in recent months, have not been detected in almost a month. Firefighters work after a drone attack on buildings in Kyiv, Ukraine, Oct. 17, 2022. However, Koffler was skeptical of the notion that the drones would not work in winter, arguing that they are made ""almost exclusively ""with Western parts and should be designed to function regardless of weather conditions."" ""Even if these drones are not optimized for freezing temperatures, they could still cause injury and death when targeting populated areas, which is what the Russians are doing,"" Koffler said. ""Russian war-fighting strategy emphasizes psychological pressure on civilians, in order to have them place pressure on Ukrainian leadership to stop the suffering inflicted on them by the Russian forces.""",22

Will she stand for the anthem now that she's back in the USA?,"The panel reacted to the Brittney Griner prisoner swap and the Biden administration's failure to secure Paul Whelan's release. In July 2020, amid the George Floyd protests sweeping across the nation, star Brittney Griner vowed not to take the court during the national anthem for the entire season. With the much-welcomed news that the Biden administration has secured her release from a Russian prison, in exchange for notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, it is reasonable to ask if Griner will commit to no longer protesting the anthem of the country that secured her freedom. Despite the insistence by some on the left that America is systemically racist and homophobic, the entire country had the back of the Black and lesbian basketball legend, everyone was pulling for her and her family, and for almost a year the pressure to get her out of Russia came from all corners of society. The absurd nine-year sentence that Griner received for possession of a few canisters of cannabis oil appeared to be a clear effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to gain leverage, and it seems to have worked. In exchange for her, the U.S. sent back to Russia one of the world’s deadliest arms dealers who was serving 25 years for crimes including the targeting of American citizens. While some Republicans argue Biden should have gotten more out the deal, specifically the freedom of former Marine Paul Whelan, we can all agree that the U.S. paid a real price for Griner’s release, not just by putting Bout back in the killing game, but also by sending a message to other foreign dictators that absconding with American citizens can be a powerful bargaining chip. That is a very real danger. star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is escorted from a court room ater a hearing in Khimki, just outside Moscow, on Aug. 4, 2022.

Brittany Griner is escorted by police before her hearing in Russia. But Griner is an American, one of our own, and as a nation we have decided that whatever the risks of releasing Bout, the priority was her freedom. Speaking of freedom, one of our greatest freedoms is the right to protest. Griner and every American can and should protest if they see injustice, such as abuses of police power against Blacks or anyone. But by making the national anthem the symbol of that protest, Griner painted the whole of America as the source of these abuses. The same America that has now sacrificed so that she may come home. This summer, Griner penned a handwritten note to President Biden, which included the following: ""On the 4th of July our family normally honors the service of those who have fought for our freedom, including my father, who was a Vietnam War veteran. It hurts thinking about how I usually celebrate this day because freedom means something completely different to me this year."" Indeed. Brittney Griner is not being asked to pay a debt to her country for the deal that ended her torment. It’s simply what America does for Americans. But perhaps going forward, when she chooses to fight social injustice she can remember that the United States is not just a place where injustice exists — what country doesn’t have that?

Former US Marine left behind in Brittney Griner-Viktor Bout exchange,"Fox News’ Greg Palkot reports on the status of U.S. efforts to bring home player Brittney Griner and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan. The United States government completed a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday after months of negotiations that resulted in the release of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for American women's basketball athlete Brittney Griner but left behind former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan. Initially, the Biden administration had sought to release both Griner and Whelan for the notorious ""Merchant of Death,"" who has served 11 years of a 25-year conviction, but the Kremlin gave the U.S. the option of only Griner's return or no deal at all. The female athlete was arrested in Russia in February 2022 after airport officials discovered cannabis oil contained in her vape cartridges. The grounds for Whelan's arrest remain dubious, with different accounts from U.S. and Russian authorities. Whelan has been in Russian custody for nearly four years, convicted on charges of espionage and spying for the U.S. government and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Whelan and the U.S. have denied the charges as the 52-year-old remains imprisoned at a labor camp in Russia's Mordovia republic. Whelan's family congratulated Griner for gaining her freedom but criticized the Biden administration for leaving Whelan behind for the second time during a prisoner exchange. , 'S ' ' ? Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was arrested for alleged spying, was convicted in a Russian court on June 15, 2020. ""She will be reunited with her family. Brittney is free. And Paul is still a hostage. But how many more times do I need to write that?"" David Whelan, Paul's brother, wrote in a statement on Thursday. ""Despite the possibility that there might be an exchange without Paul, our family is still devastated. I can't even fathom how Paul will feel when he learns. Paul has worked so hard to survive nearly 4 years of this injustice."" On Dec. 28, 2018, while staying in a hotel in the Moscow area, Whelan was arrested by the Russian Federal Security Service. At the time, Whelan had reportedly arrived in the Russian capital to attend the wedding for a friend and act as a travel guide for the groom's family. However, Russian officials claimed that Whelan had met with an unnamed Russian citizen who gave the former Marine a drive containing classified material. At the time, Whelan resided officially in Michigan, working as a corporate security executive for auto-parts manufacturer BorgWarner. Whelan had reportedly used his position to connect with law enforcement across different countries and had official citizenship outside the U.S. with Ireland and the United Kingdom. After serving in Iraq, he was dishonorably discharged from the Marine Corps for larceny and other poor conduct-related charges. Whelan's brother, David, said he was able to enter Russia using his U.S. passport and planned to leave the country on a flight from Saint Petersburg on Jan. 6, 2019. Russian news agencies also claimed Whelan had $80,000 in cash temporarily confiscated during an airport customs inspection. Previously, Whelan had been left behind in another prisoner exchange that took place in April during the prisoner transfer for Russian citizen Konstantin Yaroshenko and imprisoned U.S. citizen Trevor Reed. The U.S. government at the time had reportedly not informed Whelan's family that he would not be included in the exchange. The Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that advocates for U.S. citizens wrongfully detained in foreign countries, also criticized both the former and current presidential administrations for not securing Whelan's release in the last four years. — President Biden vowed to continue negotiations with the Russian government to return Paul Whelan back to the United States. ""Paul Whelan has been let down and left behind at least three times by 2 Presidents,"" said the organization in a statement. ""He deserves better from his government, and our Campaign implores President Biden to urgently secure Paul's immediate return using all tools available."" Vladimir Zherebenkov, Whelan's attorney based in Russia, expressed disappointment that Whelan was not included in the release but said choosing Griner was the ""more humane"" option because his client was in the military while the athlete was an Olympic champion. Zherebenkov also told the press that negotiations to free Whelan would continue and hopes another exchange could see his client freed in the next few months. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden said Russia is treating negotiations over Whelan differently for ""illegitimate reasons"" and vowed to continue negotiations for his release, adding, ""We have not forgotten about Paul Whelan.""",18

President Biden makes ""no apologies"" for releasing ""Merchant of Death"" Viktor Bout in exchange for star Brittney Griner on Thursday, despite critics who say it was a poor deal. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended the exchange to skeptical reporters during Thursday's briefing, saying the options were to either secure Griner's release or no one's. Critics have argued that Bout remains a dangerous man and was too great a prize to give to Russia. ""This was someone who had conspired to sell -47s that he knew would have been used to kill Americans — American drug agents. Law enforcement officials may not be happy with his release. What is the president's message to them and to others who say essentially that this was a bad deal?"" a reporter asked. Jean-Pierre acknowledged that immediate results in prisoner exchanges can feel ""unfair or arbitrary"" but ultimately defended the White House decision.

""The president felt a moral obligation to bring Brittney home. There was an opportunity to do that, and it was either Brittney or no one at all, and we are not going to apologize for that,"" Jean-Pierre said, adding officials would continue to negotiate the release of U.S. Marine veteran Paul Whelan. Whelan has been in Russian custody the past four years and has 12 years of hard labor left on his espionage sentence. Fox News' White House correspondent Peter Doocy later pressed Jean-Pierre on why the deal appeared to be so lopsided in favor of Russia. ""In this prisoner swap, why did Russia get such a better deal?"" Doocy asked. ""Here were our choices. Our choices were Brittney or no one at all — bringing home one American or no American at all,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""They gave up a professional athlete. We gave up a prolific arms dealer who was convicted of trying to kill Americans, who was called the 'Merchant of Death,'"" Doocy countered. Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine accused of espionage and arrested in Russia in December 2018, stands inside a defendants' cage as he waits to hear his verdict in Moscow on June 15, 2020. ""The professional athlete is also an American citizen. So let's not forget that,"" Jean-Pierre responded. ""Paul Whelan is also an American citizen. We can do this all day,"" Doocy said. Jean-Pierre said Biden would do everything in his power to secure Whelan's release, though Doocy pressed about how he could do that while refusing to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""We are still working to secure Paul Whelan. At this time, we were not able to make that happen, but that does not stop us. That will not stop us in making sure that Paul returns back home safely to his family,"" Jean-Pierre said, adding that negotiations take place through ""other channels"" than Biden himself. Whelan's brother, David Whelan, congratulated Griner on her release in a statement Thursday but lamented the Biden administration's failure to release his brother. ""There is no greater success than for a wrongful detainee to be freed and for them to go home. The Biden administration made the right decision to bring Ms. Griner home, and to make the deal that was possible, rather than waiting for one that wasn't going to happen,"" David Whelan wrote. ""She will be reunited with her family. Brittney is free. And Paul is still a hostage. But how many more times do I need to write that?"" he added. ""Despite the possibility that there might be an exchange without Paul, our family is still devastated. I can't even fathom how Paul will feel when he learns.

Former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials who were involved in the effort to bring ""Merchant of Death"" Viktor Bout to justice have characterized his trade to Russia for star Brittney Griner's freedom as a ""disgrace"" and a ""grave threat"" to U.S national security. Griner, who has been held prisoner in Russia since February, was released Thursday with applause from Biden administration officials. But former officials had previously spoken out against trading Bout, a convicted Russian arms dealer, for her release, and at least one former special agent in charge, Derek Maltz, condemned the news as a ""blow to the rule of law."" ""Americans should be very careful traveling around the world. This decision has put Americans at a huge risk,"" Maltz tweeted Thursday, calling Bout's arrest a ""total disgrace.""

It would also pose a grave threat to the national security of the United States and its allies,"" Braun wrote. He explained that Bout was a former Russian intelligence officer who entered into the arms trade in the 1990s. ""By 2003, he had become the world’s pre-eminent arms trafficker, flooding weapons to U.S.-designated terrorist organizations, insurgent groups, narcotics cartels, and rogue regimes all over the world,"" Braun wrote.

""He did particular damage in Africa, where insurgent and terrorist groups slaughtered hundreds of thousands of innocents with his weapons, depicted in the Nicolas Cage film Lord of War. Weapons that Bout sold to the Taliban were used against U.S. and forces in Afghanistan."" The U.S. government targeted Bout with sanctions in 2004 and in 2006 instructed the to seek his arrest under counter-narcoterrorism laws. Two years later, executed a sting operation in partnership with Thai police that saw Bout arrested in Bangkok. He was convicted based on explicit statements he had made conspiring to sell weapons, including man-portable surface-to-air missiles, to be used against U.S. personnel in Columbia, declaring he had been ""fighting the United States … for 10 to 15 years."" Braun predicted that if released, Bout could become a Russian asset, ""planning and executing clandestine supply missions in support of Russian proxies like the Wagner Group in Africa, Venezuela, and other hot spots."" ""Trading Bout would also encourage Moscow and other rogue regimes to take Americans hostage, exacerbating the precedent set by Biden’s exchange of Russian-held American Trevor Reed for another U.S.-imprisoned Russian criminal earlier this year,"" Braun warned. ""We can expect Moscow to double down on taking Americans hostage to trade for the Russian cybercriminals—who also often moonlight for Russian intelligence—extradited to the United States by allied countries.""

""Just like Brittney’s family, Marc’s family knows the horrors of having their loved one detained in a foreign country, put through an unjust trial despite all legal efforts, and slammed with an unreasonably long sentence during the worst diplomatic relations between Russia and America in decades,"" Sasha Phillips, lawyer for the family of Marc Fogel, told Fox News Digital. She said ""they were pleased to hear of Brittney’s return and were encouraged that her freedom was secured through diplomatic actions."" Fogel was arrested in Aug. 2021 for trying to enter Russia with about half an ounce of medical marijuana he had been prescribed in the U.S. for chronic pain. After an endless wait for his trial, Fogel found himself charged with 14 years in prison for drug possession. Russian authorities sent him out to a hard-labor prison colony, at which point his family lost track of him. U.S. officials have argued that Fogel does not count as ""wrongfully detained,"" and thus does not qualify for a prisoner swap without explaining why. Fogel's lawyer said the family are ""disappointed that Marc remains in Russia to serve his exorbitant sentence for possessing less than an ounce of medical marijuana,"" she continued. ""The family was also disheartened to not hear Marc’s name mentioned along with Paul Whelan’s in President Biden’s promise to bring other wrongfully detained Americans home during his press conference,"" on Thursday. . : ‘’ , ‘ ’ U.S. officials secured Griner’s release 10 months after Russian police arrested her on charges of drug possession for vape cartridges containing oils derived from cannabis. Her arrest, which occurred in the weeks building up to the invasion of Ukraine, became a ""cause celebre"" as the Biden administration put significant effort into securing her release. Biden announced Griner’s release with a tweet that included pictures of him in the Oval Office with Vice President Kamala Harris and Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, saying ""She is safe. She is on a plane. She is on her way home."" The Fogel family is happy to see Griner ""free, safe and on her way to reunite with her family,"" according to Phillips, and they hope that the success of Griner's release can provide ""momentum"" for the U.S. to push for the release of other Americans, including Marc Fogel. ""This is important because Marc’s health continues to deteriorate without the proper medical care that is required in his condition - Marc has a substantial medical history of spinal disease, which requires continuous monitoring, regular doctor visits and access to adequate emergency services,"" Philips explained. From left to right: Marc Fogel, Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan However, Griner's release came at the cost of Viktor Bout, a Russian prisoner known as the ""Merchant of Death."" Authorities finally arrested Bout in 2008 through a joint sting operation between U.S. authorities, Interpol and the Kingdom of Thailand. Bout worked as an arms dealer, sometimes supplying both sides of a conflict to make money. Some critics argue that the trade of Griner for Bout ended up incredibly lopsided and painted a dangerous picture for Russia and other countries who might see celebrities detained on trumped-up charges as perfect bargaining chips for valuable political prisoners. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-, has worked with the State Department to secure Fogel's release and lamented the fact that the Pittsburgh native was not even mentioned by the Biden administration when discussing Griner's release. He called it ""laughable"" for the U.S. to have completed a ""one-to-one"" trade of Griner for Bout when considering the crimes Bout committed, and that the U.S. has ""lost all leverage"" in other deals. ""We've got to remember that Viktor Bout has the blood of Americans on his hands,"" Reschenthaler said. ""This is a guy that sold weapons and arms to people who use those weapons to kill Americans, and he was an arms smuggler all over the world selling arms to both sides of certain conflicts, leading to tens of thousands of lives lost."" ""So we're now trading that guy for one person. That is laughable. That's outrageous,"" the congressman stressed. A National Security Council spokesperson told Fox News Digital that officials have focused on how to bring Americans home as ""Russia and other countries have already been willing to wrongfully detain U.S. citizens."" Marc Fogel, right, with his family ""The Biden Administration has expanded the toolkit the U.S. government can use to do that, including the ability to impose serious costs and consequences such as sanctions and visa bans on governments and non-state actors who are involved in hostage-takings and wrongful detentions,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the State Department has started indicating travel risks for countries that engage in this practice. ""As the use of wrongful detentions and hostage diplomacy continues around the globe, it's clear the U.S. government needs to be more assertive,"" David Whelan, the brother of former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan who has remained in Russian custody since 2018, said in a statement following Griner’s release. ""If bad actors like Russia are going to grab innocent Americans, the U.S. needs a swifter, more direct response, and to be prepared in advance."" , 'S ‘ ’ ? Rebekah Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, told Fox News Digital that Americans who remain jailed in Russia usually do not have the same pipeline to freedom that Griner enjoyed. ""Life in any Russian prison is miserable, but conditions in a hard labor camp are inhumane,"" Koffler explained. ""The prisoners live in crowded barracks that sometimes house 50-60 prisoners, food is inedible and unsanitary conditions overall."" ""Brittney Griner was likely treated well because she is a celebrity, she was not physically abused,"" she said. ""The guards likely got special instructions to keep her safe as she was a bargaining chip for Putin, [but] Marc Fogel an ordinary American, a teacher, doesn’t have as much value for the Russians. He is probably not getting any special treatment and protections from abuse by fellow prisoners."" Alleged Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, right, walks past temporary cells ahead of a hearing at the Criminal Court in Bangkok on August 20, 2010. Koffler speculated that Fogel was not included in the Griner-Bout swap for two reasons, mainly that the Russians wanted a one-to-one swap for ""optics"" and to avoid setting any precedent; and second to keep others like Fogel and Whelan ""in reserves"" for another swap. ""Victor Bout has extremely high value for Russia, as a operative with direct links to Putin himself, but Fogel's value is not zero either, by virtue of him being an American,"" Koffler argued. ""The Russians use hostage diplomacy as a form of statecraft. They know it works, and President Biden just proved that it works. Biden caved to Putin to score political points.""

Brittney Griner is the clear winner in Thursday’s stunning prisoner swap of the star for arms dealer Viktor Bout. But America has paid a high price and the costs to foreign policy could add up for years. Here are the other big winners in Brittney Griner’s release: Putin, Saudi Arabia, Viktor Bout, and the Biden political machine. The losers? Current Russian hostage Paul Whelan and the people of Ukraine. And America’s long-term reputation. Let me say upfront that I’m glad to see an American coming home at Christmas time. No question, Putin used Griner for propaganda purposes. Until this year, stars played in Ekaterinburg, Russia for years and got treatment. Many Americans regard vaping cannabis as less serious than a parking ticket. Even Whelan, who is still in prison in Russia, had the grace to say he was glad to see Griner freed. It’s how President Biden did it and the long-term ramifications that bother me. The Biden administration compromised big time, especially by leaving Whelan behind, and letting Bout out of jail. First and foremost, this is a win for Putin. Griner means nothing to Putin. In his eyes, she is just an American, female athlete. . 'S ? Bringing Bout back at a low price will show Putin is clever in the eyes of his cronies in Moscow and sadly, it will demonstrate to the Russian people that Putin is still well and truly in charge. He remains a major international player who has just pulled a fast one on Biden. Worse still is setting the precedent of hostage ""diplomacy"" through this negotiation. It’s a dangerous world out there and maybe more bad guys will decide they can cash in on wrongful detention of a high-profile American female. What really stinks is Putin’s barbaric war in Ukraine. It was painful to see the State Department working to get Brittney Griner back, when civilians in Ukraine are dying at Putin’s hands and nuclear tensions are high. Viktor Bout was an awfully big prize to give up. The Drug Enforcement Agency nabbed him in 2008 and Manhattan U.S. Attorney described Bout as ""international arms trafficking enemy number one for many years, arming some of the most violent conflicts around the globe"" when he was locked up for good in 2012. . : '' , ' ' Right now, Iran and North Korea are selling weapons to Russia to use in Ukraine, so they’ll be happy to see how Putin sticks up for arms merchants. Griner’s release is a win for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, too. It turns out that maybe Biden was talking to him about something other than oil. The Crown Prince wants to raise Saudi Arabia’s international profile, and he scored points brokering a deal with Russia and the U.S., and one that was announced just after a visit from Xi Jinping. For Putin, the Saudi angle was crucial, and it should have given the U.S. more leverage. Remember Putin also wants Saudi Arabia to limit production of oil and there are other factors like Europe’s Russian oil price cap and the general energy market chaos to consider. Giving the Crown Prince a diplomatic success was also easy for Putin and will help keep up Russia’s status amongst the oil merchants of + regardless of whatever happens in Ukraine.

The bottom line is that Biden cranked up diplomacy to get Griner out during the worst Russia crisis in decades – and Biden will benefit with his voter base. The Whelan negotiations ""are not back to square one"" claimed National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby today. But the raw fact is Biden prioritized Griner, and her release will give him an ongoing political pay-off. Yes, I’d say Biden’s running in 2024.",18

""I think there is a concern that he would return to doing the same kind of work that he's done in the past, a senior Defense official said. Bout was in the middle of serving a 25-year prison sentence in a U.S. prison for several offenses, including conspiring to kill Americans, when he was freed. Griner was arrested at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow on Feb. 17 after Russian authorities said she had vape cartridges with cannabis oil inside her luggage. 'S : ' ' Convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout walks past temporary cells ahead of a hearing at the Criminal Court in Bangkok on August 20, 2010. The Pentagon voiced concerns about Bout going back into arms dealing after being released in a prisoner exchange for Brittney Griner. On Aug. 4, she was given a nine-year sentence after pleading guilty, arguing that she had been prescribed cannabis for her pain and inadvertently packed it. Her sentence was upheld in October, and she was later transferred to a penal colony. Bout, a former Soviet military officer known as the ""Merchant of Death,"" spent years supplying weapons to dictators and to conflicts across the world, sometimes supplying both sides. ""If I didn’t do it, someone else would,"" he told the New Yorker in 2012. He carried out his dealings with a fleet of cargo airplanes that transported arms and military equipment to various parts of the world, including Africa, South America, and the Middle East, according to a 2010 Justice Department indictment.

""Nothing could be further from the truth, and we cannot ignore that releasing Bout back into the world is a deeply disturbing decision,"" he said. ""We must stop inviting dictatorial and rogue regimes to use Americans overseas as bargaining chips, and we must try to do better at encouraging American citizens against traveling to places like Russia where they are primary targets for this type of unlawful detention.""

Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul's case differently than Brittney,"" he added, vowing to keep working to bring Whelan home, too. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre echoed the president’s position and said, ""Unfortunately, the choice became to either bring Britteny home or no one."" , 'S ' ' ?

""We didn’t set the task to move from those talks to something else, but they do create a certain atmosphere."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov echoed the sentiment and said, ""It has no impact on the overall state of bilateral ties."" However, Rebekah Koffler, a Russia expert and former intelligence officer for Russian Doctrine & Strategy, warned that the trade will likely have greater geopolitical repercussions. ""Putin wants to capitalize on what he, his regime, and the Russian people [see] as a big ‘win,'"" she said, explaining that Bout, a former intelligence officer, has ties to Putin through his former operative days. ""Bout is not an ordinary rogue actor. He is linked to Putin himself through Igor Sechin, a former operative, current of Rosneft and one of the most influential people in Putin’s circle,"" Koffler detailed. ""Bout will likely be playing a major role in the Russia-Ukraine war now."" Koffler said the Kremlin may look to Bout’s former experience as an international arms dealer to help Russia with its dwindling supplies in the war against Ukraine. ""He is a huge fish, a high value asset for Putin, compared to Griner,"" she added, telling Fox News Digital that Putin also ""wants to show to the U.S. that he can be dealt with on a transactional basis, as long as he gets a deal on his terms.""

Some are specifically questioning why Marine veteran Paul Whelan was not freed. One such critic is former President Donald Trump who called the deal ""stupid"" and ""unpatriotic"" in a post on Truth Social. Paul's brother David Whelan hit back at President Trump for his comments, arguing his attitude is ""disappointing"" from a former president. ""I think that what President Biden did was to take care of an American who was in peril and bring home the American that he could bring home. So it's disappointing that a former president would have that sort of perspective,"" Whelan said. ? - Whelan also added that ""all Americans should be happy"" Griner has been freed from wrongful detention, congratulating the player and her family on her release. star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is escorted from a court room ater a hearing, in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, Aug. 4, 2022.

In 2018, while President Trump was in office, the Marine veteran was arrested and convicted on charges of espionage and spying for the U.S. government, facing up to 16 years in prison. David Whelan called out President Trump for his ""disappointing"" perspective on the deal since his administration was unable to free Paul. ""My brother pleaded from his prison for President Trump to tweet about him during President Trump's term in office, and President Trump didn't,"" Whelan said on ""Cavuto Live"" Saturday.

""The U.S. government was not engaged in Paul's case for the first two years, and not all of that is President Trump's fault. I think the government wasn't prepared to deal with wrongful detentions by nation states. They were still focused on terrorist groups and hostages, the old-fashioned sort of approach,"" David Whelan said. - The Brittney Griner-Viktor Bout swap is the second time Paul Whelan has been left during the Biden administration. The first instance came in April 2022 when Marine veteran Trevor Reed was swapped for Russian drug trafficker Konstantin Yaroshenko.

Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, tweeted out his thoughts, demanding an answer from the Biden administration on why Paul Whelan was excluded from the deal. ""This was likely not a simple ‘choose him or her’ situation. But if it was, you choose the guy that served our country, Paul Whelan.

Despite his own frustration with his brother's wrongful detention and continued plea to see Paul freed, Whelan called on leadership to ""fix the problem rather than complain."" ""Doing something to bring them home is a good first step. And if the people who are in power in Congress or in the agencies in the U.S. government don't like that, then they should come up with ways to fix it,"" he said. ‘ ’ David Whelan has been vocal about the government developing better policy for handling Americans wrongfully detained in hostage diplomacy. He continues to press for his brother's release. ""I think we're starting to see, again, that evolution of more decisions being made, more confidence in trying new things, more attempts to be creative,"" Whelan said. ""They're not all going to work. But if they bring Americans home, I think that that's a good thing."" ""Paul's case wasn't in front of or behind Britney's case, it was beside.

Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, who fled to the United Arab Emirates and welcomed Griner on the tarmac, relayed his conversations with Griner during an appearance on ’s ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""It’s always kind of an exciting moment when you jump on the other country’s plane and walk up to a person and, in this case, Brittney. And I’ll tell you what I told her, ‘Brittney, my name is Ambassador Roger Carstens. I’m with the U.S. Department of State. And on behalf of the President of the United States, Joe Biden, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken, I’m here to take you home,’"" Carstens told host Dana Bash. ""And at that moment, I think every person starts to realize that it’s going to happen – it’s setting in. Certainly, Brittney felt that way."" ""When she finally got onto the U.S. plane. I said, ‘Brittney, you must have been through a lot over the last ten months. Here's your seat. Please feel free to decompress. We'll give you your space.’ And she said, ‘Oh, no. I've been in prison for ten months now, listening to Russian. I want to talk. But first of all, who are these guys?’"" Carstens said. ""And she moved right past me and went to every member on that crew, looked them in the eyes, shook their hands and asked about them, got their names. Making a personal connection with them. It was really amazing.""

Griner was arrested in February before Russia invaded Ukraine for bringing in vape cartridges containing oils derived from cannabis through a Moscow airport as she was returning to the country to play for a basketball league. ""I was left with the impression that this is an intelligent, passionate, compassionate, humble, interesting person, a patriotic person, but above all, authentic,"" Carstens said. ""I hate the fact that I had to meet her in this manner, but I actually felt blessed having had a chance to get to know her."" Asked what Griner said of her 10-month ordeal being held in a Russian penal colony, Carstens said he ""would hate to steal her thunder"" in relaying too much of her story but that she spoke at length about the experience. Regarding her physical health, Carstens said Griner ""looks fantastic"" and was ""full of energy"" on her plane ride back to the United States. She is now at Fort Sam Houston undergoing medical evaluation at the major U.S. Army installation but ""seems to be just fine,"" Carstens added. ""What's that like to be the person to shake someone's hand and welcome them back to America after they've been wrongly held?"" Bash asked Carstens.

""It's humbling. It's I'm very grateful that President Biden allows me a chance to do this job. It's also a painful job,"" he responded. ""So when you get the chance to shake someone's hands, it's one of those rare moments that you get to celebrate a victory. But know this, even as we're welcoming someone home, we still have work to do. So as I'm shaking Brittney's hands and we're taking to the aircraft and having this great conversation, my brain is already thinking about Paul Whalen. What can we do to get him back? What's our next move? What's the strategy? How can we adapt?"" Carstens defended the swap despite criticism from Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who argued trading Griner for Bout incentivizing bad actors to kidnap Americans. Despite frustration, the trade wasn’t secured for former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan instead, the diplomat said the Biden administration is still actively working to return Whelan home. basketball player Brittney Griner, who was sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony in August for drug smuggling, is seen on a screen via a video link from a remand prison during a court hearing to consider an appeal against her sentence, at the Moscow regional court on October 25, 2022. ""I talked to him on Friday, the day after the swap. And here's what I told him,"" Carstens said. ""I said, ‘Paul, you have the commitment of this president, the president's focus, the Secretary of State's focused. I'm certainly focused. And we're going to bring you home.’ And I reminded him, I said, ‘Paul, when you're in the Marines and I was in the Army, they always reminded you, keep the faith. And I said, keep the faith. We're coming to get you.’"" The James Foley Foundation says that there are at least 60 Americans wrongfully detained across the globe. That includes Austin Tice, a former journalist and a former Marine who was kidnaped in Syria more than a year ago. In the past nine months, Carstens has helped bring home 15 Americans who were wrongfully detained or held hostage, and he says he’s been in frequent communications with Rice’s mother. ""Again, hate to get into negotiations and things that we're currently doing, but as I've often told Deborah, Tice's mother, I'm optimistic,"" he said. ""I think there are always paths forward that allow us to get an opportunity to bring someone like Austin home."" In an appearance on ’s ""The Sunday Show,"" former ambassador and governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson, who helped in getting Griner out, said Whelan must be next. Through his organization, Richardson also helped get former Marine Trevor Reed out of Russia about five months ago. ""Well first, the Russians are extremely tough negotiators, and they’re very mad at us. The relationship between Russia and the U.S. over Ukraine and other issues obviously affects humanitarian decisions like an exchange of prisoners,"" Richardson said. During the Trump administration, National Security Adviser John Bolton handled a proposal by the Russians to trade Bout for Whelan, but the deal fell through, and Whelan has been incarcerated for the past four years unjustly, Richardson noted, adding, ""We have to get Whelan out."" ""Sometimes it takes tough decisions. Like bringing back Bout, who’s a bad guy, but it has to happen.""",18

Bout, dubbed the ""Merchant of Death"" due to his supplying of arms around the globe, including to top conflict zones like Afghanistan and Rwanda, had been convicted in 2011 of conspiring to kill Americans, conspiracy to deliver anti-aircraft missiles and aiding a terrorist organization. The Biden administration has seen a swift backlash for the trade, which critics have called one-sided in favor of Russia, in part because its failure to secure the release of former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who is jailed in Russia on spy charges. On Monday, Sullivan defended the swap. ""Before we make any determination about whether to send somebody back as part of a deal to get an American home, we make a determination about the national security implications of that,"" he said. ""We did that assessment in this case."" ""We believe we can manage those challenges, but we will remain constantly vigilant against any threat that Viktor Bout may pose to Americans, to the United States going forward,"" he added. Sullivan noted that ""there's no shortage of arms traffickers and mercenaries in Russia who pose challenges and threats to the international order.""",18

Former President Trump is claiming that he ""turned down a deal"" with Russia to receive captive American Paul Whelan in exchange for convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout, whom President Biden ultimately swapped last week for star Brittney Griner. Whelan has been in Russian custody for over four years at a labor camp in Russia's Mordovia republic. In 2018, while President Trump was in office, the Marine veteran was arrested and convicted on charges of espionage and spying for the U.S. government, facing up to 16 years in prison. ""I turned down a deal with Russia for a one on one swap of the so-called Merchant of Death for Paul Whelan,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social account Sunday night, referencing Bout’s nickname. ""I wouldn’t have made the deal for a hundred people in exchange for someone that has killed untold numbers of people with his arms deals"" ""I would have gotten Paul out, however, just as I did with a record number of other hostages.

In his Monday column, Boot did acknowledge his relief that Griner is safe in the U.S., after she was sentenced to nine years in Russian prison for carrying vape cartridges containing oils derived from cannabis through a Moscow airport in February.

Boot began his criticism by questioning the idea of prisoner swapping in general. He stated, ""We need a serious discussion about whether this is the right policy for Washington to follow. Should we be winning the release of those currently detained at the risk of creating more hostage crises in the future?"" He wrote, ""There is legitimate cause for concern that such deals make us more vulnerable, as Republican critics now charge, but they didn’t start with Biden.

That can only encourage more unlawful detentions of Americans."" Boot then took an opportunity to trash "" Republicans"" criticizing Biden for the move. He wrote, ""Instead of engaging on the merits of Biden’s difficult decision, Republicans are displaying breathtaking bigotry, cynicism and political opportunism in their desperate desire to deny a Democratic president credit for any achievement.""

2022-12-14,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-americans-down-economy-hopeful-country,Fox News Poll: Americans are down on the economy but hopeful for the country,"Former Acting Secretary Chad Wolf says the Biden administration could secure the border but chooses not to and rather incentivizes more crossings. At year’s end, Americans’ economic views are decidedly negative. Most continue to say the economy is in bad shape and nearly twice as many think it will get worse next year as think it will get better. Inflation is a hardship for three-quarters, while another 6-in-10 rate their personal financial situation negatively. And yet, a 53% majority is hopeful about the future of the country, a notable increase from the 43% who were hopeful one year ago. The increase in optimism comes from both Democrats and Republicans . Still, Democrats are considerably more optimistic than Republicans and independents . That’s according to the latest Fox News national survey of registered voters, released Wednesday. Are you hopeful for the country's future? Democrats and Republicans on whether they're hopeful for the country's future. Despite this increased optimism, just 31% are satisfied with the way things are going in the country today, while 68% are dissatisfied. A majority of Democrats are satisfied, compared to just 11% of Republicans. The economy is clearly driving this dissatisfaction. Voters across the aisle agree it is far and away the most important issue facing the country . What is the most important issue facing the country? 2024 A - After the economy, Democrats and Republicans diverge on what they see as the next most important issues. Immigration and border security is the second-most important issue for Republicans , followed distantly by abortion and crime . There is a broader second tier among Democrats, including climate change , guns , abortion , voting rights and election integrity , crime and healthcare . Eight-in-ten voters give the economy a negative rating, with nearly half saying economic conditions are downright poor. What is your opinion on the condition of the economy? Three-quarters report inflation causing them financial hardship over the last six months — an increase over the 67% who felt that way a year ago — and 58% rate their personal economic situation negatively. Has inflation caused you hardship over the last six months? Voters don’t see relief on the horizon, with just 25% expecting the economy to turn the corner next year and nearly twice as many thinking it will get worse. That adds up to a lump of coal for the Biden administration this holiday season. Only 26% think the administration’s policies have helped control inflation, while 44% think they have made it worse. On a personal level, nearly half say they have been hurt by the economic policies of the Biden administration, while just 16% believe they have been helped; another 35% say the policies don’t make a difference. A year ago, the numbers stood at 38% hurt, 17% helped and 43% no difference. Inflation is President Biden's worst issue: 30% approve of the job he is doing . His ratings on China , immigration , the economy and guns are not much better. Four-in-ten approve of the job he is doing on energy policy and the war in Ukraine . Overall, 44% approve of the job Biden is doing, while 56% disapprove. That is slightly worse than last year at this time, when 47% approved and 51% disapproved. Do you approve of President Biden's job performance? ""Even though his job approval rating is below 50 percent, there is some Teflon in Biden,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""If you look at how voters say he has done on the big issues, he should be even less popular than he actually is. It’s possible that his ‘been there, done that' demeanor is what people want even as they express dissatisfaction with his performance."" Biden is not the only one with an approval issue. Just 27% of voters approve of the job Congress is doing, while 67% disapprove. Poll-pourri By a 52-41 percent margin, voters say Biden exceeded his Constitutional authority when he canceled student loan debt worth an estimated $400 billion dollars over 30 years. Those most likely to say he exceeded his authority include Republicans and those over age 65 . Democrats and voters under age 45 are the most likely to think Biden was within his authority. Independents are 16 points more likely to say the president exceeded his authority than stayed within his limits . Voters are most likely to attribute rising crime rates across the country to a breakdown of moral values and the availability of guns . Fewer blame weaker criminal penalties , mental health issues , decreased police funding , a lack of jobs , illegal immigration or the pandemic . Democrats believe the availability of guns is the top reason for rising crime , while Republicans think it is a breakdown of moral values . Forty-five percent of voters now believe coronavirus is completely or mostly under control in the U.S., while 54% say it is only somewhat or not at all under control. This is a markedly improved outlook from last December, when just 27% thought it was completely or mostly under control. Views are mixed on next steps in Ukraine, with 29% saying the U.S. should do more to help in the war with Russia, 26% saying the U.S. should do less, and a 40% plurality saying we’re doing the right amount. Sixty-seven percent think Ukraine will survive the Russian invasion and remain a free country, down just a touch from 71% in May. Conducted Dec. 9-12, under the joint direction of Beacon Research and Shaw & Company Research , this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,005 registered voters nationwide who were randomly selected from a national voter file and spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.

Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa., says Pittsburgh-area history teacher Marc Fogel was detained for possessing medical marijuana in 2021, similar to star Brittney Griner's arrest. On December 8, Americans woke up to the news of the Biden administration’s negotiated prisoner swap of player Brittney Griner for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout – widely known as the ""Merchant of Death."" At the announcement event, President Joe Biden vowed he had not forgotten about former Marine Paul Whelan, another American being held by the Russians. Biden also claimed he has not given up on the prospect of Whelan eventually being brought home. But there was another American prisoner’s name that the president failed even to mention: Marc Fogel. Fogel is a Pittsburgh-area history teacher who lived and worked just outside the congressional district I represent in the U.S. House of Representatives. In August 2021, he was detained at the Sheremetyevo Airport with a small amount of medical marijuana prescribed for his chronic back pain – similar to Griner’s situation. Less than a year later, Fogel was sentenced to 14 years of hard labor in a Russian prison, a sentence usually reserved for large-scale drug smugglers. He has been in custody ever since. star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is escorted from a court room ater a hearing, in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, Aug. 4, 2022. On Thursday, she was freed in exchange for Viktor Bour, a convicted international arms dealer. This is where last week’s prison swap should raise eyebrows. In Griner’s situation, the United States designated her as ""wrongfully detained"" less than three months after her arrest. For Fogel? He has never been classified as such – despite meeting at least six of the 11 established criteria to be designated as ""wrongfully detained"" under federal law. Alongside my congressional colleagues, I have relentlessly advocated for this designation to the State Department and White House – but received limited responses or acknowledgment. Fogel’s case has been effectively stonewalled and disregarded. When Griner’s situation rose to prominence, Biden spoke with her family in the Oval Office. Conversely, Fogel’s family has struggled even to get a call back from the State Department regarding his arrest and campaign for his release. This begs the question: Why did a celebrity such as Brittney Griner receive such an urgent and quick designation, but history teacher Marc Fogel is still waiting for his classification 16 months later? In a day and age where the Biden administration heavily emphasizes race, sexuality and wokeness, it is incredibly worrisome to imagine the White House giving American prisoners held by foreign adversaries preferential treatment if they subscribe to the administration’s preferred ideology. This scenario in question can’t be overlooked, as time and time again, our nation has seen Biden and Democrats pick winners and losers based on this criteria. Because of these pressing questions, Congress must investigate the negotiation process that took place to bring Griner home but left Fogel and Whelan in Russia. Swapping only a celebrity basketball player for a widely condemned Russian international arms dealer warrants heavy scrutiny – especially given Fogel and Whelan’s dire situations. Marc Fogel and his wife, Jane Following this recent swap, the United States is now severely limited at the negotiating table. To my knowledge, we don't have two Merchants of Death sitting around, waiting in our prisons to be traded. Now, the Biden administration is back at square one – with few, if any, high-value assets available to offer Russia in exchange. This is not only tragic but also infuriating. If Fogel had garnered the same media attention as Griner, would he have been included in her swap? If Fogel met the Biden administration’s celebrity status credentials, would he be resting at home with his wife and family? If Fogel checked one of the lefts’ cherished intersectional boxes, would his name have been uttered out of Biden’s mouth as he celebrated Griner’s release? These questions must be answered. When Republicans retake the House majority in January, we must investigate the deliberation process and decisions made to secure Griner’s swap without including Fogel and Whelan. Secretary Antony Blinken, Biden, and all other involved parties must preserve their documents for further congressional oversight. Sadly, this disastrous deal appears to be a failed Biden administration foreign policy decision that was based on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s terms. Additionally, the uneven trade and preferential treatment of Griner also puts minorities and people at greater risk of wrongful detainment in adversarial nations, as they are seen more valuable to take hostage. We’ll get to the bottom of this disaster and stop at nothing to bring Fogel and Whelan home. Until we do, I’ll keep advocating for their release – and ensure Marc Fogel’s name will not go unnoticed again.",18

2022-12-16,https://www.foxnews.com/world/reporters-notebook-making-russia-pay-for-ukraine-invasion,Reporter's Notebook: Making Russia pay for Ukraine invasion,"Fox News' Amy Kellogg interviews Bill Browder on how billions of dollars in frozen Russian money could be used to help fund Ukraine's war effort. One way or another, realistically or not, there is a certain expectation that Russia will have to pay for what it has destroyed in Ukraine. You break it, you pay for it. That reconstruction, however, is a way off. There is no point rebuilding what may be bombed again. As long as the war rages, talk of reconstructing Ukraine seems somewhat theoretical. But arming it is urgent business if Kyiv is to continue to claw back territory lost and defend itself. Bill Browder thinks Russia needs to pick up that tab, too. ""We’re in a situation now where people in the West are starting to complain about sending money to Ukraine for defense and for financial assistance when there are so many economic problems in other parts of the world and at home,"" Browder, head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign and author of the book ""Freezing Order,"" tells Fox News. ""The easy solution to this problem is that there are $350 billion of Russian Central Bank hard currency reserves that have been frozen. And so it makes total logical sense that that money should be used not just for reconstruction of Ukraine but for the defense of Ukraine. In my opinion, this is probably the single most important factor that will determine the outcome of the war."" Rescuers work at the site of a maternity ward of a hospital destroyed by a Russian missile attack, as their attack on Ukraine continues, in Vilniansk, Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine November 23, 2022. /Stringer : As such, Browder considers the idea of having frozen Russian Central Bank assets go to arms for Ukraine an ""elegant"" solution to the cost of conflict crisis, and he’s on a mission to make it happen. Aid to Ukraine has become a political football in Washington, as another disputed budget deadline looms amidst fears of a possible government shutdown before year-end. Republicans want President Biden to stop writing ""blank checks"" and have been crying out for greater oversight of the money spent on Kyiv. Some would like to see those dollars instead spent on America’s southern border. Browder says any drag on Ukraine’s military momentum now—any clipping of its wings—would be catastrophic. ""If Ukraine doesn’t win this war, then we will be at war with Russia next. Putin will be at the Estonian border, and he’ll be threatening a country. And then we have two very terrible choices to make. We can either choose to go to war with Russia, which will be disastrous for us. Or even worse—we can choose to abrogate our obligations under and let Putin take Estonia."" Laws on sovereign immunity stand in the way of diverting frozen Russian Central Bank funds to arms for Ukraine. Money that belongs to governments can’t just be expropriated. Browder argues that is surmountable. Laws, he believes, can be changed, especially when arguments about ""breaking legal precedent"" ring increasingly hollow. ""Vladimir Putin is breaking all legal precedents by invading a neighboring country. Redrawing the map of Europe. And as he’s expanding the definition of criminality. We have to adjust laws to take that into account.""

""Thirteen years ago, I started to advocate for the passage of something called the Magnitsky Act which would freeze the assets of foreign officials who are involved in human rights abuse.""

2022-12-19,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putins-fashion-faux-pas-russian-military-uniforms-unsuitable-combat-brutal-winter-fight,Putin's fashion faux pas: Russian military uniforms unsuitable for combat in brutal winter fight,"Former U.S. intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler tells ""Varney & Co."" that neither Ukraine nor the Russian military have a path to victory. The temperature in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, recently dropped to 25 degrees and Ukrainians are freezing as Russian airstrikes are pounding the country’s vital infrastructure, cutting off electricity and heat and depriving them of drinking water. But ""General Frost,"" on which the Russians have relied for centuries to help defeat the country’s enemies, has also turned its weapon against President Vladimir Putin’s soldiers. The Russian forces, who have been fighting, on Putin’s orders, against their Slavic brethren for 10 months, are reportedly dying from hypothermia because their uniform no longer holds up to severe Eurasian winters. The fiasco stems from several odd decisions made by the post-Soviet military leadership and by Putin himself. The Soviet Red Army uniform was a poor man’s version of the Imperial Russian Army dress from the 19th century. In the run-up to World War , when Russia had the largest army in Europe, approximately 2 million soldiers, Moscow prioritized low-cost but effective couture, compared to the pompous, flashy designs favored by the czarist generals. The uniform was practical, with no frills other than a bright distinctive insignia worn by senior officers that made them easy targets for German marksmen. Russian servicemen march at Red Square during the general rehearsal of the Victory Day military parade in Moscow on May 6, 2018. The winter wear included a greatcoat or half-length fur coat, a cap with ear flaps and thick felt wool valenki footwear worn by the Russian military and civilians alike for hundreds of years. Designed for extreme Russian winters, the uniforms helped the Russians forces beat the French in 1812 and the Germans in 1941-1945. Napoleon Bonaparte admitted that the Russian winter was largely responsible for the disintegration of his army. Many of Hitler’s lightly clad Nazi troops also froze to death. ? After the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, eager to shed their communist heritage, various post-Soviet defense ministers introduced changes to the Russian uniform. Army General Pavel Grachev, who was Boris Yeltsin’s defense minister, instituted changes that made the Russian uniform resemble ’s. An exception was the officer field cap that proudly sported a new Russian national symbol, the double-headed eagle, which the soldiers dubbed ""mutated chicken."" Igor Sergeyev, who rose to defense minister in 1997 under Yeltsin but was fired by Putin in 2001, made Russian military dress look like that of the U.S. Army. And Anatoliy Serdyukov, who was also fired by Putin, ordered winter uniforms to be slim and tailored. Author’s grandfather, Vasiliy Khudyakov, wearing a Soviet Army field combat uniform. The photo was taken in 1944 during World War , which he fought in and survived. He sent the photo to the author’s grandmother during the war. But the biggest uproar in the ranks erupted after the radical changes made by a famous fashion designer Valentin Yudashkin. Known for his theatrical styles, Yudashkin’s evening gowns are displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the California Museum of Fashion in Los Angeles and the Museum of Fashion and Textile in Paris. He dressed Raisa, the wife of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and his work appeared in Elle and Vogue. Russian soldiers, however, did not appreciate the talents of the first post-Soviet couturier who claimed to have visited the factories that produce uniforms for the French, Italian and Israeli militaries to gain expertise. Service members complained that the uniform was made of cheap synthetic material, making them too hot in summer. Its pockets were too small and didn’t fit a mobile phone or identification papers and other documents. Velcro patches fell off, buttons disappeared within two weeks, stitching came apart, and color faded after a couple of washes. The uniform was also inappropriate for combat because it made a rustling sound with movement and melted in fire. Volunteers have military training in Rostov on December 6, 2022, amid the ongoing Russian military action in Ukraine. Most importantly, the ""designer"" uniform was also too flimsy for Russian winters, because instead of natural textiles, like cotton, linen and wool, it was made of new high-tech materials. The Russian soldiers joked that at minus 15 Celsius they started jumping up and down to keep warm, and at minus 20, they couldn’t wait for the enemy to shoot them to spare them from freezing to death. Putin’s current defense minister banned Yudashkin’s invention the minute he assumed his post in 2012, prompting the famed fashionista to blame the Russian military authorities for ""playing Dolce & Gabbana"" rather than following his design recommendations. Current Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made a series of his own innovations. Since Shoigu has no military experience himself, he didn’t want to visually appear as being outranked by his army men. Shoigu introduced the limit to the number of medals worn on the ceremonial military dress to 10, allowing only those earned in combat. Until then, Russian servicemen participating in military parades on Red Square decorated themselves with several dozen medals arranged in four or five rows that didn’t fit on their chests, many of them civilian and, therefore, meaningless. Russian military cadets take part in a rehearsal for the Victory Day military parade in Saint Petersburg on April 28, 2022. The most radical change to the Russian uniform was introduced by Putin himself. In September 2020, by presidential decree, Putin banned the famous Russian military papakha headdress, which was worn by Russian, and previously Soviet, generals and high-ranking offices. Made of the fur, skinned from 3-day-old baby lambs of a special breed called Karakul, these hats kept the Russian generals warm because the fur bristles were thick, densely set and water-repellant. But Putin and Shoigu chose to replace the $317 papakhas with much less costly $79 caps made of rabbit fur. Pro-Russian rebels are shown wearing papakha. With the vain Russian military brass having prioritized style and copying the West over functionality in the post-Soviet uniform, it is hardly surprising that their forces are shivering to death as winter sets in on the battlefield. While the troops look dapper during the famous Russian military parades, pleasing Putin and his lieutenants, they are making good-looking corpses, too.",6
2022-12-19,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/defense-bill-not-perfect-but-should-result-in-stronger-more-effective-us-military,"Defense bill not perfect, but should result in stronger, more effective US military","Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram relays details on the House passing its annual defense bill and Congress' next step to avoid a looming government shutdown next week on 'Special Report.' Having passed both chambers of Congress by wide margins, the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act is now headed to the president. Though delayed through mis-prioritization of the legislative process, the final bill accomplishes its most important task: authorizing funding and providing a policy framework to strengthen the nation’s defenses. While not perfect, the bill represents a clear win for those who support a strong U.S. military. The bill’s foremost achievement is a higher top line for defense spending: $858 billion for military and national security programs. This corrects President Biden’s anemic request for only $813 billion, which did not begin to account for the full impact of inflation. This additional funding will be vital as the U.S. finally begins to counter the growing global threat of the Chinese Communist Party and as Russia continues its immoral war against Ukraine. The ’s foremost achievement is a higher top line for defense spending: $858 billion for military and national security programs. The bill contains numerous provisions that enhance military readiness. Among other things, it: prohibits the early retirement of combat platforms, such as the F-22 fighter; calls for the procurement of 11 Navy ships; restores funding for the sea-launched nuclear cruise missile; acquires a 12th Coast Guard national security cutter; and reforms the National Defense Stockpile. , The bill strengthens the munitions industrial base as well, not only by additional funding, but by authorizing the Pentagon to enter into multiyear, bulk-buy contracts. Also included is a provision lifting the -19 vaccine mandate for service members. With military recruiting falling well short of its targets, it is hard to argue the wisdom of separating service members or denying enlistment to volunteers for declining to take the vaccine. The recruiting crisis led the to shrink the Army’s end strength by 33,000 soldiers from its 2022 authorized level. Earlier versions of the included several provisions requiring reports on personal characteristics unrelated to professional competence. The previous House version, for example, required corporations doing business with the Pentagon to report on the sexual preference, race, ethnicity and sex makeup of their boards. Most of these type provisions with no connection to defense were thankfully stripped from the final bill. An ill-considered proposal to transfer control of the D.C. National Guard to the mayor was also removed. Given the multiple policing jurisdictions in the nation’s capital and the presence of so many federal entities, it would have been impractical for the mayor to control the Guard. The final bill also dropped the Senate provision that would have required women to register for the draft. A pallet of fuses for 155 mm shells, ultimately bound for Ukraine, is loaded on to a C-17 cargo aircraft, April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. One item added to the bill was the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act. This will serve to enhance U.S.–Taiwanese relations in the face of Chinese adventurism. It authorizes $10 billion over five years to strengthen security cooperation, makes Taiwan eligible for a regional contingency munition stockpile, combats Chinese coercive activities, advocates Taiwan’s participation in international organizations, and supports stronger economic and cultural ties. Appropriators must now fund the program, but this is a necessary first step. Finally, the includes increased accountability for Ukraine aid. Prior U.S. aid packages to Ukraine had extensive accountability and reporting requirements, but the builds upon that by requiring the Defense Department, State Department, and the U.S. Agency for International Development to develop a framework—reviewable by Congress—for conducting comprehensive reviews and audits of all assistance they provide to Ukraine. The bill is not perfect. Some provisions unrelated to national defense remain. But lawmakers should be congratulated on narrowing the bill to mostly focus on enhancing warfighting capabilities. The net result should be a stronger, more effective U.S. military. W.",22

From the struggle to put down nationwide protests against Chinese President Xi Jinping's ""zero-"" to Nancy Pelosi's headline-grabbing trip to Taiwan, this year saw China dealing with the greatest challenges to its repressive regime. Xi's ""zero-"" policy, which saw enforced lockdowns and quarantine along with mass testing in any town or city in which even a few positive cases of the coronavirus appeared, finally met its breaking point and forced the ruling party into an uncertain future after handing Xi an unprecedented third term as president. With high inflation and significant slowdown due to its -19 policies - prompting the party to even consider $700 stimulus checks - and tensions over a potential Taiwan invasion simmering but not yet at a boiling point, as well as a new spike in -19 infections, the future for China is entering surprisingly unknown territory. However, that is only possible due to the unprecedented year that China has experienced. ‘ ’ , ‘ ’ The National People’s Congress, the ’s highest legislative body, overwhelmingly voted to hand Xi, 69, his third mandate. State media outlet People’s Daily said the upcoming congress presented ""great significance"" for the whole party and the entire nation as it ""embarks on a new journey toward building a modern socialist country in all respects."" Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a meeting of heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization member states at a summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan September 16, 2022. ""The congress will hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, uphold Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development, and thoroughly implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,"" the announcement added. Xi has held on to the party's fidelity through the last five years of turmoil with a series of successes — growing international influence, massive leaps in natural resource infrastructure in Africa and an iron fist governance that has brought Hong Kong to heel. 6 - Xi has used his platform to further cement China’s place in the international security landscape, particularly through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , which in September agreed to admit Iran. Russia and China established the along with former Soviet states in Central Asia as a replacement for the Shanghai Five and expanded the group four years ago to include India and Pakistan, giving China greater influence over the region. Chinese President Xi Jinping attends the opening ceremony of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Oct. 16, 2022. Additionally, China did not shy away from its ties to Moscow as Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. Beijing purchased Russian coal before and after the invasion started, helping Putin limit the impact of economic sanctions from the West. U.S. officials on both sides of the aisle consistently rank China as a top priority, with military officials continuing to call China the nation's greatest pacing challenge. The U.N. also accused China of serious human rights violations that may amount to ""crimes against humanity"" in a long-delayed report that looked at the treatment of at least one million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic groups in the country. Beijing swiftly denounced the assessment as a fabrication cooked up by Western nations. The White House welcomed the U.N. report, with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noting that, ""The report deepens our grave concern regarding the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity that China is perpetrating. Our position on the atrocities in Xinjiang has been clearly demonstrated with our words and in our actions."" Following a fire in a high-rise apartment building in Xinjiang, citizens demanded accountability and an end to the party’s ""zero-"" policy. The fire killed 10 people, with many blaming the quarantine protocols for making it difficult for residents to escape the building. The anger spilled into the streets in the greatest and most direct pushback against the ’s rule. Chinese citizens showed an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the party’s censorship, providing so much trouble for the infamous ""Great Firewall"" that the West had unprecedented viewing of the protests as videos popped up on social media platforms outside of China. One such example included the now-famous ""white paper protest,"" in which people posted pictures of blank pages and hashtags of positive words so that they could bypass the algorithm and represent ""everything people want to say but cannot say."" Beijing appeared to relent, easing restrictions in a number of cities and dropping testing for asymptomatic cases, along with an end to some travel tracking. Health experts worry that China will simply face another rising wave of -19 as they do not have a strong enough vaccination rate among the population. A man is arrested while people gathering on a street in Shanghai on Nov. 27, 2022, when protests against China's ""zero-"" policy took place the night before following a deadly fire in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region. TikTok was accepted by many as a tool for spying on behalf of the to the point that former President Trump banned the use of TikTok on government-issued devices. President Biden revoked the ban and issued a broader review of social media platforms in his first year, but further lawsuits and challenges may see TikTok banned from the United States entirely, with unanimous support in the Senate for upholding a ban on all government devices just this month. No issue presents a greater threat to regional stability than China’s stance on Taiwan, which came under sharp focus following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Some critics believed that Xi would use Russia’s success or failure in Ukraine as a test for how his own invasion of Taiwan might go, even as military experts argued that any such information would provide limited value due to the staggering difference in circumstances.

2022-12-22,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-why-all-hysteria-not-clapping-zelenskyy,TUCKER CARLSON: Why all the hysteria over not clapping for Zelenskyy?,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's address to Congress on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' You can't even really call it news anymore. It's some kind of ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" scenario on display every single day. Yesterday, last night, the president of Ukraine showed up in Congress wearing a green sweatshirt and cargo pants for maximum disrespect, and demanded the United States continue to spend more on his country's border security than we spend on our own. That actually happened. It was a pretty cheeky performance if you think about it. But like Sam Bankman-Fried before him, Zelenskyy put a salesman's gloss on what otherwise might look very much like a scam. So the tens of billions of dollars you'll be sending me is not charity, Zelenskyy explained. It's not a gift. It's not like the 20 bucks you gave the homeless guy at Union Station this morning for a quart of vodka. No, it's not that at all. This money, Zelenskyy said, is, quote, ""an investment."" Oh, an investment. So what exactly are the terms of this investment now that we're talking finance? When do we get our dividend checks? Well, Zelenskyy didn't specify that. Though, at one point in his speech, he did provide a hint. Are the tens of billions of dollars you're sending me with no audit and no concrete proof of what I'm actually doing with it, will all that money be ""enough,"" Zelenskyy asked rhetorically. Answer: ""Not really."" ""Not really."" In other words, the return on our investment in Ukraine will be more pitches for more investments in Ukraine. Give me money so I can demand more money. That's what Zelenskyy promised us last night. , And under certain circumstances, that might actually be fine. If nothing else, Zelenskyy is quite an audacious young entrepreneur with the kind of pluck and fast-talking shamelessness where you think, ""This guy is either going to wind up in prison or very rich, and maybe both."" And there are times when you might want to throw a kid like that a few bucks just to see where it goes. You don't know. But unfortunately, this is not one of those times. The United States is flat out of money and not just in some abstract PowerPoint presentation kind of way, where we show you graphs of the national debt and we all pretend to be shocked and horrified. No, no, no. The United States is broke in a real way, meaning we can no longer afford to take care of our citizens. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's president, arrives to speak during a joint meeting of Congress at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 21, 2022. For example, 15 million Americans are about to lose their healthcare coverage under Medicaid. Now, these are people who got coverage during , but will now lose that coverage thanks to a provision in the $1.7 trillion spending bill that's about to become law. As reports, governors of various states have informed the Biden administration that the cost of keeping all those people on Medicaid is ""too high."" And it is high. Undoubtedly, it is high. How high is it? Well, over the last three years since began, the federal government spent about $100 billion in extra Medicaid payments to Americans. That's a lot of money. How much is it? Well, it turns out that $100 billion is roughly what Congress has sent to our fast-talking Ukrainian friend in the sweatshirt in less than a single year. Just for comparison, just you would know what the priorities are in Washington, your health care is just too expensive. Sorry. And your border is too. Can't afford it. But for the strongman who runs Ukraine, no cost is too high. That's real. Does that frustrate you? Does hearing the details infuriate you as a citizen? Imagine if you went to Congress to plead your case. Maybe you showed up in a sweatshirt to tell them what you think. ""I'm an American citizen,"" you might say. ""I've lived here my entire life. I've paid taxes, I've followed the law. I've supported the system my grandfathers built because I believed in that system. And now because corrupt ghouls like Janet Yellen at the Fed, so completely devalued the dollar and so completely hollowed out our economy, I can no longer afford to go to the doctor. As an American citizen, please help me."" So if you showed up on the floor of the House of Representatives wearing a sweatshirt and said that, what kind of response do you think you would get? Would the response look anything like this? 'S : ‘ !’ : I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves. Thank you for both financial packages you have already provided us with and the ones you may be willing to decide on. Your money is not charity. It's an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way. We're handling your money in the ""most responsible way."" Take our word for it. Take our word for it. And they clap like seals. But here's the interesting thing. Almost every person in the room clapped like a seal. So no matter what that man said -- Send me more money! I command you! Send me more money! We're taking care of it the most responsible ways -- they applaud, all of them, almost like they have to. Now there are 435 members of the House of Representatives, and they're Republicans and Democrats. And famously, they don't get along. They don't agree on anything. They can't even pass a budget because they disagree on everything very bitterly. And yet, when a foreign leader shows up in cargo pants to tell them lies and give them orders, they all applaud. That's pretty weird behavior in a democracy if you think about it. The fractious debate we hear so much about doesn't exist. And in fact, looking at the screen last night, it didn't really look like a democracy, to be honest. Oh, yes, good point. Good point, sir. We're so proud you're here. Throw your foreign flag on the dais and we'll applaud more. That's honestly what it looked like last night. You've got to clap. You get in trouble if you don't clap, so everyone just claps all the time. Clapping is mandatory as long as Zelenskyy is speaking. Now there were a few who didn't obey. That would include Matt Gaetz of Florida, Lauren Boebert of Colorado. And when they didn't stand up and applaud, they found out the hard way what happens to people who dare not to applaud. News took off right after them. That was the headline for . Its house ""historian"" Michael Beschloss declared this: ""For any members of Congress who refuse to clap for Zelenskyy, we need to know from them exactly why. We need to know why."" Thought crime alert. You've been reported as not applauding. Explain yourself, pleb. And then Beschloss went on television to drive home the point. Our sources have reported you are not clapping. Watch this. : And I think the other thing I'd like to ask is the number of members of Congress -- almost all Republican -- who did not show up tonight or who showed up and refused to clap. I'd like to know why that was for two reasons. Number one, you're a public servant. We're allowed to know those things. You're supposed to tell us, if you're serving in Congress, what the reason was. Do you love Putin or are you just opposed to democracy or is there something else? We have a right to know why you didn't clap. We have a right to know your thoughts. You thought you were a free person, able to make decisions for yourself. You could love or hate whoever you wanted in a free country. But no, Michael Beschloss has a right to know why you feel the way you do. Do you love Putin? Why wouldn't you clap for a man who banned a Christian denomination? A man who arrested priests, raided monasteries, seized churches outlawed opposition media outlets, outlawed political parties that opposed him, threw his primary political opponent in jail. Why would you applaud for a man like that? Do you love Putin? Are you opposed to democracy? Explain yourself. That's what he's saying. That's what they're all saying. It's absurd. What they're describing is the opposite of democracy. There's no democracy in Ukraine, obviously. Banning a Christian denomination. Shut up. But he did. So why all the hysteria? You've got two people who didn't clap for a foreign dictator, and Michael Beschloss gets red in the face. Why? Oh, almost everybody clapped for him. But a couple of people didn't. And Michael Beschloss can't handle that. What's going on here? Is it possible that the more ludicrous the lie they tell you, the fewer questions they can tolerate about it, the less dissent they can put up with because they fear the whole edifice might crumble if they allow one person to ask one reasonable question. It's possible that's what's happening. Remember when Joe Biden told us about Nord Stream? There were two stories. The first story was Joe Biden promised to blow up Nord Stream, the pipeline that brought natural gas from Russia to Western Europe. He's going to blow it up. Do you remember that? You're not allowed to remember it, but we remember it. And we saved the tape. Here it is. : If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine, again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream tube. We will bring an end to it. : But how will you do that exactly? Since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control. : We will. I promise you. We'll be able to do it. In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office on July 8, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, attends a meeting with military officials during his visit the war-hit Dnipropetrovsk region. Yeah. So he said it on tape. I'm going to do to that pipeline what I did to Corn Pop at the pool at Wilmington. I'm gonna take a chain to it. So he promises to destroy the pipeline. And then, so does his number two at the State Department, Toria Nuland. We'll destroy the pipeline. And then the pipeline is destroyed, and that hurts Russia. It eliminates Russia's leverage over Europe. Okay. So we know how that happened. But no, they told us. Russia did it. Putin blew up his own pipeline. That's how evil he is. That's how much destruction he wreaks. He doesn't just attack others. He attacks himself. Okay, now. That's what they told us. And some of us had questions about it. Is that really what happened? Michael Beschloss and his friends didn't like that. Anyone who asked questions about what happened to Nord Stream, which, by the way, sent more carbon into the atmosphere than any manmade event in history. So if you care about the climate, maybe be a little worried about what just happened in Nord Stream. If you suggested that the administration, the Biden administration, had anything to do with that, including prior knowledge of it, you were a Russian agent. Really, is that right? Can you fill us in a little bit more? No, you're working for Putin. Foreign Policy Magazine, which used to be a real magazine, called any questions about what happened to Nord Stream a ""Kremlin talking point."" Wow. Could it be they were lying? Oh, yeah, they were lying. Oh, they were lying. The Washington Post, of all places, now reporting and we're quoting, ""some Western officials now doubt the Kremlin was responsible. Oh, you think. There's, quote, ""no conclusive evidence that Russia is behind the Nord Stream attack."" Okay, so it's a binary here. It's Russia against a Western coalition led by the United States. So either Russia blew up the Nord Stream pipeline or the Biden administration had a hand in blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline. Those are your two options. So if Russia didn't do it, then the people who suggested maybe the Biden people were behind it were 100% right. So you'd think in a free country, in a democracy, you would get to discuss that in public. But you can't. And the press corps is not going to help you. They don't ask questions. We don't have that anymore. Here's what we have. : 'S ‘ ’ : Politicians and the press often toss around comparisons to Winston Churchill. But this time, minus the cigar and the whiskey, it fits. : President Biden face-to-face with the man who has drawn comparisons to Winston Churchill. : And in a dramatic wartime appearance reminiscent of Winston Churchill in World War . : This was historic. Some people have compared it to when Churchill came. : Zelenskyy is very much acting in the Churchillian tradition. : What could be a Churchillian moment. : I mean, he is a modern Winston Churchill with an iPhone. . : Someone who probably is the most courageous and inspirational leader since Winston Churchill. . : Where Winston Churchill stood generations ago, so to President Zelenskyy stands. : So you're almost saying that Zelenskyy's had a harder job than Churchill had? : That's exactly what I'm saying. . : This is a historical figure. This guy actually can be compared to Winston Churchill, to Lincoln in 1860. So that kind of solves a mystery from last night. How can any self-respecting American sit there when some foreign dictator shows up wearing his workout clothes in the Congress and starts demanding, with a very apparent lack of gratitude, that we send him tens of billions of dollars when we're running out of money? How could you sit and put up with that? And then drapes a Ukrainian flag in our Congress. How could you put up with that? Well, because you're not a self-respecting American. You have no self-respect. You have no dignity. You don't care. You'll say anything. You'll tell any lie. You'll repeat any talking point. And when someone from the or the White House sends you a note by text, saying, ""Compare him to Churchill,"" you do because you have no self-respect. That's the problem. So while millions of Americans can't afford to go to the doctor and we have no border, our leaders and our media are imagining they're very close to Winston Churchill. Alright. So this is clearly some sort of weird psychodrama that a ruling class is engaging in that gives meaning to their otherwise barren lives. The problem is there are potential consequences that could end the world. So the other day, Lindsey Graham came out, the Republican from South Carolina, and said that he agreed with Joe Biden and Zelenskyy. The real goal is not to move Russian troops out of Ukraine, back to pre-February borders. The real goal is regime change in Russia. Watch this. : How does this war end? When Russia breaks and they take Putin out. Anything short of that, the war is going to continue. To ask the Ukrainians to give Russia part of their country after all this death and destruction is not going to happen. To signal a cease fire, Russia will take the opportunity to rearm and come at them again. So we're in it to win it. And the only way you're going to win it is to break the Russian military and have somebody in Russia take Putin out. So it's really hard to overstate how crazy this is. And you don't want to play shrink and wonder about, you know, what emptiness at the core of Lindsey Graham's personal life causes him to identify so strongly with a country he's not a citizen of. Something's going on there. But the effect is incredibly reckless and crazy. Take out Putin. Putin's bad. Kill him. Fine. What happens then? Well, the world's largest landmass falls into ungovernable chaos. And that country has the world's largest nuclear arsenal. What happens to all those weapons? In a country with a lot of people who hate us. Lindsey Graham has no idea. He doesn't care. He's not interested. He's not going to be here to find out. And none of the lawmakers who clapped yesterday had any idea either. They're clapping for regime change. They're clapping for an uncertain and incredibly dangerous future. It's not getting the Russian military out of Ukraine. It's much more than that. And they don't want to know more.",0

Conservatives lawmakers and activists responded to President Biden's joint press conference with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Wednesday by saying the United States should stop sending money to the war-torn country. During the press conference, Biden reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to provide aid to Ukraine in its efforts to maintain its national sovereignty. However, some conservatives argued that the United States has already provided enough aid to the country and that America's limited resources would be better used to help citizens at home. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., a conservative Republican who is challenging Rep. Kevin McCarthy for House Speaker, tweeted, ""No more blank checks to Ukraine"" in the lead up to the press conference. ""Zelensky says $45 billion in aid from the U.S. is not enough. Not enough? What is enough? Enough with all of this,"" Biggs continued.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., tweeted, ""Why is Ukraine funding buried in the bill that averts a shutdown of our own government?

David Petraeus, who drew a parallel to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan's ability to capture audiences. Conservatives on Twitter hammered News presidential historian Michael Beschloss for a ""Soviet""-sounding tweet demanding to know who exactly did not clap for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his address to Congress on Wednesday. Zelenskyy traveled to the U.S. on Wednesday, his first trip outside of Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in early 2022. During his trip abroad, Zelensky met with President Joe Biden and addressed a joint session of Congress, seeking continued support U.S. and funding of the war with Russia. Most members of Congress supported Zelenskyy’s message as he was given a standing ovation for his speech. Although Beschloss seemed very curious about who in Congress may not have been enthusiastic enough about the speech or providing further support for the eastern European leader. 13 - Zelensky is in Washington to meet with President Joe Biden and address Congress -- his first trip abroad since Russia invaded in February. On Wednesday evening, the historian tweeted, ""For any Members of Congress who refused to clap for Zelenskyy, we need to know from them exactly why."" He followed up by asking, ""How many Members of Congress refused to attend tonight's speech because they do not support Zelenskyy's Ukraine? Important to know this and why."" Twitter users wondered why Beschloss was so intent on knowing such things. One user blasted Beschloss, claiming he was leaning into ""his love for Soviet"" totalitarian tactics. Pro-life writer Annette Jals wrote, ""Nice. @BeschlossDC showing his love for Soviet tactics. It’s well known that when Stalin spoke to crowds, the would monitor people to determine who wasn’t clapping or who stopped clapping first. This often resulted in applause sessions that seemed endless."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy receives from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a national flag during his address to the Congress at the Capitol in Washington, on December 21, 2022. Conservative writer Kimberly Morin asked Beschloss, ""Is this a satire account?"" Washington Examiner author Christopher Tremoglie slammed Beschloss, tweeting, ""No, we really don’t to know that."" ""How dare they not support the latest witless proxy war,"" psychology professor and author Geoffrey Miller tweeted sarcastically. Conservative influencer Márta Lisle provided her rationale for not being a fan of Zelenskyy, tweeting, ""Zelenskyy banned the Orthodox Church, opposition political parties, free press, is monitoring Christian religious activities and threatening imprisonment. Maybe that’s why."" Prominent Twitter conservative Dale Stark mocked Beschloss over the Soviet-sounding nature of his tweet. He wrote, ""We also need to know who clapped with insufficient enthusiasm and who stopped clapping first."" , Fox News Contributor Joe Concha tweeted, ""’Presidential historian’ who warned last month on national television that ‘our children will be arrested and conceivably killed’ if the did well in the midterms… is now demanding for U.S. lawmakers to be in complete and total lockstep on Planet GroupThink."" Conservative columnist David Marcus commented, ""You will be made to clap!"" Michael Beschloss while on . Previous tweets from Beschloss have concerned Twitter users as well. The historian was accused of ""suggesting that Trump should be executed"" for potentially keeping top secret nuclear documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence after leaving office. After speculation spread online that Trump may have had such documents, Beschloss tweeted out an image of Soviet spy couple the Rosenbergs, who were executed by the U.S. government for passing U.S. nuclear secrets to Moscow in the 1950s.",13

The instance also prompted an immediate response from Taiwan’s military.

Taipei’s defense ministry also provided flight paths for the Chinese military vessels, including the identification of the aircraft.

While the threat of China potentially launching a military invasion of Taiwan looms, the Biden administration has maintained a ""strategic ambiguity"" on the island. ‘ ,’ As recently as September, President Biden said publicly that the U.S. would interfere with such an invasion and order U.S. troops to defend Taiwan. This is not the official stance of the U.S. and the White House corrected his comments.

2022-12-23,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-lying-defined-politics-2022,TUCKER CARLSON: Lying defined the politics of 2022,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reflects on lies told by the federal government on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' This is, believe it or not, one of our last shows of 2022. So naturally we got to thinking about the year that was. What defined it? Well, if you're living a healthy life, of course your relationships defined it. Politics is never the most important thing. The people around you are—your family, your friends, your dogs. That's where joy comes from, not from elections. Relationships mean much more to you than any stupid pronouncement Nancy Pelosi made over the last year from her compound in Napa. But still, politics do matter. They're not irrelevant. Nancy Pelosi's babbling do have an effect on your life. So, what defined the politics of 2022? Well, lying did. This was the year of lying. The people in charge tell an awful lot of lies. That's what we learned, and we know this for sure, because while they are avid and committed liars, they're not very good at it. Their lives are amateurish, obvious, pathetic, sad, and there's something kind of insulting about that. Don't take a leak on my boots and tell me it's raining, goes the old cowboy phrase. Don't tell me something we both know isn't true and expect me to believe it. When you do that, you assault my dignity. You diminish me. You treat me like a child. If you're going to tell me a lie, put some effort into it. Try something clever. Have pride of craftsmanship. Don't pull the same old dusty alibi off the shelf like a jar of expired spaghetti sauce and expect me to fall for it again. Oh, we can't tell you that, Mr. or Mrs. America. It's a matter of grave national security, but don't worry, everything's totally fine. We're doing a great job. They've been trying that for, well, 21 years now, with the still somehow secret 9/11 files and for nearly 60 years with the assassination. At this point, no living American still believes them and none should, but they keep doing it anyway. Clearly, they think we have brain damage. It's frustrating to watch, but today we've decided to be amused by it. ' ' 2 That seemed like the more positive option, maybe the most positive available under the circumstances. So here, ladies and gentlemen, are our favorite lies of 2022. We had an awful lot to choose from in making tonight's list from Paul Pelosi's late night crime scene to the endless propaganda about the Ukraine war, to the million non-existent Americans who actually didn't get new jobs in the third quarter of the year. But we're going to start with what might be the dumbest lie ever told: Vladimir Putin blew up his own natural gas pipeline to Europe. Now, by doing this, Putin crippled his own economy and weakened his own strategic position in the middle of a war, but he did it anyway because well, just because that's the kind of evil behavior Vladimir Putin is famous for. He's so evil. He's not only a threat to us, a direct physical peril to Omaha, Bangor and San Jose. Vladimir Putin is so evil, he's an existential threat to himself. Stop that man before he blows up more of his own pipelines. That's what the media told us with a completely straight face. Watch. , : How does this fit into Putin's playbook? Of course, as you would expect, Susan, Russia says, ""Oh, we had nothing to do with this. We're going to launch an investigation,"" but come on. , : Look the indications are that foul play was involved and that it appears that Russia is certainly the likeliest suspect of this. , : I think this is clearly an act of sabotage of some sort and Russia is certainly the most likely suspect. I think this might be just the first salvo of some additional things that might be coming toward Europe. , , : What Putin is saying to us by blowing up his pipeline is, ""Look, I can blow up a pipeline. If need be, I can blow up the internet cables coming into your country. I can blow up functioning pipelines. I could do all sorts of stuff."" , Vladimir Putin delivers an address flanked by men in military uniforms. If I kill myself, I could do anything. Russia is certainly the most likely suspect, says John Brennan and you can trust him when he says that because John Brennan was Barack Obama's director. There's nothing shady about that guy. He's never been involved in any illegal murders or anything. He's got your best interests at heart. Let's put him on as a reliable foreign policy expert. He'll tell us the truth. You've got to laugh at this because, well, what's the option? And actually, John Brennan turns out to be reliable in at least one sense. If John Brennan says it, the opposite is almost certainly true and that was the case here. No, Russia did not blow up its own pipelines. That explosion was the work of the Biden administration. They signed off on it and we can tell you that tonight with confidence. The only remaining question is, now that we know for a fact that Joe Biden intentionally released more carbon into the atmosphere than any human in recorded history, can you continue to lecture the rest of us about global warming? We're thinking, oh, yeah, he can. Biden certainly is the main qualification for doing that – soullessness. This is a man who showered with his own daughter, who smiles when he's mad. This man will say literally anything. If the Chinese military unleashed a deadly manufactured flu virus on the world, Joe Biden would blame you for it and actually, he did. People are dying of , Joe Biden told us, because you have questions about an experimental mRNA shot that doesn't really work and whose long-term effects we can't know. You are the criminal here, not the Chinese government, because you're ""unvaccinated."" You must be punished. That was the message from the White House picked up and eagerly disseminated by Biden's equally soulless stooges in the media and here's one of them: Leana Wen, formerly of abortion giant Planned Parenthood, now of . -19 : We have a very narrow window to tie reopening policy to vaccination status because otherwise, if everything is reopened, then what’s the carrot going to be? How are we going to incentivize people to actually get the vaccine? So that’s why I think the and the Biden administration needs to come out a lot bolder and say, ‘If you’re vaccinated, you can do all these things. Here are all these freedoms that you have,’ because otherwise, people are going to go out and enjoy these freedoms anyway. So, the unvaccinated might be ""enjoying freedoms,"" Fretted Leana Wen and everyone knows that under the U.S. Constitution, that's not allowed. Scurry back to your hovel, kulak. No freedoms for you. The gruel is ladled at 4:00. Slurp it with gratitude. Oh, what a difference a year makes. Now we know that everything Leana Wen told us on was a lie, and we know that for certain, because, amazingly, Leana Wen just admitted it. This week, Wen acknowledged that actually this is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated. It's the opposite. The , she said, has now determined that ""vaccinated people who never had were at least three times as likely to be infected as unvaccinated people with a prior infection and a Lancet study"" continuing the quote) ""found that those who were vaccinated but never had were four times as likely to have a severe illness, resulting in hospitalization or death compared to the unvaccinated who recovered from it."" I mean, what? So, the vaccinated are four times as likely to be hospitalized or die from ? Four times. , So, it turns out that none of your vax propaganda was true. To put it mildly, it was all a lie. The question is, can we get our lives back now? How about our economy, our jobs? When's the part when you break down in wracking sobs of contrition and beg forgiveness for misleading the entire country in matters of life and death and hurting people? We look forward to that part, though, obviously not holding our breath. For now, it is satisfying enough to see a lie identified for what it always was. and honestly, that's also the pleasure in watching the Sam Bankman-Fried saga unfold. Bankman-Fried was this weird, pudgy kid in a t-shirt who played video games during interviews, took a ton of pills, and could never quite explain the business model of his ""crypto exchange."" I mean, literally, from the first day, this guy was an utterly transparent scam artist. Your golden retriever could have smelled the fraud on this guy. It was that redolent. He stunk of it. But somehow the geniuses, the financial wizards at , had no idea. They fell in love with Sam Bankman-Fried. They wanted to be Sam Bankman-Fried. They told us Sam Bankman-Fried was the new J.P. Morgan. Here is a tape we are going to watch at least once a month for the rest of our lives. It's that good. founder Sam Bankman-Fried is facing an onslaught of legal repercussions over his involvement in the collapse of . He faces several federal charges related to an alleged scheme to defraud customers. , 16: They call him the J.P. Morgan of Crypto. , : The Michael Jordan of crypto if you will. , 16: So, why should you carry about a floppy haired, vegan, fidget spinning crypto billionaire who occasionally sleeps on a beanbag chair? In the so-called crypto winter, he’s been referred to as crypto’s white knight. , 29: J.P. Morgan of this generation: Sam Bankman-Fried’s . Is he the Jay Gould of our era or is he the J.P, Morgan of our era? -: I think it’s yet to be determined : Is he Vanderbilt? -: He could be. : Is he Harriman? -: Possibly. Is he Carnegie? : If he gives a lot of libraries he is. -19 That wasn't 10 years ago. That was weeks, days, before the Sam Bankman-Fried fraud collapsed in on itself. Is he Vanderbilt? Is he Harriman? Is he Carnegie? Is he J.P. freakin Morgan? No. No, he's not. Actually, he is an accused felon who just this week was photographed shuffling along in handcuffs on his way to his cell. It's just so awesome. These people are ridiculous and that's the real lesson of Sam Bankman-Fried and we're going to enjoy every second of it. Now, it's a little harder to enjoy what's happening to the rest of the economy—inflation, especially. Inflation is one of those economic phenomena you don't need to be an professor to identify. Has the price of things you buy every week gone up a lot? Oh, it has. , you've got inflation. Inflation is demonstrable. Anyone who claims otherwise is lying and everybody knows that and that's why even most politicians, people who lie about anything, don't bother to lie about inflation. It's just too easy to catch them, but some still persist in lying about it. They just enjoy the experience of lying. It makes them feel alive. Janet Yellen is one of those. Watch her here to tell you that the inflation you're experiencing every day is not real. It's a mirage. It's ""transitory."" , 2021: We’ve had several months of high inflation that most economists including me believe will be transitory. , 2021: I personally believe that this represents transitory factors. O’, 2021: Are higher prices here to stay? : I believe it’s transitory but I don’t mean to suggest that these pressures will disappear in the next month or two. , 2021 : It is important that we monitor it carefully, but I believe fundamentally that this is something that will settle down. : Transitory? : Transitory Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen attends the House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., September 30, 2021. Al Drago/Pool via /File Photo Did you hear that? She's an economist. She's not a scam artist who got rich from bribes disguised as speaking fees from the big banks after she had been running the Fed. No, no, no, no. She's an economist and because she's an economist and you're not, she knows that there are many kinds of inflation. There's conventional inflation and there's something called transitory inflation and that's the kind of inflation you're not allowed to complain about, especially before midterm elections. You are commanded to ignore that kind of inflation and if it still bothers you, then you have to do your patriotic duty and get an abortion. That's the word from Janet Yellen, who as of tonight is literally our treasury secretary.",0
2022-12-24,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/i-lived-under-soviet-communism-taught-me-love-christmas,I lived under Soviet communism and it taught me to love Christmas,"Weather correspondent Max Gorden has the latest on the bitter cold ahead of the holidays on 'Special Report.' Growing up in Soviet Russia, I didn’t know what Christmas was, let alone celebrate it. Every winter we did, however, celebrate the biggest holiday of the year – New Year’s. All across the country, between the end of December and mid-January, major festivities were held at schools, kindergartens, universities, and places of work, with singing, dancing, and lavish decorations. For a couple of weeks each year, you got transported from an otherwise harsh and dreary Soviet reality into the magic of holiday cheer, with fireworks, marching bands, streetlights and firecrackers. The centerpiece of the holiday was the New Year’s Pine Tree that decorated every home and workplace. My sister and I relished the moment when we helped our mother decorate with ornaments a freshly cut Yolka that our father brought home. And we couldn’t wait to go to mom’s workplace to dance a khorovod around the lit-up tree and get a translucent sack filled with candy and one tangerine – a big rarity back then, especially in winter – from a bushy eye-browed and long-bearded Grandfather Frost and his granddaughter Snowgirl. It was a fairytale that became real, albeit just for a few short days. '' ' ' What I didn’t realize until my early twenties was that the Soviet government did indeed feed us a fairytale. In my fourth year of college, I was one of very few students sent on an exchange program to London. That December, to my astonishment, I learned that the British celebrated something called Christmas, with a Yolka called a Christmas Tree and a Grandfather Frost called Santa Claus, but without the charming granddaughter. Instead, he had a sweetly innocent reindeer, Rudolph. On December 24 and 25, the Brits also went to church and sang Christmas carols. They spoke about the birth Jesus Christ as the reason for the holiday. That was as much of a shock to me at 22 as that of my American children learning that Santa wasn’t real. Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill delivers the Christmas Liturgy in the Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Jan. 6, 2022. That year, I learned that Grandfather Frost and Snowgirl were Soviet inventions designed to remove religion from the Christmas holiday that was celebrated in imperial Russia up until 1918, when Bolsheviks seized power, killed the czar, and pronounced atheism as state religion, with hammer and sickle replacing the cross. Having declared that religion was the ""opiate of the masses,"" the new, proletariat regime decided that the state, not God, was the purveyor of all rights to humans, and that Vladimir Lenin, the Chief Revolutionary, was to be worshiped, with his portraits hanging on every wall and decorating children’s first reading book. Lenin, with a stroke of a pen, canceled Christmas and indeed, all religious observance, by signing a decree on February 8, 1918, ""On Introducing a West European Calendar in the Russian Republic."" Until then Russia followed an Orthodox, Julian calendar, and celebrated Christmas, which it called the ""The Birth of Christ,"" Rozhdestvo Khristovo. Lenin’s decree transitioned Russia to the Gregorian calendar, which runs 13 days ahead of the Julian. Rozhdestvo Khristovo disappeared from the calendar all together, making December 25, 1917, the day of the last celebration of Russian Christmas. Today, post-Soviet Russia celebrates Orthodox Christmas on January 7, but New Year’s remains the biggest holiday of the year. Since arriving, I’ve been savoring the freedoms in America, my adopted homeland. Americans are free to practice any religion or none at all. I don’t put up a Christmas tree in my house because I’ve converted to my husband’s faith, Judaism. So, we put up a menorah and light candles to celebrate Hanukkah. My sister – who recently shared with me that she also didn’t know about Christmas until she left Russia – has a Christmas tree in her house in America. She even goes to church, although we were raised without religion, having shared with me that our grandmother had us secretly baptized when we were babies. Our parents kept it a secret, in order not to raise any suspicions about our family with Soviet authorities. I am saddened that America is becoming more secularized. Research indicates that a quarter of Americans have a secular worldview now, and three in 10 adults are religiously unaffiliated. I know the feeling of emptiness that can fill your soul if you don’t believe that there’s some other being, looking after you and guiding you, especially in difficult times. I know what happens when you let the state become your religion. Soon it starts perceiving itself as the Almighty Himself, imposing its control on every aspect of your life. I hope my American children will never be forced to worship the government. Here’s to Merry Christmas! No cookies by the chimney for Grandfather Frost.",6

Russia and China have committed to strengthening ties between the two countries despite Moscow’s failure to quickly and effectively end its invasion of Ukraine, which may strain Beijing in the coming months. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met via public video conference Friday to discuss the bilateral relationship that has blossomed this year, with no direct mention of Ukraine in their remarks. The meeting focused on the progress both nations have made despite ""geopolitical tensions"" and a ""difficult international situation."" Putin specifically highlighted a desire to increase the military collaboration between the two countries, saying that it had a ""special place"" in the relationship. China and Russia completed joint navy drills this week, including procedures and plans for how to capture enemy vessels. Xi tried to raise concerns over Ukraine, which he referred to as a ""crisis,"" marking a departure from previous remarks that referred to the invasion as a ""situation."" 'S : ""Xi Jinping emphasized that China has noted that Russia has never refused to resolve the conflict through diplomatic negotiations, for which it expresses its appreciation,"" reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, speaks during a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping via a video conference at the Kremlin in Moscow Friday, Dec. 30, 2022. China promised a ""no limits"" friendship with Russia and refused to criticize Putin or his invasion of Ukraine, instead blamed the West for ""provoking"" Moscow, and Russia has in turn supported China amid rising tensions over Taiwan. 'S ‘’ However, China expert Craig Singleton of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said that the partnership would not provide the kind of ""cure-all"" each side wanted for their troubles with the U.S. and Europe.

""There are clear limits to China and Russia’s ‘no-limits’ partnership,"" Singleton wrote following the video conference. ""More specifically, it is difficult to fathom a scenario in which China puts Russia’s needs above its own, at least not without a clear return on investment or compelling evidence that such assistance will meaningfully shift the war’s momentum in Russia’s favor."" 20 China is facing a difficult home front situation as -19 infections have exploded across the country, with over 18 million people infected and roughly 9,000 people dying each day, according to U.K. research firm Airfinity.

""Xi’s key challenge going forward may have less to do with making sure Putin wins, an outcome that appears increasingly unlikely, and more with figuring out just how far China is willing to go to make sure Putin does not lose,"" Singleton added. Singleton suggested that China will likely continue to develop ties with Russia, but not at the risk of seriously antagonizing the West. ""As the war in Ukraine drags on, deepening Sino-Russian ties could force Western countries to re-assess their collective willingness to pressure Xi to reign in his support for Putin."" ""That could lead to greater friction in the U.S.-China relationship at a time when the two countries remain at loggerheads over Taiwan,"" he concluded.
