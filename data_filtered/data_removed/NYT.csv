2022-01-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/opinion/jan-6-global-democracy.html,Opinion | The Impact of Jan. 6 Is Still Rippling Throughout the World,"This article is part of a collection on the events of Jan. 6, one year later. Read more in a note from Times Opinion’s politics editor Ezekiel Kweku in our Opinion Today newsletter. The Jan. 6 attack on Congress by a mob inspired by former President Donald Trump marked an ominous precedent for U.S. politics. Not since the Civil War had the country failed to effect a peaceful transfer of power, and no previous candidate purposefully contested an election’s results in the face of broad evidence that it was free and fair. The event continues to reverberate in American politics — but its impact is not just domestic. It has also had a large impact internationally and signals a significant decline in American global power and influence. Jan. 6 needs to be seen against the backdrop of the broader global crisis of liberal democracy. According to Freedom House’s 2021 Freedom in the World report, democracy has been in decline for 15 straight years, with some of the largest setbacks coming in the world’s two largest democracies, the United States and India. Since that report was issued, coups took place in Myanmar, Tunisia and Sudan, countries that had previously taken promising steps toward democracy. The world had experienced a huge expansion in the number of democracies, from around 35 in the early 1970s to well over 110 by the time of the 2008 financial crisis. The United States was critical to what was labeled the “Third Wave” of democratization. America provided security to democratic allies in Europe and East Asia, and presided over an increasingly integrated global economy that quadrupled its output in that same period. But global democracy was underpinned by the success and durability of democracy in the United States itself — what the political scientist Joseph Nye labels its “soft power.” People around the world looked up to America’s example as one they sought to emulate, from the students in Tiananmen Square in 1989 to the protesters leading the “color revolutions” in Europe and the Middle East in subsequent decades. The decline of democracy worldwide is driven by complex forces. Globalization and economic change have left many behind, and a huge cultural divide has emerged between highly educated professionals living in cities and residents of smaller towns with more traditional values. The rise of the internet has weakened elite control over information; we have always disagreed over values, but we now live in separate factual universes. And the desire to belong and have one’s dignity affirmed are often more powerful forces than economic self-interest. The world thus looks very different from the way it did roughly 30 years ago, when the former Soviet Union collapsed. There were two key factors I underestimated back then — first, the difficulty of creating not just democracy, but also a modern, impartial, uncorrupt state; and second, the possibility of political decay in advanced democracies. The American model has been decaying for some time. Since the mid-1990s, the country’s politics have become increasingly polarized and subject to continuing gridlock, which has prevented it from performing basic government functions like passing budgets. There were clear problems with American institutions — the influence of money in politics, the effects of a voting system increasingly unaligned with democratic choice — yet the country seemed to be unable to reform itself. Earlier periods of crisis like the Civil War and the Great Depression produced farsighted, institution-building leaders; not so in the first decades of the 21st century, which saw American policymakers presiding over two catastrophes — the Iraq war and the subprime financial crisis — and then witnessed the emergence of a shortsighted demagogue egging on an angry populist movement. Up until Jan. 6, one might have seen these developments through the lens of ordinary American politics, with its disagreements on issues like trade, immigration and abortion. But the uprising marked the moment when a significant minority of Americans showed themselves willing to turn against American democracy itself and to use violence to achieve their ends. What has made Jan. 6 a particularly alarming stain (and strain) on U.S. democracy is the fact that the Republican Party, far from repudiating those who initiated and participated in the uprising, has sought to normalize it and purge from its own ranks those who were willing to tell the truth about the 2020 election as it looks ahead to 2024, when Mr. Trump might seek a restoration. The impact of this event is still playing out on the global stage. Over the years, authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin of Russia and Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus have sought to manipulate election results and deny popular will. Conversely, losing candidates in elections in new democracies have often charged voter fraud in the face of largely free and fair elections. This happened last year in Peru, when Keiko Fujimori contested her loss to Pedro Castillo in the second round of the country’s presidential election. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been laying the grounds for contesting this year’s presidential election by attacking the functioning of Brazil’s voting system, just as Mr. Trump spent the lead-up to the 2020 election undermining confidence in mail-in ballots. Before Jan. 6, these kinds of antics would have been seen as the behavior of young and incompletely consolidated democracies, and the United States would have wagged its finger in condemnation. But it has now happened in the United States itself. America’s credibility in upholding a model of good democratic practice has been shredded. This precedent is bad enough, but there are potentially even more dangerous consequences of Jan. 6. The global rollback of democracy has been led by two rising authoritarian countries, Russia and China. Both powers have irredentist claims on other people’s territory. President Putin has stated openly that he does not believe Ukraine to be a legitimately independent country but rather part of a much larger Russia. He has massed troops on Ukraine’s borders and has been testing Western responses to potential aggression. President Xi of China has asserted that Taiwan must eventually return to China, and Chinese leaders have not excluded the use of military force, if necessary. A key factor in any future military aggression by either country will be the potential role of the United States, which has not extended clear security guarantees to either Ukraine or Taiwan but has been supportive militarily and ideologically aligned with those countries’ efforts to become real democracies. If momentum had built in the Republican Party to renounce the events of Jan. 6 the way it ultimately abandoned Richard Nixon in 1974, we might have hoped that the country might move on from the Trump era. But this has not happened, and foreign adversaries like Russia and China are watching this situation with unconstrained glee. If issues like vaccinations and mask-wearing have become politicized and divisive, consider how a future decision to extend military support — or to deny such support — to either Ukraine or Taiwan would be greeted. Mr. Trump undermined the bipartisan consensus that existed since the late 1940s over America’s strong support for a liberal international role, and President Biden has not yet been able to re-establish it. The single greatest weakness of the United States today lies in its internal divisions. Conservative pundits have traveled to illiberal Hungary to seek an alternative model, and a dismaying number of Republicans see the Democrats as a greater threat than Russia. The United States retains a huge amount of economic and military power, but that power is not usable in the absence of domestic political consensus over the country’s international role. If Americans cease to believe in an open, tolerant and liberal society, our capacity to innovate and lead as the world’s foremost economic power will also diminish. Jan. 6 sealed and deepened the country’s divisions, and for that reason it will have consequences echoing across the globe in the years to come.

2022-01-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/world/asia/kazakhstan-putin-russia.html,"In Kazakhstan, Putin Again Seizes on Unrest to Try to Expand Influence","Long adept at stoking unrest in the West, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sent troops to the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan on Thursday to try to extinguish the latest in a series of dangerous fires to engulf the lands of the former Soviet Union, territory that Moscow views as its own sphere of influence but has struggled to keep calm. But if the turmoil in Kazakhstan has once again exposed the vulnerability of the strongman leaders the Kremlin has trusted to keep order, it has also presented Russia with yet another opportunity to reassert its influence in its former Soviet domain, one of Mr. Putin’s most cherished long-term goals. The arrival in Kazakhstan of 2,500 troops from a Russian-led military alliance amid continuing spasms of violent protest was the fourth time in just two years that Moscow has flexed its muscle in neighboring states — Belarus, Armenia and Ukraine being the other three — that the West has long tried to woo. The spectacle of a country like Kazakhstan “that seems big and strong” falling into disarray so quickly has come as a shock, said Maxim Suchkov, acting director of the Institute for International Studies at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. But it has also shown how, with the exception of Ukraine, in the former Soviet republics that have tried to balance between East and West, “boom, you get a crisis and they turn to Russia.” And once Russian troops arrive, they seldom, if ever, go home. Russian troops sent three decades ago as “peacekeepers” to the breakaway region of Moldova and the Abkhazia region of Georgia are still there. Mr. Suchkov said that the unrest in Kazakhstan can be seen as a “serious crisis that Russia is interested in turning into an opportunity.” Yet, many question how many brush fires can spring up around Russia’s borders before a similar conflagration is ignited at home. “If something like this can happen in Kazakhstan,” said Scott Horton, a law lecturer at Columbia University who has advised officials in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries over two decades, “it can certainly happen in Russia, too.” Other analysts say that as much as Mr. Putin delights at unrest in Europe and the United States as evidence that democracy is failing, he takes little pleasure in turmoil on Russia’s own doorstep, no matter what the short-term opportunity. All the same, Mr. Horton said, “Putin is playing, or perhaps overplaying, a weak hand very well.” It wouldn’t be the first time. After offering in August 2020 to provide what he called “comprehensive assistance” to help President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of neighboring Belarus halt a wave of huge protests, Mr. Putin then sent “peacekeepers” to stop a vicious war over disputed territory between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Russia has stationed more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine to press demands that Kyiv abandon its yearslong flirtation with NATO. Among the soldiers sent to Kazakhstan were members of the 45th Brigade, an elite Spetsnaz, or special forces, unit infamous for its operations in the first and second wars in Chechnya, the once restive but now brutally pacified Caucasus region of Russia. The brigade has also been active in South Ossetia, a region of Georgia at the center of that country’s 2008 war with Russia; in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and in Syria. How much this assertive role really contributes to Mr. Putin’s longstanding goal of restoring Russian dominance over much of the former Soviet sphere is a matter of heated debate. In Ukraine, it has mainly achieved the opposite, turning what had been a generally Russia-friendly population in large parts of the country into a sworn enemy. It has also set nerves on edge outside the former Soviet space and played into the hands of anti-Russian hawks, reviving a previously dormant debate in Sweden and Finland about whether they should join or at least more closely associate with NATO. When Kazakhstan bolted from the Soviet Union three decades ago, it held the world’s fourth-biggest stock of nuclear weapons, vast reserves of oil and so much promise and peril that Secretary of States James A. Baker III, rushed to the new country to try to cement ties by drinking vodka with its leader, Nursultan Nazarbayev, in the sauna and accepting blows from a tree branch. “Get me the president of the United States on the phone,” the American ambassador to Moscow at the time, Robert S. Strauss, who was also there, joked to the security detail. “His secretary of state is buck naked, and he’s being beaten by the president of Kazakhstan.” Since then, Kazakhstan has given up its nuclear arms, welcomed American energy giants like Chevron and Exxon Mobil to develop its oil fields and become such a trusted partner that, in a message to its current leader last September, President Biden told President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev that “the United States is proud to call your country a friend.” Throughout, however, people have been beaten, not just playfully in the sauna but viciously in detention centers and on the street. While its record of repression may be less severe than in other former Soviet republics in Central Asia, like Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, according to Amnesty International, it does include widespread “torture and other ill treatment in penitentiary institutions.” But in the post-Soviet revival of the Great Game, the 19th-century struggle between colonial powers across Central Asia, human rights have never been a particularly important factor in the calculations of the United States — and even less so in those of its main competitors in the region, Russia and, over the past decade, China. For Mukhtar Ablyazov, a Kazakh tycoon who fled into exile after falling out with his former patron, Mr. Nazarbayev, the current wave of protests and the Kazakh government’s appeal to Moscow for military help to crush them is proof that the West miscalculated and handed Russia a big win. Kazakhstan, he said on Thursday as Russian troops deployed, succeeded in “putting the international community to sleep” with promises of big contracts. “The result: Kazakhstan is now under the boot of Putin, who takes advantage of this to extend his power.” Steve LeVine, the author of “The Oil and The Glory,” a chronicle of the struggle between Moscow and Washington in the region after the collapse of communism, said America’s understanding of Kazakhstan in its early years as an independent state was “almost entirely” through the Tengiz oil fields. But, he added, Kazakhstan still developed into a far more stable, prosperous and tolerant country than its neighbors. “Kazakhstan is not a democracy, but it is a Central Asian democracy,” he said. “The region is run by strongmen.” Such leaders, to Mr. Putin’s dismay, have proved surprisingly brittle, a fact that has repeatedly confronted the Kremlin along its borders with eruptions of the kind of discontent it has sought to keep bottled up at home. But their weakness has also made Mr. Putin the indispensable protector that they turn to in times of crisis. Alexander Cooley, a professor of political science at Barnard College and an authority on Central Asia, said that Russia is unlikely to demand immediate concessions from President Tokayev but has gained strong leverage, upsetting Kazakhstan’s previous efforts to avoid tilting too far toward either Moscow or Washington. “Kazakhstan always tried to maintain a balancing act,” he said. “This is all about regime survival. State security needs have been reconfigured to fit the needs of those in power.” The Kazakh authorities say that dozens of protesters have died in the unrest so far with many more injured, and that 18 security officers have been killed. If the clashes drag on, the Kremlin could wind up alienating a broad swath of the Kazakh population, which in large cities like Almaty often speaks Russian and had been relatively pro-Russian. That would repeat the scenario in Ukraine, where anti-Russian sentiment has become so strong it is unlikely to subside for years or decades. But Mr. Tokayev, who took over as president in 2019 from Mr. Nazarbayev, the leader Mr. Baker joined in the sauna, is now beholden to Russia both for support in suppressing protesters and in removing Mr. Nazarbayev from his last post as head of the National Security Council on Wednesday. Such assistance is seldom offered free of charge, particularly not by as canny a tactician as Mr. Putin. Valerie Hopkins in Moscow and Andrew Kramer in Kyiv contributed reporting.",4
2022-01-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/opinion/russia-ukraine-putin-nato.html,Opinion | The Ukraine Crisis Is About Much More Than Ukraine,"MOSCOW — President Vladimir Putin of Russia is playing a game of suspense. When he kicked over the global chessboard late last year, amassing thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, he sent the world into panic. An invasion seemed imminent — and beyond it loomed the threat of a new global confrontation, contested by nuclear-armed powers. Things haven’t calmed down since: A call between Mr. Putin and President Biden on Dec. 30, where the leaders traded threats, did little to take the sting out of the situation. Any incident along the Russian-Ukrainian border could bring an inferno. The Kremlin’s reasoning for the escalation is curious. It is acting in response, it maintains, to the West’s “drawing Ukraine into NATO” and NATO’s encroachment on what the Kremlin views as Russia’s area of influence. But that looks like a bluff, or even trolling. The truth is that NATO, for all its welcoming gestures, is not ready to offer Ukraine membership. So what is Mr. Putin’s endgame? The immediate aim, to be sure, is to return Ukraine to Russia’s orbit. But that’s only a brush stroke on a much bigger canvas. Mr. Putin’s design is grand: to refashion the post-Cold War settlement, in the process guaranteeing the survival of Russia’s personalized power system. And judging from the West’s awkward, anguished response so far, he might be close to getting what he wants. In recent years, Mr. Putin has successfully revived Russia’s tradition of one-man rule by amending the Constitution, rewriting history and clamping down on the opposition. Now he seeks to provide the system with a sturdy Great Power spine, returning to Russia its global glamour. In the past decade, Mr. Putin’s Russia not only demonstrated its readiness to resume control over the former Soviet space, testing its ambitions in Georgia and Ukraine, but also left its footprints all over the world, including through meddling in Western democracies. Yet today’s standoff over Ukraine takes things to a new level. No longer content with upsetting the West, Mr. Putin is now trying to force it to agree to a new global dispensation, with Russia restored to eminence. It doesn’t stop there, though. Crucially, the geopolitical advance would serve to safeguard Mr. Putin’s rule. So the West, by accepting Russia’s geopolitical position, would effectively underwrite its domestic agenda, too. The United States would become, at home and abroad, Russia’s security provider. It’s quite the gambit. The timing is crucial. With the European Union consumed by its own challenges and the United States’ rivalry with China yet to reach top gear, the Kremlin is seizing the moment to pursue its grand design. To do so, it could put on the war helmet at any moment. But confrontation is not the Kremlin’s goal. The escalation is about peace on Russia’s terms. Right now, it’s hard to know what comes next. Mr. Putin can’t force his Western opponents to surrender; neither is he ready to retreat. But he could use both concessions and refusals to pursue his agenda. Concessions, such as NATO explicitly pledging not to expand any further east, would be presented as victories, and refusals as the pretext for further escalation. One success is already clear: The West has been forced to reward Russia — through outreach, diplomacy and, above all, attention — for the charitable act of not invading Ukraine. Russia’s rebellion threatens to turn geopolitics into a battle of threats — force on one side, sanctions on the other. Mr. Putin’s method is tried and tested: He ratchets up the tensions and then demands “binding agreements,” which he does not take seriously. The aim, really, is a Hobbesian world order, built on disruption and readiness for surprise breakthroughs. This order has nothing in common with those fashioned at the Yalta Conference in 1945, say, or the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Their architects followed the rules. The Kremlin is suggesting something very different: the irrelevance of rules. The norms by which the world has been governed for the past three decades would be thrown out, in favor of creative interpretation of the possible. In this free-for-all, Mr. Putin — mercurial master of suspense and the sudden move — can pursue his fusion of geopolitical power and personal rule. Today, Ukraine is the jewel to fight for. But it won’t end there: Belarus, whose embattled leader relies on Russia’s support, could be the next prize in the geopolitical rivalry — or perhaps it will be Kazakhstan, where popular anger at the corrupt, Russian-backed regime has erupted. The drama is just beginning. Other neighboring countries could become hostages of Russia’s system of survival, which requires external domination for the sake of internal security. So far, the Kremlin has been extremely lucky, or extraordinarily skilled, in playing a weak hand without aces up its sleeve. It deals with a Western establishment determined to maintain the status quo, even if that means accommodation. After all, the nature of globalization precludes serious containment policy: How can the West deter Russia when it is enmeshed in a web of economic and security ties with the Russian state? Mr. Putin no doubt senses the advantage. Having dealt with the Western leaders for decades, he seems to have concluded that he can play bully. That the United States quickly agreed to start talks suggests Mr. Putin’s strategy is working: It could take months before Western partners discover that they have been engaged in an exchange of hot air. They clearly have yet to work out how to respond to the Kremlin’s policy of suspense. By forcing the world to guess what Russia is up to and pursuing mutually contradictory policy lines simultaneously, the Kremlin keeps the West disoriented. Accustomed to functioning in rational, risk-averse ways, the West doesn’t know how to react to such “organized chaos.” There are several traps into which Russia and the West could fall. The kind of sanctions the Biden administration is reportedly considering could be devastating for the Russian state and its elites, which are integrated into the West. And ordinary Russians are not going to sacrifice their living standards indefinitely for wars and antagonism. According to the independent Levada Center, in 2021 only 32 percent of Russians wanted to see Russia as “a great power respected and feared by other countries,” and just 16 percent thought the war could raise Mr. Putin’s authority. The patriotic drug of militarism has started to wear off. There is a Catch-22 for the West, too: Any bargain that would allow the Kremlin to interpret the global rules of the game would undermine Western principles. Yet rejecting the bargain could incite the Kremlin to wreck the whole shop. The world’s liberal democracies are hardly ready for a clash with a nuclear opponent. This is a deadlock, and there appears to be no way out. Both sides continue to play “who blinks first”: America and its allies have set out to reassure Ukraine of their support, while Russia has kept the hammer of military deployment ready. A meeting in Moscow on Thursday between representatives of Russia, France and Germany made little headway. Negotiations begin in earnest next week, as Russia and America — later joined by NATO members — aim to find the areas where agreement is possible and where it isn’t. It’s a tall order. And even if such efforts manage to temporarily tamp down the situation, mutual suspicion will linger. The reason is simple: For as long as Mr. Putin holds sway, his grand design will never be far away.

2022-01-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/world/asia/kazakhstan-protests-strongmen.html,"Behind Kazakhstan Unrest, the ‘Strongman’s Dilemma’","To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. Kazakhstan’s explosion into unrest this week presents a stark warning to the strongman autocrats of the world: Leaving office is perilous. Since the Cold War’s end, a staggering 70 percent of governments headed by strongmen collapsed after the ruler departed, according to one data set. The trend holds whether the leader leaves voluntarily or involuntarily, dies in office or retires to a country home. Sometimes, as in Spain after Francisco Franco’s death in 1975, it opens the way to democratization. More often, as in Egypt, Sudan, Zimbabwe and many others, the result is a cycle of coups, civil conflict or other violence. Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s lifelong leader until he began gradually handing power to a successor in 2019, was, by all appearances, keenly aware of this problem. He told an interviewer in 2014 that any country like his needed “a sustainable system put in place that would be stable against the backdrop of a new leader’s arrival,” ticking through Malaysia or Singapore as possible models. Mr. Nazarbayev stage-managed his own departure in ways that suggest painstaking attention to the lessons of history, and his transition was watched closely in Moscow and other capitals as a potential model. His departure does not appear to have specifically set off Kazakhstan’s protests. But the unrest, the government’s failure to maintain support and now its flailing response are typical of the divided, disoriented bureaucracies that often falter after a strongman’s departure. The lesson, experts stress, is hardly that strongmen bring stability. Quite the opposite: Their style of rule erodes the foundations of governance, making themselves indispensable at the cost of leaving behind a political system barely capable of governing but primed for infighting. Autocrats like Mr. Nazarbayev who stand alone at the top, as opposed to those who rule on behalf of a larger party apparatus as in Cuba or Vietnam, face a tricky challenge. They must strike a balance between all of their country’s internal factions, ruling elites, security services and military brass, guaranteeing each enough power and spoils to keep them bought in, but without letting any grow powerful enough to challenge them. As a result, strongmen-led dictatorships tend to be more repressive and more corrupt. And their leaders frequently obsess over potential rivals, whether a regional leader who grows too popular or a security agency with too much autonomy. In his 29 years of rule, Mr. Nazarbayev was, like many such leaders, notorious for shuffling his government, promoting and demoting deputies to keep them off balance. But stifling rising stars, hollowing out power centers and stuffing institutions with loyalists (often chosen because they are too weak to pose a threat) leaves the government barely able to stand on its own. And it creates what some scholars call the strongman’s dilemma: how to set up a successor without creating a rival, and how to leave a government able to outlast the leader without making themselves redundant and vulnerable. Some try to solve this by grooming family members. Two of the rare successes followed this model: Azerbaijan and Syria, where dying autocrats passed power to their sons. Still, children often prove unable to win the necessary support, inviting challengers to try to take power themselves. North Korea is the only modern non-monarchy to have reached a third generation of family autocratic rule. Appointing flunkies or other easily controlled subordinates creates a similar problem. But staying in office indefinitely is little better. As the leader’s health inevitably falters, rivals or even allies may be tempted to grab for power before someone else can take it first. Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was 93 and visibly declining when he was deposed in a coup. This is why despots tend to hide from public view when they have health problems, to avoid any appearance of frailty that might set off a race to replace them. It’s also why the disappearance of a dictator, even a reviled one, tends to produce panicked rumors as citizens fear the consequences of a power vacuum. When strongman rule works, the leader is the keystone holding it all together. But any keystone is also the point of greatest weakness. If it falls away, the whole thing collapses. Which is precisely what often happens. “The moment of transfer has almost always been a moment of crisis,” the scholar Andrew Nathan has written, “involving purges or arrests, factionalism, sometimes violence, and opening the door to the chaotic intrusion into the political process of the masses or the military.” This dilemma has especially hung over the former Soviet world, where autocrats have held on two or three times the average strongman’s tenure, which is about a decade. But longer rule means a longer fall, for the leader and their country, once they inevitably depart. This has heightened the stakes, with many post-Soviet leaders extending term limits. Vladimir V. Putin of Russia recently pushed his to 2036, when he will be 83. With every passing year, it becomes harder for autocrats to hand off power, while the risks rise of disaster if a crisis should force them out. “The odds of regime survival are very dim if the leader’s departure was forced,” said Erica Frantz, a Michigan State University scholar of authoritarianism. This is much more than a problem for strongmen. Such leaders are increasingly common worldwide, a point of convergence for both calcifying dictatorships and backsliding democracies. At least two sit in the heart of Europe. Some experts consider China, where Xi Jinping is building a cult of personality and has paved the way for lifelong rule, to now qualify. And the more of the world comes under this style of rule, the more millions of people are exposed to the dangers of a catastrophically failed succession. Mr. Nazarbayev had seemingly addressed this problem by stepping halfway out of power as a loyalist nominally took over. In theory, he was to be just present enough to keep the system together, but absent enough to allow it to coalesce around a new order. But even in such rare cases where it looks like a transition has worked, Dr. Frantz said she has found in her research, the new government tends to collapse within an average of about five years. “Their successors often face serious challenges in governance,” she said, citing Venezuela, where President Nicolás Maduro has faced ever-mounting crises since taking over from Hugo Chávez in 2013. Kazakhstan now looks like an example of this, too. It casts doubt on Mr. Nazarbayev’s supposed solution and suggests that the problem of strongman succession may be, on some level, irresolvable. It is why, just as Mr. Nazarbayev’s exit in 2019 is thought to have been closely watched in palace drawing rooms from Moscow to Manila, it is a safe bet that the turmoil he failed to forestall will be as well.

2022-01-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/world/asia/kazakhstan-protests.html,"In Kazakhstan’s Street Battles, Signs of Elites Fighting Each Other","BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan — It came as no big surprise when a crumbling oil town in western Kazakhstan stirred in protest last Sunday, 10 years after security forces there killed more than a dozen workers who had gone on strike over pay and poor conditions. But it remains a mystery how peaceful protests over a rise in fuel prices last weekend in Zhanaozen, a grimy, Soviet-era settlement near the Caspian Sea, suddenly spread more than a thousand miles across the full length of Central Asia’s largest country, turning the biggest and most prosperous Kazakh city into a war zone littered with dead bodies, burned buildings and incinerated cars. The violence this week in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s former capital and still its business and cultural hub, shocked just about everyone — not only its leader, who, fortified by Russian troops, on Friday ordered security forces to “fire without warning” to restore order, but also government critics who have long bridled at repression and rampant corruption in the oil-rich nation. The crisis coincided with a power struggle within the government, fueling talk that the people fighting in the streets were proxies for feuding factions of the political elite. On Saturday, in what appeared to be another sign of political infighting, Kazakhstan’s powerful intelligence agency said that it had arrested Karim Masimov, who only days earlier was the agency’s leader, on suspicion of treason. There is also feverish speculation about Kremlin meddling and a host of other murky possible causes. About the only thing that is clear is that the country’s convulsions involve more than a straightforward clash between protesters expressing discontent and the heavy-handed security apparatus of an authoritarian regime. With Kazakhstan now largely sealed off from the outside world — its main airports are closed or commandeered by Russian troops, while internet services and phone lines are mostly down — information is scarce. Echoing the refrain of repressive leaders around the world confronted with protests, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Friday lashed out at liberals and human rights defenders, lamenting that the authorities had been too lax. Not many people are buying that, particularly as it is a message endorsed by Russia, which on Thursday sent in troops to help Mr. Tokayev regain control and has a long record of construing all expressions of discontent at home and in other former Soviet territory as the work of disgruntled liberal troublemakers. But there is growing evidence that the mayhem in Almaty, the epicenter of this week’s turmoil, was more than just people power run amok. President Tokayev, in an address to the nation on Friday, alluded to that, claiming that the violence was the work of some 20,000 “bandits” who he said were organized from “a single command post.” Calls for negotiations with such people, he added, were “nonsense” because “they need to be destroyed and this will be done.” Danil Kislov, a Russian expert on Central Asia who runs Fergana, a news portal focused on the region, speculated that the chaos was the result of “a desperate struggle for power” between feuding political clans, namely people loyal to President Tokayev, 68, and those beholden to his 81-year-old predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev. At the height of the tumult on Wednesday, the president announced that he had taken over as head of the security council, a job held until then by Mr. Nazarbayev, who stepped down as president in 2019 but retained wide powers and was given the honorary title of Elbasy, or leader of the nation. President Tokayev also fired Mr. Nazarbayev’s nephew Samat Abish as deputy head of the main security service and purged several others close to the former president. The riots in Almaty, Mr. Kislov said, appeared to be an attempt by members of Mr. Nazarbayev’s political clan to reverse their eclipse. “This was all artificially organized by people who really had power in their hands,” he said, adding that Mr. Nazarbayev’s ousted nephew seems to have played a major role in organizing the unrest. Galym Ageleulov, a human-rights activist in Almaty who took part in what began as a peaceful demonstration on Wednesday, said police officers monitoring the protest suddenly vanished around lunchtime. And “then this crowd came,” he said, an unruly mob of what seemed more like thugs than the kind of people — students, bookish dissidents and middle-class malcontents — who usually turn out for protests in Kazakhstan. He said the mob was “clearly organized by crime group marauders” and surged down main streets toward Akimat, the City Hall, setting cars on fire and storming government offices. Among those who urged the crowd on was Arman Dzhumageldiev, known as “Arman the Wild,” by reputation one of the country’s most powerful gangsters, who witnesses said provoked much of the violence. He gave frantic speeches on Almaty’s central square as government buildings blazed behind him, calling for people to press the government to make concessions and mocking as a “coward” Mukhtar Ablyazov, an exiled tycoon who is a bitter personal enemy of Kazakhstan’s longtime former president, Mr. Nazarbayev. On Friday, the interior ministry said that its special forces unit had arrested Mr. Dzhumageldiev, together with five accomplices. Mr. Dzhumageldiev was the leader of an organized criminal gang, the ministry said. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told reporters in Washington on Friday that the United States still has questions about Mr. Tokayev’s request for military reinforcements from a Russian-led alliance. “It’s not clear why they feel the need for any outside assistance, so we’re trying to learn more about it,” he said. “One lesson in recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it’s sometimes very difficult to get them to leave,” Mr. Blinken added. Later on Friday, the State Department said it was allowing nonemergency personnel at its consulate general in Almaty to leave voluntarily, citing the potential for sudden eruptions of violence. That a possible power struggle could have morphed so quickly into mayhem on the streets is a measure of how brittle Kazakhstan is beneath the shiny surface of wealthy, cosmopolitan cities like Almaty. Discontent, even if exploited by political elites, is very real. The country is less repressive than most in a region dominated by brutal strongmen — the former dictator of neighboring Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, was accused of boiling his critics in vats of oil and having hundreds of protesters massacred in the town of Andijan in 2005. But whatever the relative tolerance of their leaders, many Kazakhs still resent a kleptocratic elite that has poured billions into showcase projects like the construction of a new capital, named Nursultan in honor of the former president, while neglecting the well-being of many ordinary people. The roots of that discontent are in places like Zhanaozen, the western oil town where this week’s protests began — and where security forces in December 2011 opened fire on a group of striking workers. Unlike protests in Almaty, those in Zhanaozen and other western towns along the Caspian Sea, the center of the Kazakh oil industry, have been peaceful throughout the week. The region’s senior official, Zhanarbek Baktybaev, said on Friday that there had been no violence, lamenting that “as you know, in some region of our country there have been riots and looting by terrorist elements.” Vital services, he said, were all working normally. Mukhtar Umbetov, a lawyer for the independent trade union in Aktau, next to Zhanaozen, said by telephone that protests had continued with no violence in the west of the country, and expressed the anger of ordinary workers over rising inflation and stagnant salaries. “Kazakhstan is a rich country,” Mr. Umbetov said, “but these resources do not work in the interests of the people, they work in the interests of the elites. There is a huge stratification of society.” Shocked by violence a decade ago in western Kazakhstan, a country that Washington regarded as a stable and dependable partner, the Senate and House held a joint hearing attended by experts on the country, including a former U.S. ambassador there, William B. Courtney. Mr. Courtney described the December 2011 bloodshed “as an aberration” but “symptomatic of the wide gap between rulers and ruled, between reality and expectations, between those who live honestly and those who do not.” Kazakhstan’s political development, he added, “is stunted by 20 years of authoritarian rule.” The title of the hearing: “Kazakhstan: As Stable as its Government Claims?” If nothing else, the events of the past week have at least answered that question.

2022-01-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/08/world/europe/kazakhstan-russia.html,"Amid Crisis, Kazakhstan's Leader Embraces Russia","MOSCOW — The embattled president of Kazakhstan has the pedigree of an international technocrat. The son of prominent intellectuals, he studied in Moscow at a premier academy for diplomats, and later worked in the Soviet Embassy in Beijing. He served as a key adviser to the strongman who ruled the oil-rich Central Asian country as a fief for nearly three decades — and then, in 2019, became his heir. The rise of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to the presidency was looked at as a possible model by other authoritarian regimes on how to conduct a leadership transition without losing their grip on power. Instead, Kazakhstan erupted in violence this week and Mr. Tokayev has overseen a ruthless crackdown on protesters while ousting his former benefactor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, 81, from his last foothold of authority, as head of the nation’s powerful security council. For support, Mr. Tokayev has turned to another autocrat: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. It is too soon to know for certain whether Kazakhstan’s moment of crisis will be a victory for Mr. Putin, who quickly responded to Mr. Tokayev’s request for help by sending troops as part of a Russia-led effort to quell the uprising. Moscow has a history of sending “peacekeeping” forces to countries that never leave. And Mr. Putin is intent on maintaining a sphere of Russian influence that includes former Soviet republics like Kazakhstan. But analysts and experts on Central Asia say that when his government was under siege and his own position was teetering, Mr. Tokayev, 68, was neither powerful enough nor independent enough to go it alone. And his swift alignment with Moscow portends potentially transformative changes in a region that has seen fierce jockeying for influence among the United States, Russia and China. In effect, analysts said, against a backdrop of chaos and violence, Mr. Tokayev chose Russia to ensure his own political survival. The Kazakh president “traded his country’s sovereignty to Russia for his own power and the interests of kleptocratic elites,” said Erica Marat, a professor at National Defense University, a military university in Washington. This move “is really about making Kazakhstan a more submissive, more loyal partner,” she said, adding that Kazakhstan would “have to be more aligned with Russia against the West in geopolitical and global matters.” In a menacing speech on Friday, in which he warned that government security forces could shoot to kill to suppress protests, Mr. Tokayev displayed deference to Mr. Putin, offering special thanks to the Russian leader for providing assistance “very promptly and, most importantly, warmly, in a friendly way.” He again expressed “special gratitude” to Russia in a phone call with Mr. Putin on Saturday, the Kremlin said. But the relationship between the two leaders features a significant imbalance in stature: At a news conference last month in Moscow, Mr. Putin seemed unable to remember Mr. Tokayev’s name. Mr. Tokayev took office, handpicked by Mr. Nazarbayev, pledging to turn the autocracy into a “listening state” that was “overcoming the fear of alternative opinion.” His transformation almost three years later to a leader promising this week to “fire without warning” at the protesters, is a drastic one, said Luca Anceschi, a professor of Eurasian Studies at the University of Glasgow. “He has become a truly authoritarian leader, projecting power which he doesn’t really have,” Dr. Anceschi said. “If you have to rely on power from Russia, are you powerful?” he added. When protests turned violent this week, Mr. Tokayev responded by dismissing his cabinet and ousting Mr. Nazarbayev, who had retained great influence as the “leader of the nation,” the chairman of the ruling Nur Otan party and the head of the nation’s security council. Mr. Tokayev also fired Mr. Nazarbayev’s key allies from prominent roles in the country’s vast security apparatus. Then pitched battles broke out. The timing of the shift from the initial, peaceful protests in the country’s West to the violence and looting in Almaty — which intensified after Mr. Nazarbayev and his loyal head of the country’s powerful intelligence agency, Karim Masimov, were fired — has given rise to widespread speculation that the rioters were organized by proxies for feuding factions of the political elite, pitting Mr. Nazarbayev and his allies against Mr. Tokayev. Into the security vacuum, at Mr. Tokayev’s request, came elite troops — mostly Russian — from a Kremlin-sponsored alliance called the Collective Security Treaty Organization, Russia’s version of NATO. Internally, Mr. Tokayev’s decision to welcome the soldiers, tanks and airplanes from the alliance could further erode public trust in the president. Many working-class Kazakhs have long been furious at the corruption that funnels the wealth from Central Asia’s biggest economy to an elite few. Seeing a leader who supported and benefited from that system, and now chooses to be propped up by Moscow instead of listening to genuine grievances, will infuriate ordinary Kazakhstanis, Dr. Marat said. “People did not come on the streets to ask for Russian interference in their daily lives,” she said. For Mr. Putin, dispatching troops to Kazakhstan represents “a low-cost engagement with high returns,” Dr. Marat said. For decades, Mr. Tokayev built a reputation as an effective technocrat adept at helping Mr. Nazarbayev balance Kazakhstan’s foreign policy between its increasingly assertive neighbors, China and Russia, and its powerful economic investor, the United States. And for 28 years, he was effectively Mr. Nazarbayev’s understudy. Since taking office, Mr. Tokayev has not had to contend with real political competition. Under his leadership, there has been a significant crackdown on opposition parties, human rights groups say. And genuine opposition figures are “consistently marginalized,” according to the watchdog Freedom House, while “freedoms of speech and assembly remain restricted.” But now, the president has to contend with apparent rivals inside the top echelons of government — some of the people closest to Mr. Nazarbayev, several analysts said. Days after the protests began on Jan. 2 over ballooning inflation and rising fuel prices, Mr. Tokayev said he would rescind the price increases. But demonstrators had already begun demanding the end of the kleptocratic political system that Mr. Nazarbayev had built and maintained since the country declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By midweek, protesters were shouting, “Shal ket!” — or “Old man out!” — in reference to Mr. Nazarbayev. But then Mr. Tokayev fired the former president and the intelligence agency chief, Mr. Masimov, along with Mr. Nazarbayev’s nephew, who was the agency’s second in command. Mr. Masimov was detained on suspicion of “high treason” on Thursday, the agency — known as the National Security Committee — said in a statement on Saturday. Rioters soon broke into at least one government weapons depot, where they met little resistance, according to local news reports. They raced to take over government buildings and the airport in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city and economic center, where most of the unrest took place. (Elsewhere in the country, especially the West, protests remained peaceful.) Akezhan Kazhegeldin, who served as prime minister of Kazakhstan from 1994 to 1997 but resigned over concerns about corruption, said it was likely that Mr. Tokayev determined that he had “lost control over the military and law enforcement bodies,” leading him to dismiss Mr. Nazarbayev, Mr. Masimov and the government. Mr. Kazhegeldin, who has been in exile for decades, said he was still holding out hope that Mr. Tokayev, who served as his chief of cabinet when he was prime minister, could turn things around. But he warned that it would be a mistake for Mr. Tokayev to continue seeking help from Russia, with whom Kazakhstan shares a 4,750-mile land border. Kazakhstan maintains close relations with Russia, and is a member of the single-market Eurasian Economic Union. Mr. Putin, though, has at times played down Kazakh independence, employing messaging similar to his recent statements on Ukraine. Many Kazakhs view the Soviet era with ambivalence, with some seeing it as an extension of colonial rule. “We don’t need any Russian or Belarusian help to settle the situation in one city, Almaty,” Mr. Kazhegeldin said. “We can use our nation.” Dr. Anceschi, from the University of Glasgow, suggested that the only one with a true choice amid the chaos was Mr. Putin, who decided to back Mr. Tokayev instead of Mr. Nazarbayev and Mr. Masimov. But for Mr. Tokayev, the turn to the Kremlin was an existential choice. The president, Dr. Anceschi said, “didn’t choose Russia, he chose himself.”",22
2022-01-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/opinion/ukraine-biden-putin.html,Opinion | What Putin Really Wants From the Ukraine Crisis,"Grave may have been the mistakes of Donald Rumsfeld, but George W. Bush’s first defense secretary did have a gift for memorable phrases. One of them — “weakness is provocative” — explains the predicament we again find ourselves in with Russia’s belligerence against Ukraine and NATO. Let’s recap how we got here. ■ In August 2008, Russia invaded Georgia and took control of two of its provinces. The Bush administration protested but did almost nothing. After Barack Obama won the White House that fall, he pursued a “reset” with Russia. In 2012, he cut U.S. force levels in Europe to their lowest levels in postwar history and mocked Mitt Romney for calling Russia our principal geopolitical threat. ■ In September 2013, Obama famously retreated from his red line against Bashar al-Assad’s use of nerve gas in Syria, accepting instead a Russian offer of mediation that was supposed to have eliminated al-Assad’s chemical arsenal. That arsenal was never fully destroyed, but Vladimir Putin took note of Obama’s palpable reluctance to get involved. ■ In February 2014, Russia used “little green men” to seize and then annex Crimea. The Obama administration protested but did almost nothing. Russia then took advantage of unrest in eastern Ukraine to shear off two Ukrainian provinces while sparking a war that has lasted seven years and cost more than 13,000 lives. Obama responded with weak sanctions on Russia and a persistent refusal to arm Ukraine. ■ In 2016, Donald Trump ran for office questioning how willing America should be to defend vulnerable NATO members. In 2017 he tried to block new sanctions on Russia but was effectively overruled by Congress. The Trump administration did ultimately take a tougher line on Russia and approved limited arms sales to Ukraine. But Trump also tried to hold hostage military assistance to Ukraine for political favors before he was exposed, leading to his first impeachment. Which brings us to Joe Biden, who ran for office promising a tougher line on Russia. It has been anything but. In May, his administration waived sanctions against Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, which, when operational, will increase Moscow’s energy leverage on Europe. Since coming to office, the administration has done little to increase the relatively paltry flow of military aid to Ukraine. In the face of a Russian invasion, it will be as effective as trying to put out a forest fire by peeing on it. Then there was the fiasco of our withdrawal from Afghanistan. “In the aftermath of Saigon redux,” I wrote at the time, “every enemy will draw the lesson that the United States is a feckless power.” The current Ukraine crisis is as much the child of Biden’s Afghanistan debacle as the last Ukraine crisis was the child of Obama’s Syria debacle. Now the administration is doubling down on a message of weakness by threatening “massive consequences for Russia” if it invades Ukraine, nearly all in economic sanctions. That’s bringing a knife to the proverbial gunfight. Imagine this not-so-far-fetched scenario. Russian forces move on a corner of Ukraine. The United States responds by cutting off Russia from the global banking system. But the Kremlin (which has built its gold and foreign-currency reserves to record highs) doesn’t sit still. It responds to sanctions by cutting off gas supplies in midwinter to the European Union — which gets more than 40 percent of its gas from Russia. It demands a Russia-Europe security treaty as the price of the resumption of supplies. And it freezes the United States out of the bargain, at least until Washington shows good will by abandoning financial sanctions. Such a move would force Washington to either escalate or abase itself — and this administration would almost certainly choose the latter. It would fulfill Putin’s long-held ambition to break the spine of NATO. It would further entice China into a similar mind-set of aggression, probably against Taiwan. It would be to America’s global standing what the Suez Crisis was to Britain’s. At least Pax Britannica could, in its twilight, give way to Pax Americana. But to what does Pax Americana give way? What can the United States do instead? We should break off talks with Russia now: No country ought to expect diplomatic rewards from Washington while it threatens the destruction of our friends. We should begin an emergency airlift of military equipment to Ukraine, on the scale of Richard Nixon’s 1973 airlift to Israel, including small arms useful in a guerrilla war. And we should reinforce U.S. forces in frontline NATO states, particularly Poland and the Baltics. None of this may be sufficient to stop Russia from invasion, which would be a tragedy for Ukrainians. But Putin is playing for bigger stakes in this crisis — another sliver of Ukrainian territory is merely a secondary prize. What he really wants to do is end the Western alliance as we have known it since the Atlantic Charter. As for the United States, two decades of bipartisan American weakness in the face of his aggression has us skating close to a geopolitical debacle.

2022-01-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/world/europe/russia-sanctions-ukraine-nord-stream-pipeline.html,Senate Democrats Try to Advance Russia Sanctions Over Ukraine,"Senate Democrats unveiled legislation on Wednesday that would impose sanctions on top Russian officials if Moscow invaded Ukraine, in an effort to squash a competing Republican-led bill that would impose sanctions on a Russian natural-gas pipeline that bypasses Ukraine. The Senate is expected to vote later this week on a measure led by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, that would impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2, a Russian undersea pipeline to Germany viewed as a means of exerting influence over Europe. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has both privately and publicly urged senators to support the bill, casting Nord Stream 2 as an existential threat. The pipeline would give Russia enormous leverage over Europe and would render Ukraine’s own pipeline to Poland obsolete, depriving Ukraine of substantial revenue. But the Biden administration and its allies in Congress have lobbied against Mr. Cruz’s measure, which would go into effect 15 days after being signed into law, whether or not Russia attacks. They argue that quick passage would undermine unity among the nation’s European allies, including Germany, which has championed the pipeline as vital to its industrial success. They also argue that the sanctions would have little effect on the construction of the pipeline, because it is nearly completed. They have instead encouraged Democrats wishing to penalize Russia for massing troops at Ukraine’s border to support legislation by Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat. “We support Senator Menendez’s legislation, which would trigger severe costs to Russia’s economy and support additional security assistance to Ukraine should Russia further invade,” said Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. “We will keep working with Congress on maximizing potential costs to Russia.” That approach appeared to be resonating on Wednesday with even the most vocal Democratic defenders of Ukraine, as more than two dozen members of the party signed on to Mr. Menendez’s legislation. Ten Democrats would need to back Mr. Cruz’s bill in order for it to pass, and it would likely be doomed in the Democratic-controlled House. “We need legislation that addresses the political situation we face today in response to increasing Russian aggression — not last year or two years ago,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire. “The dynamics changed and so must our strategy.” Mr. Menendez’s legislation would impose sanctions on top Russian officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, as well as the nation’s banking sector if Russia engages in or supports “a significant escalation in hostilities or hostile action in or against Ukraine.” And it would provide Ukraine with $500 million in supplemental emergency security assistance in the event that Russia invades. Republicans have argued that sanctions could still stop the completion of Nord Stream 2, and accused President Biden of indulging Russian lawlessness last year when the administration waived sanctions on the pipeline in an attempt to mend ties with Germany. New sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline were included in the annual defense policy bill last year, but were quietly stripped out of the legislation at the last minute before its final passage.",1
2022-01-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/world/europe/putin-ukraine-kazakhstan.html,"For Putin, Propping Up Allies Is Turning Into a Perilous Bargain","From Eastern Europe to the oil fields of Central Asia, President Vladimir V. Putin is straining to maintain a sphere of influence that will keep the forces of history at bay. The Russian leader’s allies, perched atop former Soviet republics, are growing old in office or face rising discontent. The bulwarks they have provided against the expanding frontiers of democracy and Western military power look increasingly shaky. So Mr. Putin is relying more on brute force to hold it all together: preparing a possible invasion of Ukraine to keep it out of NATO, sending troops to Kazakhstan to suppress protests and threatening to do the same in Belarus. Coercing allies is hardly unusual for great or regional powers. The Soviet Union, whose loss Mr. Putin often laments, sent tanks into Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan. Still, it bonded its empire through Communism, which instilled a common mission and a sense of existential conflict with the capitalist West. Now, with capitalism and at least pretensions of democracy the norm on both sides of the old Iron Curtain, there is little to justify fealty to Moscow beyond the shared desire of post-Soviet strongmen to help one another cling to office. “There’s no real ideological glue to hold together this motley alliance of people with very different interests,” said Timothy M. Frye, a Columbia University political scientist. Mr. Putin’s sphere of influence, for all the trouble it causes the West, is increasingly a cage of his own making. The more that he relies on force to prop up aging, unpopular autocrats on his periphery, the more besieged his alliance becomes, both by dissent at home and Western pressure abroad. As a result, the very threats that Mr. Putin hoped to avert are instead growing. Ukraine is rushing into the West’s arms. Provocations by Belarus, rooted in its crackdown on rising dissent, are uniting Europe against its pro-Moscow leader. And protesters in long-stable Kazakhstan are demanding change. Mr. Putin has sought to turn his reactive escalations into a strength at home, portraying his interventions into those countries’ problems as reclaiming Soviet greatness. But a tepid public reaction, as well as the Kremlin’s recent crackdowns on civil society and political rivals, Dr. Frye said, indicated that “the usual narratives that Putin has used to shore up his rule are just not working as well.” Mr. Putin’s fear of democratic encroachment is often traced to the so-called color revolution democratic uprisings that swept several former Soviet republics in the 2000s. He and his deputies still speak often of those events, usually as Western plots to subvert Russian power. But Mr. Putin’s response did not crystallize until 2012, when he cracked down violently on protests against him in Russia. Many of the demonstrators belonged to the Russian middle class that had once widely backed him. This elevated hard-liners within his administration, while also leading Mr. Putin to shift his power base to security services. The Kremlin, increasingly hawkish and nationalistic, even paranoid, settled on a strategy of propping up neighboring leaders who would control dissent and oppose the West. As a result, Mr. Putin came to believe that only leaders who look like him — autocratic strongmen — could be trusted to keep the dangers of democracy and Western influence at bay. Any others would have to be forced into loyalty. After Ukrainian protesters ejected their country’s pro-Moscow president in 2014, Mr. Putin did not seek to persuade newly empowered Ukrainian voters to align with Moscow. Rather, hoping to strong-arm Ukrainian leaders into obedience, Russia invaded and annexed one part of Ukraine and sponsored separatists in another. So far, this strategy has largely backfired. Western powers increased their support for Ukraine, and Ukrainian voters, once divided over relations with Russia, turned sharply against it. But Mr. Putin, perhaps unable to see a neighboring democracy as anything other than a threat, has only escalated his efforts, and is now threatening a major invasion of Ukraine. This may well forestall overt alignment between Ukraine and the West, or even force Washington to redouble its acknowledgment of Russian interests there. But one danger for Mr. Putin is that it may not work forever and, once failed, could see yet another former Soviet republic join the European institutions that he insists are a threat to him. Mr. Putin’s reliance on fellow strongmen has proved nearly as risky. Strongman-ruled countries, which concentrate power in one person’s hands at the expense of governing institutions, tend to be more unstable, more corrupt and less economically effective, all of which deepen public dissatisfaction. The dangers of this can be seen in Kazakhstan, where a carefully planned transition from one leader to the next broke down into violent unrest. Mr. Putin sent a Russian-led force of 2,500 troops to Kazakhstan to help put down the turmoil, at a time when tensions with Ukraine and Belarus were already simmering. It has been an illustration of the perilous bargain holding Mr. Putin and his allies together, in which they are essentially obligated to guarantee one another’s rule by force. Strongman leaders are also likelier to start conflicts and likelier to lose them, Erica Frantz, a Michigan State University scholar of authoritarianism, said she has found in her research. “Personalists don’t have to bargain over policy, and lack of accountability leads to riskier behavior,” she said, using a formal term for such leaders. While their fear of democracy makes them useful allies to Mr. Putin, the downsides of their rule increasingly bedevil his informal alliance. “Provocations are what we would expect. We’d also expect some of his moves to be bad choices,” Dr. Frantz said. Even with democracy’s global travails, it has nonetheless remained widely accepted since the Cold War’s end, beyond a handful of countries like China or Cuba, as the default, forcing even unabashed dictators to at least pretend at democracy. The result is a circle of pro-Moscow strongmen who frequently struggle to persuade their citizens why it is necessary to accept fewer freedoms than those in neighboring countries. Belarus exemplifies the dangers. Last year, as dissent rose over the government’s failures to address the pandemic, the president’s escalating crackdowns became a source of diplomatic conflict with the rest of Europe, which ensnared Mr. Putin. Some Belarusian opposition activists, aware of Russia’s influence, signaled their openness to working with Moscow. But, in what may be a reflection of the Kremlin’s narrow insistence on familiar autocrats, for all their missteps, it has ignored their outreach. Much as with Ukraine, Mr. Putin is left with a strategy in Belarus or Kazakhstan of ever-escalating coercion, albeit conducted through his allies in office. These cycles, of shoring up a sphere of influence built on distrust and intimidation, can take on a logic of their own. So the strategy is pursued even when it appears likely to produce the opposite of Mr. Putin’s hoped-for results: both inviting the very threats he fears and eroding the alliance on which he has rested so much of his future. “It will certainly produce more militarization of the alliance’s eastern flank,” Emma Ashford, a researcher at the Atlantic Council research group wrote of NATO’s likely response to Russia’s threats against Ukraine. “Just because we think it’s a stupid, self-defeating move on the part of Russia doesn’t mean they won’t do it.”",4
2022-01-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/opinion/us-russia-putin-ukraine.html,"Opinion | On Russia, NATO and Ukraine, the U.S. Must Stop Lying to Itself","At the heart of the current crisis between Washington and Moscow is this: Vladimir Putin has massed troops on Russia’s border with Ukraine and implied that he may invade unless he receives a guarantee that Ukraine will never join NATO. The Biden administration rejects that demand out of hand. Powerful nations, it insists, cannot demand that their neighbors fall under their spheres of influence. As Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken put it last month, “One country does not have the right to dictate the policies of another or to tell that country with whom it may associate; one country does not have the right to exert a sphere of influence. That notion should be relegated to the dustbin of history.” It’s a noble principle, just not one the United States abides by. The United States has exercised a sphere of influence in its own hemisphere for almost 200 years, since President James Monroe, in his seventh annual message to Congress, declared that the United States “should consider any attempt” by foreign powers “to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.” Listening to Mr. Blinken, you might think the United States long ago deposited this prerogative over the foreign policies of its southern neighbors in history’s dustbin. It has done no such thing. In 2018, Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, called the Monroe Doctrine “as relevant today as it was the day it was written.” The following year, his national security adviser, John Bolton, boasted that “the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well.” To be sure, the United States doesn’t enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the same way it did in the first half of the 20th century, when it regularly deployed the Marines to Central America and the Caribbean, or during the Cold War, when the C.I.A. helped topple leftist governments. Washington’s methods have changed. It now prefers using economic coercion to punish governments that ally with adversaries and challenge its regional dominion. Consider Washington’s decades-long embargo of Cuba. U.S. officials may claim the embargo’s goal is to promote democracy, but virtually every other government on earth — democracies included — views it as an act of political bullying. Last year, the United Nations General Assembly condemned the embargo by a vote of 184 to 2. Human Rights Watch has denounced it for imposing “indiscriminate hardship on the Cuban population.” Biden officials do not celebrate the Monroe Doctrine as their Trump administration predecessors did. But they still muscle America’s neighbors. Mr. Biden hasn’t eased the embargo of Cuba. Nor has he ended Mr. Trump’s effort to cut off Venezuela, another autocratic government that flirts with America’s foes, from global trade. The United States, in the words of one European Union official, is still prepared to “starve Venezuelans until their leadership surrender or their people oust them.” These policies serve notice to other Latin American governments that defying Washington can bring grave costs. The United States also wields considerable influence through its “soft power.” Because the United States has a dynamic economy and an open society, close relations with Washington are more attractive to America’s neighbors than close relations with Moscow are to Russia’s. Still, within the velvet glove remains an iron fist. As Erika Pani, a historian of U.S. and Mexican politics at El Colegio de México, explained to me, “The Mexican government has, historically, been clear it can’t do absolutely anything it wants” in international affairs because “if you live right next to the elephant, you know it is best not to provoke him.” Mexico, whose long border with the United States offers a parallel to Ukraine’s proximity to Russia, can publicly disagree with U.S. foreign policy, but it couldn’t join a military alliance with U.S. adversaries. It’s impossible to imagine a Mexican government inviting Russian or Chinese troops onto its side of the Rio Grande. None of this means Russia has the right to dominate Ukraine. If America’s regional bullying is wrong, Moscow’s cruder version — which currently consists of troops massed on Ukraine’s border — is even worse. But the problem with the Biden administration’s willful naïveté about U.S. policy toward Latin America is that it fosters a willful naïveté about the way international politics actually works. Of course, Ukraine has the right to forge an independent foreign policy. But foreign policy isn’t an exercise in abstract morality; it involves questions of power. And the United States and its European allies lack the power to deny Russia a say over Ukraine’s future because they are not willing to send their sons and daughters to fight there. Implicitly, the Biden administration has already conceded that: NATO has no plans to admit Ukraine anytime soon because doing so would commit the United States and Europe to Ukraine’s defense. And there’s no chance the United States and Europe will make that commitment if it could mean fighting Russian troops. So long as Moscow is ready to threaten war, it can keep Ukraine out of NATO. The Biden administration just doesn’t want to admit that publicly, for fear of demoralizing the Ukrainian government and encouraging Mr. Putin to make even greater threats. As Thomas Graham and Rajan Menon have suggested, the best solution may be artful diplomatic language that allows Moscow to claim it has blocked Ukraine from entering NATO and the United States and Ukraine to insist that it could still join in some distant, theoretical, future. America’s highest priorities should be preventing a wider war and ensuring that Ukraine remains a free society at home. A deal that tacitly acknowledges Russia’s veto over Ukraine’s military alliances is worth swallowing in order to achieve that, since in practice, Russia already wields that veto. It’s far better than a full-scale Russian invasion, which would expose the limits of America’s commitment to Ukraine and turn the entire country into a battlefield. But this kind of compromise, which acknowledges the brute facts of geopolitical power, is harder when officials in Washington pretend that only tyrants like Mr. Putin expect a say over the behavior of their weaker neighbors. The United States must stop lying to itself. The more willing the Biden administration is to admit that it, too, expects a sphere of influence in its corner of the globe, the better able it will be to ensure that Russia’s sphere of influence doesn’t destroy Ukraine or plunge Europe into war.

2022-01-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/us/politics/senate-russia-gas-pipeline-ukraine.html,New Sanctions for Russian Gas Pipeline Fall Short in Senate,"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday rejected a bid to impose sanctions on a Russian natural-gas pipeline, as Democrats set themselves against a Republican-led measure endorsed by Ukrainian leaders but opposed by the Biden administration amid fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The final tally of 55 to 44 fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage, and came as the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies were pressing Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, to abandon any further incursion into Ukraine and pull back his troops from its borders. The bill prompted dueling lobbying campaigns on Capitol Hill, where top Ukrainian officials leaned on senators to back it and Biden administration officials sought to kill it. Efforts to impose sanctions on the Nord Stream 2, an undersea gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that would give Moscow enormous leverage over Europe, have long drawn bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have enthusiastically sought to bolster Ukraine against Russian aggression. But the timing of the vote — amid continuing diplomatic talks between Russia and the United States in the hopes of averting war — as well as the Biden administration’s vocal opposition ultimately helped fuel the measure’s defeat. Six Democrats — some of them facing difficult re-elections in 2022 — defected from their party’s position and voted in favor of the measure, reflecting that a majority of senators supported the new sanctions. The Biden administration and its allies in Congress argued the legislation, led by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, would do little to counter Russian influence because the pipeline’s construction is nearly completed. Instead, they said, the sanctions would drive a wedge between the United States and Germany, which has championed the pipeline as vital to its industrial success, and give up a key point of leverage during diplomatic negotiations. “If this bill passes, it won’t make the Nord Stream pipeline any less likely,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. “It won’t stop Russia from invading Ukraine. In fact, it will do the exact opposite. It will make the completion of Nord Stream more likely, and it will be a gift to Russia, dividing us from our European allies right at the moment when we need to be in solidarity with them in order to deter Russian aggression.” Republicans accused Democrats of allowing Russian aggression to go unchecked, painting their reluctance to impose sanctions as politically motivated. “The White House is furiously lobbying Democrats, asking Democrats to stand with their party at the expense of our allies, at the expense of Europe, at the expense of U.S. national security,” Mr. Cruz said. “I would suggest if Joe Biden were not president, if Donald Trump were sitting in the Oval Office today, every single Democrat in this chamber would vote for these sanctions.” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, sought to defang Democrats’ argument that the sanctions would erode unity between the United States and its European allies. “The pipeline itself is the wedge,” Mr. McConnell said. “That’s the whole point. That’s been Putin’s goal: decoupling Ukraine from Europe and making Europe even more reliant on Russian gas.” What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Mr. Cruz’s legislation set off a fierce round of lobbying, squeezing in particular centrist Democrats who have long been supporters of Ukraine. On a Christmas Eve video call with a bipartisan group of more than 20 lawmakers, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine cast Nord Stream 2 as an existential threat to his country, arguing that the pipeline posed as much risk to Ukraine as the Russian troops amassing on its border, according to four people briefed on the call, who described it on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on it. Mr. Zelensky, they said, expressed frustration that the Biden administration had waived sanctions on the pipeline last year. Since then, Mr. Zelensky has promoted Mr. Cruz’s bill on Twitter. A lobbyist who represents the Ukrainian oil and gas industry, including the state-owned company Naftogaz, reached out this week to the offices of Senate Democrats to urge support for Mr. Cruz’s bill, according to a person familiar with the outreach. An email sent on Monday to Senate offices by the lobbyist, which was forwarded to The New York Times, included a screenshot of Mr. Zelensky’s tweet, and added the message, “Ukraine Pres. Zelensky calls on all senators to vote in favor of Nord Stream 2 sanctions.” But the Biden administration marshaled its own forces against the legislation. Responding to a request for a briefing by two Democratic senators, the State Department sent officials to Capitol Hill on Monday to brief lawmakers and dissuade them from supporting the bill. The next day, the issue came up again as senators met with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken in a closed-door meeting to discuss an upcoming delegation trip to Ukraine. In an effort to further head off defections, Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, unveiled on Wednesday a Democratic alternative to Mr. Cruz’s bill that would impose sanctions on top Russian government officials, including Mr. Putin, if Russia engages in or supports “a significant escalation in hostilities or hostile action in or against Ukraine.” It would also provide Ukraine with $500 million in supplemental emergency security assistance in the event that Russia invades. It likely did not help Mr. Cruz’s cause that many Democrats are furious with him for depriving President Biden of a slew of national security officials who are still awaiting Senate confirmation. Mr. Cruz had delayed dozens of diplomatic appointments in an attempt to pressure the administration to reimpose sanctions against Nord Stream AG, the operator of the pipeline, and its German chief executive, that officials waived in May. Last month, he agreed to stop blocking the confirmation of 32 of Mr. Biden’s State Department and Treasury Department nominees in exchange for Thursday’s vote. In a sign of how closely Ukrainian interests were monitoring the legislation, people close to the Ukrainian government privately fumed at the role played by Amos J. Hochstein, one of the State Department officials who has been dispatched to the Hill on multiple occasions to relay the administration’s concerns about Mr. Cruz’s bill. Mr. Hochstein had also served on a supervisory board of Naftogaz until he resigned in late 2020, citing concerns about the Ukrainian government’s willingness to combat corruption. Congress enacted legislation in 2017, 2019, and 2020 imposing stringent sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and related entities. But bipartisan efforts to impose additional sanctions as part of the annual defense policy bill were quashed last year as lawmakers wrapped up the legislation.",1
2022-01-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/opinion/letters/voting-rights-filibuster.html,"Opinion | Voting Rights Bill Dead, Filibuster Alive","To the Editor: Re “After Fiery Debate, Voting Bill Dies in the Senate” (front page, Jan. 20): “I just don’t know how you break a rule to make a rule,” Senator Joe Manchin said on Tuesday, expressing reluctance to kill the filibuster and pass the voting rights bill he supports. To paraphrase the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous discussion of just and unjust laws in his “Letter From Birmingham Jail”: There are just rules, and there are unjust rules. The filibuster is an unjust rule with a long history as a weapon of racist oppression. Strom Thurmond’s infamous filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 was no outlier. From the 1890s to the 1960s, several voting rights and civil rights bills were killed by filibuster in the Senate. Today, Americans’ voting rights are again in danger from unjust rules. The G.O.P. has spent the last year passing voting restrictions by the dozen and further gerrymandering House districts to enable minority rule. And since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, all of it is legal — though none of it is just. The Senate must act to protect voting rights by killing the filibuster. When an unjust rule stands in the way of justice, it is a moral imperative to break that rule. Cory DerringerSwissvale, Pa. To the Editor: Re “How Did Democrats Let This Happen?,” by Bishop Reginald T. Jackson (Opinion guest essay, Jan. 17): The Democrats voted to pass voting rights legislation, but not a single Republican was in favor. Furthermore, throughout the country, Republicans are leading the effort to block people from voting. The hardheaded obstructionist actions by Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are a problem, but even they support the legislation. They are waiting for 10 Republicans to join them. In what way are President Biden and the Democrats responsible for this failure? And why is Bishop Jackson calling them out, instead of placing the blame where it belongs? Barbara BarranBrooklyn To the Editor: It was interesting watching the Senate debate over voting rights and the filibuster. Many Republicans argued that we don’t need to protect voting rights, as turnout in 2020 was extremely high. The question I kept waiting for someone to ask them, but I never heard, is, “If the rules in 2020 worked so well, why are so many states changing them?” John S. SmithHamilton, N.J. To the Editor: Re “Democrats Face Costly New Slog on Voting Curbs” (front page, Jan. 16): These new voting regulations are not intended to curtail genuine voter access or suppress voting rights. They are meant to restrain casual, uninformed voting and prevent political activists from harvesting other people’s votes. Voting is supposed to be serious and to reflect the national will at a given point in time. It’s not supposed to be “easy” or incidental or absentee for no reason. It’s not a fall sale stretched out over a month. Lax regulations have distorted the very concept and process of voting in order to manipulate elections. Richard SybertSeattle To the Editor: Charles M. Blow (column, Jan. 17) sounded a crucial alarm, especially when he pointed out that the voter suppression legislation being pushed by many in the G.O.P. is only the opening salvo in such efforts, and that President Biden has been very late to the game in this regard. But why is that? It seems to trace back to two phenomena: Mr. Biden’s almost delusional belief that he could pass important legislation on a bipartisan basis on the strength of his personality thanks to his past congressional relationships, and a failure to prioritize what the country most needs. How else to explain why he spent so much effort on the unsuccessful Build Back Better legislative push when the fate of our democracy was hanging in the balance? Assuring that the vote is as sacrosanct as possible should have been the priority; it wasn’t. Roy ChristiansonMadison, Wis. To the Editor: Re “Justices Rebuff Trump’s Request on Jan. 6 Records” (front page, Jan. 20): What welcome news, in a world of unwelcome news. Perhaps now, with the Supreme Court favoring the requests of the House committee investigating Jan. 6, we will finally know the truth of what went on in the minds of Donald Trump and his allies, what messages they sent each other and what plans they had to subvert the will of the American people. There has perhaps never been a time when “full disclosure” has had more significance. Once the truth is out, once the American people will learn how close our nation came to the overthrow of our fragile democracy, perhaps then Mr. Trump’s reign will be rebuffed for good. Doris FenigBoca Raton, Fla. To the Editor: Whatever else may ail the United States, we may rejoice that our Supreme Court still behaves as intended, as an independent judiciary with allegiance to no president. We may complain about justices’ conservatism or that personally held beliefs may predispose their rulings, but their rectitude is what is most important of all for our country. They are free of corruption and dedicated to the rule of law. William GoldmanPalos Verdes Estates, Calif. To the Editor: Re “Biden Expects Putin to Order Ukraine Attack” (front page, Jan. 20): Although I am a supporter of President Biden, I was incredulous when I read that headline. At a time when the president needs to appear adamantly and resolutely opposed to such Russian aggression, it makes him seem weak and resigned to the idea. That may not be what he intended, but that is the way it will be interpreted by many, including our allies in Ukraine, unfortunately. Chase WebbPortland, Ore. To the Editor: Re “Private Insurers Must Cover Eight At-Home Covid Tests Each Month, the U.S. Says” (news article, Jan. 11): It was heartening to hear that the Biden administration was requiring insurance companies to cover the cost of at-home Covid test kits purchased by private individuals. However, Medicare will not be covering these costs. It seems almost beyond belief that the administration is ordering reimbursement for families and adults with private medical insurance, while excluding much of the elderly population, which is most susceptible to complications from Covid. Don HillelNew YorkThe writer is a retired physician. To the Editor: The weather tragedies in the Midwest last month once again demonstrated Americans’ sense of shared responsibility and concern. Rescuers dug through rubble to find potential survivors; neighbors opened their houses to shelter one another when the tornadoes touched down. This is an enduring part of America’s mythos — we do what we can to help those in need, whether filling sandbags in a rainstorm or venturing out in boats during a squall, putting our own lives in danger to assist others. This selflessness makes all the more paradoxical the refusal by many Americans to vaccinate themselves and perform other common-sense acts to protect one another from Covid-19. If your neighbor’s house were on fire would you hesitate to use your hose to put out the fire? If your neighbor’s child were in the path of a runaway truck would you hesitate to rush into the street to save that child? Doesn’t Covid-19 present just such a risk? Larry WestermanPortland, Ore.",1
2022-01-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/opinion/russia-ukraine-us-nato.html,Opinion | How to Retreat From Ukraine,"One of the hardest challenges in geopolitics is figuring out how to conduct a successful retreat. We witnessed that reality last summer in Afghanistan, when the Biden administration made the correct strategic choice — cutting our losses instead of escalating to preserve a morally bankrupt status quo — but then staggered through a disastrous withdrawal that wounded Biden’s presidency and laid bare American incompetence to a watching world. Now we face the same problem with Ukraine. The United States in its days as a hyperpower made a series of moves to extend our perimeter of influence deep into Russia’s near-abroad. Some of those moves appear to be sustainable: The expansion of NATO to include countries of the former Warsaw Pact was itself a risk, but at the moment those commitments seem secure. But the attempt to draw Ukraine out of Russia’s orbit, the partway-open door to Ukrainians who preferred westward-focused alliances, was a foolish overcommitment even when American power was at its height. Note that this is not a question of what Ukrainians deserve. Russia is an authoritarian aggressor in the current crisis; Ukraine is a flawed democracy but a more decent regime than Vladimir Putin’s oligarchy. When we gave Ukraine security assurances under Bill Clinton, opened the door to NATO membership under George W. Bush and supported the Maidan protests under Barack Obama, we were in each case acting with better intentions than Moscow in its own machinations. But in geopolitics good intentions are always downstream from the realities of power. Whatever its desires or ours, the government in Ukraine has simply never been in a position to fully join the West — it’s too economically weak, too internally divided and simply in the wrong place. And the actions of the Bush and Obama administrations — and for all of Trump’s personal sympathies for Putin, some Trump administration acts as well — have left us overstretched, our soft-power embrace of Kyiv ill-equipped to handle hard-power countermoves from Moscow. Given those realities, and the pressing need to concentrate American power in East Asia to counter China, it’s clear enough where an ideal retreat would end up: with NATO expansion permanently tabled, with Ukraine subject to inevitable Russian pressure but neither invaded nor annexed, and with our NATO allies shouldering more of the burden of maintaining a security perimeter in Eastern Europe. But as with Afghanistan, the actual execution is harder than the theory. Coming to a stable understanding with Putin is challenging, because he’s clearly invested in being a permanent disrupter, taking any opportunity to humiliate the West. Extricating ourselves from our Ukrainian entanglements will inevitably instill doubts about our more important commitments elsewhere, doubts that will be greater the more Kyiv suffers from our retreat. And handing off more security responsibility to the Europeans has been an unmet goal of every recent U.S. president, with the particular problem that a key European power, Germany, often acts like a de facto ally of the Russians. Given those difficulties, the Biden administration’s wavering course has been understandable, even if the president’s recent news conference was too honest by several orders of magnitude. The United States cannot do nothing if Russia invades Ukraine; we also would be insane to join the war on Ukraine’s side. So the White House’s quest for the right in-between response, some balance of sanctions and arms shipments, looks groping and uncertain for good reason: There’s simply no perfect answer here, only a least-bad balancing of options. But my sense is that we are still placing too much weight on the idea that only NATO gets to say who is in NATO, that simply ruling out Ukrainian membership is somehow an impossible concession. This conceit is an anachronism, an artifact of the post-Cold War moment when it briefly seemed possible that, as the historian Adam Tooze puts it, the world’s crucial boundaries “would be drawn by the Western powers, the United States and the E.U., on their own terms and to suit their own strengths and preferences.” That’s not how the world works now, and precisely because it’s not how the world works I would be somewhat relieved — as an American citizen, not just an observer of international politics — to see our leaders acknowledge as much, rather than holding out the idea that someday we might be obliged by treaty to risk a nuclear war over the Donbas. And if we cannot give up the idea outright, the idea of giving it up for some extensive period — like the 25 years suggested by Thomas Graham and Rajan Menon in a recent Politico op-ed — seems like a very reasonable deal to make. Something can be reasonable and still be painful — painful as an acknowledgment of Western weakness, painful to the hopes and ambitions of Ukrainians. But accepting some pain for the sake of a more sustainable position is simply what happens when you’ve made a generation’s worth of poor decisions, and you’re trying to find a decent and dignified way to a necessary retreat.

Why should there be a compromise? Does Russia have any legitimate claims on Ukraine? If not — and I know of none — then a compromise would hand an unjustified victory to Vladimir Putin, a reward for his thuggish behavior that would encourage him to repeat it. The only “compromise” that should be offered is a chance for him to withdraw Russian troops with some grace. Jonathan J. MargolisBrookline, Mass. To the Editor: Re “How to Retreat From Ukraine” (column, Jan. 23): Ross Douthat is absolutely correct to say that the United States does not have the power to maintain an extension of NATO that includes Ukraine. What is missing, however, is the interests of the Ukrainian people. I had the privilege of visiting Ukraine as a Fulbright scholar in 2003. My hosts were fervent pro-Western Ukrainian nationalists; however, they understood that Ukraine could not be a strong united country unless the considerable segment of the population that leaned toward Russia felt included. The problem with U.S. policy over the last decade or so is that we sought to exclude the pro-Russian population and turn Ukraine into a U.S. ally. A stable solution must involve keeping Ukraine out of both NATO and the European Union and the equivalent Russia-centered blocs. Ideally, we would have favorable trade deals with both sides; a one-sided deal would be anathema to hopes for peace. There is a model for such a solution: Finland in the 1960s and 1970s. Finns were able to have substantial political and economic freedom as long as they understood that they could not be hostile to the U.S.S.R. With a less confrontational approach by the U.S., this solution could apply to Ukraine today. John BergDorchester, Mass.The writer is professor emeritus of government at Suffolk University. To the Editor: Ross Douthat urges that Europe and the United States acquiesce to Russia’s demand for a role in determining the fate of Ukraine and presumably other states in Moscow’s so-called near abroad. Europe and the U.S. should not accept this demand for a resurrection of Moscow’s Soviet-era imperial pretensions. Vladimir Putin’s demand echoes Hitler’s insistence on Lebensraum for Nazi Germany. The West should stand firm in support of a free, democratic Ukraine. Edmund McWilliamsWhite Oaks, N.M.The writer is a retired Foreign Service officer. To the Editor: We can’t be sure what Vladimir Putin has in mind as he amasses his troops on the Ukrainian border, but to do it now, when the world is struggling with a pandemic that has killed millions of people, is beyond contempt. Just when we need cooperation between countries to overcome this devastating threat, he plays a game that exploits the uncertainty and fear we live under. The threat of a possible war puts more stress on all of us. Mariann CarlinWalnut Creek, Calif. To the Editor: Absent from much of the discussion of the impending military action by Russia in Ukraine is sufficient attention to the oft proven political adage “All politics is local.” Russia is suffering from myriad major domestic problems: gross inequality, climate catastrophes (much of the tundra ablaze), a declining birthrate and a general increase in public misery, particularly away from Moscow and St. Petersburg. There is no better way to distract the public than a “glorious reunification” of territories widely considered to be lost parts of the motherland. Because it all makes domestic political sense, as we have learned from our own politics, it is far more likely to actually happen. Steven KoltaiLincolnville, MaineThe writer is a nonresident senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. To the Editor: In “Kids’ Sense of Dread Is Normal” (Opinion, Jan. 22), Jessica Grose reflects on the pandemic and the “unanswerable questions” posed by her young daughter, particularly those about “existential crises.” I call them the “big questions,” those questions and also insightful remarks that come from even preschool children. Too often we might dismiss their thoughts as silly and not realistic. In fact, many children’s answers are profound and beautiful in their simplicity. They remind us that we are meant to ponder the meaning of our existence. As parents we often want to reassure our children by giving realistic answers, but actually comfort and wisdom often reveal themselves in the mysterious and more imaginative realm of our inner experience. Young children are still close to this world. When my son was 4 he told me that when I died I would become a star and always shine down on him. I want to encourage parents to engage with their children about the big questions; ask them what they think. Their answers are sure to amaze and inspire! Dawn MenkenPortland, Ore.The writer, a psychotherapist, is the author of “Raising Parents Raising Kids: Hands-On Wisdom for the Next Generation.” To the Editor: In “Prince Andrew Became a Liability for the Crown” (Opinion guest essay, Jan. 20), Tanya Gold writes of the Windsors that “their business is power.” What power would that be, exactly, other than the power to command worldwide attention whenever they stand up, sit down or stay put? If the family is in business at all, it’s the business of high-end prestige, in which a ruinously compromised prince threatens to pitch the Firm into bankruptcy. Simon MarcusOakland, Calif.",4
2022-01-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/world/europe/kyiv-pronunciation.html,How Do You Pronounce Kyiv?,"It is not the most important question regarding the international maelstrom currently brewing in Ukraine. But it is a very common question, and one that carries what some may find an unexpectedly political answer: How do you pronounce the capital’s name, Kyiv? Ukrainians have a preference — and it might not be the one most commonly heard or assumed. It sounds more similar to “keev” than the two-syllable “key-EV” favored by many Russian speakers, but that’s not exactly it, either. Andrii Smytsniuk, a Ukrainian who teaches Ukrainian and Russian languages at the University of Cambridge, broke the word down letter by letter for English speakers in an interview on Tuesday. It’s a bit hard to describe. The K sound is the same as in English. The Y is similar to the I sounds in “little bit.” The I is similar to the first part of “yeast.” The V is a slightly shorter version of a W, as in “low,” or almost like the V in “love.” Marta Jenkala, who teaches the Ukrainian language at University College London, endorsed the pronunciation seen in a video by Oleksandra Wallo, an assistant professor of Slavic languages and literatures at the University of Kansas. “It helps if you smile a little bit to say it, especially on the first syllable,” she said in the video. In 2019, Yuri Shevchuk, a lecturer in Ukrainian at Columbia University, told The New York Times that native Ukrainians stress the first vowel, and pronounce it like the “i” in the word “kid” or “lid.” The second vowel is pronounced as a separate syllable, and sounds like the “ee” sound in “keel.” The V is also pronounced a bit differently, like the end of the word “low.” One common pronunciation, “key-ev,” is the Russian form of saying it, and it is one Americans may tend to hear more often. Mr. Smytsniuk said he would argue for people pronouncing it the Ukrainian way “that is as close to the original as possible.” “It is the same thing with names,” he said. “I think it makes sense to pronounce someone’s name the way the person would pronounce it.” A discussion of the city name and pronunciation is the first thing he goes over in his Ukrainian language courses, he said, along with “Ukraine” versus “the Ukraine.” (When Ukraine became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991, the preferred name became “Ukraine.”) Most people are unaware of how to pronounce Kyiv, so he tries not to aggressively correct people, Mr. Smytsniuk said. But many people do take the issue seriously, he said. “When I see American media, it’s always different, it’s always new, always a surprise,” he said.",4
2022-01-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/opinion/ukraine-russia-putin.html,Opinion | Bring Back the Free World,"At some point in the last 30 years, the concept of the “free world” fell out of favor. Maybe it seemed dated once the Cold War ended. Or an afterthought in an era in which economic development, not political freedom, became the primary measure of human progress. Or too smug in an American culture increasingly obsessed with its own sins, current and original. Or no longer befitting countries where democratic norms and liberal principles were being eroded from within — from Hungary to India to the United States. But we urgently need to restore the concept to its former place, both for its clarifying power and its moral force. The prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine is being treated by Vladimir Putin’s many apologists as a case of reasserting Russia’s historic sphere of influence, or as predictable pushback against NATO’s eastward expansion — that is, as another episode in the game of great-power politics. By this logic, the Kremlin’s aims are limited, its demands negotiable. It’s a tempting logic that implies diplomacy can work: Give Putin something he wants — say Ukraine won’t join NATO, or remove NATO forces from former Warsaw Pact states — and he’ll be satisfied. But the logic ignores two factors: Putin’s personal political needs and his far-reaching ideological aims. Putin is neither a czar nor a real president, in the sense that he governs according to fixed rules that both legitimize and limit him. He’s a dictator, liable to charges of corrupt and criminal behavior, who has no guarantee of a safe exit from power and must contrive ways to extend his rule for life. Whipping up periodic foreign crises to mobilize domestic support and capture global attention is a time-tested way in which dictators do this. So however the Ukrainian drama is resolved, there will be other Putin-generated crises. Appeasing him now emboldens him for later. The second factor follows from the first. The ultimate way to consolidate dictatorship is to discredit democracy, to make it seem divided, tired and corrupt. There are many ways to do this and Putin practices plenty of them, from supporting extremist parties and politicians to sponsoring the Russian bots and trolls peddling conspiracy theories on social media. The most effective method is a blunt power play that exposes the gap between the West’s high-flown rhetoric about democracy, human rights and international law, and its unheroic calculations about commercial advantage, military spending, energy dependence and strategic risks. Attacking Ukraine will have costs for Putin, but they’ll be more than compensated for if he can imbue the West with a profound sense of its own weakness. The bully’s success ultimately depends on his victim’s psychological surrender. The best short-term response to Putin’s threats is the one the Biden administration is at last beginning to consider: The permanent deployment, in large numbers, of U.S. forces to frontline NATO states, from Estonia to Romania. Arms shipments to Kyiv, which so far are being measured in pounds, not tons, need to become a full-scale airlift. NATO troops need not, and should not, fight for Ukraine. But the least we owe Ukrainians is to give them a margin of deterrence that comes with being armed before they are invaded, along with a realistic chance to fight for themselves. The longer-term response is to restore the concept of the free world. What’s meant by that term? It isn’t just a list of states that happen to be liberal democracies, some bound together by treaty alliances like NATO or regional trading blocs like the European Union. The free world is the larger idea that the world’s democracies are bound by shared and foundational commitments to human freedom and dignity; that those commitments transcend politics and national boundaries; and that no free people can be indifferent to the fate of any other free people, because the enemy of any one democracy is ultimately the enemy to all the others. That was the central lesson of the 1930s, when democracies thought they could win peace for themselves at the expense of the freedom of others, only to learn the hard way that no such bargain was ever possible. The concept of the free world is not a perfect one — its constituent states are so often imperfect. It can be prone to overconfidence (as in Afghanistan) or strategic incoherence (as it was, for several years, in the Balkans) or bitter division (as it was over the war in Iraq). But it would be foolish to think that the loss of Ukraine would mean nothing to the future of freedom elsewhere, including in the United States. Success in risky ventures tends to beget admiration, and Putin has never lacked for Western admirers, including a certain former — and possibly future — American president. Putin seems to think that dividing and humiliating the West over Ukraine would reduce NATO and its partners to a collection of states, each fearful and pliable. It’s not a bad bet, and it won’t be easy to stop him. But a free world that understands that the alternative to hanging together is hanging separately can at least begin to face up to the menace he represents.

2022-01-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/opinion/president-biden-russia-ukraine.html,Opinion | Did We Miss Biden’s Most Important Remark About Russia?,"Pretty much every crucial line in President Biden’s recent marathon news conference has been dissected by now — except one, the one that may turn out to be the most prescient. You had to be listening closely because it went by fast. It was when Biden told President Vladimir Putin that Russia has something much more important to worry about than whether Ukraine looks East or West — namely, “a burning tundra that will not freeze again naturally.” My translation: Yo, Vladimir, while you’ve been busy putting your “little green men” into Ukraine — all those masked Russian soldiers in green uniforms without insignia — little green shoots have been popping up in your warming tundra. Siberia had a totally freakish, hyper-extreme weather event — a forest fire that firefighters had to stomp out with their boots because the local water sources were all frozen. I’m pretty sure this was the first time a U.S. president ever tried to persuade a Russian leader to get out of his neighbor’s front yard and focus instead on saving his own backyard — because as Siberia is affected by climate change, it will threaten Russia’s stability a lot more than anything that happens in Ukraine. Alas, Putin is part of a generation of world leaders who know how to build their popularity only on the strength of their resistance to enemies abroad and at home. But we are now at the start of a transition, I predict, where more and more leaders will try to build — or need to build — their stature by generating resilience for their people and neighbors in a warming and water-stressed world. This excerpt from a Moscow Times story in November explains why — and what Biden was referring to. It’s dystopian: “An unseasonably rare forest fire has engulfed the Russian tundra as the country faces significant changes from climate change, Interfax reported.” Some 900 acres “are burning despite below-zero temperatures in the Magadan region some 10,000 kilometers east of Moscow. ‘The tundra is usually covered with snow at this time of year, so such fires occur extremely rarely,’ Interfax quoted an unnamed source as saying. Firefighters’ efforts to extinguish the flames are hampered by frozen water reservoirs, Interfax reported. Video posted online shows firefighters working to stamp out the fire with their feet and with tree branches.” And no wonder: Russia’s territory is warming 2.5 times as fast as the planet on average, and the situation there is going to get only worse. On June 20, 2020, the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk, about 70 miles north of the Arctic Circle, hit 100.4 degrees — the highest temperature ever recorded north of the Arctic Circle. I have zero illusions that Putin noticed Biden suggesting Russia is much more vulnerable to climate change expansion than NATO expansion — or would be deterred if he did. He doesn’t strike me as a guy much interested in the climate. But the climate is interested in him. Putin may choose to ignore that. His successor won’t have that option. “Roughly 65 percent of Russia’s territory is covered in permafrost,” The Moscow Times explained in another report. “As air temperatures have risen in recent decades, this soil that has been frozen for millennia has begun to thaw.” If this melting accelerates, it is “expected to cause significant damage to human settlements and key energy and transportation infrastructure. And as permafrost melts, it releases long-stored greenhouse gases like methane, triggering an accelerating feedback loop of warming.” Sure, one day some of this tundra may become rich farmland. But getting from here to there — watch out: “As earth’s climate zones shift from the Equator to the poles, previously forested lands are turning into deserts,” The Moscow Times added. The republic of Dagestan, some 930 miles south of Moscow, is near Russia’s agricultural heartland, “and experts worry that desertification could spread to these regions and impact the country’s food supply.” These very same pressures around climate and drought are already spurring some of the new generation of Middle East leaders to subtly shift the basis of their authority from resistance to resilience. Consider another big story that also did not get the attention it deserved — the energy-water deal that Israel, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates tried to finalize in November. The essence of the deal was this: The U.A.E. — whose leader, Mohammed bin Zayed, is the most prominent Arab ruler working to build his stature by delivering resilience — would finance the construction by an Emirati firm of a huge solar power plant in Jordan that would generate cheap electricity for Israel, which would build a desalination plant on the Mediterranean and send water to an increasingly parched Jordan. Well, a funny thing happened on the way to the signing, Axios first reported. Saudi Arabia came in from nowhere at the 11th hour and tried to pressure the U.A.E. into scrapping the deal. It was not because the Saudis were opposed to the concept. Just the opposite. It was reportedly because the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the U.A.E.’s more powerful neighbor, wanted himself to be seen as the region’s dominant player in green energy deals, not the U.A.E. and Jordan — so he could be seen as more of a resilience figure than a resistance figure. As a result, the deal was softened to a memorandum of understanding. M.B.S., as the crown prince is known, has been trying to diversify and green the Saudi economy, to shift it away from its dependence on petrochemicals. But this has been overshadowed by Saudi Arabia’s continued involvement in the bloody tribal civil war in Yemen — where resistance-focused leadership is still the only game in town. Nevertheless, just as Biden’s news conference was probably the first time a U.S. president had tried to deter a Russian leader by invoking Mother Nature over missiles, this may have been the first Arab-Arab diplomatic row over which leader would be seen as generating more resilience than resistance on climate. But it gets better. Now this struggle between resistance leaders and resilience leaders is moving inside countries as well. EcoPeace Middle East is an alliance of Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian environmentalists that has been pushing for a regional strategy called a Green Blue Deal. It would build on the Jordan-Israel-U.A.E. accord but also include the Palestinian West Bank and Gaza and extend to both fresh water and electricity. Two EcoPeace leaders, Gidon Bromberg from Israel and Nada Majdalani from the Palestinian Authority, were invited last week to present their ideas to the U.N. Security Council. Unfortunately, the Palestinian U.N. representative showed little interest in their proposal in his own remarks to the Security Council. And the Israeli U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan — a right-wing holdover from former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s era — used his time to score points with right-wingers at home, by bashing the Palestinian Authority for being unresponsive to Israeli overtures to collaborate on the environment. This prompted Israel’s current environmental protection minister, Tamar Zandberg, to issue a public rebuke of Erdan for putting out information “incompatible with the truth and in a style that does not represent the minister’s position.” Zandberg said she and her Palestinian counterpart have already launched joint projects in the fields of “environment and waste” and their “work is progressing well in a different atmosphere than before … based on the understanding that climate change has no borders and that the two peoples will benefit from this collaboration.” This is just the beginning of a whole new kind of power struggle within and between countries based on who is leading with resistance and who is leading with resilience.

2022-01-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/us/politics/republicans-ukraine.html,Republican Rift on Ukraine Could Undercut U.S. Appeals to Allies,"WASHINGTON — As President Biden tries to forge a united allied response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, unity on the home front is strained by a Republican Party torn between traditional hawks in the leadership and a wing still loyal to Donald J. Trump’s isolationist instincts and pro-Russian sentiment. Republican leaders, by and large, have struck an aggressive posture, encouraging Mr. Biden to get tougher on Russia, through immediate sanctions on Russian energy exports and more lethal aid to Ukraine’s military. But that message has been undermined by the party’s far right, which has questioned why the United States would side with Ukraine at all, and has obliquely suggested with no evidence that the president is bolstering his son Hunter Biden’s business interests. Driven by a steady diet of pro-Russian or anti-interventionist rhetoric from the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the Republican right has become increasingly vocal in undercutting not only U.S. foreign policy but also the positions of the party’s leaders. The Republican representatives Matt Rosendale of Montana, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia; the Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance; and Donald Trump Jr. have weighed in to oppose confronting Russia or to suggest nefarious intentions on Mr. Biden’s part. Mr. Trump told the conservative podcast host Lou Dobbs that Mr. Biden’s reported plan to send as many as 50,000 troops to bolster Europe’s defenses was “crazy.” Representative Michael R. Turner of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, went on Fox News to confront Mr. Carlson. “Why would we take Ukraine’s side and not Russia’s side?” Mr. Carlson pushed. “It’s a sincere question.” Mr. Turner responded: “Ukraine is a democracy. Russia is an authoritarian regime that is seeking to impose its will upon a validly elected democracy in Ukraine, and we’re on the side of democracy.” Such confrontations have muddied the Republican response, but more concerning are worries that the right could prompt U.S. allies to question Washington’s resolve. On a conference call on Wednesday with Ukrainian Americans, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, expressed alarm about “the rhetoric of the far right.” “Our allies are watching closely for signs of division here,” he said in an interview after the call. “The good news is, I detect no real traction of those messages from my Republican colleagues.” The bad news, he allowed, is that most Republicans are willing to disown it only in private. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said legislation to impose sanctions on Russia and bolster Ukraine’s military and economic position could be on the Senate floor as soon as next week, and he hopes it will counter any message of division. “This is a moment for us to come together and pass a strong, bipartisan sanctions package to send an unmistakable signal of support for Ukraine, Ukraine’s independence and for President Biden’s leadership,” he said on Wednesday. Publicly, Republican leaders have been talking tough. After Mr. Biden’s gaffe last week, when he seemed to suggest that a “minor incursion” into Ukraine would not merit a forceful allied response, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, asked: “Do you think the strong, wonderful people of the Ukraine think it would be a minor incursion if Putin moved tanks into Ukraine, even a piece of the Ukraine? Of course they don’t.” This week, speaking to reporters in Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, indicated such criticism had pushed the administration to toughen its stance. “What I’ve been hearing since then is encouraging, that they’re prepared to take steps before an incursion, not afterwards,” he said, adding, “It appears to me the administration is moving in the right direction.” But that direction — and that message — may not be what the most partisan Republican voters want. A Yahoo News/YouGov poll released this week found that 62 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents view President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a stronger leader than Mr. Biden. But a survey released on Wednesday by the Pew Research Center found that views of Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine did not differ much by partisan affiliation at all. Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, said on Wednesday that some callers to his district office had begun parroting Mr. Carlson’s assertions that the United States should be allied with Russia, not Ukraine, or that he should be supporting Russia’s “reasonable” demands for NATO withdrawal from Eastern Europe. “Most Republicans in the House are totally solid; to the extent they want Biden to do more, that’s at least a healthy instinct,” Mr. Malinowski said in a phone interview from Brussels, where a bipartisan House delegation was visiting NATO after meetings in Ukraine. “I do think some of them are slightly in denial about this other force in their party.” For now, Mr. Malinowski said, the United States’ allies in Europe are united in their response to Russian aggression. Though they remain wary of American constancy after four years of Mr. Trump’s anti-NATO remarks, so far they trust that the Biden administration and Republican leadership will stand by the alliance if Russian forces invade Ukraine. But, he warned, Republican leaders should not be fooled into thinking their foreign policy views could survive a resurgence of Trumpism in the White House, either with a return of the former president or with the election of one of his acolytes. He pointed to the memo drafted in the closing days of the Trump White House to justify the firing of Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper. The reasons included his focus on Russia and “every facet of competition” with Moscow, and his opposition to withdrawing U.S. troops from Germany. In some sense, the taunts, insults and isolationist sentiments coming from the Republicans’ far-right flank are consistent with the Trump era, when Mr. Trump stood beside Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, and said he trusted the Russian strongman over his own intelligence agencies. “Despite claims by war hawks on both sides of the aisle, it is not in our national interest to spill American blood and treasure in Ukraine,” Mr. Rosendale wrote in a statement. Mr. Gosar wrote: “We have no dog in the Ukraine fight. Not one American soldier should die there. Not one American bullet should be fired there. We just lost Afghanistan to sandal wearing goat herders. I assure you Russian military is no joke either.” Others were simply insulting. Ms. Greene again called for Mr. Biden’s impeachment. Ms. Boebert brought up Burisma, the Ukrainian company that Hunter Biden did work for, leading to outlandish accusations of corruption from Republicans, which were later dispelled by a Senate Republican inquiry that found no evidence of improper influence or wrongdoing by the elder Mr. Biden. Just as significant, some said on Wednesday, is the silence from Republicans, who have refused to speak out against their fringe. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, told Ukrainian Americans on Wednesday that a group of senators who had just returned from Ukraine had been working for three days on a tough new bill that would impose broad sanctions on Russia. That legislation would be a vehicle to show “there’s no daylight between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to the fundamental questions of whether we should provide significant economic and security support to Ukraine right now at unprecedented levels in order to make sure that Ukraine can defend itself,” he said. “And there is no daylight between Republicans and Democrats as to whether Putin should and will pay a devastating price if he were to launch an invasion.”",1
2022-01-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/opinion/letters/independent-voters-biden.html,Opinion | How Independent Voters Feel About Biden,"To the Editor: “14 Independent Voters Share Their Fears” (Sunday Review, Jan. 23) reflects attitudes that may cause the downfall of the Biden presidency and result in even greater negative consequences. In response to a request for “a word or phrase that describes President Biden,” the answers were weakly moderate (e.g., “reasonable”) to completely negative (e.g., “incoherent,” “pathetic,” “clueless,” “complete disaster,” “spaced out”). Consider the issues and opposition that Mr. Biden faces: Vladimir Putin and Ukraine, Chinese economic and territorial expansionism, Covid, a divided Congress, Iran negotiations, Build Back Better, inflation, Supreme Court rulings, voting rights, economic and social justice, and last, but definitely not least, climate change. Consider also that the Afghanistan pullout and infrastructure bill are done. I do not believe that any president since World War II has confronted and tried to address so many major, even existential, issues at one time. I was not initially a Biden supporter. I do not necessarily agree with him on everything. My solutions may differ on the issues. But if I were to be asked for a word to describe President Biden, it would be “courageous.” Dean R. EdstromEden Prairie, Minn. To the Editor: As I read through the transcript of the focus group with “independent” voters, I couldn’t help but think: I voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and worked on Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. Where’s my focus group? The media’s obsession with using Obama-Trump voters as a representation of independent voters has never made sense to me. While these voters may represent a segment of independent voters, they seem more drawn to strong personalities than good policies. Many in the group seemed susceptible to misinformation, a trait that I imagine led them to Donald Trump. There are other independents in this country who can provide much more interesting (and dare I say nuanced) takes on how the administration is doing. Those voters can have just as much of an impact on the elections in 2022 and 2024, if not more. I hope The Times will consider highlighting those voices as well in the future. Eric HinkleArlington, Va. To the Editor: Re “President Biden’s Economy Is Failing the Big Mac Test” (editorial, Jan. 23): Your editorial succinctly summarizes the economic policies of the Biden administration, the current state of the economy and its likely future trajectory. With all that in mind, it concludes that President Biden made the right choice in firing up the economy to avoid a sluggish recovery that would have caused considerable pain for many, even though this approach has caused near-term pain for a segment of the population. Were one, however, to read the headline, or even its first few paragraphs, one would come away with the incorrect notion that Mr. Biden — who the editors acknowledge has less ability to affect the economy than popularly conceived — has engaged in failed policies that have left people worse off than they ought to be. The Times can and should do better. Seth GinsbergEnglewood, N.J. To the Editor: The Times’s failing grade for President Biden’s economic performance needs to be re-examined. The editorial tells us your main measure is real weekly wages — the average worker’s wages adjusted for inflation. The editorial determined that Mr. Biden has failed, since the average real weekly wage fell by 2.3 percent over the last year. There are two major problems with this measure. The first is a composition effect. In 2020, many low-paid workers were laid off. This raises the average, in the same way the average height in a room rises when the shortest person leaves. The composition effect went the opposite way in 2021, as low-paid workers were rehired. The other is a pandemic price effect. Many prices, most notably gasoline, were depressed when the world economy shut down because of the pandemic. Predictably, these price declines were reversed when the economy reopened. If we want a more honest measure, we would look at real wage growth over the last two years, which is a very respectable 2.9 percent. Dean BakerKanab, UtahThe writer is senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. To the Editor: The problem is, nobody really understands the economy. Different economists will give different reasons for why the economy is doing what it’s doing. Some will get it right, many won’t. Some might be only partly right. When it comes down to it, there are often multiple reasons why the economy does what it does. And, no matter what the president does, the economy will go its own way because of multiple factors. So is President Biden at fault? A little bit yes and a little bit no. We have an economy being manipulated by Covid, oil-producing nations, supply chains, businesses inflating prices, etc. The president is the most prominent individual to aim at, but he’s only a small part of the problem. Do you know anyone who’d be more effective? Marshall CossmanGrand Blanc, Mich. To the Editor: Rather than blaming “Democrats, unable to agree on the terms of a permanent expansion” for the expiration of the child tax credit, the blame should be placed on one Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin, and the 50 Republicans who are united in opposition. Michael CaplowSeattle To the Editor: Re “How Partying Could Be Boris Johnson’s Undoing” (The Daily podcast, Jan. 25): As I watch the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, tumble into a conflagration of his own lies and hubris as he flagrantly flouted Covid restrictions while the rest of Britain abided by the rules, I am struck by the members of his own Tory Party who are openly stating their disgust at his behavior. Certainly they are motivated by self-interest and the preservation of the Tory majority, but one can only wonder where we would be in this country if Mitch McConnell and other Republicans had confronted Donald Trump and openly declared their actual personal opinions about his mendacity and malignancy as David Davies, a senior member of the Conservative Party, did in Parliament. He quoted the words spoken to Neville Chamberlain: “You have sat there too long for all the good you have done. In the name of God, go!” The Republican leadership simply did not have the morality and courage of David Davies. We are all paying the price for their lack of character. Robert GrossmarkNew York To the Editor: I have been struck throughout the pandemic by the resonances with Edgar Allan Poe’s story “The Masque of the Red Death,” in which a prince, attempting to escape a deadly plague, holes himself inside a palace and throws a masquerade ball. Spoiler alert: The plague gets in, disguised as a flamboyantly dressed guest. It does not surprise me that Boris Johnson’s demise may be thanks to a party of his own. Alice WalkerBrooklyn To the Editor: If Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine, then the United States, Britain and the European Union should close their borders to Russian citizens and deny them visas. Let the oligarchs find new places to buy their mansions and launder their money. The West should not be a refuge for Russian money and rich Russians. Michael R. SlaterSan Luis Obispo, Calif. To the Editor: Re “Do Debtors Really Need a Lawyer When Sued?” (news article, Jan. 26): Yes, they do! Hundreds of thousands of overwhelmingly Black and brown low-income people face debt collection in New York State — from pending cases and cases in which creditors secured court judgments against them. Why should they have to settle for nonprofessional counsel in legal proceedings that can determine if they have food on the table and a roof over their heads for themselves and their families? If you have the means, you would never settle for a nonprofessional, and they should not have to either. New York State should expand civil legal services in this grossly underfunded area, particularly at this critical time.

2022-02-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/02/world/asia/russia-ukraine-china-putin-xi.html,"In Clash With U.S. Over Ukraine, Putin Has a Lifeline From China","BEIJING — As the United States moves to exert maximal pressure on Russia over fears of a Ukraine invasion, the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin, has found relief from his most powerful partner on the global stage, China. China has expressed support for Mr. Putin’s grievances against the United States and NATO, joined Russia to try to block action on Ukraine at the United Nations Security Council, and brushed aside American warnings that an invasion would create “global security and economic risks” that could consume China, too. On Friday, Mr. Putin will meet in Beijing with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, ahead of the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics that President Biden and other leaders have pointedly vowed to boycott. Although details of any potential agreements between the two countries have not been disclosed, the meeting itself — Mr. Xi’s first in person with a world leader in nearly two years — is expected to be yet another public display of geopolitical amity between the two powers. A Chinese promise of economic and political support for Mr. Putin could undermine Mr. Biden’s strategy to ostracize the Russian leader for his military buildup on Ukraine’s borders. It could also punctuate a tectonic shift in the rivalry between the United States and China that could reverberate from Europe to the Pacific. “If there’s a war over Ukraine, and the Chinese and Russians overtly align with one another, suddenly the world we’re in looks like a very, very different one,” said Evan S. Medeiros, a professor at Georgetown University who served on the National Security Council during Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. “China will be on the eastern front of what looks like a long-term global competition,” he added. China’s leaders have watched the confrontation between Russia and the United States over Ukraine intently, with reports in Chinese state media highlighting the divisions among the NATO allies and criticizing the United States, gleefully at times. The leadership has viewed the showdown as a test of American influence and resolve that could distract Mr. Biden from his administration’s focus on China as the pre-eminent strategic rival of the 21st century. That includes growing American support for Taiwan, the island democracy that China claims as part of its territory. “In practical terms, China benefits on two fronts,” said Alexander Gabuev, an expert on Russia’s relations with China at the Carnegie Moscow Center. “First, a major security crisis in Europe will suck up a lot of oxygen that Team Biden needs to address China. Secondly, Russia will move even closer to China — on Beijing’s terms.” In Washington, administration officials said they are worried that at the summit meeting in Beijing, Mr. Xi would offer Mr. Putin reassurances of Chinese support if the United States imposes heavy economic penalties on Russia, as the administration has threatened to do. When the United States imposed similar penalties in 2014 following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Mr. Putin also turned to China as an alternative source of investment and trade, minimizing the impact, at least somewhat. That year, China went ahead and signed a $400 billion gas deal with Russia, though Chinese officials did negotiate favorable prices for their companies since Mr. Putin was in a bind. Maria Snegovaya, a visiting scholar at George Washington University who co-wrote an Atlantic Council paper on American sanctions against Russia, said the 2014 events pushed Russia closer to China. She predicted that China would again help blunt the impact of sanctions, noting that the country is now a big buyer of Russian weapons, fish and timber, and in 2020 it was the largest importer of Russia’s crude oil and natural gas. “This provides Russia more flexibility in case the West sanctions some of Russia’s exports,” she said. While China has often driven a hard bargain with Russia in the past, the economic ties between the two countries have soared since Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine. China announced last month that trade with Russia had reached nearly $147 billion, compared to $68 billion in 2015, the year after it annexed Crimea and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s ambassador to China, Andrei Denisov, said the two countries could soon complete a deal for a second natural gas pipeline like the one called Power of Siberia, which began flowing in 2019. Beyond any economic benefits, the two countries have found common cause in trying to weaken American power and influence. Officials and state media in both countries have in recent weeks echoed each other’s attacks on the United States, reflecting an increasingly jaded view of American intentions. China joined Russia in accusing the United States of fomenting public protests that swept Kazakhstan. Sergei Naryshkin, the director of Russia’s foreign intelligence service and a hawkish compatriot of Mr. Putin’s when both served in the Soviet K.G.B., said last month that the United States planned “to aggressively and maliciously interfere” in the Olympics in Beijing. Global Times, a nationalistic newspaper of the Communist Party, seized on the comments to declare that the plot had been foiled. “Failed attack campaign against Winter Olympics shows incompetence of U.S. government,” a headline declared. Mr. Xi has met Mr. Putin 37 times as their countries’ leaders, more than any other head of state. In their last meeting, a virtual summit in December, Mr. Xi called him his “old friend,” and the two pledged to build an international political and financial system not dominated by the United States and the dollar. Chinese officials view Russia’s drive to push back against NATO as a parallel to their own efforts to prevent the United States from building up alliances and partnerships in Asia to counter China. While there are many differences in the geopolitical situations of Ukraine and Taiwan, Mr. Putin’s use of historical myths and sheer military power to justify seizing Ukraine has resonance among hawks in Beijing. Mr. Xi, too, has intensified his warnings that Taiwan must never seek independence from a united China under Communist Party rule. “There is a strong link between the two flash points,” said Artyom Lukin, a professor of international studies at the Far Eastern Federal University in Russia. One notable difference is that while the United States has flatly said it will not send troops to defend Ukraine, it has maintained “strategic ambiguity” on Taiwan for decades and has left unsaid whether it would come to the armed defense of the island. That ambiguity has helped serve as a deterrent against a Chinese invasion. China’s diplomatic and rhetorical support is not a blank check for Russia’s designs. If the United States targets Russia with new sanctions, China could take measured steps in aiding its neighbor. As they did in 2014, Chinese banks and companies would need to calculate whether they could end up being penalized if they do business with any targeted Russian entities. Such penalties would jeopardize their commerce in the United States and elsewhere. China has also never recognized Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and while the two countries conduct joint military operations, it is highly unlikely that China would ever explicitly support a military intervention. Only weeks ago, China celebrated the 30th anniversary of an independent Ukraine following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The two nations have strong commercial ties, including in the defense industry. Although Chinese officials have made clear that the United States should address Russia’s “reasonable security concerns” in Europe, they have also emphasized the need for a peaceful resolution of the conflict over Ukraine. “Beijing is in the uncomfortable position of seeing one sovereign country invade another sovereign country,” said Derek Grossman, an analyst on Asian security issues at the RAND Corporation. “That flies in the face of noninterference, which China, on paper at least, has assiduously upheld.” Memories also linger of the last Olympics in Beijing, the Summer Games in 2008. During the opening ceremony, news spread that Russian troops had moved into Georgia, another former Soviet republic bristling at Russian interference. “The attitude of the Chinese government is still relatively prudent,” Cheng Xiaohe, a professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said, “but it mainly shows a cautious attitude on the basis of sympathy and support for Russia.” Steven Lee Myers reported from Beijing and Edward Wong from Washington.

2022-02-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/world/asia/putin-xi-meeting-russia-china.html,Putin to Meet Xi in Beijing Ahead of Winter Olympics,"BEIJING — Ahead of his visit to Beijing for the opening of the Winter Olympics, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia pledged on Thursday to deepen his country’s diplomatic and economic ties with China in ways that would counter American power and influence. In an article as well as a separate interview with Chinese state media, Mr. Putin did not mention the churning confrontation with the United States and its allies over Ukraine. But he said he and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, would coordinate foreign policy “based on close and coinciding approaches to solving global and regional issues.” As the Ukraine crisis has unfolded, China has become increasingly outspoken in its support of Russia’s positions, complicating President Biden’s strategy of deterring any Russian attack by threatening to impose a punishing economic and diplomatic cost. Last week, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, after speaking with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, declared that any political resolution should address “Russia’s legitimate security concerns.” Mr. Putin is scheduled to meet with Mr. Xi on Friday in Beijing, and he suggested that they would discuss a variety of issues, including trade and business deals, cooperation in lunar exploration and plans to create financial mechanisms that would “offset the negative impact of unilateral sanctions.” Such sanctions have been the pillar of the American and European responses to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, much to the fury of Mr. Putin and other senior Russian officials and businessmen who have been subjected to them. On Friday evening, Mr. Putin is scheduled to attend the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Games, joining dozens of foreign dignitaries, including other heads of state. In the article Mr. Putin wrote for the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, he appeared to chide Mr. Biden and other leaders for declaring that diplomats from their countries would not attend the ceremony, as a protest against China’s human rights abuses. “Sadly, attempts by a number of countries to politicize sports to the benefit of their ambitions have recently intensified,” Mr. Putin wrote. “This is fundamentally wrong and contrary to the very spirit and principles of the Olympic charter.”",22
2022-02-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/04/world/asia/olympics-beijing-xi-putin.html,"In Beijing, Olympic Spectacle and Global Power Games","BEIJING — China’s leader, Xi Jinping, opened an Olympic Games on Friday intended to celebrate his country’s increasingly assured global status standing defiantly with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, in an increasingly ideological contest with the United States and its allies. While President Biden and other democratic leaders shunned the opening ceremony over China’s human rights abuses, Mr. Xi drew his own bloc of supportive guests. Mr. Putin, another strongman leader bristling against the United States’ demands, appeared with him in a calculated display of solidarity while Moscow’s tensions with Ukraine could tip into war. The meeting with Mr. Putin, with the opening ceremony, amounted to a choreographed display of China’s shifting place in the world — wanting to win over countries wary of its rising power, but growing impatient, and disdainful, of Western censure. It also underscored China and Russia’s determination to present a united front against the West, broadly, and the United States in particular — exactly the result that President Richard M. Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, were trying to avoid with their opening to China in 1971. In a joint statement after Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin met, they said their friendship had “no limits,” and China sided with Russia on one of its critical security demands: an end to NATO expansion to the east and closer to Russia’s borders. The two leaders called for the United States to abandon plans to deploy intermediate range missiles in Europe and Asia and denounced what they see as American interference in their internal affairs by fomenting “color revolutions,” the public uprisings in former Soviet republics like Georgia and Ukraine calling for greater democracy. “Russia and China stand against attempts by external forces to undermine security and stability in their common adjacent regions,” they said in the 5,300-word statement, which illustrated the widening rift between democracies and autocracies. In a message directly aimed at the United States, the two leaders vowed “to counter interference by outside forces in the internal affairs of sovereign countries under any pretext, oppose color revolutions and will increase cooperation in the aforementioned areas.” The statement made no mention of mutual support in Russia’s tensions over Ukraine and China’s with Taiwan, signaling the limits of the growing partnership. “This statement reflects the nature of the relationship with China,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center. “It’s increasingly deep, increasingly directed at the U.S., but it’s not an alliance where both sides support each other on everything.” After the hard-nosed geopolitics of his talks with Mr. Putin, Mr. Xi presided over the Winter Games’ opening spectacular in the “Bird’s Nest” National Stadium. The ceremony, lasting more than two hours on a clear, frigid night, was filled with images of China as a friendly, open host, despite the imposition of the most stringent health restrictions ever in a major sporting event. The night began with a display of folksy charm watched by spectators carefully screened against Covid — a distant cry from the passionate crowd that filled the stadium for the grandiose, four-hour Summer Olympics ceremony there in 2008. The highlight for many that time was the appearance of 2,008 tightly coordinated drummers chanting Confucius: “Friends have come from afar, and how happy we are.” This time, a thousand performers jumped and twisted to China’s version of square dancing, a boisterous dance style popular among middle-aged people who gather in parks across China. Zhang Yimou, the director of the opening ceremony, as well as the 2008 opening, has said that this time he wanted to highlight China’s “ordinary humanity.” The president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, used his remarks at the opening ceremony to make a plea to keep politics out of international sports, a position that has drawn increasing criticism from detractors of the committee and of China. Politics, in fact, have been an undercurrent of these Games from the beginning. Mr. Xi has seized on the occasion to present China as an anchor of stability in a crisis-ridden world. Being able to hold the Games on schedule, in the face of Covid, is enough proof of China’s dependability, he has suggested. Nearly 14 years after the 2008 Games, a very different China — much wealthier, more powerful, but also more feared — put on a show designed to reassure, as well as dazzle, its global audience. China, the message was, did not feel the same swaggering anxiety as it once did to prove that it had arrived. “China is no longer seeking entry into the international community. It is an embedded senior member,” Rana Mitter, a professor of Chinese history and politics at Oxford University, said of the contrast between 2008 and today. “There is also a much stronger message saying, ‘We’re no longer supplicants seeking to enter the room. We are defining the rules of what happens in the room’,” he said. Mr. Xi and other Chinese leaders have portrayed the Games as a celebration of sport, accusing the United States of politicizing the event by leading a “diplomatic boycott” by Western leaders and senior officials. Mr. Putin reiterated the accusation in remarks on the eve of his visit. Chinese state news media has even claimed, without evidence, that the United States was plotting to disrupt the festivities with orchestrated protests by athletes or other participants. In their meeting on Friday — the 38th between the two as leaders — Mr. Putin told his counterpart that the Chinese-Russian relationship had “taken on a truly unprecedented character.” “It is an example of a dignified relationship that helps each of us develop while supporting each other’s development,” Mr. Putin said at the start of talks that also covered trade and security issues. Even so, the limits of China’s support for Russia were on display. The leaders’ statement did not specifically mention Ukraine, where China has economic and geopolitical interests of its own. Mr. Putin was among 22 world leaders who attended the opening ceremony, a gathering that blunted at least somewhat the “diplomatic boycott” that Mr. Biden and other democratic leaders had announced. Among those in attendance were the leaders of the five Central Asian nations that were once part of the Soviet Union, as well as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates. Most, though not all, are autocratic nations, underscoring the growing divides in the world based less on political ideology than on modes of governance and tolerance for basic political freedoms. China’s record of rights abuses made the country’s choice as a host for these Games even more controversial than Beijing was for the Summer Olympics in 2008. Beijing became the first city given the chance to hold both the summer and winter editions of the premier sporting event in 2015 — only after Norway, Sweden and other European countries dropped out, citing costs or lack of public support for hosting the Olympics. Mr. Xi’s wide suppression of dissent, crushing of democratic opposition in Hong Kong and detention of hundreds of thousands of members of the Uyghur ethnic minority in Xinjiang region have fueled calls for boycotts by countries and corporate sponsors. Against that backdrop, critics denounced as hypocritical the choice of Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a cross-country skier who the Chinese said has Uyghur roots, to participate in the final, ritual lighting of the Olympic flame. China’s economy, however, is now more than three times larger than it was in 2008, meaning corporations and even countries have dared not risk losing access to the market. Mr. Xi, who was vice president in 2008, has since taking power in 2012 presided over a vigorous restoration of Communist Party power that he clearly hopes the Olympics will validate. “If you look back at that time, 2008, they were still willing to show the world that they speak the same language, that they were part of some idea,” Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist who helped design the Bird’s Nest stadium, said in an interview from Portugal. He left China in 2015 after his outspoken criticisms of the government. The open, airy design of the stadium was at odds with the direction China has taken, he said. “But by now,” he said, “the Chinese Communist Party is in a very different position. The whole tone has changed.” Holding the games could help put Mr. Xi in a flattering glow before a Communist Party congress late this year that will be crucial to extending his era in power. Mr. Xi appears increasingly assured of winning another five-year term as party leader at that congress, confirming his status as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. “This is in fact a celebration of a decade of Xi Jinping’s era in power. It’s a celebration of his power,” Geremie R. Barmé, a fellow at the Asia Society’s Center on U.S.-China Relation, said of the Games’ opening ceremony. “It’s like a National Day celebration, but done in the guise of an international event.” During the ceremony, thousands of athletes representing 90 countries and territories marched around the stadium. So far, none have openly criticized the Chinese government, something officials have warned could be punished. “If any athletes, upon their departure from China and return to their home countries, choose to say anything about China, though, that could turn the narrative back toward the tensions,” said Heather Dichter, an associate professor of sports history at De Montfort University in Britain. “But,” she added, “it is likely that for the two weeks of the Games themselves, the focus will be on the athletes and the many challenges they have had to overcome.” Anton Troianovski contributed reporting from Moscow, and David E.

2022-02-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/world/asia/taiwan-china-ukraine-russia.html,Taiwan and China Are Both Closely Watching Ukraine Crisis,"BEIJING — With Russia massing troops along Ukraine’s borders, President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan felt compelled to act. She ordered the creation of a task force to study how the confrontation thousands of miles away in Europe could affect Taiwan’s longstanding conflict with its larger, vastly more powerful neighbor. “Taiwan has faced military threats and intimidation from China for a long time,” Ms. Tsai told a gathering of her national security advisers late last month, according to a statement by her office. Perhaps more than people in any other place in the world, Taiwanese know what it is like to live in the shadow of an overbearing power, with China claiming the island as its own. Ms. Tsai added, “we empathize with Ukraine’s situation.” While the correlation is not exact, the confrontation between Russia and the United States over Ukraine’s fate has resonated on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, highlighting the strategic calculus China and Taiwan have made about the possibility of armed conflict. In China, some have viewed a clash in Ukraine as a potential crisis for the United States that could undermine American support for the island, while also draining attention and resources that might otherwise be directed at Chinese military ambitions in the Pacific. For Taiwan, it has become a test of the strategic assumption that lies at the core of the island’s defense: that American military forces would intervene to stop a Chinese invasion. “If the Western powers fail to respond to Russia, they do embolden the Chinese thinking regarding action on Taiwan,” said Lai I-chung, the president of the Prospect Foundation in Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, and former director of the China Affairs department for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. The link between the two distant conflicts came into new focus when the Russian leader, President Vladimir V. Putin, came to Beijing last week and received explicit backing from China for his grievances about American and NATO military strategy. In a joint statement after their meeting before the opening of the Winter Olympics, Mr. Putin and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, criticized “attempts by external forces to undermine security and stability in their common adjacent regions.” While their statement did not mention Ukraine by name, Mr. Putin extracted China’s most explicit remarks to date opposing further NATO expansion. Mr. Putin also restated Russia’s recognition of Taiwan as “an inalienable part of China.” The joint statement drew a sharp rebuke from Taiwan’s foreign ministry, underscoring the wariness there of the deepening partnership between China and Russia. “At a time when the world is paying attention to the Winter Olympics, cheering for athletes from all over the world, and paying attention to China’s human rights abuses, the Chinese government has used the Russian summit to engineer authoritarian expansion, which has insulted the spirit of peace proclaimed by the Olympic Rings,” Joanne Ou, the ministry’s spokeswoman, said in a statement. “It will be disdained by the Taiwanese people and despised by democratic countries.” China’s leaders have watched the confrontation intently, seeing it as a test of American influence and resolve. China has claimed Taiwan as an integral part of a unified nation ever since the defeated national forces retreated to the island in 1949 following the country’s civil war. American support for the island, including hundreds of millions of dollars in arms sales over the decades, has long been an irritant in relations with China, much as American support of Ukraine is for Mr. Putin today. Beijing’s view of the island is not unlike Mr. Putin’s view of Ukraine as a historical and cultural part of Russia. Russia’s efforts to push back against NATO also echo China’s complaints about American efforts to bolster alliances and partnerships in Asia, including with Taiwan. The joint statement last week criticized the deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Asia, as well as in Europe, and singled out the recent agreement between the United States and Britain to help Australia build a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. Reports in Chinese state media have highlighted divisions in NATO and portrayed the United States as weak and indecisive. The implication is that governments in Asia — Taiwan, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea — should not count on American diplomatic or military support in a crisis. Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said that in China’s view, a protracted conflict in Europe would leave it less able to also focus simultaneously on a potential confrontation in the Pacific. “The United States is in a sorry plight right now,” he said. A conflict between Russia and Ukraine, he added, would “further embolden China’s current very tough stance and military readiness on the Taiwan issue.” Wu Qiang, an independent political analyst in Beijing, said that in some ways Taiwan is even more vulnerable than Ukraine because of its ambiguous diplomatic status. Only 13 nations and the Vatican still recognize Taiwan as a sovereign country. The United States and others who do not have sought to show support through economic and diplomatic ties, vowing to oppose any effort by China to extend its rule over the island democracy by force. But the lack of official recognition — on top of China’s growing military might — could complicate any international intervention in the case of war. “Ukraine has been an internationally recognized, independent democratic country since the collapse of the Soviet Union,” Mr. Wu said. “Taiwan’s status as a nation state is very weak.” Within Ms. Tsai’s administration, the tensions have been viewed with increasing urgency. The task force she created has been instructed to monitor and submit regular reports on the situation in Ukraine. Taiwan opposed Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, but the war then was not seen as a potential foreshadowing of the island’s fate. Officials now worry that the new round of tensions could embolden Mr. Xi, who has described the absorption of Taiwan — by force, if necessary — as a pillar of his vision of “rejuvenating the Chinese nation.” China’s air and naval forces have stepped up operations around Taiwan in recent years, in part in response to American patrols. Two weeks ago 39 Chinese aircraft crossed into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, the largest so far this year. Since the crisis over Ukraine began, there have been no signs of China bolstering its already sizable forces arrayed against Taiwan. Military and political analysts said that, so far, the events are not likely to alter China’s assessment on conquering the island in the near future. Mr. Xi is expected to be preoccupied this year, first by the Olympics now underway and later by the Communist Party congress in the fall, where he is all but certain to claim another term as the country’s leader. There are other differences in the geopolitical situations of Ukraine and Taiwan that make an imminent attack from Beijing unlikely. While the Biden administration has said outright that it would not send troops to defend Ukraine, it has not said whether it would defend Taiwan. The policy, known as “strategic ambiguity,” has historically served as a pillar of American deterrence. Mr. Lai, the Prospect Foundation president, said that recent statements from the administration had helped to reassure the Taiwanese officials that the American commitment to supporting the island remained solid. Still, he added, there was also a growing sense within Taiwan that it would need to do more to shoulder the burden of its own defense. Claire Fu contributed research",22
2022-02-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/us/politics/russia-ukraine-veterans.html,Veterans’ Groups Splinter Over Ukraine Crisis,"WASHINGTON — An antiwar alliance of veterans that emerged from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and spanned the political spectrum is splintering badly over the U.S. response to the threatening moves of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia against Ukraine. The fracturing is more ideological than partisan: Some groups on the left that opposed the war in Afghanistan are siding with President Biden’s deployment of thousands of troops to Eastern Europe, while other liberals are staunchly against it. Some conservative groups and lawmakers oppose the deployments, while others are pressing the president to go further, arguing that he has not been tough enough. The complex dynamics among veterans’ groups that had been united just months ago reflected both general exhaustion with war among American voters and shifting domestic politics on the right and the left. Mr. Biden approved the deployment of 3,000 troops to NATO allies, including Poland and Romania, but said he did not intend to send troops to Ukraine, which is not a member of the alliance. The administration has also described a range of possible responses should Mr. Putin decide to invade Ukraine, including economic sanctions targeting Moscow. VoteVets, a left-leaning group that lobbied to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, quickly dispatched former generals to Capitol Hill to shore up Mr. Biden’s position. Jon Soltz, the chairman of VoteVets, said people steadfast in their positions on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were struggling to justify their support for a muscular response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. U.S. troop deployments can be seen as “a way to prevent war,” he added, and even “those who are tied to the anti-forever-war dynamic” are having to adjust “to a different problem set.” The group’s strongest conservative partner in ending the “forever wars,” Concerned Veterans for America, has taken a firm position against any American actions that could leave either Ukraine or Russia believing Washington has made a security commitment to Kyiv. The group opposes deploying troops to Eastern Europe and selling American weapons to Ukraine. Common Defense, a group that leans further left than VoteVets and also pressed for an end to the wars, has landed somewhere in the middle on Ukraine. “We certainly don’t want us to get involved, but if we have to would support the president,” said Naveed Shah, the group’s political director. The ideological fragmentation is similar on Capitol Hill and among national security policy experts. Even conservatives who have traditionally hewed to a pro-democracy line have taken a position against what they call “expansionist foreign policy” in standing up to Russia now. “This is definitely not a left-right thing,” said Emma Ashford, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and co-author of an article expressing opposition to American support of Ukraine, arguing that the United States is stretched too thin abroad. “If you consider the broad swath of the restraint or antiwar movements, there are a lot of different groups under that umbrella,” she said. “The antiwar left says we should avoid conflict altogether, and we are saying the same thing, but for different reasons.” For some groups aligned with Democrats, the motivations for supporting Mr. Biden are clear after four years of a president who admired Mr. Putin and was hostile to NATO. “The progressive position here is to avoid war,” Mr. Soltz said, adding that “buzz words like ‘forever war’ don’t hold up when you talk about Putin. While the U.S. was playing games in the Middle East for 25 years, Russia was rebuilding its military.” That is not a universally held position on the political left. Last month, Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, released a statement with Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California and a leading antiwar voice in her party, expressing worry that “new troop deployments, sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions and a flood of hundreds of millions of dollars in lethal weapons will only raise tensions and increase the chance of miscalculation.” In a recent television interview, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, decried the “military industrial complex” and added: “I believe that the Biden administration is well within their right to counter Russia’s aggression diplomatically, but there is not a military solution to this problem.” Other liberal-leaning veterans’ groups aligned with VoteVets on the wars against terrorism are concerned that helping Ukraine could lead to a military intervention and have pushed for diplomatic solutions. “While Americans are concerned about Ukraine, poll after poll shows this sympathy doesn’t translate into support for any form of military intervention,” said Adam Weinstein, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute and a Marine veteran. “The incessant promise that the next military intervention is different has largely fallen on deaf ears among vets and outside the Beltway.” On the Republican side, while there is significant support for Mr. Biden’s efforts, a populist strain is evident. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, have both suggested that the United States has no role to play in the fate of Ukraine. Former President Donald J. Trump said recently, “Before Joe Biden sends any troops to defend a border in Europe, he should be sending troops to defend our border right here in Texas,” a talking point that some other congressional Republicans appear to be grabbing as well. But even among some Republican lawmakers less overtly aligned with Mr. Trump and his isolationist tendencies, the reception has been tepid. Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, for instance, has said that he is against sending more troops to Europe. “The White House and many foreign policy commentators want to simply write it off as ‘Russian disinformation’ or Tucker’s affinity for Putin,” said Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America. “But it is really another example of the shift in the larger foreign policy debate.” The Secure Families Initiative, which represents military families, expressed wariness of the United States “nearing another endless, unwinnable war,” according to a statement released in response to the developments in Eastern Europe. “We’ve focused on reinforcing the administration’s stated guardrails regarding these deployments,” said Sarah Streyder, the group’s executive director and an active-duty military spouse. “Any time troops deploy, it’s a potentially life-changing event for the military families back at home, and so we don’t take the decision lightly even if it turns out to be the most strategic choice.”",1
2022-02-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/opinion/germany-ukraine-scholz-biden.html,"Opinion | On Ukraine, Germany Is Nowhere to Be Seen","BERLIN — Last week, Ukrainian legislators held up the flags of countries providing military and diplomatic assistance to Ukraine as it faces the threat of a Russian invasion. The flags of the United States, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Poland and Turkey all jostled for space. One, however, was conspicuous by its absence: the black, red and gold of Germany. It was a fitting rebuke. Over the past few weeks, as Europe has seemingly approached the brink of war, Germany has been the odd man out. While the United States, Britain and Poland delivered weapons to Ukraine, the German government stoutly refused to do the same — and even seemed to block a transfer of weapons previously sold to Estonia. Across the continent, criticism has been fierce. For Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who on Monday met with President Biden in Washington, it’s been a trial by fire. In office since December and at the head of a new coalition government, he has struggled to gain control of a situation that threatens to torpedo his authority. It’s a stark contrast to the way Angela Merkel stepped up after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Through active and energetic diplomacy, Ms. Merkel was able to bring about a cease-fire and something approaching a settlement. Under similar pressure, her successor has gone missing. But the problem goes beyond Mr. Scholz to Germany itself. The crisis in Ukraine puts to the sword many of the country’s central assumptions about its role in the world. Wedded to the past and conflicted in the present, Germany — at least when it comes to foreign policy — looks stuck. But now is not the time to be indecisive. It needs to assert itself as a power broker and unify Europe’s response to Russian aggression. The first difficulty, of course, is historical. Determined not to repeat the horrors of the past, the country is extremely wary about military engagement. That caution extends to weapons, which are generally not sold to conflict zones or when they could become instruments of human rights violations. In practice, economic interests often overrule principles: Saudi Arabia and Egypt receive German weaponry. Yet with Russia, the issue is particularly fraught. Never again, goes the catechism, shall German weapons be used to kill Russian citizens. These historical arguments are not particularly useful in the 21st century. But Germany just can’t get over them: Pacifism and history are deeply ingrained in our public debate and particularly in the political culture of two of the three parties currently governing the country, the Greens and the Social Democrats. For Mr. Scholz’s Social Democratic Party, relations with Russia are an especially emotional and contested issue. The party prides itself on its change-through-rapprochement approach during the Cold War, and many members defend the notion that Germany’s role is to be a buffer between the United States and Russia rather than to clearly side with the West. It’s a narrative rooted in nostalgia and idealism, but it has a cynical side: The party’s defense for Nord Stream 2, the controversial pipeline built to deliver more Russian gas to Europe, often clads straightforward economic interests in the gown of historical dignity. For the Green Party, the second largest in Germany’s so-called Traffic Light coalition, the situation is no less sensitive. Founded out of the peace and ecological movements in 1980, it opposed the deployment of American nuclear weapons to Germany and rearmament generally. The party’s position has since evolved, but Russia’s threat to Ukraine has caught the Greens at a difficult moment. After a slightly disappointing election result in September, tensions within the party — over cabinet positions, internal reforms and political priorities — are high. It is, in short, a bad moment to take an ax to a central pillar of party identity. Then there’s the coalition itself, formed two months ago and keen to show it can provide stable rule. With domestic problems mounting — rising prices, pandemic restrictions and ambitious decarbonization plans threaten the country’s uneasy equilibrium — the government may have decided not to risk its unity over a foreign policy issue. Its caution, after all, is in step with national opinion at large: A recent survey showed that 59 percent of Germans oppose delivering weapons to Ukraine, while only 20 percent approve. Taken together, it amounts to a difficult brief for Mr. Scholz. And it’s clear that, so far, he’s struggled to meet the moment. Criticism abroad — Latvia’s defense minister called Germany’s reluctance to arm Ukraine “immoral” and “hypocritical” — has been more sharply expressed but no more pointed than at home, where Mr. Scholz has been derided as almost invisible. (On Twitter, #WoIstScholz — “Where is Scholz?” — became something between a lament and a joke.) His personal approval ratings have sunk 17 percentage points, according to a recent poll, and his party’s standing has also taken a hit. After Ms. Merkel’s long tenure, Mr. Scholz is discovering just how hard the job can be. It’s not just Germany he’s struggling to lead; it’s Europe, too. Yet Mr. Scholz maintains that the country is taking the right path. In a television interview last week, he stressed that Germany has invested $2 billion in Ukraine in recent years. Building a country’s resilience, a senior government official told me, means helping it to defend itself. The chancellery appears to deem weapon deliveries to Ukraine purely symbolic — a costly exercise politically, with little actual impact. And officials were quick to underline Germany’s leading presence in NATO’s deployment, since 2017, of troops to Poland and the Baltic States. On Monday, the country announced it would send 350 more soldiers to defend NATO’s eastern flank. Is this just the usual German delusion? Is the country just making excuses for pursuing business as usual? Yes and no. Germany is certainly reluctant to leave its comfort zone, as its hesitancy — nowhere better captured than in its offer to send Ukraine helmets rather than missiles — clearly betrays. But some things have changed. For one thing, some Social Democrats appear willing to leave behind the idea of a special relationship with Russia. “We don’t want a special role for Germany,” Michael Roth, a Social Democrat who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, told me. This is a significant development and means that Nord Stream 2 is, for the first time, genuinely on the line. As Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister (and a co-leader of the Green Party), made clear to her Russian counterpart in January: Germany is prepared to act, even if “such measures hurt us economically.” In the context of the past, it’s a bold statement. But these nuances are not as easy to grasp as boots on the ground. On Monday, Mr. Scholz, addressing Mr. Biden by his first name, sought to bolster the trans-Atlantic alliance. “We are absolutely united,” he said. There’s no reason, really, to doubt it. But it may still take some convincing. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

2022-02-16,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/opinion/ukraine-war-biden.html,Opinion | Ukraine and a Post-Pax Americana World,"Who knows, at this writing, what Vladimir Putin will decide to do with the forces he’s massed along Ukraine’s borders? If Putin backs down, maybe thanks to some face-saving diplomatic formula, the Biden administration will deserve full credit for masterly crisis management: whipping into line our European allies, particularly Germany; thwarting Russian covert operations by leaking details to the media; expanding America’s military presence in frontline NATO states; working on ways to supply Europe with liquefied natural gas; refusing to negotiate at Ukraine’s expense; threatening sanctions against Moscow that, for once, have real teeth. If Putin doesn’t back down, these were still the right and necessary steps. They just weren’t sufficient. Either way, the crisis should serve as a tutorial on what the so-called post-Pax Americana world will look like. In a fantasy version of that world — a world in which American power isn’t constantly being called upon to address faraway crises or reassure nervous allies — the United States trades the burdens of being a superpower for the modest but more manageable, affordable and humane ambitions of a normal country. Our military shrinks to a size adequate for national defense, not global policing. We spend the savings on mending the frayed edges of society. Our allies stop freeloading off our security guarantees and start spending more on their own defense. Our foreign policy becomes less arrogant and more collaborative. We lose the illusion that we can, or should, solve other people’s problems, and we free ourselves from the personal sacrifices and moral compromises that go with that illusion. Our economic policies shift to adapt to a less-globalized world. Instead of depending on China for low-cost manufacturing and labor, we reinvest in American workers and factories and become independent in everything from energy to microchips. It’s a tempting vision, a left-right marriage of George McGovern’s “Come Home, America” and Donald Trump’s “America First.” It’s also been thought of before: Bob La Follette Jr., the progressive senator from Wisconsin, and Father Charles Coughlin, the antisemitic radio host, shared the same sorts of ideas in the run-up to World War II. They had broad public appeal all the way through Dec. 6, 1941. What’s wrong with those ideas? For starters, global order is not a self-generating phenomenon. In the absence of Pax Americana, would the United Nations be capable of enforcing rules of the road, like freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, over which as much as one-third of the world’s commercial traffic passes? How about regional alliances, like the European Union or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations? Don’t count on it. This has some obvious knock-on effects. It’s an invitation to predatory behavior — precisely of the kind we’re witnessing on Ukraine’s borders and also seeing signs of over the Taiwan Strait. And predatory behavior is rarely satisfied. A Russia that possesses more of Ukraine or a China that seizes Taiwan will each want more. They’ll be in a stronger position to get it. Another obvious consequence: There will be no peace dividend in a post-Pax Americana world. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the United States today spends historically little on defense — about 3.7 percent of gross domestic product, compared to more than 5 percent in the last year of the Carter administration. But military spending would have to return to Cold War levels for an era in which core U.S. interests were constantly threatened by hostile and confident powers. We would also find ourselves perplexed and frightened by the behavior of our traditional allies. Instead of having freeloaders, we would enter a world of freelancers, countries aggressively out for themselves, irrespective of American wishes or established norms. Without the assurance of U.S. protection, what would keep a future Japanese government from rapidly fielding a vast nuclear arsenal as a response to China? Why shouldn’t Turkey and Saudi Arabia go nuclear, too, particularly if Iran winds up with a bomb? A world in which several combustible regions each have multiple nuclear powers in varying configurations of alliance and hostility is a recipe for miscalculation, accident and tragedy. It’s also not a formula for prosperity. The idea that the United States should aspire to some sort of autarky is divorced from any conceivable economic reality. In a post-Pax Americana world, we would simply have to depend on flows of trade at the mercy of hostile powers and unexpected events. Most dangerously, the post-Pax Americana world is one in which liberal democracy would wither. This is already happening abroad, from Budapest to Ankara to Mexico City. Why shouldn’t it happen here, too? Charismatic dictatorships often inspire a current of admiration among democratic publics; it’s why a corner of the progressive left admired the Castro regime in Cuba, just as the new far right is quietly infatuated with Putin. Anyone who says it can’t happen here must have slept through the past five years. Whatever happens next in Ukraine, it won’t matter as much as the lessons we draw from it. Only the innocent think that an America that turns its back on the world will be left alone in turn. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-02-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/us/politics/biden-ukraine-crisis.html,Is the Ukraine Crisis Biden's Moment to Win Back Credibility?,"America’s chaotic exit from Afghanistan last year was a made-for-TV tragedy — complete with camera-ready scenes of frantic civilians, harried U.S. Marines and helicopters hovering over an embassy roof. Ukraine is a foreign policy conundrum of an entirely different sort. President Biden’s task is to stop a war from beginning, not to end one with dignity. But even if he wards off a Russian invasion, he shouldn’t expect any ticker tape on Fifth Avenue. “The politics of foreign policy are rarely fair, and this is the epitome of that kind of situation,” said John Gans, a former Pentagon speechwriter in the Obama administration. “You rarely get credit for the dogs that don’t bark.” Our colleagues have been all over the national security aspects of the showdown with Moscow, including the latest news developments, with reporting by Julian E. Barnes and Helene Cooper on how the White House is trying to outfox Russia, and Michael Crowley’s look at Biden’s calculations. But this is a political newsletter, so we must ask a crass question: Can Ukraine help Biden win back some of the public trust he lost after the Afghanistan pullout? In conversations in recent days with current and former officials, members of Congress and Capitol Hill aides, we found broad support overall for Biden’s approach to Ukraine, although some Republicans complained about specific aspects of the strategy. But the president’s options for resolving the crisis, many said, could give critics an opening. And, as Biden warned in his remarks on Tuesday, confronting Vladimir Putin is not likely to be “painless” for Americans, even if Russia relents. For the moment, Biden has faced some criticism on the right, but there’s been no sustained chorus of rebukes from either party. Republicans aren’t speaking with one voice. They are split between those, like Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who are agitating for a harder line against Moscow, and skeptics like Tucker Carlson of Fox News who say that Ukraine is not America’s problem. The party lost in 2018 its most prominent hawk, Senator John McCain of Arizona, while its current leader, Donald Trump, makes for a less than ideal messenger when it comes to Russia. The White House has also kept leading progressives on board. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has praised the administration for “doing its best walking a very difficult tightrope,” while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Jeff Merkley of Oregon told HuffPost that they support Biden’s strategy. Unlike with Afghanistan, criticism from the foreign policy establishment has been muted. “I think they started with a bit of an analytical mistake — that they could have a stable and predictable relationship with Russia so they could focus on China,” said Michael McFaul, a former ambassador to Moscow in the Obama administration. “But, generally, I’m impressed.” Since November, the administration has held more than 300 “diplomatic engagements” with partners and allies. Biden has sent troops to bolster jittery NATO allies in Eastern Europe. And the White House has used information as a weapon of deterrence, declassifying and disclosing intelligence to disrupt possible Russian operations in real time. Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former deputy national intelligence officer for Russia, described this as an effort to “build a common threat picture.” That much has worked so far. European countries that might otherwise have gone wobbly, notably Germany, have agreed to impose severe sanctions should Putin decide to invade. “Trump couldn’t have done this,” said Daniel Fried, a longtime Russia expert who retired in 2017 as the State Department’s coordinator for sanctions policy. “Trump wouldn’t have been interested.” Putin might still attack, of course, which would raise questions about the White House’s strategy. And he has options short of war, too: Annexing parts of Ukraine. Squeezing Kyiv economically. Wielding Russia’s energy resources to divide European countries. Launching cyberattacks. Forcing up the price of oil. Giving Putin an off-ramp could require a painful, protracted negotiating process, potentially leading to accusations that the United States is feeding Ukraine to the Russian wolf. Building a cross-aisle coalition in Washington won’t be easy, either. On Tuesday, as discussions on a bipartisan bill to penalize Russia broke down, the best Congress could cobble together was a statement expressing solidarity with Ukraine. Two of the holdouts were Cotton and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, both of whom harbor presidential ambitions. Senate Republicans introduced their own punitive legislation — the Never Yielding Europe’s Territory, or NYET Act, a rhetorical flourish in the form of a bill that would halt Nord Stream 2, a Baltic Sea gas pipeline meant to bypass Ukraine. The proposal was a reminder that Republicans have a megaphone but no real responsibility. And in an election year, national security can get political in a hurry. Historically, any effect that foreign crises have on public opinion tends to be ephemeral. After John F. Kennedy led the United States out of the Cuban missile crisis, his approval rating soared to 76 percent. By the time of his assassination a year later, it had fallen to the upper 50s. George H.W. Bush’s approval rating reached 89 percent after the first Gulf War, but it sank to 29 percent as the economy slumped, and he lost re-election to Bill Clinton. Killing Osama bin Laden bought Barack Obama about a month of buoyant poll numbers, at most. But when things go wrong abroad, the damage to a president’s credibility can be devastating. Lyndon B. Johnson declined to run for re-election after the Tet offensive in Vietnam helped drive his approval ratings into the mid-30s. The seizure of American hostages in Iran paralyzed Jimmy Carter, contributing to his defeat in 1980. And though George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, Iraq haunted the remainder of his presidency. David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Obama, said that Biden has been “very smart, strong and deliberate” on Ukraine. “Even as most Americans are focused closer to home,” he added, “‘smart, strong and deliberate’ are welcome adjectives for this president after a challenging six months.” Should Putin gain the upper hand, though, history’s judgment could be harsh. And even if things go well, some question the wisdom of devoting so much attention to a region that represents the geopolitical past, not its future. “We have to focus on China,” said Elbridge Colby, a former Pentagon official in the Trump administration. “The military situation in Asia is increasingly acute, and we’re way behind. Russia’s a secondary issue.” HOW THEY RUN Representative Kathleen Rice of New York announced on Tuesday that she won’t run for re-election in her Long Island district. As Annie Karni reported, Rice’s decision means that more Democrats are calling it quits this year than they have since 1992. Rice is the 30th House Democrat to make a retirement announcement — a statistic Republicans are celebrating as a sign that those Democrats are getting out to avoid brutal midterm elections. But that doesn’t tell the entire story. The raw number of retirements matters. But so does the kind of seats that Democrats are leaving, and the timing of their decisions in a redistricting year. “It’s a rush to the exits, but not yet an all-hands-abandon-ship moment,” said Michael Li, a redistricting expert and senior counsel for the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program. When a redistricting year overlaps with midterm elections, there’s extra motivation for members of Congress to consider retiring. For some, redistricting eliminates their districts outright. For others, it means they have to introduce themselves to new constituents, which costs money and means spending more time wooing donors. Either situation makes for a convenient time to leave Washington. Dan Sena, who led House Democrats’ campaign arm when they retook the majority in 2018, told us that he didn’t find the number of retirements to be particularly concerning. “The vast majority of these districts are Democratic districts,” he said. So far, just a handful of the districts that Democrats are leaving are expected to be competitive in the general election. It’s possible that the retirement list will look worse for Democrats in a few months than it does now. While Rice’s seat favors Democrats, multiple nonpartisan analysts have noted that in a big enough wave, Republicans could flip it. But the writing on the wall was much clearer, and worse, for the party in power in Trump’s first midterm election in 2018, when Republicans headed for the exits in droves. At least half a dozen Republicans who retired, resigned or ran for a different political office before the 2018 election were representing districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016, making them the lowest-hanging fruit for Democrats. A couple of Republicans who represented districts that Trump had only narrowly carried called it quits, too. Among this year’s retirements, Li said, only one Democratic incumbent, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona, would have run for re-election in a district that Trump carried. Thanks for reading.

2022-02-18,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/18/us/politics/congress-russia-sanctions.html,"Unable to Agree on Russia Sanctions Bill, Senate Settles for a Statement","WASHINGTON — For weeks, as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia signaled he was moving closer to invading Ukraine, members of Congress in both political parties vowed that the Senate would pass a “mother of all sanctions” bill targeting Moscow that would prove the overwhelming, bipartisan American resolve to stand with Kyiv against Russian aggression. But on Thursday evening, with the threat of invasion looming ever more acutely, senators could muster only the legislative equivalent of a strongly worded letter scolding Mr. Putin for a “provocative and reckless” military buildup on Ukraine’s border, passing a nonbinding resolution quickly and without debate before leaving Washington for a weeklong break. Some senators praised the symbolic action, taken with a voice vote, as proof that the Senate could unite to deliver a strong message of support at a perilous moment. But it was a striking backtracking, born of deep disagreements between the two parties over when and how to impose sanctions on top Russian officials and banks, and resistance by the Biden administration to acting before Mr. Putin invaded. The result was legislative paralysis on a measure that — at least conceptually — seemed to have enjoyed overwhelming support. Few senators had even questioned whether approving additional sanctions on Moscow would act as a deterrent against further incursions by Russia into Ukraine. “Both parties are saying the same thing about wanting the same result,” said Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, who had been negotiating the bill on behalf of his party. “It’s just, what action gets us that result?” Republicans and Democrats squabbled about that question for weeks. In January, Democrats scuttled an effort by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2, the Russian gas pipeline, arguing that imposing such measures before an invasion would give up key leverage that United States officials needed in diplomatic talks with Russia. Pressing a case made by the White House, they also said it would alienate Germany when demonstrating European unity against Moscow’s aggression was crucial. They all but promised they would coalesce around a new sanctions bill. The measure under discussion in recent weeks by Mr. Risch and Senator Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was supposed to be what they called the “mother of all sanctions” packages. It would have slapped immediate penalties on Russian officials and entities, and additional ones should Mr. Putin invade. The bill also would have authorized President Biden to use the Lend-Lease Act of 1941 to lend military equipment to Ukraine, on top of the $2.7 billion in security assistance the United States has committed to Kyiv since 2014. For weeks, senators used language such as “fine-tuning” and “one-yard line” to describe how close they were to reaching a deal. Mr. Menendez suggested that senators might even plow over objections from the White House to imposing sanctions before an invasion, a move that Republicans had pushed for but the Biden administration had lobbied hard to head off. “They’re not enthralled with the idea,” Mr. Menendez told reporters about the White House. “But I have suggested to them that a strong bipartisan response strengthens their hand.” But in the end, according to aides familiar with the negotiations, the intractable disagreements that doomed Mr. Cruz’s legislation also snarled the bipartisan negotiations. Democrats balked at imposing such broad sanctions before an invasion, amid fierce resistance from the Treasury Department, and Republicans insisted on doing so. As the talks wore on with no resolution, prominent backers of a sanctions package — including Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader — began to argue that Mr. Biden could unilaterally impose sanctions without congressional action. By Tuesday, eyeing the coming recess and the decaying state of negotiations, Senate Republicans unveiled their own sanctions legislation that also would have provided the Ukrainian government with an additional $500 million in military financing. Mr. Menendez denounced the move as “partisan posturing,” and said the proposal was “largely a reflection of what Democrats had already agreed to.” “A partisan victory is not worth a message of division from Washington, which only benefits Putin,” he said. Despite the partisan bickering over how best to proceed, there has been little division in the Senate over whether additional sanctions could change Mr. Putin’s behavior. Even Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who has argued that allowing Ukraine to join NATO would strain the security posture of the United States at a time when it should be focused on China, endorsed imposing additional sanctions. “If they get to a point where their financial system is seriously impaired, I think that that will absolutely send a message,” Mr. Hawley said in a brief interview. “In the new era we’re entering in Europe, we’re going to have to do more with less.” Only Senators Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who has long opposed the use of sanctions, and Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, have publicly opposed the proposed bill. “The sanctions against Russia that would be imposed as a consequence of its actions and Russia’s threatened response to those sanctions could result in massive economic upheaval — with impacts on energy, banking, food and the day-to-day needs of ordinary people throughout the entire world,” Mr. Sanders said in a speech from the Senate floor last week. That argument has also been adopted by some progressives in the House. A Russian incursion, however, would most likely only rally more support to impose sanctions, though both the House and Senate are slated on be out on recess until the last week of February. It would also eliminate the dispute over timing of the sanctions that appears to have hamstrung Senate negotiators: whether to impose sanctions before an invasion. “I can tell you this,” Mr. Risch said. “If there’s an invasion, there is going to be a lot of support for this bill.”",1
2022-02-18,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/opinion/liberalism-democracy-russia-ukraine.html,Opinion | The Dark Century: Why Is Liberalism in Decline?,"In the early 1990s I was a roving correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, based in Europe. Some years it felt as if all I did was cover good news: the end of the Soviet Union, Ukrainians voting for independence, German reunification, the spread of democracy across Eastern Europe, Mandela coming out of prison and the end of apartheid, the Oslo peace process that seemed to bring stability to the Middle East. I obsess about those years now. I obsess about them because the good times did not last. History is reverting toward barbarism. We have an authoritarian strongman in Russia threatening to invade his neighbor, an increasingly authoritarian China waging genocide on its people and threatening Taiwan, cyberattacks undermining the world order, democracy in retreat worldwide, thuggish populists across the West undermining nations from within. What the hell happened? Why were the hopes of the 1990s not realized? What is the key factor that has made the 21st century so dark, regressive and dangerous? The normal thing to say is that the liberal world order is in crisis. But just saying that doesn’t explain why. Why are people rejecting liberalism? What weakness in liberalism are its enemies exploiting? What is at the root of this dark century? Let me offer one explanation. Liberalism is a way of life built on respect for the dignity of each individual. A liberal order, John Stuart Mill suggested, is one in which people are free to conduct “experiments in living” so you wind up with “a large variety in types of character.” There’s no one best way to live, so liberals celebrate freedom, personal growth and diversity. Many of America’s founders were fervent believers in liberal democracy — up to a point. They had a profound respect for individual virtue, but also individual frailty. Samuel Adams said, “Ambitions and lust for power … are predominant passions in the breasts of most men.” Patrick Henry admitted to feelings of dread when he contemplated the “depravity of human nature.” One delegate to the constitutional convention said that the people “lack information and are constantly liable to be misled.” Our founders were aware that majorities are easily led by ambitious demagogues. So our founders built a system that respected popular opinion and majority rule while trying to build guardrails to check popular passion and prejudice. The crimes of the constitutional order are by now well known. It acquiesced to the existence of slavery and prolonged that institution for nearly another century. Early democratic systems enfranchised only a small share of adult Americans. But the genius of the Constitution was in its attempt to move toward democracy while trying to prevent undue concentrations of power. The founders divided power among the branches. They built in a whole series of republican checks, so that demagogues and populist crazes would not sweep over the land. “They designed a constitution for fallen people,” the historian Robert Tracy McKenzie writes in his book “We the Fallen People.” “Its genius lay in how it held in tension two seemingly incompatible beliefs: first, that the majority must generally prevail; and second, that the majority is predisposed to seek personal advantage above the common good.” While the Constitution guarded against abuses of power, the founders recognized that a much more important set of civic practices would mold people to be capable of being self-governing citizens: Churches were meant to teach virtue; leaders were to receive classical education, so they might understand human virtue and vice and the fragility of democracy; everyday citizens were to lead their lives as yeoman farmers so they might learn to live simply and work hard; civic associations and local government were to instill the habits of public service; patriotic rituals were observed to instill shared love of country; newspapers and magazines were there (more in theory than in fact) to create a well-informed citizenry; etiquette rules and democratic manners were adopted to encourage social equality and mutual respect. Think of it like farming. Planting the seeds is like establishing a democracy. But for democracy to function you have to till and fertilize the soil, erect fences, pull up weeds, prune the early growth. The founders knew that democracy is not natural. It takes a lot of cultivation to make democracy work. American foreign policy had a second founding after World War II. For much of our history Americans were content to prosper behind the safety of the oceans. But after having been dragged into two world wars, a generation of Americans realized the old attitude wasn’t working any more and America, following the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, would have to help build a liberal world order if it was to remain secure. The postwar generation was a bit like the founding generation. Its leaders — from Truman to George F. Kennan to Reinhold Niebuhr — championed democracy, but they had no illusions about the depravity of human beings. They’d read their history and understood that stretching back thousands of years, war, authoritarianism, exploitation, great powers crushing little ones — these were just the natural state of human societies. If America was to be secure, Americans would have to plant the seeds of democracy, but also do all the work of cultivation so those seeds could flourish. Americans oversaw the creation of peaceful democracies from the ruins of military dictatorships in Germany and Japan. They funded the Marshall Plan. They helped build multinational institutions like NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund. American military might stood ready to push back against the wolves who threatened the world order — sometimes effectively, as in Europe, but oftentimes, as in Vietnam and Iraq, recklessly and self-destructively. America championed democracy and human rights, at least when the Communists were violating them (not so much when our dictator allies across, say, Latin America were). Just as America’s founders understood that democracy is not natural, the postwar generation understood that peace is not natural — it has to be tended and cultivated from the frailties of human passion and greed. Over the past few generations that hopeful but sober view of human nature has faded. What’s been called the Culture of Narcissism took hold, with the view that human beings should be unshackled from restraint. You can trust yourself to be unselfish! Democracy and world peace were taken for granted. As Robert Kagan put it in his book “The Jungle Grows Back”: “We have lived so long inside the bubble of the liberal order that we can imagine no other kind of world. We think it is natural and normal, even inevitable.” If people are naturally good, we no longer have to do the hard agricultural work of cultivating virtuous citizens or fighting against human frailty. The Western advisers I covered in Russia in the early 1990s thought a lot about privatization and market reforms and very little about how to prevent greedy monsters from stealing the whole country. They had a naïve view of human nature. Even in America, over the past decades, the institutions that earlier generations thought were essential to molding a democratic citizenry have withered or malfunctioned. Many churches and media outlets have gone partisan. Civics education has receded. Neighborhood organizations have shrunk. Patriotic rituals are out of fashion. What happens when you don’t tend the seedbeds of democracy? Chaos? War? No, you return to normal. The 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were normal. Big countries like China, Russia and Turkey are ruled by fierce leaders with massive power. That’s normal. Small aristocracies in many nations hog gigantic shares of their nations’ wealth. That’s normal. Many people come to despise cultural outsiders, like immigrants. Normal. Global affairs resembles the law of the jungle, with big countries threatening small ones. This is the way it’s been for most of human history. In normal times, people crave order and leaders like Vladimir Putin arise to give it to them. Putin and Xi Jinping have arisen to be the 21st century’s paradigmatic men. Putin has established political order in Russia by reviving the Russian strong state tradition and by concentrating power in the hands of one man. He has established economic order through a grand bargain with oligarch-led firms, with him as the ultimate C.E.O. As Fiona Hill and Clifford G. Gaddy write in their book, “Mr. Putin,” corruption is the glue that holds the system together. Everybody’s wealth is deliberately tainted, so Putin has the power to accuse anyone of corruption and remove anyone at any time. He offers cultural order. He embraces the Russian Orthodox Church and rails against the postmodern godlessness of the West. He scorns homosexuality and transgenderism. Putin has redefined global conservatism and made himself its global leader. Many conservatives around the world see Putin’s strong, manly authority, his defense of traditional values and his enthusiastic embrace of orthodox faith, and they see their aspirations in human form. Right-wing leaders from Donald Trump in the United States to Marine Le Pen in France to Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines speak of Putin admiringly. The 21st century has become a dark century because the seedbeds of democracy have been neglected and normal historical authoritarianism is on the march. Putin and Xi seem confident that the winds of history are at their back. Writing in The Times a few weeks ago, Hill said that Putin believes the United States is in the same predicament Russia was in during the 1990s — “weakened at home and in retreat abroad.” Putin, Xi and the other global conservatives make comprehensive critiques of liberalism and the failings of liberal society. Unlike past authoritarians they have the massive power of modern surveillance technology to control their citizens. Russian troops are on the border of Ukraine because Putin needs to create the kind of disordered world that people like him thrive in. “The problem Russia has faced since the end of the Cold War is that the greatness Putin and many Russians seek cannot be achieved in a world that is secure and stable,” Kagan writes in “The Jungle Grows Back.” “To achieve greatness on the world stage, Russia must bring the world back to a past when neither Russians nor anyone else enjoyed security.” Will the liberals of the world be able to hold off the wolves? Strengthen democracy and preserve the rules-based world order? The events of the past few weeks have been fortifying. Joe Biden and the other world leaders have done an impressive job of rallying their collective resolve and pushing to keep Putin within his borders. But the problems of democracy and the liberal order can’t be solved from the top down. Today, across left and right, millions of Americans see U.S. efforts abroad as little more than imperialism, “endless wars” and domination. They don’t believe in the postwar project and refuse to provide popular support for it. The real problem is in the seedbeds of democracy, the institutions that are supposed to mold a citizenry and make us qualified to practice democracy. To restore those seedbeds, we first have to relearn the wisdom of the founders: We are not as virtuous as we think we are. Americans are no better than anyone else. Democracy is not natural; it is an artificial accomplishment that takes enormous work. Then we need to fortify the institutions that are supposed to teach the democratic skills: how to weigh evidence and commit to truth; how to correct for your own partisan blinders and learn to doubt your own opinions; how to respect people you disagree with; how to avoid catastrophism, conspiracy and apocalyptic thinking; how to avoid supporting demagogues; how to craft complex compromises. Democrats are not born; they are made. If the 21st century is to get brighter as it goes along, we have to get a lot better at making them. We don’t only have to worry about the people tearing down democracy. We have to worry about who is building it up. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-02-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/us/politics/russia-china-ukraine-biden.html,"Amid Ukraine Crisis, China and Russia's Bond Alarms U.S. and Europe","WASHINGTON — When Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister, called on Saturday for talks to resolve the crisis in Europe, he said Ukraine’s sovereignty should be “respected and safeguarded” — but also sided with Russia in saying that NATO enlargement was destabilizing the continent. “If NATO keeps expanding eastward, is it conducive to maintaining peace and stability in Europe?” he said by video at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, which Vice President Kamala Harris was attending in person to rally countries against Russia. It was the latest instance of what Western officials say is China taking a bold new swing at the United States and its allies by wading into European security issues to explicitly back Russia, which has amassed as many as 190,000 troops around Ukraine for a possible invasion — despite the fact Ukraine is not joining NATO anytime soon. Current and former U.S. and European officials say they are alarmed over what is effectively a nonaggression pact between China and Russia that could amount to a realignment of the world order. Portending a new type of Cold War, Biden administration officials say the United States will work to create and bolster its own coalitions of democratic nations — including new Europe and Asia-Pacific strategic groups — and help countries develop advanced military capabilities. John F. Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said last week that the U.S. government was watching the “burgeoning relationship” between China and Russia. He said that a joint statement issued by the two countries in early February when Presidents Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China met in Beijing showed that China was standing behind Mr. Putin’s military buildup around Ukraine. “Their tacit support, if you will, for Russia is deeply alarming, and, frankly, even more destabilizing to the security situation in Europe,” Mr. Kirby said. In recent weeks, the two nations negotiated a 30-year contract for Russia to supply gas to China through a new pipeline. They blocked a demand from Washington that the United Nations impose additional sanctions on North Korea for new missile tests, even though the two nations had agreed to similar sanctions before. And Russia moved large numbers of troops from Siberia to its west, a sign that Moscow, in preparing for a potential invasion of Ukraine, trusts China along their shared border in the east. Their long courtship reached a peak with the 5,000-word joint statement that said their partnership had “no limits,” which some Biden administration officials see as a turning point in China-Russia relations and a brazen challenge to American and European power. The statement was the first in which China explicitly joined Russia in opposing any further expansion of NATO, and the two countries denounced Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy and its new security partnership, AUKUS, which includes Britain and Australia. The nations also described Taiwan as “an inalienable part of China.” China and Russia declared that they would work with other countries to “promote genuine democracy” and counter American-led ideology and institutions — building a new world order in which autocracies are unchallenged, U.S. and European officials say. “They seek a new era, as they say, to replace the existing international order,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said in Munich on Saturday. “They prefer the rule of the strongest to the rule of law, intimidation instead of self-determination, coercion instead of cooperation.” The strengthening China-Russia ties could herald a reconfiguring of the triangle of power that defined the Cold War and that President Richard M. Nixon exploited 50 years ago on Monday when he made a historic visit to Beijing to normalize diplomatic relations. That helped the United States and China counterbalance the Soviet Union. Ties between Beijing and Moscow had been unraveling for years over issues of ideology and foreign policy. The opposite is happening now. “It’s certainly concerning, and it is not a positive development from the standpoint of U.S. national security or U.S. national interests,” said Susan Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego, and a former State Department official. “They have a kind of common perspective on the U.S. right now, and there is this affinity between the leaders.” Ms. Shirk said President Biden nonetheless should try engaging in diplomacy with Mr. Xi to coax him to act with the United States on the Russia-created Ukraine crisis. “This seems like Diplomacy 101 given at least the history of this triangular relationship,” she added. China and Russia are not united by ideology, and they are in a marriage of convenience that Russia needs more. While Mr. Xi appreciates Mr. Putin’s defiance of the United States, he does not want the economic uncertainty that a European war would bring. China also traditionally insists on respecting every nation’s sovereignty, as Mr. Wang made clear on Saturday. There are limits to what China would do to help Mr. Putin if he invades Ukraine. After Washington imposes sanctions on Russia, Chinese companies could buy more oil and gas from Russia and help fill some technology gaps, but the major Chinese state-owned banks would probably refrain from overt violations of the sanctions for fear of being shut out of the global financial system. Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin have met 38 times as national leaders. They share a drive to restore their nations to a former glory that they see as having been stripped from their homelands by Western European powers, the United States and, in China’s case, Japan. Both are obsessed with the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991: Mr. Putin seeks to forcefully wind back the clock to a pre-collapse era, while Mr. Xi aims to prevent China from meeting the same fate as the Soviet empire. They accuse Washington of fomenting mass protests and democracy movements around the world to overthrow other governments. An intensifying conflict with China and Russia would have a different shape than the Cold War. China’s trade economy is deeply integrated with those of other nations, including the United States, and Russia is an important energy exporter to Europe. For practical reasons, the three governments would be unable to completely block commercial exchanges with each other or form distinct economic blocs with partner countries, like in the days of the Iron Curtain. Nevertheless, foreign leaders and Democratic and Republican foreign policy practitioners have expressed concern in recent days. In a Wall Street Journal opinion column titled “Entente Multiplies the Threat From Russia and China,” John R. Bolton, the hawkish national security adviser under President Donald J. Trump, argued that the partnership “will last” because the two countries’ interests “are mutually complementary for the foreseeable future.” Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser under President George W. Bush, called the joint statement “a manifesto for their global leadership,” while Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia, said China’s explicitly pro-Russia position on European security was “new and significant and quite a radical departure from the past.” Scott Morrison, the current prime minister of Australia, denounced China last week for remaining “chillingly silent” on Russia’s military buildup around Ukraine and noted that the two countries were “banding together.” A senior U.S. official said the Biden administration would counter the two powers in part by trying to create “greater connectivity” among democratic partners and allies of the United States, one that goes beyond regional coalitions. Such an approach has been a central thrust for Mr. Biden, who during the 2020 campaign said Russia was the greatest foreign policy challenge for the United States in the medium term, and China the biggest in the long term. Mr. Biden pushed NATO to issue a summit communiqué last June that laid out the challenges that China poses to the alliance, a position that Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, has reiterated. The president held a virtual “Summit for Democracy” in December in which he spoke by video with officials from more than 100 countries. And this month, the White House released an Indo-Pacific strategy paper that said the United States would promote democratic institutions among partner nations and help them “deploy advanced war-fighting capabilities,” such as helping Australia build nuclear-powered submarines. Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin have denounced the initiatives. They have long seen those two main strategic prongs of Washington — promotion of democracy abroad and the deployment or sharing of troops and military equipment — as enormous threats to their nations. “It is hoped that the U.S. side will take off their tinted glasses, discard the Cold War mind-set, view China-Russia relations and cooperation objectively, recognize the prevailing trend of the times and do more things that are beneficial to world peace and development,” Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said when asked to comment for this article. Alexander Gabuev, the chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said that the joint statement from China and Russia was a notable public milestone, but that the most important cooperation was occurring beneath the surface. In particular, he said, weapons sales from Russia to the Chinese military should be of great concern to American policymakers. Mr. Gabuev also noted that because the two nations settled territorial disputes along their 2,700-mile border in 2008 and have increased their military cooperation, Moscow felt confident enough to move troops from its east to near Ukraine to prepare for a potential invasion — drawing down Russian troops on the borders with China and Mongolia to their lowest level since 1922. However, the two nations also compete and disagree on major issues. China has a growing footprint in Central Asia, whose former Soviet republics are viewed by Moscow as within its sphere of influence. China insists it is now a power in the Arctic, a region Mr. Putin has wanted to dominate. And the country has important trade relations with nations across the former Eastern European bloc. China is Ukraine’s largest trade partner, and Beijing has acknowledged the nation’s sovereignty for decades. It has never recognized Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Notably, the joint statement made no explicit mention of Ukraine. “When I was in the government, we would take a very hard look at China’s calculations and find those things that were not compatible with what Putin was trying to do and work on that basis,” said Daniel Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. “The fact is that it’s so late in the game, and the three sides have moved so far in this unequal triangle, that it’s really not going to be easy to try to undo that.” Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.",22
2022-02-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/opinion/nixon-china.html,Opinion | Nixon Feared a Russia-China Alliance. It's Here.,"Mao Zedong arrived in Moscow in 1949 expecting to be feted for delivering China, the world’s most populous country, to Communism. Instead, Joseph Stalin humiliated him by making him wait for a meeting. Although Stalin and Mao eventually signed a Treaty of Friendship, Mao chafed at being treated like a hayseed from a backward country. By the 1960s, Mao was openly feuding with the Soviets over leadership of the Communist world. The Soviet Union and China even battled each other in 1969 over disputed territory along their long border. That created an opening for Richard Nixon’s trip to China on Feb. 21, 1972, a diplomatic overture aimed at peeling China away from the Soviet orbit. In the short term, Nixon’s eight-day visit was an unambiguous success. Chinese leaders agreed to help spy on the Soviet Union. Nixon won re-election. The stage was set for China’s eventual integration into the global economy. But as we mark the 50th anniversary of that visit, some U.S. officials and foreign policy analysts have second-guessed the wisdom of partnering with Beijing. Even Nixon apparently looked back on the strategy with mixed feelings, and possibly some regret. Russia was a military threat, but never an economic rival. China, however, is becoming the first power in a century capable of challenging American dominance on both economic and military terms. Some American policymakers felt that China would eventually rise, with or without U.S. help. If you take that view, then welcoming China as a friendly partner, instead of a hostile power, made sense. Today, China has a far bigger stake in the international system and the U.S. economy than Nixon could have imagined possible. Still, over the years, American policymakers have oversold the benefits of engaging China and have underplayed the risks. Steps by China toward a free-market economy didn’t turn it into a democracy, as many argued it would. And although a lot of American businessmen grew wealthy off China’s success, and American consumers were able to buy a lot of cheap stuff, many American workers suffered when factories moved to China. Over the last 20 years, Washington has been too preoccupied with the war on terrorism to think about how to prevent the United States from becoming too dependent on a Communist country that could prove to be fundamentally at odds with us. President Xi Jinping of China makes no secret of his view that the United States is a fading superpower that is intent on blocking China’s ascent to its rightful place in the world. Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese goods, bringing an era of hopeful engagement to an end. But Mr. Trump’s isolationism benefited China, which filled the void of America’s global retreat. President Biden, who has rallied Europe, Australia and Japan with talk of fighting autocracy and making democracy bloom around the world, presents a thornier problem for Mr. Xi. If the United States and Europe remain united, they form an economic bloc that is still roughly twice the size of China’s economy. But by framing the struggle as a fight between the “free world” and dictatorship, the Biden administration risks pushing Russia and China closer together into what some are calling a “new axis of autocracy.” This time, Moscow is the little brother, seeking support from Beijing. It could prove to be among the most consequential geopolitical developments in decades. “What the West is doing now is the exact opposite of what Nixon did back then,” Adrian Geiges, a co-author of the forthcoming “Xi Jinping: The Most Powerful Man in the World,” told me. “Russia and China are not natural partners. They are partners because of the common enemy — the United States and Western Europe.” It’s too early to tell how far China will stick its neck out for Russia in its confrontation with the West over Ukraine. China’s leaders have long argued for a world free of formal military alliances. They’ve been cautious about getting entangled in other countries’ military conflicts. But President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Mr. Xi took pains to present a common front recently when they issued an extraordinary joint statement hours before the opening night of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The statement pledged that their cooperation would be “superior” to the one forged between the two countries during the Cold War. No area of cooperation would be off limits, presumably including Russia giving China its most advanced weaponry. The two countries began edging closer together in 2014, after Russia’s invasion of Crimea prompted Western sanctions. Russia weathered the fallout with some support from China, which beefed up trade and its purchase of Russian oil and gas. This month, the friendship appeared to break ground. The statement marked the first time that China has supported Russia’s demand for an end to NATO expansion. By signing onto the text, Russia also supported China’s claim to Taiwan, and both sides said they were “seriously concerned” about the U.S. decision to forge a military alliance with Britain and Australia and to cooperate “in the field of nuclear-powered submarines.” Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi might not be natural allies, but they have an awful lot in common. Both see the United States as a chaotic hegemon. Both men were profoundly shaken by the collapse of the Soviet Union, which they viewed as a cautionary tale of what not to do. Both have clamped down hard on dissent and dispensed with or circumvented presidential term limits, paving the way for the potential to rule for life. And both, longing to restore their countries’ role as great powers, are striving to recover territory that they see as having been lost to the West: Ukraine, in Russia’s case, and Taiwan, in the case of China. The most striking thing about their statement was its sweeping declarations. It reads like a manifesto calling for the United States to recognize that it is no longer the boss of the world. Two months after Mr. Biden presided over a democracy summit, Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi assailed “certain states’ attempts to impose their own ‘democratic standards’ on other countries, to monopolize the right to assess the level of compliance with democratic criteria, to draw dividing lines based on the grounds of ideology.” The world has changed, they asserted. Russia and China should be respected as “world powers” that get to dictate what happens in their backyards. The statement can be read as an attempt to peel America’s allies away or to make Americans lose the will to fight. The truth is that the world has changed. American democracy doesn’t look as shiny as it used to. Many people around the world are tired of Westerners telling them what to do. And yet the world is not jumping at the chance to be bossed around by the world’s largest surveillance states, either. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the fate of the world depends on our ability to get the response to this “axis of autocracy” right. Americans have to stand up for our values and our allies without ending up in a catastrophic war. No matter how testy relations become, we should remember that the biggest threats we face today — climate change, the pandemic and nuclear proliferation — threaten Russia and China, too.

2022-02-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/opinion/ukraine-russia-zelensky-putin.html,Opinion | Ukraine’s President Is in Over His Head,"KYIV, Ukraine — It’s not hard to guess what President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine must be craving right now: one normal day. The comic-turned-president surely never imagined the job would be quite so intense. First, he got tangled up in the impeachment of Donald Trump. Then he had to deal with the Covid pandemic. And now he’s facing the prospect of a full-scale invasion by Russia. Russia, of course, has been waging a war in eastern Ukraine since 2014. But now the threat is total: Up to 190,000 Russian troops have amassed near Ukraine’s borders and in separatist regions, and an invasion, bringing devastation and disaster, could come at any time. It’s a gravely serious situation. And Mr. Zelensky, a comedian for most of his life, is in over his head. When Mr. Zelensky took power in Ukraine in 2019, converting his TV fame into a stellar political career, no one knew what to expect. His opponents said he was so inexperienced, he was bound to be a disaster. His supporters thought that he would break away from the old ways and end corruption. His harshest critics claimed that Mr. Zelensky, a Russian-speaking man born in eastern Ukraine, would all but sell the country off to Russia. Others said he was an oligarch puppet. Yet the truth is more prosaic. Mr. Zelensky, the showman and performer, has been unmasked by reality. And it has revealed him to be dispiritingly mediocre. After his nearly three years in office, it’s clear what the problem is: Mr. Zelensky’s tendency to treat everything like a show. Gestures, for him, are more important than consequences. Strategic objectives are sacrificed for short-term benefits. The words he uses don’t matter, as long as they are entertaining. And when the reviews are bad, he stops listening and surrounds himself with fans. He started brightly. Early in his tenure, Mr. Zelensky commanded more power than any of his predecessors had. His fame and anti-establishment allure landed him with a parliamentary majority, a handpicked cabinet and a mandate for reform. At first, it seemed to be working. His government opened up the farmland market and expanded digital services across the country. He began an enormous road construction program, proclaiming that he wanted to be remembered as the president who finally built good roads in Ukraine. But the successes largely stopped there. Mr. Zelensky’s other major project, a campaign he calls “deoligarchization” that’s aimed at capping the influence of the very wealthy, looks more like a P.R. move than serious policy. Despite his campaign promises, no progress has been made in fighting corruption. According to Transparency International, Ukraine remains the third-most-corrupt country in Europe, after Russia and Azerbaijan. Anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies are either stalling or run by loyalists appointed by the president. Corruption just doesn’t seem to worry Mr. Zelensky much — at least when those implicated are close to him. In March 2020, when his chief of staff’s brother was caught offering government posts for money, Mr. Zelensky did nothing. More recently, a top lawmaker was caught on camera drunkenly offering a bribe to a police officer at the site of a car crash he might have caused. The public was outraged, but Mr. Zelensky mumbled a disapproving comment and moved on. Even the president’s beautiful newly built roads are mired in controversy. The procurement process is thought to be rigged and the prices too high. Scandals and tolerance for corruption have chipped away at Mr. Zelensky’s popularity. Sixty-two percent of Ukrainians don’t want him to run for re-election, and if an election were held today, he’d garner about 25 percent of the vote — down from the 30 percent he easily won in the first round of the 2019 election. He’d still be likely to win, but the historic 73 percent he scored in the second round feels like a distant memory. The president’s tense relationship with the press doesn’t help, either. A former actor used to the sound of applause, Mr. Zelensky is notoriously thin-skinned when it comes to criticism and challenging questions. He is visibly irritated by traditional journalists: In November, this fractious approach led to unseemly confrontations at a news conference. It’s not just the media Mr. Zelensky struggles to work with. His first year in charge was chaotic. His hastily assembled team quickly fell apart, and yesterday’s allies turned into some of his harshest critics. There were constant reshuffles. New ministers were given very little time to prove themselves and were kicked out if they didn’t. The churn eventually stopped, but at a cost. Mr. Zelensky, stung by the fallout, came to largely rely on the loyal rather than the qualified. A former movie producer and longtime friend was made chief of staff, joining other friends and confidants of Mr. Zelensky in wielding outsize power. The security service is overseen by a childhood friend, a former corporate lawyer, and the president’s party in Parliament is run by a loyal former I.T. businessman. The circle around the president has become an echo chamber. In the process, Mr. Zelensky has turned into a version of the politician he campaigned against: insular, closed off, surrounded by yes men. In normal circumstances, that would be bad enough. But now, when Ukraine is menaced by Russia, it may be affecting Mr. Zelensky’s judgment. That’s become ever clearer in recent weeks. As the West pursued megaphone diplomacy to discourage an invasion, Mr. Zelensky tried to downplay the threat. But this understandable effort to project calm and steady skittish markets was undermined by his showy style. In a tone-deaf address in January, for example, a patronizing Mr. Zelensky effectively mocked Ukrainians for their proneness to panic and laughed off a possible invasion. The very next day, he claimed Russia might invade Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Instead of being comforted, the country was confused. No wonder 53 percent of Ukrainians think Mr. Zelensky won’t be able to defend the country if there is an invasion. Yet Mr. Zelensky’s behavior, odd to the point of erratic, obscures a truth: He has no good options. On the one hand, any concession to Russia, particularly over the conflict in eastern Ukraine, would likely bring hundreds of thousands of people to the streets — threatening him with the fate of Viktor Yanukovych, the president overthrown by a revolution in 2014. Any decisive move against Russia, on the other hand, risks giving the Kremlin a pretext for a deadly invasion. The show must go on, of course. The crisis continues. But the president’s performance — strained, awkward, often inappropriate — is hardly helping. Olga Rudenko (@olya_rudenko) is the chief editor of The Kyiv Independent, a Ukrainian news site.

2022-02-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/opinion/putin-ukraine-nato.html,Opinion | This Is Putin’s War. But America and NATO Aren’t Innocent Bystanders.,"When a major conflict like Ukraine breaks out, journalists always ask themselves: “Where should I station myself?” Kyiv? Moscow? Munich? Washington? In this case, my answer is none of these. The only place to be for understanding this war is inside Russian President Vladimir Putin’s head. Putin is the most powerful, unchecked Russian leader since Stalin, and the timing of this war is a product of his ambitions, strategies and grievances. But, with all of that said, America is not entirely innocent of fueling his fires. How so? Putin views Ukraine’s ambition to leave his sphere of influence as both a strategic loss and a personal and national humiliation. In his speech on Monday, Putin literally said Ukraine has no claim to independence, but is instead an integral part of Russia — its people are “connected with us by blood, family ties.” Which is why Putin’s onslaught against Ukraine’s freely elected government feels like the geopolitical equivalent of an honor killing. Putin is basically saying to Ukrainians (more of whom want to join the European Union than NATO): “You fell in love with the wrong guy. You will not run off with either NATO or the E.U. And if I have to club your government to death and drag you back home, I will.” This is ugly, visceral stuff. Nevertheless, there is a back story here that is relevant. Putin’s attachment to Ukraine is not just mystical nationalism. In my view, there are two huge logs fueling this fire. The first log was the ill-considered decision by the U.S. in the 1990s to expand NATO after — indeed, despite — the collapse of the Soviet Union. And the second and far bigger log is how Putin cynically exploited NATO’s expansion closer to Russia’s borders to rally Russians to his side to cover for his huge failure of leadership. Putin has utterly failed to build Russia into an economic model that would actually attract its neighbors, not repel them, and inspire its most talented people to want to stay, not get in line for visas to the West. We need to look at both of these logs. Most Americans paid scant attention to the expansion of NATO in the late 1990s and early 2000s to countries in Eastern and Central Europe like Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, all of which had been part of the former Soviet Union or its sphere of influence. It was no mystery why these nations would want to be part of an alliance that obligated the U.S. to come to their defense in the event of an attack by Russia, the rump successor to the Soviet Union. The mystery was why the U.S. — which throughout the Cold War dreamed that Russia might one day have a democratic revolution and a leader who, however haltingly, would try to make Russia into a democracy and join the West — would choose to quickly push NATO into Russia’s face when it was weak. A very small group of officials and policy wonks at that time, myself included, asked that same question, but we were drowned out. The most important, and sole, voice at the top of the Clinton administration asking that question was none other than the defense secretary, Bill Perry. Recalling that moment years later, Perry in 2016 told a conference of The Guardian newspaper: “In the last few years, most of the blame can be pointed at the actions that Putin has taken. But in the early years I have to say that the United States deserves much of the blame. Our first action that really set us off in a bad direction was when NATO started to expand, bringing in Eastern European nations, some of them bordering Russia. “At that time, we were working closely with Russia and they were beginning to get used to the idea that NATO could be a friend rather than an enemy … but they were very uncomfortable about having NATO right up on their border and they made a strong appeal for us not to go ahead with that.” On May 2, 1998, immediately after the Senate ratified NATO expansion, I called George Kennan, the architect of America’s successful containment of the Soviet Union. Having joined the State Department in 1926 and served as U.S. ambassador to Moscow in 1952, Kennan was arguably America’s greatest expert on Russia. Though 94 at the time and frail of voice, he was sharp of mind when I asked for his opinion of NATO expansion. I am going to share Kennan’s whole answer: “I think it is the beginning of a new cold war. I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else. This expansion would make the founding fathers of this country turn over in their graves. “We have signed up to protect a whole series of countries, even though we have neither the resources nor the intention to do so in any serious way. [NATO expansion] was simply a lighthearted action by a Senate that has no real interest in foreign affairs. What bothers me is how superficial and ill informed the whole Senate debate was. I was particularly bothered by the references to Russia as a country dying to attack Western Europe. “Don’t people understand? Our differences in the Cold War were with the Soviet Communist regime. And now we are turning our backs on the very people who mounted the greatest bloodless revolution in history to remove that Soviet regime. And Russia’s democracy is as far advanced, if not farther, as any of these countries we’ve just signed up to defend from Russia. Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then [the NATO expanders] will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are — but this is just wrong.” It’s EXACTLY what has happened. To be sure, post-Cold War Russia evolving into a liberal system — the way post-World War II Germany and Japan did — was hardly a sure thing. Indeed, given Russia’s scant experience with democracy, it was a long shot. But some of us then thought it was a long shot worth trying, because even a less-than-democratic Russia — if it had been included rather than excluded from a new European security order — might have had much less interest or incentive in menacing its neighbors. Of course, none of this justifies Putin’s dismemberment of Ukraine. During Putin’s first two terms as president — from 2000 to 2008 — he occasionally grumbled about NATO expansion but did little more. Oil prices were high then, as was Putin’s domestic popularity, because he was presiding over the soaring growth of Russian personal incomes after a decade of painful restructuring and impoverishment following the collapse of communism. But across the last decade, as Russia’s economy stagnated, Putin either had to go for deeper economic reforms, which might have weakened his top-down control, or double down on his corrupt crony capitalist kleptocracy. He chose the latter, explained Leon Aron, a Russia expert at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of “Yeltsin: A Revolutionary Life,” who is now writing a book about the future of Putin’s Russia. And to both cover and distract from that choice, Putin shifted the basis of his popularity from “being the distributor of Russia’s newfound wealth and an economic reformer to the defender of the motherland,” Aron said. And right when Putin opted for domestic political reasons to become a nationalist avenger and a permanent “wartime president,” as Aron put it, what was waiting there for him to grasp onto was the most emotive threat to rally the Russian people behind him: “The low-hanging fruit of NATO expansion.” And he has dined out on it ever since, even though he knows that NATO has no plans to expand to include Ukraine. Countries and leaders usually react to humiliation in one of two ways — aggression or introspection. After China experienced what it called a “century of humiliation” from the West, it responded under Deng Xiaoping by essentially saying: “We’ll show you. We’ll beat you at your own game.” When Putin felt humiliated by the West after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the expansion of NATO, he responded: “I’ll show you. I’ll beat up Ukraine.” Yes, it’s all more complicated than that, but my point is this: This is Putin’s war. He’s a bad leader for Russia and its neighbors. But America and NATO are not just innocent bystanders in his evolution. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-02-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/us/politics/congress-ukraine-russia.html,"Once a Foreign Policy Partner, Congress Struggles for Unity on Ukraine","WASHINGTON — Since the 1950s, when Senator Arthur Vandenberg declared that “politics stops at the water’s edge,” titans in Congress have been key partners in America’s foreign policy, not as “yes men” to presidents but as co-architects of Pax Americana and the post-World War II order. But the spiraling Ukraine conflict has pointed up how far the power of Congress in the foreign policy arena has fallen since the death of Senator John McCain, the move of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. off Capitol Hill and to the White House, and the rise of a brand of partisanship that extends well beyond the water’s edge. This week, loud voices emerged urging President Biden to act forcefully to counter Russian aggression. But other lawmakers have used the crisis for partisan advantage, castigating the president and blaming the Biden administration for President Vladimir V. Putin’s assault on his neighbor. Perhaps more telling is the relative quiescence, from both Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, who are hobbled by divisions in their ranks and seemingly content to let the White House take the lead, the credit or the blame. “The Congress will be prepared to take further action, if additional action is deemed necessary,” Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader, said on Tuesday afternoon, encapsulating the hands-off posture of many of his colleagues. Such caution is in keeping with the legislative branch’s reluctance to challenge the expanding powers of the presidency abroad. “When you put your name next to an action, you’re going to be judged for that action, and Congress is full of risk-averse people,” said Casey Burgat, the director of the legislative affairs program at George Washington University, who studies Congress and foreign policy. “Foreign policy is a minefield of unintended consequences. It’s hard to put your name next to something when you don’t know how it ends.” After a month of trying and failing to reach consensus, senators from both parties went to work again on Tuesday on a multipronged legislative response to Russian aggression that would provide emergency funds for Ukraine’s defense, weaken Moscow’s economy and create a new task force to find ways to seize the wealth of Russian oligarchs, and possibly the riches of Mr. Putin himself. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said an emergency spending bill and bipartisan sanctions legislation — long delayed in Congress — could pass when lawmakers return from a Presidents’ Day recess. “I want a sanctions regime from hell next week,” he told reporters at a news conference in South Carolina. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said talks began Monday night and were picking up steam Tuesday, after senators fruitlessly argued for the past month over the size, shape and timing of a measure to impose sanctions legislatively. The spending bill would pump up lethal aid to Ukraine, help the Defense Department fund troop deployments to NATO countries to the north and the west of Ukraine, and prepare Ukraine’s neighbors for refugees. The sanctions bill aims to target the fabulously rich oligarchs who have bolstered Mr. Putin’s government while sending their children to schools in the West and their money into yachts in European ports and luxury apartments in London and Manhattan. “There is consensus among Democrats and Republicans that one of the soft underbellies of Putin’s world is the lavish lifestyles of the oligarchs that he supports to keep him in power,” Mr. Graham said. But he also warned the broader Russian public, “You can expect bad things to come your way.” Mr. Blumenthal said Germany’s action this week to halt work on a major natural gas pipeline from Russia to Western Europe had cleared away the biggest sticking point to a sanctions bill. Some Republicans had been pressing hard for sanctions to cripple the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, but the Biden administration strongly opposed such an action until a Russian attack, fearing it would splinter the trans-Atlantic alliance and hurt NATO unity before an invasion. But a month ago, Mr. Blumenthal was among the senators who vowed that a bipartisan vote on sanctions against Russia would come within a week or two, to prove U.S. unity and resolve — and marginalize voices on the far right that were questioning American interests in the conflict or, worse, siding with Mr. Putin. “I was disappointed, to be very blunt, that we were unable to come together,” Mr. Blumenthal said on Tuesday. There is no guarantee that unity is now at hand, either. Foreign policy has become a graveyard for legislative ambition. Repeated efforts to repeal or revise authorizations for military force passed in 2001 and 2002 have gained steam, only to die. Republican efforts to reshape or kill President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran came to nothing. Democratic efforts to block President Donald J. Trump’s “emergency” arms sales to the Middle East also proved unsuccessful. The ever-expanding powers of an imperial presidency have been greeted largely by inaction by the legislative branch. But the current crisis could be different, said Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, who has been working fruitlessly for nine years to reassert Congress’s authority to declare wars. Mr. Biden has broad authority to impose crippling sanctions on his own, but in some areas, such as cutting Russia off from the international banking computer system known as Swift, Congress may need to legislate. And after talking tough for so long, lawmakers will want to show they can come together. “Congress would rather not act if it doesn’t have to, and would rather leave it to the president if there’s a credible way to do that,” Mr. Kaine said. “But at this point, there isn’t a credible way to do that.” Mr. Graham, an outspoken ally of Mr. Trump, did say on Tuesday, amid shots by many of his Republican colleagues at the Biden administration: “We have one president at a time. President Biden is the president of the United States, and to the extent I can help him push back on Putin, I will.” But other Republicans were less gracious. “Joe Biden has refused to take meaningful action, and his weakness has emboldened Moscow,” Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said in a statement on Tuesday, echoing Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who wrote on Monday, “Biden-Harris officials are to an enormous extent directly responsible for this crisis.” The House Republican leadership even grabbed a photo of Mr. Biden’s back as he left the East Room of the White House after announcing the latest round of sanctions, and declared, “This is what weakness on the world stage looks like.” Criticism is nothing new, noted Mark Salter, a longtime aide, adviser and biographer of Mr. McCain’s. The senator, who died of brain cancer in 2018, was able to drive foreign and military policy from Capitol Hill through sheer force of personality. He could be harshly critical of presidents from both parties, but he was consistent in his advocacy of a strong trans-Atlantic alliance to confront authoritarianism. It is that consistency that is fraying, Mr. Salter said, and cheap shots for attention are not helpful. Republicans who stood silent as Mr. Trump launched a sustained assault on NATO and leaned toward Mr. Putin now speak of Mr. Biden’s weakness toward Russia. Leaders have failed to condemn isolationist voices in the party such as Mr. Trump and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who questioned on Twitter, “What is with these neocons drooling over our 18 year old men getting blown to pieces in war?” On conservative radio on Tuesday, the former president praised Mr. Putin as “savvy” and “genius,” echoing the Russian strongman’s description of his invading troops as peacekeepers. “That’s the strongest peace force; we could use that on our southern border,” Mr. Trump said, adding: “There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re going to keep the peace all right.” Such sentiments are light years from the internationalist coalition assembled by Mr. Vandenberg, a Michigan Republican, to support the postwar Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, the establishment of NATO and mutual defense agreements through the United Nations. “Even in the glory days of ‘politics stops at the water’s edge,’ if that ever existed, there was always political opportunism,” Mr. Salter said. “It’s just sort of disgusting at the moment.”",1
2022-02-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/world/europe/russia-putin-ukraine-europe-cold-war-nato.html,The Limits of a Europe Whole and Free,"PARIS — For the prime minister of Lithuania — and Lithuania knows something of life in Moscow’s imperium — President Vladimir V. Putin’s rambling dismissal of Ukrainian statehood, used to justify sending Russian troops into the eastern part of that state, “put Kafka and Orwell to shame.” There were “no lows too low, no lies too blatant,” the prime minister, Ingrida Simonyte, said of Mr. Putin’s menacing explanation on Monday of his decision to recognize two separatist regions of Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk. But if the speech revived the doublespeak of the Soviet Union, more than 30 years after its demise, did it also rekindle the Soviet threat and the Cold War that went with it? On many levels, the challenge Mr. Putin’s revanchist Russia presents to the West is different. This Russia has no pretense of a global ideology. The Cold War depended on closed systems; computer technology put an end to that. No Soviet tanks are poised to roll across the Prussian plains and absorb all Europe in a totalitarian empire. Nuclear Armageddon is not on the table. Yet, perhaps because of the way he prepared the ground for full-scale war, saying Russia has “every right to take retaliatory measures” against what he called a fictive nation led by usurpers who would be responsible for the bloodshed, Mr. Putin’s decision felt like a breaking point that went beyond his annexation of Crimea in 2014. It held up the specter of Europe’s darkest days. He laid down a marker, setting the outer limit of the Europe whole and free of 1989. The Russian president’s aggressive move was a slap in the face to President Emmanuel Macron of France, who has led efforts to engage with Russia, and it left, at least for now, the idea of some reconfigured European security architecture moribund. In its place, division and confrontation loomed in a world marked by what Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken called “President Putin’s flagrant disrespect for international law and norms.” The White House called Russia’s move “the beginning of an invasion.” China, walking a fine line between its support for Mr. Putin and its support for the territorial integrity of sovereign nations, has declined to criticize Russia, while saying those norms must be upheld. Still, in a month when Russia and China cemented a friendship with “no limits,” Mr. Putin’s order to dispatch troops into Ukraine suggested how Russian military might and Chinese ideological and economic heft might form a potent anti-democratic front. President Biden has often referred to an “inflection point” between liberal democracy and autocratic systems. For now, that point seems to lie in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of a country whose name means borderland. How far Mr. Putin is prepared to go remains unclear. A senior French official at the presidency, who insisted on anonymity in line with government practice, described the Russian leader’s speech as at once “rigid and, I would say, paranoid.” This, he suggested, was in keeping with the man Mr. Macron found at the end of a 20-foot table in the Kremlin earlier this month, and later described to journalists on his plane as more stiff, isolated and ideologically unyielding than at their previous meeting in 2019. Still, as Polonius put it in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, “Though this be madness, yet there is method in it.” Mr. Putin, for all his wild imaginings about Ukraine as the “forward springboard” for some American pre-emptive strike against Russia, has been relentlessly building his case against NATO expansion to Russia’s borders and against Western democracies since the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. The estimated 190,000 Russian and separatist troops on the Ukrainian border and in its breakaway regions are only the latest expression of this obsession. The open question is whether Mr. Putin has become weaker or stronger as a result of this drive. In some respects he has achieved the opposite of his intentions. American officials argue that he has galvanized and united a NATO alliance that was casting around for a raison d’être. He shifted Ukrainian public opinion decisively against Russia and toward an embrace of NATO and the West. He damaged an already vulnerable, undiversified economy, with Germany’s blocking on Tuesday of the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline just the latest blow. One poll this month in Ukraine by the Rating Group organization found support for NATO membership at a record high 62 percent, up from 55 percent in December. “He has turned Ukraine against Russia,” said Jacques Rupnik, a French political scientist focused on central European countries. “That is quite an achievement.” At the same time, however, Mr. Putin has proved effective on several fronts. The humiliated Russia of the immediate post-Cold-War years struts the global stage once more, winning the end game in Syria, working effectively through paramilitary surrogates in Africa, cementing a bond with China. The Russian president has suspended Georgia and Ukraine in strategic limbo through the frozen conflicts he has created there. NATO membership for Georgia is no longer talked about much. Ukraine’s membership seems infinitely distant, almost unimaginable, even to its closest Western allies. In 2013, President Barack Obama decided not to bomb Syria after Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, had crossed an American “red line” against using chemical weapons. Since then, Russia has moved aggressively in the apparent conviction that no provocation outside NATO countries will bring armed American reprisal. Mr. Putin’s decision on Monday to recognize the two breakaway regions was the latest example of this probing. Mr. Biden has made clear that no American troops will be sent to die for Ukraine. NATO expansion eastward after the fall of the Berlin Wall was designed to secure and safeguard the freedom of 100 million central Europeans who had escaped the Soviet imperium. It worked. One thing Mr. Putin has not done is threaten Poles or Romanians with renewed Russian subjugation. Its price, however, has been the festering alienation of Russia, which felt it had been betrayed by NATO at its border. This anger was redoubled in 2008 when NATO leaders issued a summit declaration in Bucharest saying that Ukraine and Georgia, once part of the Soviet Union, “will become members of NATO.” They did not say how or when because they did not know — leaving the commitment floating in a sea of treacherous vagueness. “It was an absolutely disastrous decision,” Mr. Rupnik said. “Either you say you will take Ukraine in by a certain date assuming certain conditions are met, or you say Ukraine’s place is not in NATO and we will devise an alternative strategic framework for the neighborhood between NATO and Russia. This was the worst of both worlds.” Just how bad is now apparent. Russia’s demand that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine has been met by the West’s insistence that NATO’s door will remain open, even if nobody is prepared to say how Ukraine would ever squeeze through that door. The West has complicated its position in other ways, too. As Marko Milanovic, a professor of international law at the University of Nottingham, pointed out in the European Journal of International Law Blog: “No matter how fantastical some Russian claims may be, the credibility of Western allies in responding to Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty remains deeply undermined, on the law and on the facts, by their own previous misadventures, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq.” In the end, Mr. Putin did what he did because he thinks he can get away with it in an unanchored world of growing Great Power rivalry, where American power is no longer determinant and the Russian-Chinese alignment is strong. But hubris is always a danger for a leader as isolated as Mr. Putin appears to be today. The most difficult thing for a communist, it has been observed, is to predict the past. History must be molded to the imperatives of the present. That is what Mr. Putin, the former K.G.B. agent, has tried to do. The coming weeks will tell if Ukrainian anger, rediscovered NATO unity, and American determination can stop his attempt to reverse the consequences of Soviet unraveling.",4
2022-02-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/opinion/ukraine-russia-us-war.html,Opinion | This Is a Moment for America to Believe in Itself Again,"Central to much of the skepticism regarding America’s involvement in the crisis in Ukraine is the question, “Who are we?” Who are we, with our long history of invasions and interventions, to lecture Vladimir Putin about respecting national sovereignty and international law? Who are we, with our domestic record of slavery and discrimination, our foreign record of supporting friendly dictators, and the ongoing injustices of American life, to hold ourselves up as paragons of freedom and human rights? Who are we, after 198 years of the Monroe Doctrine, to try to stop Russia from delineating its own sphere of influence? Who are we, with our habitual ignorance, to meddle in faraway disputes about which we know so little? Such questions are often put by people on the left, but there’s a powerful strain of the same thinking on the right. When Bill O’Reilly asked Donald Trump in 2017 how he could “respect” Putin when the Russian president is “a killer,” the president replied: “We’ve got a lot of killers. What, you think our country’s so innocent?” Trump aside, there’s something intrinsically virtuous about this kind of thinking: Who is it who tells us to first cast out the beam in our own eye before we cast out the mote in the eye of another? Countries, like people, are better off when they proceed with more self-awareness, less moral arrogance, greater intellectual humility and an innate respect for the reality of unintended consequences. But neither people nor countries are well served by the defects of those virtues: self-awareness that becomes a recipe for personal or policy paralysis, intellectual humility that leads to moral confusion, a fear of unknown risks that becomes an asset to an enemy. These are some of the deeper risks we now face in the contest with the Kremlin. Why has Putin chosen this moment to make his move on Ukraine? As many have pointed out, Russia is an objectively weak state — “Upper Volta with nuclear weapons,” as someone once quipped — with a nominal G.D.P. smaller than that of South Korea. Outside of energy, minerals and second-rate military equipment, it produces almost nothing that outsiders want: no Russian iPhone, Lexus or “Fauda.” Putin’s problem with Ukraine, starting with the Maidan uprising of 2014, is that Ukrainians want nothing to do with him. If he were a Disney character, he’d be Rapunzel’s mother. But Putin has advantages his opponents don’t, which go beyond the correlation of military forces in the Donbas. One advantage is the correlation of appetites: Putin wants Ukraine under his thumb much more than the West wants to keep Ukraine in its orbit, and he’s willing to pay a higher price to get it. Another advantage is the correlation of attention spans: Putin has methodically set his sights on returning Ukraine to his fold since at least 2004. For the West, Ukraine is another complex crisis of which it will eventually tire. A third advantage is the correlation of wills: Putin wants to change the geopolitical order of Europe and is prepared to take large risks to do it. The Biden administration wants to preserve a shaky and increasingly lifeless status quo. Fortune tends to favor the bold. But Putin’s greatest advantage is self-belief. Serious historians may scoff at his elaborate historical theories about Ukraine’s nonexistence as a true state. But he believes it, or at least he makes a convincing show of it. What, really, does the West believe about Ukraine, other than that it would be a shame, and scary, if Putin were to swallow large chunks of it? Certainly nothing worth fighting for. Most of us understand that history has a way of turning into myth, but the reverse can also be true: Myths have a way of making history. Fortune also tends to favor fervent believers. The United States used to have self-belief. Our civilization, multiple generations of Americans believed, represented human progress. Our political ideals — about the rule of law, human rights, individual liberties, democratic governance — were ideals for all people, including those beyond our borders. Our literature spoke to the universal human experience; our music to the universal soul. When we fought wars, it was for grand moral purposes, not avaricious aims. Even our worst blunders, as in Vietnam, stemmed from defensible principles. Our sins were real and numerous, but they were correctable flaws, not systemic features. It goes without saying that this self-belief — like all belief — was a mixture of truth and conceit, idealism and hubris, vision and blindness. It led us to make all sorts of errors, the acute awareness of which has become the dominant strain of our intellectual life. But it also led us to our great triumphs: Yorktown and Appomattox; the 13th and 19th Amendments; the Berlin Airlift and the fall of the Berlin Wall; the Marshall Plan and PEPFAR. These victories were not the result of asking, “Who are we?” They came about by asking, “Who but us?” In the crisis of Ukraine, which is really a crisis of the West, we might start asking the second question a little more often than the first.

2022-02-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/world/europe/china-russia-ukraine-sanctions.html,China Criticizes Sanctions Against Russia as Ineffective,"China on Wednesday criticized the expansion of economic sanctions against Russia, saying that they were unlikely to solve the Ukraine crisis and that they had the potential to harm average people as well as the interests of Beijing. “The position of the Chinese government is that we believe that sanctions have never been a fundamental and effective way to solve problems, and China always opposes any illegal unilateral sanctions,” Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry, said at a regular press briefing on Wednesday. “Since 2011, the United States has imposed sanctions on Russia more than 100 times, but we can all think about it calmly,” she added. “Have U.S. sanctions solved the problem?” Russia has cultivated close ties with China, a neighbor whose huge domestic economy offers a potential bulwark against Western sanctions. Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the Olympic Games in Beijing this month, and they declared in a joint statement that their friendship had “no limits.” Still, China offered an equivocal response to Mr. Putin’s moves against Ukraine this week, neither criticizing nor endorsing his decision to recognize two separatist enclaves and order the deployment of troops. But on the question of sanctions, China was sharply critical, warning against moves that could have wider effects. “When handling the Ukraine issue and relations with Russia,” Ms. Hua said, “the U.S. must not harm the legitimate rights and interests of China and other parties.” Claire Fu contributed research.",22
2022-02-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/us/politics/republican-candidates-split-over-ukraine-russia-crisis.html,Republican Candidates Split Over Ukraine-Russia Crisis,"You won’t find a clearer distillation of the Republican Party’s divide on foreign policy than the sparring that broke out this weekend in Ohio over Ukraine. It’s a skirmish that pits Trump-style, “America First” isolationists against more traditional hawkish Republicans. And while strategists in both parties say voters are much more concerned about pocketbook issues like inflation than they are about national security, the contrasting messages reflect a Republican Party that remains deeply torn between a base still loyal to Donald Trump and an elite seeking to move beyond him. On one side of the split is J.D. Vance, who has sought to parlay his celebrity as the author of “Hillbilly Elegy” into a Senate seat. On the other is Jane Timken, a former state party chair who represents the closest thing in the race to an establishment candidate. Timken has run a campaign focused on inflation, immigration, “parents’ rights” and crime. On Ukraine, she put out a statement Monday that was perfectly in tune with the Senate Republicans she hopes to join: supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty and calling for sanctions on Russia, while condemning Biden for what she called “weak and feckless leadership.” But Vance, a Yale Law School graduate who served in the Marines in Iraq before becoming a venture capitalist, staked out a wildly different position. “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,” Vance said in a podcast interview. A retired Army general, Barry R. McCaffrey, blasted those comments on Twitter. “JD Vance is a shameful person unsuitable for public office. His comments are those of a stooge for Russian aggression,” said McCaffrey, who led an infantry division during the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and has since become a television news analyst, defense consultant and Trump critic. To which Vance replied: “Your entire time in military leadership we won zero wars. You drank fine wine at bullshit security conferences while thousands of working class kids died on the battlefield. Oh, by the way, how much do you stand to gain financially from a war with Russia, Barry?” The exchange might as well have been ripped from Trump’s playbook. Trump, of course, famously derided John McCain’s war record during the 2016 presidential campaign. At a candidate event in Iowa in July 2015, Trump dismissed the Arizona senator’s service in Vietnam, saying, “I like people who weren’t captured.” At the time, his statement was widely seen as a fatal blunder. What politician in their right mind would attack a decorated war hero, a man who withstood torture in a Vietnamese prison for 5 years? And in a Republican primary, no less? What many pundits didn’t recognize at the time was how many Republican voters harbored a deep antipathy to foreign entanglements after years of overseas interventions that they saw as a failure. “The G.O.P. base were the ones who saw their kids from red states die and get wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan,” said Ryan James Girdusky, an adviser to a pro-Vance super PAC. “How many Ukrainians would lay their life down to protect the U.S.?” Debate over whether the G.O.P. should cater to that sentiment raged throughout Trump’s presidency. Trump’s frequent praise of President Vladimir Putin of Russia alarmed and appalled Republican senators, who often found themselves at odds with their own party leader on how best to deal with Moscow. The investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia dominated his first year in office. And a phone call with the president of Ukraine caused his first impeachment. Surveys in recent years have shown that Republican voters are much less likely than Democrats to support an active U.S. leadership role in world affairs, and Trump’s pollsters have argued that the base is not interested in policing other countries. At the same time, establishment Republicans venerate the party’s Cold War stance of “peace through strength,” a position best articulated by Ronald Reagan. “I think Ohio Republicans are of the same two minds that national Republicans are when it comes to how aggressive they should be in defending Ukraine,” said Mark R. Weaver, a Republican strategist based in Columbus. Ohio has large and politically active Eastern European communities, including some 80,000 Americans of Ukrainian descent. But the state also has a history of supporting isolationism, dating back to the days of Robert Taft Jr., the senator who opposed U.S. involvement in World War II. The question in Ohio’s Senate primary is: Which faction is larger? “Vance is clearly assuming he turns more voters on than he turns off with this America First isolationism,” said Jeff Sadosky, a former adviser to Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. Sadosky is currently neutral in the race. Portman, a Republican who is retiring this year, has made his bet: Last week, he endorsed Timken, and three other senators followed. Portman, who heads the Ukraine caucus in the Senate, remains popular in Ohio, and his imprimatur is likely to carry weight with Republican donors. Why we published an obscenity. Because the tone of a Times article should be thoughtful and restrained, we generally avoid publishing vulgarities. However, we do publish offensive language in exceptional cases, as when an important public figure uses such language in a public setting, or where the use of the words themselves is the story. Vance has made a different calculation. He’s been peppering his Twitter feed with comments on Ukraine for several weeks now, hitting several themes at once. First, that the fate of Ukraine is none of America’s concern. Second, that he’s more concerned about illegal immigration. And third, that corrupt elites have conspired to embroil Americans in pointless wars. “Worth repeating: our leaders care more about Ukraine’s border than they do our own,” Vance wrote on Twitter. “Billions spent on the Kennedy school, grand strategies seminars, and the Georgetown school of foreign service has bought us an elite that’s about to blunder us into a Ukraine war. Our country is broken, especially in how it trains its leaders,” he wrote in another. Vance expanded on his comments in a statement on Tuesday that took aim at Timken for “jumping on the America last bandwagon.” Vance’s message is remarkably similar to the comments of Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host. In his hugely popular nightly broadcasts, Carlson has argued that Ukraine is of no consequence to the United States, that its government is corrupt and unworthy of U.S. support, and that Russia is not America’s enemy. “He’s running for the Republican voters who listen to Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump,” Andrew Fedynsky, director of the Ukrainian Museum-Archives in Cleveland, said of Vance. If Russia divides Republicans, two other issues bring them together. There’s opposition to President Biden, whose handling of foreign policy has polled poorly since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Then there is China — a country seen on the right as responsible for everything from the coronavirus pandemic to the collapse of working-class jobs in states like Ohio. “For all the left’s screaming about Russia, it’s China that sends fentanyl into their communities, buys up their farms, ships their jobs overseas, steals our technology, and poses the greatest long-term threat to the U.S.,” said Girdusky, the Vance super PAC adviser. Trump has said little about the conflict in Ukraine, leaving many Republicans uncertain about what line to take. On Tuesday, he made remarks that suggested he was impressed by Putin’s move to back the independence of two pro-Russian enclaves within Ukraine, calling it “pretty savvy” during a cameo on “The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show.” Fox News’s coverage of his comments focused on the more unifying topic with Republican voters: the need to defend Taiwan from a hypothetical Chinese attack. “China’s going to be next,” Trump said. “Not with me, they wouldn’t have.” Timken seized the chance to agree with the former president — at least in part. “President Trump is 100% right,” she wrote on Twitter. “1. This never would have happened under his leadership. 2. China is watching Biden’s weakness and licking its chops.” briefing book On Tuesday morning, Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the leader of the Republican Party’s Senate campaign arm, did something unusual: He put out his own electoral platform. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, had previously brushed off opportunities to define his agenda for the midterms, telling reporters, “I’ll let you know when we take it back.” The logic of McConnell’s position was obvious: Why give Democrats a set of policies to run against, when Republicans want to make the midterms a referendum on Biden? Privately, Republicans said Scott’s 11-point plan reads like a platform for a presidential run. It leans heavily on cultural wedge issues, such as requiring that children cite the Pledge of Allegiance and banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. He would also finish building the border wall with Mexico and name it after Trump. Scott, who insisted the platform was his and his alone, explained his reasoning in an interview with Politico. “As a general rule, you know, probably this year’s election is going to be a lot about the Biden agenda. But I do believe we’re going to win,” he said. “We ought to have a plan and what we’re trying to get done when we get the majority.” Judging from the gleeful reaction of Senate Democrats, who have not had much to cheer about this year, Scott’s move might have been a blunder. They’re now attacking a provision in the plan that reads: “All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount. Currently over half of Americans pay no income tax.” David Bergstein, the communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, emailed out a statement quoting critics of Scott’s proposals. “While Senate Democrats are fighting to lower costs and cut taxes, Senate GOP candidates have found their midterm bumper sticker: raising taxes on Americans, seniors and working families,” Bergstein said in a statement.

2022-02-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/world/europe/taiwan-china-ukraine.html,Some in Taiwan See Parallels to Ukraine,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine, calling it a violation of the United Nations charter, as the self-governed island eyes the conflict closely with its own existential crisis in mind. Many people within and outside the island are drawing parallels between Taiwan, which is claimed by Beijing, and Ukraine. On Wednesday, Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, ordered the island’s armed forces and security personnel to step up surveillance and strengthen defenses as part of an effort to reassure the public. While Beijing now regularly sends warplanes toward Taiwan, there is no sign that an invasion of the island is imminent. Though the comparison is not perfect, Taiwan, like Ukraine, has long lived in the shadow of a large and overbearing neighbor. Both China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have appealed to nostalgia for an idealized imperial past to justify their present-day territorial claims. Mr. Xi has intensified his warnings to Taiwan not to seek independence from China, just as Mr. Putin has barraged Ukraine with threats and demands. “We empathize with Ukraine’s situation,” Ms. Tsai said late last month in announcing the creation of a task force to study the tensions in Ukraine. On Wednesday, Ms. Tsai called on her government to remain on high alert against what she described as “cognitive warfare” and disinformation efforts by foreign powers intent on using the tensions in Ukraine to stoke panic and instability in Taiwan. There are key differences between Ukraine and Taiwan. While most countries do not recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation, the island is an important trade partner for the United States and a crucial node in the global supply chain. Its strategic location just off the coast of southeastern China has made it a key part of the United States’ military strategy in the Pacific. While the Biden administration has said outright that it would not send troops to defend Ukraine, it has not said whether it would defend Taiwan. The policy, known as “strategic ambiguity,” has historically served as a pillar of American deterrence. The concern among some analysts in Taiwan, however, is that a distracted West or a weak response to a Russian invasion in Ukraine could embolden the ruling Chinese Communist Party to ramp up pressure on the island using what Taiwan’s government has called “gray zone” tactics. Others have pointed to the tensions in Ukraine to criticize Ms. Tsai, who has kept a distance from Beijing while simultaneously bolstering ties with the United States and other Western countries. “The Ukraine outcome is right before our eyes,” Chao Chien-min, former deputy minister of Taiwan’s mainland affairs council, said at a conference on Tuesday, according to local news media reports. “Resisting China does not help protect Taiwan — it only accelerates our death.” Beijing has sought to maintain a balancing act on Ukraine, calling for respect for nations’ sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also implicitly acknowledging Mr. Putin’s grievances. It has made clear, however, that it sees Taiwan as fundamentally different from Ukraine. “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, and the Taiwan issue is purely China’s internal affairs,” Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a press briefing on Wednesday.

2022-02-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/opinion/ukraine-russia-putin-history.html,Opinion | Putin's Attack on Ukraine Teaches Us a Vital History Lesson,"What I see on the faces and hear in the voices of so many of the people around me is sheer disbelief about Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and a brutal war in Europe: Aren’t we supposed to be past this? Didn’t history move on? The Wall came down, the Cold War ended, and democratic liberalism was the wave of the future, which wouldn’t be so kind to strongmen like Vladimir Putin. Well, Putin didn’t get the message. Nor did plenty of others around the world. Our notions about history were innocent and disregarded most of it. They also depended on a solipsistic projection of Western — and, especially American — culture and beliefs onto nations that share neither. I don’t know if it’s a boomer thing, a modern thing, an elite thing or some other thing, but in my lifetime, in this country, among many of my generational peers, there has been a sense that people had learned particular lessons and were evolving past extremes of pettiness and barbarism, certainly in the corners of the globe deemed more enlightened. In Europe, so devastated and so educated by World War II, sovereign nations wouldn’t be invaded just because their neighbors were mightier, meaner and more rapacious. That was a grandiosity and folly of the past — before the European Union and before all of our “advances,” a word we’ve used so frequently and clung to so tightly, as if the accretion of knowledge and the epiphanies of science were guarantors, or at least harbingers, of affluence and peace. This perspective wasn’t just overly optimistic about history’s arc. It was blind to the present — to the unabated factionalism in the Middle East, to the blood spilled on borders all around the world, to the enduring and enduringly potent strains of territorialism and tribalism, to human nature. We are creatures of magnificent grace, capable of extraordinary altruism and empathy, and I usually choose to focus on that. But we are also acquisitive, aggressive, envious, suspicious. Look no further than the theaters of political warfare here in the United States — exemplar and tribune of the West — for evidence aplenty of that. Knowledge is no antidote to the most destructive human qualities. It’s no vaccine. To wit: vaccines. As my Times colleague Bret Stephens recently noted about conspiracy-minded Americans of the current moment: “Here we are with a vaccine that can save you from dying or going to the hospital with Covid, and tens of millions of people refuse to help themselves by taking it. Which goes to prove that no pandemic is deadlier than stupidity.” We reach fresh zeniths of sophistication; we tumble into the same old savagery. We devise technologies to usher us into a new information age; they become tools of misinformation. Three steps forward, two steps back, because, as my colleague David Brooks wrote last week, we’ve been cavalier about the constant hard work of progress and inadequately mindful of the full, messy spectrum of human tendencies. It’s not just that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it; it’s that the past repeats itself, not precisely but to a significant degree, because the psychologies that shaped it survive it. I was struck by a passage in Madeleine Albright’s excellent guest essay yesterday about Putin and her first impressions when, as the U.S. secretary of state, she met him in 2000. In the notes that she wrote down of their encounter, she remarked not only that he was “small and pale” but also that he was “embarrassed by what happened to his country and determined to restore its greatness.” He has stewed in that embarrassment ever since. He has grown more intent and less inhibited. And now the small and pale man has struck. He announced a “special military operation” in Ukraine today. He ordered and commenced a sweeping invasion by land, air and sea. By late this morning there were already reports of dozens of Ukrainian casualties, and there were explosions not just near the Russian border but also in cities all across the country, whose citizens find themselves at the mercy of Putin’s megalomania. Embarrassment, vanity, viciousness: History never moves on or gets past these forces, which drove invasions and conquests in centuries past and will drive invasions and conquests in years to come. There should be no great shock about Russia’s audacious attack on Ukraine — only profound sadness and painstaking thought about what to do and what’s to come. It’s only fitting that tributes to a gifted wordsmith include gifted wordsmithing, and that was the case last week with articles about the death of the writer P.J. O’Rourke. Christopher Buckley’s take, which appeared in The Times under the headline “P.J. O’Rourke and the Death of Conservative Humor,” included this passage: “Humorlessness has crept in its petty pace to the right, where it is conducted with North Korean-level solemnity by the bellowing myrmidons of MAGAdom. A sense of humor, much less self-awareness, is not a trait found in cults of personality. If Tucker Carlson has said anything advertently funny, witty or self-knowing from his bully pulpit, I missed it. Maybe you had to be there.” (Thanks to Jonine Collins of Aurora, Colo., and Jeff Merkel of Fairbanks, Alaska, among others for nominating this.) Buckley later added: “P.J. wasn’t the only conservative pundit to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016, but he didn’t try to spray Febreze on his ballot.” (Keith Bernard, Charlotte, N.C.) The Times book critic Dwight Garner added his own two cents on O’Rourke’s luster and legacy — and, Dwight writing like Dwight, it was more like two hundred bucks: “O’Rourke’s death matters not just because he was a lively presence, a cranky original. His absence leaves a martini-glass-size gap in what remains of conservatism’s huddled and surrounded intellectual and cultural wing.” Also: “Tucker Carlson stole O’Rourke’s preppy look (khakis, blue blazers) but not his wit, his cool or his intolerance for the barking mad.” (Those nominations come from me.) Here’s Dwight again, reviewing a collection of essays and speeches, “Burning Questions,” by Margaret Atwood: “I kept reading. Hope springs eternal across a crowded table of contents. And there is some smart material and pawky wit in ‘Burning Questions,’ even if they huddle, trembling, like ferns behind a waterfall.” (Jonathan Gerard, Durham, N.C., and Betsy Snider, Acworth, N.H.) Sticking with The Times, here’s Elizabeth Spiers, whose mixed-bag skepticism about human progress clearly matches mine, on workplace romances: “We are a higher species capable of observing restraint, but we are also ambulatory clusters of needs and desires, with which evolution has both protected and sabotaged us.” (Mike Burke, Honeoye Falls, N.Y.) Here’s James Poniewozik, noting that an appetite for nostalgia helped render aspects of the Super Bowl, especially its rap-centric halftime show, as tasty as they were meant to be: “For the game to finally center America’s biggest music genre in front of America’s biggest audience was overdue and thrilling. But the calendar doesn’t lie. The Super Bowl, as a rule, discovers music when that music’s audience discovers high-fiber diets, and the price of admission was knowing that this revolutionary soundtrack was now dad’s treadmill workout playlist. Snoop Dogg commanded the midfield stage, cool and resplendent in a blue bandanna tracksuit; that afternoon he had hosted the Puppy Bowl with Martha Stewart.” (Max Shulman, Manhattan) Alexis Soloski, reviewing a new Off Broadway production of “The Merchant of Venice,” called it “a fairy tale with a corrosive center, a chocolate filled with battery acid.” (Leila Hover, Lacey, Wash.) Melissa Kirsch, pondering “How Life Resumes” after the worst of the pandemic, described a trip out to the movies: “Being in an audience, emoting in concert, even squeezing past the bitter-enders in my row who sat all the way through the credits, felt good. It felt like a two-hour workout for my weakened living-life muscles. (Mary Liz Olazabal, Miami) Sabrina Imbler and Emily Anthes traced the path of the coronavirus through the animal kingdom: “The virus infiltrated zoos, infecting the usual suspects (tigers and lions) as well as more surprising species (the coati-mundi, which is native to the Americas and resembles a raccoon crossed with a lemur, and the binturong, which is native to Southeast Asia and resembles a raccoon crossed with an elderly man).” (Susan Sawatzky, Colorado Springs, and Bernie Cosell, Pearisburg, Va.) In The Washington Post, George Will bemoaned the Trump-pleasing somersaults performed by so many Republicans: “Considering the amount of nonsense spoken, it is consoling that so many people mean so little of what they say.” (Arthur Rothstein, San Francisco) David Ignatius, turning his attention toward Putin’s aggression, wrote: “Perhaps the Ukrainians will be able to field a strong, prickly resistance movement in the weeks ahead. But history teaches that this porcupine may have internal parasites — and that it will be pursued by a very sharp-toothed fox.” (Alan Stamm, Birmingham, Mich.) Also in The Washington Post, Robin Givhan reflected on the grief and strength of Ahmaud Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, as she spoke out on Tuesday: “She was the believer in God’s unflinching might. She was the unabashedly determined, stubborn and angry Black woman. Cooper-Jones epitomized all that is beautiful and wondrous in that phrase. Despite the effort society has expended trying to transform that trope into something ugly and hateful, there is no greater salvation than to rest under the protective wing of someone who loves you fiercely and relentlessly, who is enraged by your pain and who will fight your battles when you no longer can.” (MaryBeth Winkworth, Southfield, Mich.)

When readers thank me, it’s often for articulating perspectives that they share, and I understand why that’s meaningful to them. We’re all buoyed by the reassurance that others experience the world in the same fashion that we do. And we all like leads and tips, so I’m not surprised when readers convey their gratitude for an article that I’ve pointed them toward, a book that I’ve praised or a television show that I’ve recommended. But from time to time, after I’ve written something especially personal, I get a kind of thank-you email that I don’t expect. A reader will communicate appreciation for my vulnerability. And I’ll pause over that word, because vulnerability is usually cast in negative terms: To be vulnerable is to be at risk. To be vulnerable is to be exposed. It has connotations of weakness, fragility, danger. Ukraine was vulnerable. But these readers see another, different kind of vulnerability. Oprah Winfrey does, too, as I learned this week. On her Oprah Daily website, she has begun doing a series of “The Life You Want” classes, and she invited me to join her for one on Tuesday night to discuss my new book, “The Beauty of Dusk.” (The Times ran this excerpt last week.) I’ll admit to being wowed simply that an advance copy had found its way into her hands, let alone that she’d read and wanted to talk about it. She specifically wanted to discuss its portrait of vulnerability and my description of my compromised and imperiled eyesight not as a diminution but as an education. She wanted to ponder vulnerability as a means of connection, a bridge. And that is, indeed, how I tend and try to see it. To be vulnerable is to be more alert and ideally more sensitive to what’s going on around you. To be vulnerable is to let others in, and there’s promise as well as peril in that. To admit to vulnerability is to own up to being human. You show me someone who’s alive; I’ll show you someone who’s vulnerable. There are days, sure, when my vulnerability feels like powerlessness and I tremble inside. There are quite a number of them, and that’s not about my eyesight but about a thousand other things — about the evanescence of pleasures that I so wish I could hold on to, about the inconstancy of people whom I’d prefer to depend on, about my own failure to keep some of the promises that I’ve explicitly or implicitly made, about the limits of my energy, which once seemed boundless. I’m vulnerable to great disappointment. But that goes hand in hand with being open to great joy.",4
2022-02-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/opinion/putin-war-russia-military.html,Opinion | Why Is Putin at War Again? Because He Keeps Winning.,"There is no world leader today with a better track record when it comes to using military power than President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Whether against Georgia in 2008, Ukraine in 2014 or in Syria since 2015, the Russian military has repeatedly converted battlefield successes into political victories. Russia’s rearmament over the past decade and a half has been unmatched by a comparable increase in Western capabilities. So it is no surprise why Russia feels emboldened to use its military power while the West stands by. Russia’s past three wars are textbook examples of how to use military force in limited ways to achieve political goals. The invasion of Georgia in 2008 lasted five days but forced that country into humiliating political concessions. In Ukraine in 2014, regular Russian military units were deployed at scale for a few weeks, but this proved enough to force Kyiv to sign a painful peace deal. When Russia intervened in Syria in 2015, some Western analysts predicted a disaster along the lines of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which began in 1979 and ended, after a decade of quagmire, in retreat. Instead, Syria’s civil war served as a testing ground for Russia’s most advanced weaponry. For the past decade, Americans have come to believe that Russia’s strength lies in hybrid tactics — cyberwarfare, misinformation campaigns, covert operations — and its ability to meddle in other countries’ domestic politics. Yet as we have searched for Russian phantoms behind every misinformed Facebook post, Russia has replaced the poorly equipped army it inherited from the Soviet Union with a modern fighting force, featuring everything from new missiles to advanced electronic warfare systems. Today the threat to Europe’s security is not hybrid warfare but hard power, visible in the cruise missiles that have struck across Ukraine. “We are 50 percent-plus of global G.D.P.,” Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, argued recently, contrasting this to Russia’s unimpressive 3 percent share of the world’s economic output. However, economies don’t fight wars; militaries do. America’s economic power was tested when Mr. Biden threatened tough sanctions if Russia were to invade Ukraine; Mr. Putin did so anyway, betting that hard power would carry the day. There’s still no doubt that America’s military has better trained troops and more capable systems in aggregate. However, what matters is not theoretical military matchups but the ability to use force for specific aims. Russia has developed precisely the capabilities needed to rebuild its influence in Eastern Europe. The United States, meanwhile, has watched its room for maneuver in the region steadily shrink, hemmed in by Russian antiaircraft systems and cyber- and electronic warfare threats. Letting the military balance in Europe shift in Russia’s favor was a choice. The United States has itself partly to blame. Even after Russia’s first attacks on Ukraine in 2014, America’s reinforcements on the continent were only enough to slow the rate of improvement in Russia’s position. The Biden administration has presided over military spending cuts, after inflation is considered. America’s roughly $700 billion defense budget may look impressive, but Russia has the advantage of paying less for troops’ salaries and for domestically produced equipment. Adjusting for these differences, Russia’s defense budget has grown far more rapidly than America’s over the past two decades. European allies have even more to answer for: Germany and other European countries must wake up from the fantasy that peace is their birthright. They used to have serious fighting power. It is time to rebuild it. It may be that, in trying to swallow all of Ukraine, Mr. Putin has finally overstepped. A long occupation of Ukraine would stretch Russia’s capabilities, especially because its military advantages will be less significant if the conflict shifts into Ukraine’s populous cities. However, we should not simply assume that Ukraine will become Mr. Putin’s Afghanistan or his Iraq because other leaders have made their own errors. Mr. Putin could simply choose to destroy Ukraine and leave the West to pick up the pieces. Such a dismembered, dysfunctional Ukraine could well suit his interests. Russia’s recent wars have been carefully calculated and limited in cost. There’s no guarantee that this conflict won’t be, too. The U.S. strategy of making public intelligence about Russia’s military buildup around Ukraine was clever, but Mr. Putin has called our bluff. It was once popular to mock the Russian president for his 19th-century worldview, but his use of military power to bolster Russia’s influence has worked in the 21st century. The West’s assumption that the arc of history naturally bends in its direction is looking naïve. So, too, is the decision to let our military advantage slip. Soft power and economic influence are fine capabilities to have, but they cannot stop Russian armor as it rolls toward Kyiv.

2022-02-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/opinion/defeat-trump-democrat-myths.html,"Opinion | Defeat Trump, Now More Than Ever","The democratic nations of the world are in a global struggle against authoritarianism. That struggle has international fronts — starting with the need to confront, repel and weaken Vladimir Putin. But that struggle also has domestic fronts — the need to defeat the mini-Putins now found across the Western democracies. These are the demagogues who lie with Putinesque brazenness, who shred democratic institutions with Putinesque bravado, who strut the world’s stage with Putin’s amoral schoolboy machismo while pretending to represent all that is traditional and holy. In the United States that, of course, is Donald Trump. This moment of heightened danger and crisis makes it even clearer that the No. 1 domestic priority for all Americans who care about democracy is to make sure Trump never sees the inside of the Oval Office ever again. As democracy is threatened from abroad, it can’t also be cannibalized from within. Thinking has to be crystal clear. What are the crucial battlegrounds in the struggle against Trump? He won the White House by winning Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin with strong support from white voters without a college degree. Joe Biden ousted Trump by winning back those states and carrying the new swing states, Arizona and Georgia. So for the next three years Democrats need to wake up with one overriding political thought: What are we doing to appeal to all working-class voters in those five states? Are we doing anything today that might alienate these voters? Are the Democrats winning the contest for these voters right now? No. At the start of 2021 Democrats had a nine-point advantage when you asked voters to name their party preference. By the end of 2021 Republicans had a five-point advantage. Among swing voters, things are particularly grim. A February 2022 Economist/YouGov survey found that a pathetic 30 percent of independents approve of Biden’s job performance. Working-class voters are turning against Biden. According to a January Pew survey, 54 percent of Americans with graduate degrees approved of Biden’s performance, but only 37 percent of those without any college experience did. Are Democrats thinking clearly about how to win those voters? No. This week two veteran Democratic strategists, William A. Galston and Elaine Kamarck, issued a report for the Progressive Policy Institute arguing that Democrats need to get over at least three delusions. The first Democratic myth is, “People of color think and act alike.” In fact, there have been differences between Hispanics and Black Americans on issues like the economy, foreign policy and policing. Meanwhile working-class people have been moving toward the G.O.P. across racial lines. “Today, the Democrats’ working-class problem isn’t limited to white workers,” the veteran Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg wrote in The American Prospect. “The party is also losing support from working-class Blacks and Hispanics.” The second Democratic myth is, “Economics trumps culture.” This is the idea that if Democrats can shower working- and middle-class voters with material benefits, then that will overwhelm any differences they may have with them on religious, social and cultural issues — on guns, crime and immigration, etc. This crude economic determinism has been rebutted by history time and time again. The third myth is, “A progressive ascendancy is emerging.” The fact is that only 7 percent of the electorate considers itself “very liberal.” I would have thought the Biden economic agenda, which basically consists of handing money to the people who need it most, would be astoundingly popular. It’s popular, but not that popular. I would have thought Americans would scream bloody murder when the expansion of the existing child tax credit expired. They haven’t. Distrust in government is still astoundingly high, undercutting the progressive project at every turn. What do Democrats need to do now? Well, one thing they are really good at. Over the past few years a wide range of thinkers — across the political spectrum — have congregated around a neo-Hamiltonian agenda that stands for the idea that we need to build more things — roads, houses, colleges, green technologies and ports. Democrats need to hammer home this Builders agenda, which would provide good-paying jobs and renew American dynamism. But Democrats also have to do something they’re really bad at: Craft a cultural narrative around the theme of social order. The Democrats have been blamed for fringe ideas like “defund the police” and a zeal for “critical race theory” because the party doesn’t have its own mainstream social and cultural narrative. With war in Europe, crime rising on our streets, disarray at the border, social unraveling in many of our broken communities, perceived ideological unmooring in our schools, moral decay everywhere, Democrats need to tell us which cultural and moral values they stand for that will hold this country together. The authoritarians tell a simple story about how to restore order — it comes from cultural homogeneity and the iron fist of the strongman. Democrats have a harder challenge — to show how order can be woven amid diversity, openness and the full flowering of individuals. But Democrats need to name the moral values and practices that will restore social order. It doesn’t matter how many nice programs you have; people won’t support you if they think your path is the path to chaos. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-02-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/opinion/letters/russia-ukraine-putin.html,Opinion | Putin’s War on Ukraine: Rising Outrage,"To the Editor: Re “War in Ukraine” (front page, Feb. 25): The trajectory of the Russian move into Ukraine was obvious for weeks while the rest of the world figuratively slept. It is a luxury to think that Western countries should remain bystanders to an unfolding tragedy and not put boots on the ground to help defend Ukraine because there is no treaty obligation to do so. Had Western military moved into Ukraine, Vladimir Putin would not have dared to launch his vanity invasion. But seeing that Ukraine would be left to fend for itself, Mr. Putin concluded that there was little price to pay. President Biden telegraphed as much by adamantly taking a response by U.S. troops off the table. The loss of innocent life and of a country that simply wanted to be left alone should trouble our conscience. The lesson of a belligerent Germany in the 1939 invasion of Poland should have been “never again.” Ronald KallenHighland Park, Ill. To the Editor: The overarching reason that Vladimir Putin has declared war on Ukraine boils down to this — his pride. To Mr. Putin, the collapse of the Soviet Union was a monumental tragedy. Ever since Ukraine regained its independence, its sovereignty continually reminded him of the Soviet Union’s loss of power and glory. The world moved on; Mr. Putin hasn’t. As with all power-hungry demagogues throughout history, power — and its expansion — is the only thing that matters. Martin GellerManhasset, N.Y. To the Editor: A major factor in Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine now has been his perception that the United States is in a weakened state. Republicans have been quick to blame President Biden for this, conveniently ignoring their own role in dividing and weakening the resolve of Americans. Every president should have a loyal opposition, but not countering the pro-Putin statements of Donald Trump and his water carriers such as Tucker Carlson is unconscionable. The relentless efforts to undermine even those Biden policies that Republicans traditionally supported have undermined unity and supported Mr. Putin’s belief that he is dealing with a president who doesn’t have the support he needs to fight Russian aggression. Unfortunately he’s right. Marsha NiazmandEvanston, Ill. To the Editor: Vladimir Putin has a lock on nearly a quarter of the world’s gas reserves, but he can’t control the sun or the wind. The terrifying truth is that democratic nations paid for Mr. Putin’s bombing of Ukraine. Let’s learn from history: no more wars funded by oil or gas. Local clean energy for peace. Helena BireckiSan Francisco To the Editor: The news includes footage of Russian protesters in Moscow and St. Petersburg chanting “No to war!” as the police arrest them, shoving and herding them into vehicles. These protesters are the true spirit of Russia, their sense of justice intact despite lives lived under repression. The U.S. government should commend these brave Russians for their heroism in recognizing and opposing Vladimir Putin’s evil. Our leaders should salute them as the true children of Pushkin, Tolstoy and Sakharov. John FrancisPhiladelphia To the Editor: Vladimir Putin openly dreams of the Cold War world where numerous countries were ruled by the Soviet Union. His latest step has been to invade Ukraine. The democratic world faces a moment of truth. Do we really believe in democracy, or are we just interested in our own cushy and perceived safe life rather than standing by other democratic countries if there is a cost to pay? Sanctions are fine but take years to have any major effect. In the meantime Ukraine, and who knows what other country, will fall back under Russian control. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, we acted and stopped him. Was it really just about oil, or did we believe that invading another country was wrong and unacceptable? The Cold War ended decades ago, and there has been a long period of peace in Europe and Russia. It is up to the democratic world to decide if we want to slip back into that threatening world that existed during the Cold War. Ray WarrenMandurah, Australia To the Editor: My theory is that Vladimir Putin had planned on invading Ukraine during the pliable Trump administration, when he could get away with it. Luckily for Europe, his plans were delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. He has gone ahead, but now Joe Biden is president and NATO is united, so his success is less assured. Winnie BoalCincinnati To the Editor: The monstrous actions of Vladimir Putin and the lack of humanity in his rule over Russia should serve as a terrifying lesson for America. We can see what happens when an authoritarian cements his power through lies and propaganda, when the sycophants around him grovel at his feet, when the media promotes his lies, when a class of wealthy individuals lends him support to enhance their own financial status, and when he and his supporters subvert democracy and fair elections. Sound familiar? Donald Trump builds his American version of authoritarianism on lies, his sycophants grovel in fear of offending his followers, right-wing commentators at Fox News and other far-right outlets spread propaganda and lies, and the authoritarian’s followers show an utter disdain for democracy, voting and fair elections. Is it any surprise that people like Mr. Trump, Mike Pompeo and so many Trump followers downplay Mr. Putin’s actions or even express admiration for him? Is this what we really want for America? David S. ElkindGreenwich, Conn. To the Editor: Re “New York’s Efforts to Achieve Equity Are Hurting Black People,” by Jim Quinn and Hannah E. Meyers (Opinion guest essay, Feb. 18): While all New Yorkers are concerned about rising crime, including gun-related homicides and theft, the authors present a false choice when calling for a reversal of race-related justice reforms. We don’t have to choose between the safety of New Yorkers and addressing racism in incarceration, as the authors suggest. A recent study from University of California at Berkeley shows that New York’s bail reform has had no effect on crime rates, and research at George Mason University finds that the election of reform-minded prosecutors did not increase crime. Homicide rates did jump during the pandemic, reports the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice, but that also happened in cities that have not reformed incarceration policy. More than anything, providing both safety and fairness isn’t just within the realm of possibility; it must be a citywide imperative.

2022-02-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/us/politics/cpac-ukraine-putin.html,How CPAC Went From 'City Upon a Hill' to 'Anti-Anti-Putin',"In 1974, Gov. Ronald Reagan of California addressed a new conference of insurgent conservatives. But before he jumped into what would become one of his most famous speeches, laying out his vision of the nation as “the last best hope of man” and “a city upon a hill,” he introduced a young Navy pilot who had been recently released from a North Vietnamese prison. As the crowd gave the 37-year-old John McCain a rousing standing ovation, Reagan chuckled. “Well, I might as well sit down,” he said. “I can’t do any better than that for the remainder of the evening.” The moment deserves some unpacking today, as conservatives gather for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. It’s an event that bears little resemblance to the one that celebrated the future president and the future senator, who both went on to careers defined by support for aggressive U.S. intervention overseas. On the morning after President Vladimir Putin of Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine, at least one speaker at the conference used the platform to criticize President Biden, a Democrat, as distracted by a crisis in a place Americans need not care about. Others on the conference’s agenda have made remarks that seem to sympathize with Russia. On Saturday, activists will hear from Donald Trump, who this week hailed Putin as a “genius.” It’s not the first time that CPAC has revealed how far the Republican Party has traveled in the Trump era. In 2018, as McCain was suffering from terminal brain cancer, a CPAC crowd booed when Trump mentioned the senator’s name in a speech. But the conference’s evolution from its intellectual roots to ardent populism continues to anger and sadden many on the right. “CPAC was always a place where conservatives got together and debated ideas,” said Heath Mayo, the organizer of an alternate conservative gathering taking place in Washington, D.C., this weekend. “And that’s just not what it is anymore.” Most Republican members of Congress have hewed to a traditional conservative line — condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while criticizing Biden for not acting more swiftly to impose sanctions. But while there was plenty of criticism of Biden’s alleged weakness, this year’s CPAC features a number of speakers who have taken a starkly un-Reaganesque position. (Two of the Republican Party’s most prominent hawks — the former vice president, Mike Pence, and Nikki Haley, a former U.N. ambassador under Trump — did not attend.) Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist, said in his speech, “The U.S. southern border matters a lot more than the Ukrainian border.” He added: “I’m more worried about how the cartels are deliberately trying to infiltrate our country than a dispute 5,000 miles away, cities we can’t pronounce, places that most Americans can’t find on a map.” Other speakers include Candace Owens, a popular podcast host who this week urged her three million Twitter followers to read Putin’s remarks on Ukraine “to know what’s *actually* going on.” Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who has gained a following on the right, said on Twitter: “This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns.” It would be a mistake to infer that such remarks represent a majority of Republicans, said Quin Hillyer, a longtime conservative commentator. “It is not as widespread as it is loud,” Hillyer said. “The real debate among conservatives is about how to react rather than whether to sympathize with the Russians.” He pointed to polling suggesting that Republican voters are more anti-Putin than is widely assumed. Geoffrey Kabaservice, a historian of the Republican Party, said some conservatives are enthralled by “cheering on Putin as he wrecks the liberal order and makes all those smarty-pants experts cry.” “Tulsi Gabbard may believe in a lot of things the CPAC crowd does not, but they love her appetite for destruction — and that inclines all of them toward an anti-anti-Putin line,” he added. Matt Schlapp, the head of the American Conservative Union, which runs CPAC, defended the conference as a platform for a variety of viewpoints. But he said that he preferred to highlight non-establishment voices. “Nobody here has walked up to me and said, ‘Why isn’t Mitt Romney speaking?’” Schlapp said, referring to the Utah senator and 2012 Republican nominee. “I don’t see any reason why I’d have him on the stage. I don’t find him to be a constructive voice.” “Nobody here is thinking that John McCain should be reincarnated and give a speech at CPAC,” he added, though he said he respected his war record. For all the criticism of CPAC, efforts to develop an alternative forum remain embryonic. This weekend, 450 conservatives are gathering in Washington, D.C., for what organizers are billing as the anti-CPAC, the Principles First conference. The goal is to get back to the days when conservatives debated and inspired young activists, said Mayo, the group’s 31-year-old founder. “They respected disagreements and arguments. They got up onstage and made arguments. That is why we followed them,” he said. And while it’s not explicitly an anti-Trump gathering, the anti-Trump vibe is impossible to ignore. In the 2016 presidential primary, Mayo supported Marco Rubio, the hawkish Florida senator. The headline speakers are Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both Republicans who were censured by the party for their involvement in the congressional committee that is investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Both have been vocal supporters of Ukraine. Roger Zakheim, the Washington director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, said that “reasonable people can disagree” about the direction of the Republican Party, and noted that Reagan himself often faced attacks from his right flank. But he urged Republicans to reconnect with Reagan’s foreign policy ideas, which he boiled down to two fundamental principles: “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. It must be fought for” and “peace through strength.” The more discussion and disagreement, the merrier, said Hillyer. “Right now, Trump is not our standard-bearer. We do not have a national standard-bearer,” he said. “So everything is fair game.” pulse It’s too early to know precisely how Americans are reacting to Russia’s invasion. But public opinion surveys in the run-up to the conflict found voters clearly divided over just how far the United States should go to support Ukraine — and what costs they would be willing to bear. Overall, 52 percent of Americans said that the U.S. should have a “minor role,” in the situation in Ukraine, while 26 percent supported a “major role” and 20 percent argued for no role at all, according to a survey completed Monday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. In a surprising marker of how foreign policy views have shifted over the last several decades, Democrats were somewhat likelier than Republicans to say that the U.S. should have a major role in the conflict. A Republican firm, Echelon Research, found a similar split: 56 percent of Democrats thought the U.S. had a moral responsibility to protect Ukraine, compared to just 31 percent of Republicans. Recent surveys offered few signs that the public was poised to rally behind Biden during an international crisis. Just 43 percent of voters approved of his handling of his relationship with Russia, according to a Reuters poll. The tally closely mirrored his overall approval rating, suggesting that attitudes about his handling of Russia may reflect general attitudes about his presidency more than any specific views of his foreign policy. The surveys were taken before the Russian invasion into Ukraine and should be interpreted with caution. The findings only represent a baseline measure of where the public stood before the conflict, and attitudes might change quickly with new developments and sustained media coverage. It could be several more days before most pollsters complete surveys taken entirely after the Russian invasion. Still, the polling hints at some of the political risks for the Biden administration. The Reuters poll found that only about half of Americans backed sanctions against Russia if it would mean higher gas prices — as seems likely — even though more than two-thirds of voters said they supported increased sanctions in general. Even before any economic fallout from the conflict, most voters gave Biden poor ratings for his handling of the economy, inflation and gas prices. Voters have ranked inflation and the economy among the most important issues facing the country in surveys taken over the last several months. Is there anything you think we’re missing?

2022-02-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/world/europe/chrystia-freeland-vladimir-putin.html,A Canadian Leader with Ukrainian Roots Ranks Putin as One of Most ‘Reviled European Dictators.’,"In Canada, a country with one of the world’s largest Ukrainian diasporas, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been met with particularly visceral emotion, including from the deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, the daughter of a Ukrainian-Canadian mother. Speaking after Russia invaded Ukraine this week, Ms. Freeland, who lived for a time in Ukraine as a student in the late 1980s, said that President Vladimir V. Putin had cemented his place “in the ranks of the reviled European dictators who caused such carnage in the 20th century.” “The horrific human costs of this cruel invasion are the direct and personal responsibility of Vladimir Putin,” she said in a speech peppered with Russian and Ukrainian, adding: “To my own Ukrainian-Canadian community, let me say this: Now is the time for us to be strong as we support our friends and family in Ukraine.” Canada has a large population with Ukrainian heritage, including about 1.4 million Ukrainian-Canadians, according to the Canadian government. Brought up in Alberta amid Canada’s close-knit Ukrainian community, Ms. Freeland, a former Moscow bureau chief for The Financial Times and author of a book about Russia, has a strong connection to Ukraine. While a student at Harvard University in the late 1980s, she did a university exchange program in Kyiv. During the heady days of glasnost, in the run-up to the Soviet Union’s disintegration, she was involved in 1988 and 1989 in the Ukrainian independence movement, and was tailed by the KGB. She was even given a code name: Frida. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ms. Freeland, Canada has taken a strong stance against Russian aggression. This week it unveiled financial sanctions against 62 Russian individuals and entities, including members of the Russian elite, and halted all export permits. Amid concerns of a new European refugee crisis as Ukrainians flee the country, the Canadian government said Canadian Armed Forces in Poland were also prepared to help with humanitarian efforts, while Mr. Trudeau said Thursday that Canada would prioritize immigration applications for Ukrainians. Last year, Simon Miles, an assistant professor in the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, wrote in the Globe and Mail, a leading Canadian newspaper, that while Ms. Freeland was pursued by the KGB in the late 1980s, she earned the spy agency’s admiration by outfoxing them. Among other things, he wrote, she evaded interception by sending material out of Ukraine via a diplomatic pouch at the Canadian embassy in Moscow. Citing material from the KGB archives, Mr. Miles wrote that the KGB had tried to stymie Ms. Freeland, including by having her teacher at a university in Kyiv increase her academic workload. But again, she foiled the secret police because her fluent Ukrainian allowed her to ace her course work, without attending class. Last year, Ms. Freeland recalled her days as a student in Ukraine. “I am aware that my work with pro-democracy and environmental activists invoked the ire of the Soviet KGB. I remember being the target of smear campaigns in the Soviet press,” she told the Globe and Mail. “Though I was eventually forced to leave the country, I have no regrets about my time in Ukraine during the Soviet period. Out of this experience, what struck me, very powerfully, was how quickly a rotten political system could collapse, and how important the work of brave dissidents could be.”",4
2022-02-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/world/europe/trump-putin-russia-ukraine.html,"Trump Praises Putin, Leaving Republicans in a Bind","As Russia prepared to strike Ukraine and the United States rushed to defend neighboring allies in Europe, former President Donald J. Trump had nothing but admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. He is “pretty smart,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday at a Florida fund-raiser, assessing the impending invasion like a real estate deal. “He’s taken over a country for $2 worth of sanctions,” he said, “taking over a country — really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people — and just walking right in.” Historians called the remarks unprecedented. “The idea that a former president would praise the man or leadership who American troops are even now traveling to confront and contain,” said Jeffrey Engel, a presidential historian at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, “is astounding.” Yet Republican leaders, while condemning the invasion of Ukraine, stayed silent about the ex-president’s repeated praise this week for Mr. Putin, even as some Trump allies — from former administration figures to the Fox News host Tucker Carlson — amplified his Russian-friendly views to the party’s core. Foreign policy experts and Russia scholars said the apparent sympathy or ambivalence toward Moscow from elements of the right raised questions about the influence Mr. Trump continues to exert over candidates seeking to tap into his base, the legacy of a decade-old effort by the Kremlin to court American conservatives and the future of the G.O.P. amid a backlash against the Republican-led entanglements in Afghanistan and Iraq. Cold War-era Republicans, historians said, would have repudiated comments like Mr. Trump’s as un-American. Anders Stephanson, a historian of foreign policy at Columbia University, recalled an earlier Russian invasion. “Could one imagine Dwight Eisenhower praising Leonid Brezhnev for invading Czechoslovakia in 1968?” he asked in an email. “I think not.” Republican congressional leaders on Thursday stayed far away from the Putin-friendly views that had been emanating from the former president. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, denounced Mr. Putin at length and urged the Biden administration to provide military aid to help the Ukrainians fight back. Asked at a news conference in Louisville about Mr. Trump’s comments, the senator responded with silence. As the threat of a Russian invasion rose, Mike Pompeo, a former secretary of state and C.I.A. chief under Mr. Trump, and now a potential presidential aspirant, appeared to take a similar line to his former boss. Mr. Putin was “an elegantly sophisticated counterpart” and “very shrewd,” Mr. Pompeo said. But as the Russian onslaught neared, Mr. Pompeo on Wednesday qualified those views. Mr. Putin was also “evil” and “should be crushed,” he told The Des Moines Register on a visit to Iowa. J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist and author who is courting Trump supporters as a candidate in the Ohio Republican primary for a Senate seat, recalibrated as well. “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other,” Mr. Vance said a few days ago, aligning himself with the former president. Yet on Thursday he issued a blistering statement both blaming “elites” for “the tragedy” of Russia’s invasion and opposing “further engulfing ourselves in Eastern Europe.” “Putin is an evil man,” Mr. Vance said, “but the foreign policy establishment that led Ukraine to the slaughterhouse deserves nothing but scorn.” Other Republicans across the country who are closest to the party’s base — House members and primary candidates — have often sought to deflect questions about their stance on Ukraine with answers that avoid breaking with Mr. Trump or agreeing with President Biden. A chorus of Republicans are arguing that the White House is worrying more about a distant conflict than about illegal immigration. “Why does Joe Biden care more about Ukraine’s border than the U.S. southern border?” the official Twitter account of the Republican minority of the House Judiciary Committee declared on Wednesday. Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, last week took a step toward the Trump-supporting base and away from the Republican leadership, arguing that NATO should placate Russia by refraining from expanding membership to Ukraine. “My view is that China is our number one security and economic threat,” Mr. Hawley said in an interview last week. “This is what leads me to being very skeptical of an expansion. I don’t think we can afford, in both the literal and colloquial uses of that term, to expand our security commitments in Europe.” But on Thursday, Mr. Hawley joined the leadership in urging Mr. Biden to send Ukraine military equipment and “sanction Russian energy production to a halt.” The former president’s allies in the conservative media, meanwhile, have carried his praise for Mr. Putin into a more fully formed argument against opposing the invasion of Ukraine. Tucker Carlson has echoed Kremlin talking points so closely that his sound bites have become a staple of Russian state television. Mr. Carlson, a onetime hawk who turned against American adventurism in the wake of the Iraq war, has openly questioned U.S. commitments to Ukraine since Mr. Trump’s first impeachment, when the former president was said to have withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure officials there into investigating Mr. Biden and his family. “What is this really about?” Mr. Carlson asked this week of the Biden administration’s condemnation of Russia. He answered himself with a series of questions inviting listeners to direct their anger at American liberals or at China instead. “Has Putin ever called me a racist?” Mr. Carlson asked, adding, “Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic?” “No one on this show is rooting for Putin,” Mr. Carlson sought to clarify on Wednesday, “or rooting for the Ukrainians for that matter.” “We are always rooting for peace,” he insisted. Andrew S. Weiss, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Kremlin had sought for a decade to win over allies on the American right, in part by denouncing gay rights, emphasizing Russian support for conservative social norms and inviting visits from prominent evangelical figures like Franklin Graham. “It’s worked beautifully,” Mr. Weiss said. Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to Mr. Trump who hosts a popular conservative podcast, hinted this week at the success of those efforts. “Putin ain’t woke — he is anti-woke,” Mr. Bannon said approvingly on Wednesday. He was interviewing Erik Prince, the private security contractor and a member of a prominent family of evangelical Christians and Republican donors, who joined Mr. Bannon in commending Russia for its opposition to transgender rights. On Thursday, Mr. Bannon argued that Congress should impeach Mr. Biden for “instigating this war in Ukraine.” “There is no appetite in Europe to defend themselves, OK?” Mr. Bannon said. “Now you’ve gone in and stirred up a hornet’s nest.” Hal Brands, a historian at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, compared the apparent sympathy for Russia among some on the right to earlier periods when groups on the political fringes embraced foreign rivals as foils for domestic opponents. During the years before the United States entered World War II, for example, a handful of lawmakers lauded Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini for their strong leadership. During the early years of the Cold War, he noted, some on the far left spoke approvingly of the Soviet Union as an alternative to unfettered capitalism. “Russia is a stand-in for anti-wokeness,” he said. But the current “fascination with Putin” among some on the right, he added, “is also wrapped up in the post-Trump sweepstakes.” “You see a lot of emulation going on among politicians who may or may not be authentically Trumpian but nonetheless want to claim that part of the party’s base for their own political ambitions.” Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.",1
2022-02-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/world/europe/eurovision-russia.html,Eurovision Bars Russia From This Year’s Song Contest,"The Eurovision Song Contest, a cultural phenomenon that was the springboard for Abba and Celine Dion and is watched annually by 200 million people, has decided that no Russian act will be allowed to participate in this year’s contest. In making the announcement on Friday, the organizers alluded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, citing fears that Russia’s inclusion in the contest would damage the reputation of the world’s largest music competition, a showcase meant to promote European unity and cultural exchange. The exclusion from the famously over-the-top celebration of kitsch may seem like a trivial matter, but if Russia becomes a cultural pariah on the global stage, it could intensify tensions within the country. President Vladimir V. Putin is credited with restoring Russia’s stability after the political and economic chaos of the 1990s. Russia began competing in the wildly popular song contest in 1994, has competed more than 20 times, and its participation has been a cultural touchstone of sorts for the country’s rebound and engagement with the world. In 2008, when Dima Bilan, a Russian pop star, won Eurovision with the song “Believe,” Mr. Putin weighed in promptly with congratulations, thanking him for further burnishing Russia’s image. The decision by the European Broadcasting Union, the coalition of public media organizations that oversees the contest, to block Russians from the contest followed the cancellation of two major European sporting events in Russia on Friday. European soccer’s governing body voted to move the Champions League final, the continent’s biggest soccer competition this year, from St. Petersburg to Paris. And the governing body of Formula 1, the international car racing organization, canceled the Russia Grand Prix, which was scheduled for September, citing “impossible” circumstances. The European Broadcasting Union said it had decided to block Russian performers after consulting with its membership, which includes broadcasters from 56 countries, including Ukraine and Russia. Just a day earlier, it had said Russia could compete. But Ukraine and public broadcasters in Finland, the Netherlands, and Iceland had called for Russia to be excluded, and Finland on Friday said it would not compete in the final if Russia participated. The contest features performers from 39 different countries singing and dancing to a diverse range of songs. Maneskin, a tattooed, four-person Italian rock band, won last year’s competition and Barbara Pravi, a French solo artist, came in second after singing a plaintive song of longing backed by a piano and cello. Russia, which finished ninth in last year’s competition, was originally given a spot in this year’s semifinal, which is scheduled for May in Turin, Italy. The contest organizers did not say how removing the Russian act would affect the structure of the competition.",29
2022-02-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/world/asia/china-russia-ukraine-sovereignty.html,‘Abrupt Changes’: China Caught in a Bind Over Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine,"As Russian troops have poured into Ukraine, officials in Beijing have fumed at any suggestion that they are betraying a core principle of Chinese foreign policy — that sovereignty is sacrosanct — in order to shield Moscow. They will not even call it an invasion. “Russia’s operation” is one preferred description. The “current situation” is another. And China’s leader, Xi Jinping, says his position on the crisis is perfectly coherent. “The abrupt changes in the eastern regions of Ukraine have been drawing the close attention of the international community,” Mr. Xi told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, in a call on Friday, according to an official Chinese summary. “China’s fundamental stance has been consistent in respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, and abiding by the mission and principles of the United Nations Charter,” Mr. Xi said. Outside the echo chamber of Chinese official media, however, there seems little doubt that Russia’s war has put its partner Beijing in a severe bind, including over where it stands on countries’ sovereign rights. China may have played a role Friday in inducing Russia to look more accommodating, even as Russian forces advanced into Kyiv. After Mr. Putin’s phone call with Mr. Xi, in which the Chinese leader called for talks, the Russian president signaled he was open to the idea, reversing his own foreign minister’s statement made just hours earlier. The Kremlin framed Mr. Putin’s position as a response to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who had said he was ready to discuss “neutral status” for Ukraine. Talks to resolve the crisis, however belated, would clearly be in China’s interest, easing what critics see as its double-standard on the sovereignty issue. On the one hand, China has long said that the United States and other Western powers routinely trample over other countries, most egregiously in recent times in the invasion of Iraq in 2003. China’s message has been that it is the true guardian of sovereign independence, especially for poorer countries. On the other hand, Mr. Putin has expected Mr. Xi to accept, if not support, the invasion. Mr. Xi’s government has played along so far, laying responsibility for Europe’s worst war in decades on hubris by the United States. China has also distanced itself from the condemnation of Russia at the United Nations. China’s “central attack on the United States as a global power since Xi Jinping has come to office has been to accuse it of continued violation of U.N. Charter principles on national sovereignty,” Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia who served as a diplomat in China, said in a telephone interview. “This torpedoes that argument midship.” The growing economic relationship between China and Russia also has given Mr. Xi some potential leverage in pushing for Mr. Putin to quickly resolve the Ukraine crisis. With severe sanctions now imposed on Russia by Western powers, Mr. Putin may need China more than ever as an investor and buyer of Russian oil, wheat and other products. Unless the Ukraine crisis is resolved, China will continue performing verbal contortions to try to balance its solidarity with Russia with its declared devotion to the sanctity of the nation-state, experts and former diplomats said. If the war expands and persists, the costs for China of hemming and hawing over a deadly crisis may grow. Beijing’s stance has already angered Western European leaders and hardened American frustration with China. Asian and African countries traditionally close to Beijing have condemned Russia’s actions. One of the main currencies of Chinese diplomacy — its declared dedication to sovereign rights for all countries — could be devalued. “The incoherence is damaging to China over the long term,” said Adam Ni, an analyst who publishes China Neican, a newsletter on Chinese current affairs. “It undermines China’s long-held foreign policy principles, and makes it harder to project itself as a responsible great power,” he said. Mr. Ni said it would also “be seen by the U.S. and E.U. member states as duplicity and complicity in Russian aggression, which will likely have costs for Beijing.” Chinese newspapers have uniformly held to the government’s position on the war, accusing the United States of provoking Russia by holding open the possibility that Ukraine could join NATO. “China believes that the chief cause of this war was the United States’ long-term failure to respect Russian security,” said Xuewu Gu, the director of the Center for Global Studies at the University of Bonn in Germany. “In that sense, China sees this war as one of self-defense by Russia, therefore naturally it would not describe it as an invasion.” In private, some Chinese academics have shared misgivings about Mr. Xi’s embrace of Mr. Putin. And on the Chinese internet, some users have robustly questioned how China’s position on the Ukraine war squares with its longstanding precept that countries should steer their own fates. “Ukraine is a sovereign, independent country, and if it wants to join NATO or the E.U., that’s its freedom and nobody else has the right to intervene,” said one comment on Friday on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media service. More than most countries, China has upheld the idea that national sovereignty trumps other concerns, including human rights standards. China’s modern concept of sovereignty — “zhuquan” in Chinese — developed from the 19th century when Western powers subjugated the Qing rulers. “There’s a great insistence on a full concept of sovereignty, and it’s typical of third world colonial or semi-colonial environments,” said Ryan Mitchell, a law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, on how such concepts evolved in China. “That remains true today.” Beijing’s muscular notion of how far its sovereignty reaches has become one of the main drivers — and trouble points — of Chinese policy. Beijing has maintained that Taiwan, the self-governed island that has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, must eventually be united with China, even if armed force is needed. Beijing has made expansive claims to islands and waters across the South China Sea. It has also been locked in clashes with India over disputed borderlands. In domestic policy, too, the Chinese government has made sovereignty a focus. When the authorities put dissidents on trial in secret, they brush off requests for access or information by citing “judicial sovereignty.” When Chinese internet censorship is criticized, officials cite China’s right to preserve its “cybersovereignty.” In meetings with Chinese diplomats, the word came up often, said Mr. Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia, who is now president of the Asia Society. “The whole notion of mutual noninterference and the respect for national sovereignty has been not just a cosmetic principle but an operational principle for the Chinese system internally,” he said. Chinese diplomats will be busy explaining how that comports with their position on Ukraine. That may be tricky, but they have some practice. When Russian forces seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, China tried to strike a balance. It abstained from a United Nations Security Council resolution urging states not to recognize Russia’s claim to the area, but it did not formally recognize Russia’s claim, either. Chinese leaders also tried to straddle positions after Russian forces seized territory in Georgia in 2008. This time, however, Mr. Xi has already leaned China much more toward Russia. He and Mr. Putin met at the start of the Beijing Winter Olympics in early February, and issued a joint statement declaring that their countries’ friendship “has no bounds.” “After that statement that ties Xi so closely to Putin, the U.S. and others are bound to punish China for enabling Russia’s aggression,” said Susan Shirk, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who now leads the 21st Century China Center at the University of California San Diego. “But it’s also harder for China to signal to the world that it doesn’t support Russia’s move,” she said. “Looks like Putin suckered Xi.” Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson contributed reporting.

2022-02-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/26/opinion/vladimir-putin-clash-of-civilizations.html,Opinion | Vladimir Putin’s Clash of Civilizations,"When the United States, in its hour of hubris, went to war to remake the Middle East in 2003, Vladimir Putin was a critic of American ambition, a defender of international institutions and multilateralism and national sovereignty. This posture was cynical and self-interested in the extreme. But it was also vindicated by events, as our failures in Iraq and then Afghanistan demonstrated the challenges of conquest, the perils of occupation, the laws of unintended consequences in war. And Putin’s Russia, which benefited immensely from our follies, proceeded with its own resurgence on a path of cunning gradualism, small-scale land grabs amid frozen conflicts, the expansion of influence in careful, manageable bites. But now it’s Putin making the world-historical gamble, embracing a more sinister version of the unconstrained vision that once led George W. Bush astray. And it’s worth asking why a leader who once seemed attuned to the perils of hubris would take this gamble now. I assume that Putin is being sincere when he rails against Russia’s encirclement by NATO and insists that Western influence threatens the historic link between Ukraine and Russia. And he clearly sees a window of opportunity in the pandemic’s chaos, America’s imperial overstretch and an internally divided West. Still, even the most successful scenario for his invasion of Ukraine — easy victory, no real insurgency, a pliant government installed — seems likely to undercut some of the interests he’s supposedly fighting to defend. NATO will still nearly encircle western Russia, more countries may join the alliance, European military spending will rise, more troops and material will end up in Eastern Europe. There will be a push for European energy independence, some attempt at long-term delinking from Russian pipelines and production. A reforged Russian empire will be poorer than it otherwise might be, more isolated from the global economy, facing a more united West. And again, all this assumes no grinding occupation, no percolating antiwar sentiment at home. It’s possible Putin just assumes the West is so decadent, so easily bought off, that the spasms of outrage will pass and business as usual resume without any enduring consequences. But let’s assume that he expects some of those consequences, expects a more isolated future. What might be his reasoning for choosing it? Here is one speculation: He may believe that the age of American-led globalization is ending no matter what, that after the pandemic certain walls will stay up everywhere, and that the goal for the next 50 years is to consolidate what you can — resources, talent, people, territory — inside your own civilizational walls. In this vision the future is neither liberal world-empire nor a renewed Cold War between competing universalisms. Rather it’s a world divided into some version of what Bruno Maçães has called “civilization-states,” culturally cohesive great powers that aspire, not to world domination, but to become universes unto themselves — each, perhaps, under its own nuclear umbrella. This idea, redolent of Samuel P. Huntington’s arguments in “The Clash of Civilizations” a generation ago, clearly influences many of the world’s rising powers — from the Hindutva ideology of India’s Narendra Modi to the turn against cultural exchange and Western influence in Xi Jinping’s China. Maçães himself hopes a version of civilizationism will reanimate Europe, perhaps with Putin’s adventurism as a catalyst for stronger continental cohesion. And even within the United States you can see the resurgence of economic nationalism and the wars over national identity as a turn toward these kinds of civilizational concerns. In this light, the invasion of Ukraine looks like civilizationism run amok, a bid to forge by force what the Russian nationalist writer Anatoly Karlin dubs “Russian world” — meaning “a largely self-contained technological civilization, complete with its own IT ecosystem … space program, and technological visions … stretching from Brest to Vladivostok.” The goal is not world revolution or world conquest, in other words, but civilizational self-containment — a unification of “our own history, culture and spiritual space,” as Putin put it in his war speech — with certain erring, straying children dragged unwillingly back home. But if your civilization-state can’t attract its separated children with persuasion, can they really be kept inside with force? Even if the invasion succeeds, won’t much of Ukraine’s human capital — the young and talented and ambitious — find ways to flee or emigrate, leaving Putin to inherit a poor, wrecked country filled with pensioners? And to the extent that the nationalist vision of Russian self-sufficiency is fundamentally fanciful, might not Putin’s supposedly-greater-Russia end up instead as a Chinese client or vassal, pulled by Beijing’s stronger gravity into a more subordinate relationship the more its ties to Europe break? These are the long-term challenges even for a Putinism that accepts autarky and isolation as the price of pan-Russian consolidation. But for today, and for as many days as Ukrainians still fight, the hope should be that he never gets a chance to deal with long-term problems — that the history that he imagines himself making is made instead in his defeat.

2022-02-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/26/world/europe/putin-ukraine-advisers.html,"Putin Seems to Sideline Advisers on Ukraine, Taking a Political Risk","To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. Does President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have the support he needs at home to wage a costly war in Ukraine? That may seem like an odd question. After all, Mr. Putin has already invaded Ukraine, suggesting he feels confident in his resources. And his public image is that of a strongman, with the power to direct the Russian state as he pleases. But no leader can govern alone. And a series of events this week, including Russia’s decision to throttle access to Facebook and censor news about the war in Ukraine, raise questions about just how much political support Mr. Putin will be able to draw on during the conflict. An early sign that something might be amiss came on Monday in a televised meeting of Russia’s Security Council. Mr. Putin seemed to expect all of the assembled officials to unquestioningly advise him to recognize the independence of Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine — a public show of elite support for war, just days before it began in earnest. But Sergei Naryshkin flubbed his line. Mr. Naryshkin, the director of foreign intelligence, stuttered uncomfortably when Mr. Putin asked him about recognizing the separatists’ claims. Then he seemed to overcorrect, saying he thought Russia should recognize the breakaway republics as “part of Russia.” Mr. Putin snapped impatiently that Mr. Naryshkin should “speak clearly,” then said dismissively that annexation “was not under discussion.” The moment seemed so significant because all authoritarian leaders rule by coalition, even if, like Mr. Putin, they often appear to be wielding power on their own. The specifics of the power-sharing coalitions vary by country, with some leaders backed by the military, and others by wealthy business leaders or other elites. But Mr. Putin’s coalition is primarily made up of the “siloviki,” a group of officials who came to politics after serving in the KGB or other security services, and who now occupy key roles in Russia’s intelligence services, military and other ministries. “That’s the system that brought him to power, and that’s the system that he has relied on in order to consolidate his power,” said Maria Popova, a political scientist at McGill University in Canada who studies Russian and Ukrainian politics. For decades, Mr. Putin has proved himself to be highly skilled at maintaining his relationships with elites. And the structure of Mr. Putin’s ruling coalition is an advantage for him, said Erica de Bruin, a political scientist at Hamilton College and the author of a recent book on coups. “Where political power is more centralized in an individual ruler — as is the case in Russia under Putin — it can be somewhat harder for elites to hold that leader accountable,” she said. But elites still matter. And the Putin advisers’ apparent confusion during Monday’s meeting, including the exchange with Mr. Naryshkin, gave the impression that the Russian president had kept this crucial group out of the loop on his plans. “He seemed to be humiliating some of these people,” Dr. Popova said — particularly in the way he spoke to Mr. Naryshkin, a prominent silovik who served in the KGB at the same time as Mr. Putin. Their interaction could have been a fluke brought on by the stress of the moment, of course. And it is notable that all of Mr. Putin’s advisers, including Mr. Naryshkin, ultimately offered their public support on Monday for the president’s decision to recognize the separatist regions. But even the seating arrangements of Mr. Putin’s recent meetings, in which he has placed himself at a literal distance from his advisers, convey an image that he is separated from everyone, including his elite coalition. It could be because he wanted to avoid catching the coronavirus, reportedly a significant fear for the Russian leader. But some observers, Dr. Popova said, believe Mr. Putin intended to convey the impression that he is the king, and his advisers mere courtiers — a message they might not appreciate. And then there is the matter of the Russian public. Although public opinion in Russia is not as directly powerful as it would be in a democracy, Mr. Putin’s high levels of public support have long been a source of political strength and leverage for him. No other politician or member of his inner circle has a public reputation even close to his. But public anger over the war could undermine that advantage, and even become a political liability. The war will strain the Russian economy. And it has already been a blow to Mr. Putin’s public image as a careful and pragmatic steward of Russian interests. There was low public support for war in Ukraine even before casualties began to mount. A long-running academic survey found in December that only 8 percent of Russians supported a military conflict against Ukraine, and only 9 percent thought that Russia should arm Ukrainian separatists. That is a very large enthusiasm gap for Mr. Putin to overcome. Mr. Putin’s actions this week suggest he is concerned about the consequences of public anger. On Thursday and Friday, the police arrested hundreds of people who turned out to protest the war in cities across Russia. On Saturday, the government limited access to Facebook and other media sites for the apparent offense of posting stories “in which the operation that is being carried out is called an attack, an invasion or a declaration of war.” Which brings us to the stakes for Mr. Putin in maintaining his relationship with his inner circle: “Because of the resources and access that they have, elites pose the biggest threat to authoritarian leaders,” said Dr. de Bruin. “Retaining the support of elites is thus crucial to remaining in power.” And wars often pose a particular threat to leaders’ relationships with elites. “The relationship between authoritarian rulers and their core of elite supporters can be strained when dictators wage war abroad — particularly where elites view the conflict as misguided,” Dr. de Bruin said. Public anger over war can also increase elites’ perception that a leader is no longer an effective protector of their interests. And if the United States and Europe manage to impose effective sanctions on members of Mr. Putin’s elite coalition, that could make the war costly for them as individuals, as well as risky for Russia. (Some members of that inner circle, including Mr. Naryshkin, had already been on the U.S. Treasury blacklist for years, so it is unclear what incremental effect new restrictions might have on their finances.) That is not to say that Mr. Putin’s allies will turn on him because he was rude to one of them on television, of course, or that public anger would immediately undermine his presidency. But there is still reason to pay attention to signs of strain within Mr. Putin’s coalition. Elite dissatisfaction could affect his responsiveness to targeted sanctions, for instance, or the constraints he might face on resources for the conflict in Ukraine. It also could affect whether he has the political capital to stay the course if domestic opposition grows. And perhaps, if things go very badly, it could mean even more significant consequences for Mr. Putin’s presidency. “Two-thirds of authoritarian leaders are removed by their own allies,” Dr. Popova said. “If he tightens the screws too much, if he tries to really increase his power at the expense of the ruling authoritarian coalition, then he is threatening his own position.” Audio produced by Adrienne Hurst.",4
2022-02-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/world/europe/united-nations-russia-withdraw-ukraine.html,Russia Vetoes UN Security Council Resolution Calling on it to Withdraw from Ukraine,"Russia on Friday vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution of which it was the target, effectively blocking action by the panel, which is responsible for protecting and maintaining international peace. The resolution, written and presented by the United States and dozens of its allies, strongly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called on Moscow to withdraw its troops immediately and provide safe access for humanitarian relief work. Eleven member countries voted in favor of the resolution. China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained. Russia, which has veto power as one of five permanent members of the council, voted against it. “Russia, you can veto this resolution, but you cannot veto our voices,” said the U.S. ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield. “You cannot veto the truth. You cannot veto our principles. You cannot veto the Ukrainian people. You cannot veto the U.N. Charter. And you will not veto accountability.” The United States had known all along that Russia would veto the resolution. But U.S. officials hoped that by doing so, Russia would demonstrate its isolation and its disregard for the U.N. charter. Russia appeared unfazed. Its ambassador thanked the three countries that had abstained from the vote. He dismissed as a Western conspiracy the diplomatic efforts to hold it accountable. He denied that Russia had targeted civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and then delivered a jab at the United States for its own military incursions, inferring to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 on the premise that Saddam Hussein was harboring chemical weapons, which turned out to be not true. “It is difficult for us to compete with the U.S. in terms of invasions,” said the Russian ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya. “You are in no position to moralize.” Diplomats said that the U.N. General Assembly would act next week on a resolution condemning Russia’s war on Ukraine. Countries do not have veto power at the General Assembly, but its resolutions are symbolic and not legally binding, as the Security Council’s are. The abstention by China was not a surprise. China has taken a both-sides approach to the conflict, calling for defusing of tensions and respect for sovereignty but stopping short of condemning Russia. “Against the backdrop of five successive rounds of NATO expansion, Russia’s legitimate security aspiration should be given attention and addressed properly,” said China’s ambassador, Zhang Jun. “Ukraine should be a bridge between East and West, not an outpost for confrontation between major powers.” But the abstentions by India and the United Arab Emirates, a U.S. ally in the Middle East, came as a surprise. Both countries said they had not voted in favor of the resolution because it might have closed the door for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict. Brazil voted in favor of the resolution and condemned Russia’s aggression. Its ambassador said the country had sought during last-minute negotiations to make changes to the text of the resolution to “balance” the language and leave space for diplomacy. The council meeting ended with Ukraine’s ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, asking for a moment of silence to pray for peace and to honor those who had died or who might die. “I invite the Russian ambassador to pray for salvation,” Mr. Kyslytsya said. A minute of silence followed and then loud applause. Diplomats spoke to the news media after the meeting had ended. The European Union representative, Olof Skoog, said Russia’s veto was “another proof of Russia’s isolation and blatant disrespect for the world.”",22
2022-02-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/opinion/ukraine-putin-steve-bannon.html,Opinion | How the American Right Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Russia,"Last week, before Russian threats toward Ukrainian borders turned into an all-out invasion, one part of the American media landscape questioned why we weren’t supporting the invaders. “Hating [Russia’s president, Vladimir] Putin, has become the central purpose of America’s foreign policy. It’s the main thing that we talk about,” the Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson said on Tuesday. “It might be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious: What is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?” Interviewed on “The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show” on Tuesday, former President Donald Trump described Mr. Putin as “smart” and “savvy.” Then on Wednesday night, as reports of Russian explosions across Ukraine rolled in, Mr. Trump repeated his admiration for the Russian leader. J.D. Vance, a Republican candidate for Senate in Ohio, said during a Feb. 19 podcast interview with Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former White House chief strategist, “We did not serve in the Marine Corps to go and fight Vladimir Putin because he didn’t believe in transgender rights, which is what the U.S. State Department is saying is a major problem with Russia.” Mr. Bannon, for his part, hailed Mr. Putin as “anti-woke” hours before Russia’s assault on Ukraine. The American political right was long associated with Cold War hawkishness. But in recent years the trend has shifted toward fawning praise for autocrats, even those leading America’s traditional adversaries, as well as projecting our own culture wars overseas. Where once Russia and other autocracies were seen as anti-democratic, they have now become symbols of U.S. conservatism — a mirror for the right-wing worldview. Supporting Mr. Putin, as well as other authoritarian leaders, is yet another way in which the political right is weaponizing culture wars to further divide Americans. Part of this new paradigm is that foreign policy is now a partisan matter. In 2016, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary offered an endorsement of then-candidate Donald Trump, admiration that was later returned. Mr. Putin’s Russia reportedly meddled in the American election in 2016, and the Russian president has admitted that he wanted Mr. Trump to win. Those amicable relationships trickled down to the Republican voting population, which shifted its views on Mr. Putin’s favorability, which soared from a mere 10 percent in July 2014 to 37 percent in December 2016. A Yahoo News/YouGov poll from January of this year found that 62 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents consider Vladimir Putin a stronger leader than Joe Biden. “Strong” may be the key word here. In this construction, a strong leader is apparently one who cracks down on opposition, cultural and political, and does not concede. This idea then dovetails with right-wing ideas that liberal elites are actively corroding deeply held traditional values — including traditional gender roles. For those who spend a fair amount of airtime worrying about the emasculation of men, the kind of strength portrayed by Mr. Putin — who on Monday convened his top security officials and demanded they publicly stand and support him — is perhaps appealing. Many of the admirers of the world’s strongmen on the American right appear to believe that the countries each of these men lead are beacons of whiteness, Christianity and conservative values. On Wednesday, conservative commentator Rod Dreher wrote, “I adamantly oppose risking the lives of boys from Louisiana and Alabama to make the Donbas safe for genderqueers and migrants.” These comments, from the right, aren’t exactly advancing a new position. In 2018, the political commentator Pat Buchanan said that Mr. Putin and the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko were “standing up for traditional values against Western cultural elites.” He considered the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs to have told a “moral truth” in asserting that same-sex relationships were “fake.” But those traditional values do not include the freedom to political opposition. According to Viasna Human Rights Center, an organization dedicated to keeping track of Belarusian abuses, there are over 1,000 political prisoners in Belarus, many of whom were arrested for peaceful assembly, protesting or daring to engage in political activities. Russia is neither all white nor all Christian — it is a country that encompasses several regions, religions and ethnicities. Still, it is often perceived as white. The white nationalist Richard Spencer has referred to Russia as “the sole white power in the world.” Matthew Heimbach, a founder of the Traditionalist Worker Party who was involved in the 2017 Unite the Right rally, has expressed admiration for Mr. Putin and ultranationalist European political leaders. “Russia is our biggest inspiration,” Mr. Heimbach told The Times in 2016. “I see President Putin as the leader of the free world.” As The Times reported at the time, this construction of Mr. Putin as a beacon of far-right values began with the ultra-far-right nationalists in Europe and later spread to the United States. But, as the Washington Post opinion writer Christian Caryl wrote in 2018, just as the halcyon image American Communists had of Stalinist Russia in the early 20th century belied the truth of a brutal regime, the Russia celebrated today by conservatives is also, in some ways, a fiction. In any event, Mr. Putin is not waging a culture war. He is waging real, actual war, in which real, actual lives are already being lost. But then, why would that matter? The Russia, Ukraine, Hungary and Belarus of conservative pundits’ imaginations are just that: imaginings. Avatars. Projections of themselves. The Russians and Ukrainians who are living — and dying — do not factor into the picture.

2022-02-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/opinion/putin-russia-ukraine-europe.html,Opinion | We Are All Living in Vladimir Putin’s World Now,"Journalists writing on international affairs in the 1920s and 1930s referred to the era as postwar. They saw events through the prism of the Great War that devastated Europe just a few years earlier. Historians writing today refer to the same years as the interwar period, for the simple reason that they analyze what happened during those years as part of the lead-up to the even more destructive World War II. If only those journalists writing in 1930s Europe had the clarity of hindsight. We should all have that clarity today. Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine is one of those moments that impels us to reinterpret our own era. What we called the 30-year peace that followed the Cold War (tending to forget, consciously or unconsciously, the wars in the former Yugoslavia) has now ended. Future historians will look at these last decades, by and large, much as they look at the interwar period: as an opportunity squandered. The sooner we all admit it, the better we can prepare for what comes next. Unfortunately, a kind of self-serving denialism pervades Western capitals and prevents us from seeing the obvious. Passionate pleas to defend the post-Cold War European order have no meaning because this era is over. In the wake of Russia’s occupation of Crimea in 2014, Angela Merkel, then the chancellor of Germany, talked to President Vladimir Putin of Russia and reported to President Barack Obama that, in her view, Mr. Putin had lost touch with reality. He was, she said, living in “another world.” Today we are all living in it. In this world, to quote Thucydides, “the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.” How did we get here? First, we must understand that this is not Russia’s war. It is Mr. Putin’s. He comes from a particular generation of Russian security officials who never managed to reconcile themselves with Moscow’s Cold War defeat. In front of their eyes, the Soviet Union vanished from the map without military loss or foreign invasion. For them, the current assault on Ukraine is a logical and necessary inflection point. The imperial table can once again be reset. These people are not interested in writing the future; they want to rewrite the past. While watching Russian missiles attacking Kyiv, in a mood of powerless outrage, I suddenly realized that many Russians must have felt the same way when NATO was bombing Belgrade two decades ago. Mr. Putin’s invasion may be more about revenge than grand strategy. There’s a distinction between revisionism and revanchism. Revisionists wish to build an international order of their liking. Revanchists are driven by the idea of payback. They dream not of changing the world but of changing places with the victors of the last war. If Mr. Putin is succeeding today, the West can blame only itself. While Western public opinion was hypnotizing itself with the idea that Russia is in steep decline — a gas station with nukes, some liked to call it — the Russian president began to realize his strategy. For years, Mr. Putin has been consolidating his sphere of influence over the former Soviet Union, starting with his war on Georgia in 2008 and through his annexation of Crimea in 2014. More recently, he has tightened his grip on Belarus and Central Asia. Now he has undertaken the next, dramatic step. President Biden said on Thursday that in response to the invasion of Ukraine, he intends to make Mr. Putin “a pariah on the international stage.” That would be a fitting punishment for this violation of international law, but things may not work out that way. There is a real danger that instead it’s the West that could find itself more isolated. Over the past two months, the Moscow-Beijing alliance has moved from hypothesis to reality, thanks to the shared goal of challenging American dominance. While Chinese elites are hardly excited about Russia’s reckless invasion of Ukraine (the Chinese hold dear their commitment to nonviolation of state sovereignty), there is no doubt they will stay on Moscow’s side. Look at how Beijing refused to officially describe Mr. Putin’s war as an invasion. President Xi Jinping may be the biggest beneficiary of the current crisis: America not only looks weak; it also now finds itself bogged down in Europe and unable to focus on Asia. Many countries see the conflict between Russia and the West as one between old imperialists that hardly affects them. Of greater and more immediate concern is the way that sanctions imposed by the West will drive up energy and food prices. The West can win over skeptics of its efforts to combat Mr. Putin only if it succeeds in showing those outside Europe that what is at stake in Kyiv is not the fate of a pro-Western regime but the sovereignty of a newly born postimperial state. Some already understand that idea: Kenya’s ambassador to the United Nations captured what is happening in Ukraine when he said, “The situation echoes our history. Kenya and almost every African country was birthed by the ending of the empire.” What does the end of peace mean to Europe? The consequences will be dire. War in Ukraine has the frightening potential to heat up frozen conflicts on the continent’s periphery, including elsewhere in the post-Soviet space and the western Balkans. The leaders of the Republika Srpska may read a victory by Mr. Putin in Ukraine as a signal to dismantle Bosnia. Russia-friendly leaders in the European Union, too, will feel emboldened by Mr. Putin’s victory. The invasion of Ukraine has united Europe, but it will also hurt its self-confidence. But more fundamentally, the events of the past week will necessitate a radical rethinking of the European project. For the past 30 years, Europeans have convinced themselves that military strength was not worth the cost and that American military pre-eminence was enough to dissuade other countries from pursuing war. Spending on defense fell. What mattered, the received wisdom intoned, was economic power and soft power. Now we know that sanctions can’t stop tanks. Europe’s cherished conviction that economic interdependence is the best guarantee for peace has turned out to be wrong. Europeans made a mistake by universalizing their post-World War II experience to countries like Russia. Capitalism is not enough to temper authoritarianism. Trade with dictators does not make your country more secure, and keeping the money of corrupt leaders in your banks does not civilize them; it corrupts you. And Europe’s embrace of Russian hydrocarbons only made the continent more insecure and vulnerable. The most destabilizing effect of Russia’s invasion could be that many around the world start to agree with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. At the Munich Security Forum this month, he stated that Kyiv had made a mistake abandoning the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union. The United States’ unwillingness to defend a friendly country like Ukraine can make at least some American allies believe that nuclear weapons are the only way to guarantee their sovereignty. It’s not hard to imagine China’s neighbors also thinking this way. The fact that a majority of South Koreans now favor their country obtaining nuclear weapons suggests that Mr. Putin’s moves in Ukraine put at risk the world’s nuclear nonproliferation regime. In 1993 the great German poet and essayist Hans Magnus Enzensberger predicted that the Cold War would be followed by an age of chaos, violence and conflict. Reflecting on what he observed in Yugoslavia and the urban riots in the United States, he saw a world defined by an “inability to distinguish between destruction and self-destruction.” In this world, “there is no longer any need to legitimize your actions. Violence has freed itself from ideology.” Mr. Enzensberger was right. He was just too early. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-02-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/world/asia/putin-xi-jinping-russia-china.html,Ties That Bind Putin and Xi Tested by Russia's Ukraine Invasion,"They visited a hockey rink in Beijing and the panda enclosure at the Moscow Zoo. They shared blinis layered with caviar in Russia and, reciprocally, the popular variant in China, jianbing. They have shared birthday cakes and exchanged toasts with shots of vodka, while demurring that neither would dare go overboard with the stuff. For more than a decade, Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have forged a respectful, perhaps even warm relationship, reflecting the deepening ties between two world powers that share common cause against American military and economic might. The invasion of Ukraine could upend all that — or forge, in diplomatic isolation, an alliance that reshapes the world order in the 21st century. Three days into the conflict, it seemed clear on Sunday that Mr. Putin’s expectation of a quick subjugation of Ukraine was foundering. Ukrainian resistance slowed or stalled Russia’s forces, while Western nations sharply escalated economic pressure on Russia, which was looking almost totally isolated. Mr. Putin’s attack on Ukraine has forced Mr. Xi into what Kevin Rudd, the Australian ex-prime minister who was once a diplomat in Beijing, called an “impossible balancing act” between his personal camaraderie with the Russian leader and the potential for blowback for China, should it be seen as endorsing an invasion condemned by most of the world. On Friday, Mr. Xi spoke by telephone with the man he called his “best friend” in 2019, but stopped far short of endorsing the assault on Ukraine. He said all countries should “abandon a Cold War mentality,” and he expressed support when Mr. Putin told him he would seek a negotiated resolution to the war, according to the Chinese government’s summary of the call. But there is no sign that Mr. Xi did anything to ward off the invasion, if he knew it was coming. His senior advisers rebuffed American requests to use China’s influence with Mr. Putin to discourage an attack; instead, China shared the Americans’ intelligence with the Russians and accused the United States of trying to sow discord, according to American officials. For China, the costs of Mr. Putin’s adventurism could be high. “I don’t think this is good for anybody,” said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, a research organization in Beijing that advises the government. “Conflict is not a solution, and China doesn’t want to see things deteriorate.” China has deep ties with Europe and the United States that it cannot afford to sever, despite growing tensions in those relationships. The Ukraine invasion has rattled Chinese stock markets and threatens to roil the global economy during an important political year for Beijing that is expected to end with an extension of Mr. Xi’s rule. The international furor over Ukraine — and the diplomatic isolation Mr. Putin is expected to face — could also serve as a warning of what Mr. Xi can expect if he uses force to subdue Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that China claims as its territory. Mr. Putin, for his part, appears to be banking on China’s support over Ukraine — explicit or not — in the face of punitive measures that the United States and others have already begun to impose. China has already lifted some restrictions on Russian wheat imports, but it has yet to indicate whether it will abide by American and European sanctions meant to restrict Russia’s access to capital. “It’s really going to be an acid test,” said John Culver, a retired Central Intelligence Agency officer who studied China. “It’s going to demonstrate whether China would really support Russia and provide economic support in violation of sanctions, or even face sanctions itself.” Only three weeks ago, on the eve of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi met for the 38th time since Mr. Xi became China’s leader, declaring that the friendship between their countries had “no limits.” Outside their inner circles, it is not known whether Mr. Putin disclosed his plans for Ukraine to Mr. Xi then. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, suggested that he had not. Now, Mr. Putin has forced China into the awkward position of explaining how the invasion does not violate the principle of respect for national sovereignty that is, officially, a pillar of China’s foreign policy. “They must feel like they’ve been played,” Mr. Culver said of the Chinese leaders. China’s uncertainty over the issue has been clear in the statements of officials like Ms. Hua, who declined to call the invasion an invasion and sought to shift the blame for it to the United States. China may consider Taiwan an unconquered province, but it has explicitly recognized Ukraine as a sovereign nation, one with which it has close economic ties. However the war ends, it has already underscored how important — and complex — the relationship between Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin has become. It has been shaped by striking biographical parallels, but also by differences that could test their “no limits” pledge. Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi were born only eight months apart — Oct. 7, 1952, and June 15, 1953, respectively — and both were children of Communist powers that rose out of the catastrophic convulsions of war and revolution. They idolized their fathers, veterans of those conflicts, and were inculcated in the Marxist-Leninist view of world affairs. Mr. Xi’s father oversaw China’s cadre of Soviet experts and visited the Soviet Union in 1959, bringing back gifts for his son that were later destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, according to Joseph Torigian, an assistant professor at American University and author of a forthcoming biography of Mr. Xi’s father, Xi Zhongxun. Mr. Xi has recalled in interviews that he grew up reading Russian literature and was inspired by a minor character in “What Is to Be Done?” the 1863 novel by Nikolai Chernyshevsky, who sleeps on a bed of nails. “They have very similar views of the role of history in politics and how attacks on their own history are seen as treacherous and dangerous,” Mr. Torigian said of the two leaders. Both ended up in government service, Mr. Putin as an intelligence officer in the K.G.B. and Mr. Xi as a regional party functionary after the political rehabilitation of his father, who had been imprisoned during the Mao era, accused of spying for the Soviets. Sergey Alexsashenko, who was a deputy chairman of the Russian central bank during Mr. Putin’s rise in the 1990s, said there was a key difference between the two leaders’ biographies. Mr. Putin, he noted, served in the intelligence service when the Soviet Union was entering its inexorable decline in the 1970s and 1980s, while Mr. Xi joined the government ranks as China’s transformation from impoverished nation to global economic powerhouse began. “For Xi, the history of China while he’s a mature man is a history of success,” Mr. Alexsashenko said. “He wants to move ahead with this rebuilding for the future. For Putin, all good was in the past.” The experience that most closely binds them is the global political turmoil of 1989, beginning with the protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing that China crushed, followed by the demonstrations that toppled the Soviet Union’s satellite states in Europe. Mr. Xi, then an official in Fujian Province, warned in a party newspaper that democracy without restriction meant “no constraints or sense of responsibility.” Mr. Putin was by then a lieutenant colonel at the K.G.B.’s Dresden outpost, watching helplessly as protesters ransacked the local headquarters of the Stasi, East Germany’s secret police. He was forced to retreat to the Soviet Union, which collapsed two years later, creating new borders that he is now essentially trying to erase. Both leaders have spoken often about the lessons of that period, reinforcing what they see as the need for a strong state hand to control popular sentiment. In a speech in 2013, Mr. Xi denigrated the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for letting the Soviet Union fall on his watch, something Mr. Putin has called the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.” “In the end,” Mr. Xi said, “nobody was a real man.” Mr. Putin’s pivot toward China began under Mr. Xi’s predecessors. He settled in 2005 a border dispute that had flared into a short war between the Soviet Union and China decades earlier, and he eased visa restrictions that allowed for a trade boom across their border. When Mr. Xi came to power a decade ago, the entente between the countries accelerated into a deepening relationship that has overcome decades of division and suspicion. Trade has skyrocketed, reaching $146 billion last year. The two militaries train together and conduct joint air and naval patrols along China’s coast. “Even though the bilateral relationship is not an alliance, in its closeness and effectiveness this relationship even exceeds that of an alliance,” Mr. Xi told his counterpart during virtual talks in December, according to Mr. Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri V. Ushakov. That relationship seemed to reach a new peak at the Olympics. After their meeting, the leaders issued a lengthy joint statement that raised alarms in Washington. It was the first time China had explicitly endorsed Russia’s demand for a halt to NATO expansion, though it had criticized previous NATO applications by individual countries, including Montenegro and North Macedonia. The two leaders also vowed to resist American-led efforts to promote pluralistic democracy and said they would fight foreign influence under the guise of what both call “color revolutions,” after the popular uprisings in former Soviet republics like Ukraine and Georgia. Even so, Mr. Xi now appears uncomfortable with how Mr. Putin has chosen to bring Ukraine to heel. “I think the Chinese are going to have balance how much they want to invest in Putin,” Mr. Culver, the former intelligence officer, said, “and how much it’s going to cost them strategically.” Anton Troianovski, Chris Buckley and Claire Fu contributed reporting or research.",22
2022-02-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/world/middleeast/israel-ukraine-russia.html,War in Ukraine Forces Israel Into a Delicate Balancing Act,"TEL AVIV — On the day Russia invaded Ukraine, Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, did not mention Russia once. Mr. Bennett said he prayed for peace, called for dialogue and promised support for Ukrainian citizens. But he did not hint at Moscow’s involvement, much less condemn it — and it was left, as preplanned, to Mr. Bennett’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, to criticize Moscow in a separate statement that day. The pair’s cautious double act embodied the bind in which the war in Ukraine has placed Israel. Israel is a key partner of the United States, and many Israelis appreciate longstanding cultural connections with Ukraine, which, for several months in 2019, was the only country other than their own with both a Jewish president — Volodymyr Zelensky — and a Jewish prime minister. But Russia is a critical actor in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, Israel’s northeastern neighbor and enemy, and the Israeli government believes it cannot risk losing Moscow’s favor. For much of the past decade, the Israeli Air Force has struck Iranian, Syrian and Lebanese military targets in Syria without interference, trying to stem the flow of arms that Iran sends to its proxies in both Syria and Lebanon and to limit a military buildup on its northern border. Israel also wants to leave itself enough room to act as a go-between in the conflict. After Ukrainian requests, Mr. Bennett has offered at least twice to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, most recently on Sunday — when Mr. Bennett rushed abruptly from a cabinet meeting to speak with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for 40 minutes. And Israeli officials, including Mr. Bennett, shuttled between their Russian, Ukrainian and American counterparts on Sunday afternoon, two senior Israeli officials said, a mediation that may have contributed to Ukraine’s decision to meet with Russian officials on the Belarusian-Ukrainian border. Israel, which often asks that its allies support it unconditionally, finds itself in the uncomfortable position of appearing to refuse to publicly criticize Russia, even when other countries with seemingly more at stake have condemned Mr. Putin’s war. It is a “delicate situation for Israel,” said Ehud Olmert, a former Israeli prime minister who dealt often with Mr. Putin during his time in office. “On the one hand, Israel is an ally of the United States and a part of the West, and there can be no doubt about it,” Mr. Olmert said in a phone interview. “On the other hand, the Russians are present in Syria, we have delicate military and security problems in Syria — and that requires a certain freedom for the Israeli military to act in Syria.” Israel also wants to avoid taking any action that might stir antisemitism against the hundreds of thousands of Jews in both Ukraine and Russia. And Israeli officials must simultaneously consider the responses of Israel’s large Russian-speaking population, who form about 12 percent of its electorate. Roughly 1.2 million Russian speakers have arrived in Israel from the former Soviet Union over the past three decades, about a third of them from Russia and about the same from Ukraine, according to government data. Some of the latter are even back in Ukraine to defend their original homeland. “Yes, I love Israel, but I have two countries and I need to defend both of them,” said Mykhailo, 25, an Israeli-Ukrainian digital marketer currently fighting in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, who asked to be identified only by his first name for security reasons. “Here is a war,” he said in a phone interview on Sunday afternoon. “I need to do my job.” Israel’s primary concern is to maintain its ability to act in Syria with near impunity and without Russian interference. But Russia also maintains a significant presence in Syria, and Israel needs Moscow’s good will to continue to operate there with ease. Israeli officials currently notify Russian counterparts about impending strikes, and vice versa, using a special encrypted communication line between the Israeli Air Force’s subterranean bunker, situated under a military base in Tel Aviv, and the Khmeimim air base in western Syria, a senior Israeli defense official said. Any change to that relationship might complicate both the Israeli and Russian strategies in Syria. In September 2018, Syrian anti-aircraft missiles firing at Israeli planes hit a Russian aircraft that was passing through the area by coincidence. It crashed and all 15 Russian soldiers on board were killed. Russian planes have been more active around Syria’s borders in recent weeks, both on the western border with Israel and in eastern Syria where American planes frequently operate, the senior Israeli defense official said. The uptick may have been a show of force intended to send a signal about the growing Ukraine crisis, the official added. Conscious of the need to placate Russia, Israel has rejected several requests in recent months to send military and intelligence equipment to Ukraine, three Israeli officials and a Ukrainian official said. The most recent request was rejected by Mr. Bennett during the call on Friday, the Ukrainian official said. Even after approving the sale of Pegasus, an Israeli-made spyware program, to dozens of other countries, Israel refused to sell it to Ukraine — rejecting a request last August from a Ukrainian delegation that visited Israel to discuss spyware purchases, according to an Israeli official and two people familiar with the matter. And Ukraine never formally asked Israel to use its fabled air defense system, known as Iron Dome, precisely because it knew that Israel would never agree to supply it, the Ukrainian official said. Israel has instead allowed private Israeli firms to sell Ukrainian military communication equipment and robotics, and on Sunday it announced a 100-ton delivery of humanitarian and medical supplies to Ukrainian civilians. Within Israel, the war in Ukraine has divided Russian speakers along political lines, though not necessarily along national ones. Eduard Shtrasner, a teacher and businessman who moved to Israel in 1990 from an area that at the time was part of Moldova, has become estranged from some friends of Moldovan origin for expressing a less critical attitude of Mr. Putin. “I am not at all in favor of war,” said Mr. Shtrasner, 48. “But I can justify what Putin is doing. I read, I listen, I gather information and, if I were him, I would do the same thing.” He acknowledged, though, that in Israel, his position was “not popular at all.” The invasion has been a unifying moment for Russian speakers, with those who once supported Mr. Putin now increasingly turning on him, community activists said. On Thursday, as Russia began its invasion, the Russian-born owners of the Putin Pub, a bar popular with Russian-speaking Israelis in Jerusalem, removed the golden “P-U-T-I-N” letters from its facade and announced that they were seeking a new name for their bar. “It was our initiative,” said Yulia Kaplan, one of the bar’s three owners, who moved to Israel from St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1991. “Because we are against war.” In 2014, during the Russian invasion of Crimea, there was a much stormier debate on social media among opposing camps of Russian-speaking Israelis, said Ksenia Svetlova, a journalist, academic and former member of the Israeli Parliament who moved to Israel from Moscow in 1991. “But then there wasn’t the violence and bloodshed that there is now,” Ms. Svetlova said. Even among older Russian speakers here who tend to rely on the Russian news media and have admired strong leadership in the past, there seems to be little sympathy for Mr. Putin this time around. “There is a sense of shock — people of my parents’ age are saying it’s shameful,” said Pola Barkan, a community activist who moved to Israel as an infant in the early 1990s with her family from Ukraine. “They say their grandparents fought shoulder to shoulder against the Nazis, and the grandsons are now fighting each other.” Russian speakers in Israel are also bracing for a new wave of Jewish immigration from Ukraine; anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent can apply for Israeli citizenship. The Jewish Agency, a worldwide Jewish organization that operates in coordination with the Israeli government and assists Jews interested in immigrating to Israel, said it was opening six processing stations for potential immigrants at Ukrainian border crossings with Poland, Moldova, Romania and Hungary. Israel’s Ministry of Immigration and Absorption has been planning for a new wave of immigration and making contingency plans, including for temporary housing. “I feel like we are back in the ’90s,” said Alex Rif, a Ukrainian-born poet and activist. “All those questions, like how many will come.” Patrick Kingsley and Ronen Bergman reported from Tel Aviv, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.

2022-02-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/world/europe/russia-ukraine-global-reaction.html,Invasion Brings Russia Global Repudiation With Cold War Echoes,"LONDON — In Switzerland, the Lucerne music festival canceled two symphony concerts featuring a Russian maestro. In Australia, the national swim team said it would boycott a world championship meet in Russia. At the Magic Mountain Ski Area in Vermont, a bartender poured bottles of Stolichnaya vodka down the drain. From culture to commerce, sports to travel, the world is shunning Russia in myriad ways to protest President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Not since the frigid days of the Cold War have so many doors closed on Russia and its people — a worldwide repudiation driven as much by the impulse to show solidarity with besieged Ukrainians as by any hope that it will force Mr. Putin to pull back his troops. The boycotts and cancellations are piling up in parallel with the sanctions imposed by the United States, Europe, and other powers. Although these grass-roots gestures inflict less harm on Russia’s economy than sweeping restrictions on Russian banks or the mothballing of a natural gas pipeline, they carry a potent symbolic punch, leaving millions of ordinary Russians isolated in an interconnected world. Among the most visible targets of this opprobrium are cultural icons like Valery Gergiev, the conductor and a longtime backer of Mr. Putin. He has been dropped by Lucerne, Carnegie Hall, La Scala in Milan, and faces imminent dismissal by the Munich Philharmonic, where he is chief conductor, unless he disavows the invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been banned from this year’s Eurovision Song Contest, which it last won in 2008, with Dima Bilan performing his power ballad, “Believe.” Russia’s Formula 1 Grand Prix, scheduled for September in Sochi, has been scrapped. St. Petersburg has lost the Champions League soccer final, which was relocated to Paris. Russia’s World Cup hopes were dashed on Monday after a dozen countries joined Poland in refusing to play its national soccer team in qualifying rounds. Under intense pressure, soccer’s two main governing bodies, FIFA and UEFA, ruled that Russia was ineligible to play in their tournaments. In Germany, the soccer club Schalke severed a sponsorship deal with the Russian oil giant Gazprom. The National Hockey League also suspended its business dealings in Russia. Also on Monday, Greece announced that it would suspend all collaborations with Russian cultural organizations. A French former ballet star, Laurent Hilaire, resigned as the director of the Stanislavksi Theatre Company in Moscow, saying that “the context no longer allows me to work with peace of mind.” “Canceling all these cultural exchanges and sporting events will be felt by the Russian population,” said Angela E. Stent, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the book, “Putin’s World.” “Unfortunately, at the Kremlin level, it will be seen as just another example of the West trying to paint us into a corner.” “It will become part of the narrative of victimhood, which we’ve heard from Putin in spades over the last few weeks,” Ms. Stent said. “The boycotts affect the people involved in those events, but we’re talking about Putin and the few people around him. I’m not sure it’s going to make him change his mind.” The last time the country’s leaders provoked such a global backlash was in 1980 when the United States, West Germany, Japan, and Canada boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow to protest the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviets retaliated by skipping the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. That was during the depths of the Cold War, when Hollywood released jingoistic films like “Red Dawn,” about a fictional Soviet invasion of Colorado, and more than 100 million Americans tuned into “The Day After,” a television movie about a calamitous nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Olympics boycott had a major impact on popular sentiment, according to Russia experts, because the then-Soviet leader, Leonid I. Brezhnev, had presented them as a simulacrum of Soviet power and influence, much as Mr. Putin has framed the invasion of Ukraine in terms of reclaiming Russian greatness. “The Soviet government had to explain why the United States and other countries weren’t there,” said Michael A. McFaul, a former American ambassador to Russia. “It began to affect the way that Soviet citizens saw themselves in the world.” Though Russian villains remained a Hollywood staple, the country’s black-hat image faded after the collapse of the Communist regime. Younger Russians grew up in a relatively open, if rough-and-tumble, society. Those with money had access to a foreign education and European holidays, where the hosts catered to free-spending Russians. In Jerusalem, Russian-speaking Israelis flocked to the popular Putin Pub, where the name seemed a lark — no more problematic than the bar’s late-night Russian karaoke. On Thursday, the Russian-born owners stripped the golden “P-U-T-I-N” letters from its facade and announced that they were looking for a new name. “It was our initiative,” said Yulia Kaplan, one of the three owners, who moved to Israel from St. Petersburg in 1991. “Because we are against war.” Israel, in its own way, serves as an example of the limits of these kinds of boycotts. For years, critics of its occupation of the West Bank have tried to pressure the government through the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement. While it has had successes, it has antagonized people on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide and failed to pressure successive Israeli leaders to change policy toward the Palestinians. “Such boycotts won’t change Putin’s mind, for sure,” said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel. “But it will boost the morale of the Ukrainians to know that people around the world are on their side. And it will put the oligarchs on the spot in a way that I suspect financial sanctions will not.” Still, the backlash will hit ordinary Russians hard as well. Already, they cannot fly to London and large swaths of the European Union because of bans on Russian flights. Canada closed its airspace to Russian planes on Sunday and announced it was investigating the Russian carrier, Aeroflot, for violating the restrictions. “Middle-class Russians have been going to Turkey to vacation for a decade,” Mr. McFaul said. “Now they will have to wonder: Will their credit cards work? Will their money be worth anything?” In capitals from Madrid to London, tens of thousands of people marched in solidarity with the Ukrainians and against the Russian invasion. In Ottawa, the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill, the backdrop for three weeks of trucker protests in the Canadian capital, was lighted up in the colors of the Ukrainian flag. In Rio de Janeiro, where the invasion coincided with the start of the annual Carnival festival, people wore costumes and carried signs related to the conflict. “Drop acid, not bombs,” one sign said in English. “The totality of it — the sanctions, the cheering football fans for the Ukrainians, the crowds marching in Berlin and Prague — I do think it matters because it makes Russians feel isolated,” Mr. McFaul said. That is likely to deepen the opposition of some Russians to the invasion, he said, particularly among urban, educated elites. These people have access to the internet and are aware of the scornful reaction to Mr. Putin’s aggression. But among those who live in more provincial areas, where the media is tightly controlled by the government, the backlash against Russia could breed further resentment. Some cultural institutions have tailored their actions against people who are known for their close ties to Mr. Putin. The Metropolitan Opera, for example, said it would no longer work “with artists or institutions that support Putin or are supported by him,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said in a video statement. That has prompted a show of defiance from some Russian artists. The star soprano Anna Netrebko, who is scheduled to perform at the Met in Puccini’s “Turandot” in April, has tried to distance herself from the Russian invasion. But she also posted on her Instagram account, “forcing artists, or any public figure, to voice their political opinions in public and to denounce their homeland is not right.” Not all cultural exchanges have been sundered. A blockbuster show of French and Russian paintings at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris remains open. The exhibit — showcasing 200 works collected by two 20th-century Russian textile magnates — grew out of high-level discussions between President Emmanuel Macron of France, Mr. Putin and the chief executive of LVMH, Bernard Arnault. Both leaders signed contributions to the exhibit’s catalog, and Mr. Putin signed off on loans for the paintings. For many, however, the idea of supporting Russia is simply intolerable. Pennsylvania, Utah, Ohio, New Hampshire, and other states, as well as Canada, have pulled Russian-branded vodka off the shelves of liquor stores. In some cases, the gesture is misplaced: Stolichnaya, though historically a Russian brand, is manufactured in Riga, Latvia. In Brazil, a São Paulo bar has renamed its Moscow Mule — a drink that was concocted in the United States and is made with vodka, ginger beer, and lime — as a U.N. Mule. “We’re not too happy with what Moscow has done, with what Russia has done,” said the bar’s co-owner, Maurício Meirelles, a well-known comedian and television host in Brazil. “And then we thought about changing the name,” he added. “The U.N. Mule: the drink that isn’t attacking anyone.” Reporting was contributed by Jack Nicas in Rio de Janeiro, Andre Spigariol in Brasília, Aurelien Breeden in Paris, Raphael Minder in Madrid, Elisabetta Povoledo in Rome, Carlotta Gall in Istanbul, Niki Kitsantonis in Athens, Vjosa Isai in Ottawa, Livia Albeck-Ripka in California and Isabel Kershner in Jerusalem.",29
2022-03-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/europe/zelensky-ukraine-war-outrage.html,How Ukrainians Are Using Social Media to Speak Out About the War,"PARIS — The man the Kremlin holds in dismissive contempt, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, has emerged as an online hero. His Twitter account has leapt by hundreds of thousands of followers a day (he now has 4.3 million). Often dressed in olive-green fleece and cargo pants, he has accused Russia of war crimes, signed a formal application to join the European Union, and morphed into a symbol of hope and grace under pressure. As Russia pursues its ruthless invasion, Mr. Zelensky has used social media adroitly to outmaneuver his nemesis, President Vladimir V. Putin. So, too, have many of the 44 million citizens of Ukraine. TikTok, the video-sharing app with more than a billion active users, has shaped views of the conflict and contributed to an intense wave of global sympathy for Ukraine. Call it Resistance 4.0, the influencers’ war against an unprovoked Russian invasion. Mr. Putin’s assault against a phantom “genocide” in Ukraine meets the nimbleness, even the humor, of a people unified and galvanized by the Russian leader’s obsessive talk of their nonexistence as a nation. The Russian leader also claims the war is nonexistent and is in fact “a special military operation.” Technology, blamed of late for every ill from the death of truth to the spread of loneliness, restores feeling and revives human connection as the war unfolds. Brave civilians brandishing newly acquired rifles against armored divisions cannot leave the onlooker cold. “I don’t really have any choice because this is my home,” Hlib Bondarenko, a computer programmer who has lined up for his weapon in Kyiv, tells The New York Times in a video. This is not the remote, clinical war of drones and satellites. It poses perhaps the most acute moral question of war, especially one pitting the weak and righteous against Goliath: What would I do? The answer appears to be: something, at least. Protest marches have unfurled under blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags across Europe and the United States, from Chicago to Warsaw, from Berlin to New York. Ukrainians living abroad have lined up to return home and fight. As with the Spanish Civil War, when volunteers flocked to support the left-leaning government against a military rebellion, the conscience of Europe has stirred. Taboos have tumbled. Swedish and Finnish and Swiss neutrality has evaporated. Postwar Germany’s refusal to prioritize military spending and send arms to conflict zones has ended. A united 27-nation European Union has decided, for the first time, to provide Ukraine with more than half-a-billion dollars in aid for lethal weapons. The outright collapse of the Russian economy is declared an objective by the French economy minister. “It’s a sea change,” said Anne-Claire Legendre, the spokeswoman for the French Foreign Ministry. “A new world has defied Putin, the master of propaganda.” Salomé Zourabichvili, the president of Georgia, told France Inter, a French radio station, that “Putin has already failed because he has given birth to a monster: European power and European defense.” The outcome of the five-day-old war is of course still in the balance, with Russia unleashing a rocket assault on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and a Russian military convoy, at least 40 miles long, poised north of Kyiv. But if Mr. Putin planned a blitzkrieg to decapitate Ukraine in short order, the impact of his plan with reality has been confounding. Nowhere has the European sea change been more pronounced than in Germany, where one legacy of Nazism was reluctance to exercise national power to the full. Another was hesitancy over confronting Russia, one of the countries Hitler invaded. All that ended on the date of the Russian invasion, Feb. 24, 2022, “a turning point in the history of our continent,” as Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. He told the Bundestag, the Parliament, on Sunday that “at the heart of the matter is whether power can break the law.” That was also the question in Berlin in 1933 as Hitler took control. It is therefore an existential question for Germany. The essential issue, Mr. Scholz said, was whether “we find it within ourselves to set limits to an international warmonger like Putin.” The war, in other words, is a pivotal moral challenge to the 21st-century world, as seen by the power that committed the greatest moral outrage of the last century. This, after all, is a war in which a nuclear power, Russia, confronts a state, Ukraine, that gave up its nuclear weapons in 1994 in exchange for Russian promises that its sovereignty and territorial integrity would be respected. Mr. Putin’s Russia leveled Grozny during the Chechnya war. It leveled Aleppo in Syria. Can it level Kyiv with a TikTok world watching? The question hangs over the war as the Russian leader’s frustration grows. Just over a decade has passed since social media played the role of great liberator, connecting the youth of the Arab world in uprisings against their despotic rulers. But technology, it transpired, was twin-souled like Goethe’s Faust. The organizing tool of the freedom fighter might equally serve the surveillance system of the despot. Facebook, owned by Meta, was used by the military in Myanmar to stir a frenzy of hatred against the Muslim Rohingya that led to the mass expulsion and genocide that began in 2016. It was used by Russian intelligence agencies to interfere in the 2016 American election. But the war in Ukraine has demonstrated some lessons learned, as well as the enduring liberalizing potential inherent in a borderless virtual world. Big tech companies like Google, Meta and Apple have taken several steps to counter the Russian disinformation that proved so effective in the past. At the same time, their platforms have revealed growing Russian opposition to Mr. Putin’s war and allowed Ukrainian influencers to display the courage of a nation where, from rural village to metropolis, nobody appears to be surrendering. If the idea of truth, in the United States as elsewhere, appeared to have been lost in the disorienting bombardment of social media, with the line between fact and falsehood ever fainter, the sheer enormity of Russian lies — the denial of the existence of a war, for example — appears to have done something to restore its value and importance. “Who else but us?” said Zakhar Nechypor, a Ukrainian actor, as he armed himself with a rifle. Who else indeed and what truth more raw? Ivan Andronic, a plumber who moved from his native Moldova to France 18 years ago, said in an interview that he felt his mother and mother-in-law back in Moldova were now at risk. Mr. Putin could do anything, even embark on nuclear war. “He is very dangerous,” Mr. Andronic said. “We must fight him together, and his own population must turn on him.” Togetherness is a word enjoying a revival. The Ukraine war appears to have dented a cycle of growing loneliness in which Covid-19 played a significant part. The unbearable lightness of online being has given way to the unbearable gravity of a European war. A break has occurred in the world where people are corralled into herds by social media algorithms, trolls and bots. Where they forsake community to become tribes with megaphones. Where they turn in circles, succumbing to technological neuroticism. Above all, where they grow lonelier, caught in a vortex, starved of connective tissue, hungry for status, often bereft of moral conviction. In their place, quite suddenly, a life-and-death struggle presents itself with its moral imperatives. As Europe initially hesitated, Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister and the president of the European People’s Party, tweeted: “In this war everything is real: Putin’s madness and cruelty, Ukrainian victims, bombs falling on Kyiv. Only your sanctions are pretended. Those EU government’s, which blocked tough decisions (i.a. Germany, Hungary, Italy) have disgraced themselves.” Very soon, almost overnight, Europe did what it is rarely capable of doing. It united to end that disgrace and face down Mr. Putin. As the German philosopher Hannah Arendt wrote, “Under conditions of terror, most people will comply but some will not. Humanly speaking, no more is required, and no more can reasonably be asked, for this planet to remain a fit place for human habitation.”",4
2022-03-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/asia/ukraine-taiwan-china-russia.html,War in Ukraine Hits Home for Taiwanese,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Justin Huang, a 23-year-old recent university graduate in Taiwan, has been gripped by news of the crisis, just like many other people around the world. He has pored over reports about Ukrainians signing up for the military and scrutinized video footage of Russian missiles hitting residential buildings. He has been deeply disturbed by Russia’s brazen disregard for global norms. But for Mr. Huang and many Taiwanese, Russia’s assault is hitting especially close to home. The self-governed island democracy has long faced the threat of being absorbed by the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, which has vowed to do so by force if it deems necessary. As Taiwanese watch Russian troops pour into Ukraine, their unease about their island’s own future is growing. The courage of Ukrainians, as well as the harsh reality of that country’s lonely battle, has driven a greater sense of urgency among many Taiwanese to step up the island’s defenses. “Reading the news has been a bit traumatic emotionally,” Mr. Huang said. Moved by a sense of solidarity with Ukraine, he and around 200 other people protested on Saturday outside Russia’s de facto embassy in Taipei. He said he feared that the invasion of Ukraine could be the “tipping point” in the world order, ushering in a new era in which autocrats could act with impunity. “I can see how, after the crisis in Ukraine, it’s possible that China could find some reason to invade Taiwan in the near future,” he said. Taiwan’s parallels with Ukraine are evident to many on this island of 23 million people. Taiwan, like Ukraine, has long lived in the shadow of a large and overbearing neighbor. Both China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have appealed to nationalistic historical narratives to justify their present-day territorial claims. And Mr. Xi has in recent years intensified his warnings to Taiwan not to seek formal independence from China, similar to the ways in which Mr. Putin had threatened to punish Ukraine if it sought to strengthen security ties with the West, for instance by joining NATO. In Taiwan, the invasion has rekindled debates about the probability of a Chinese invasion, the level of Taiwan’s military preparedness and whether the United States is committed to defending the island. Taiwan is more vulnerable than Ukraine, to some extent, because it is not recognized by most countries as a sovereign nation. For days, the slogan “Today, Ukraine, tomorrow, Taiwan!” has ricocheted online. On Taiwan’s news programs and talk shows, some pundits have said that Beijing could take advantage of a distracted West to step up its pressure on Taiwan. Others have expressed concerns that a weak Western response to Russia’s invasion could embolden the Chinese leadership. Still others have said such talk has only created unnecessary anxiety. Regardless of the possible outcomes, many Taiwanese see a need for greater self-reliance. Dr. Charlie Ma, a 59-year-old physician in Taipei, said that the West’s refusal to send troops to help Ukraine fight Russia made him think Taiwan could not count on other countries coming to its defense. If China invaded Taiwan, Dr. Ma said, he would volunteer as a combat medic. “This is Ukraine’s lesson for us: Don’t rely on others,” he said. While Beijing now regularly sends warplanes toward Taiwan, there is no sign that an attack on the island is imminent. Dr. Ma said his biggest concern was that an accident, like a collision of military planes, could inadvertently start a war. Still, Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, last week ordered the island’s armed forces and security personnel to step up surveillance and strengthen defenses, partly to reassure the public. For Ms. Tsai, drawing comparisons with Ukraine helps bring world attention to Taiwanese concerns about Beijing’s aggression, but leaning too heavily on that narrative risks stirring panic at home. Ms. Tsai has said that Taiwan empathizes with Ukraine and pointed to that country’s continuing resistance as evidence of strength in unity. “We all see the people of Ukraine come together to fight against the invasion by a powerful country,” Ms. Tsai said on Monday. She was speaking at a ceremony commemorating one of the most painful chapters of Taiwan’s modern history: a popular uprising in 1947 in Taiwan that was crushed by Nationalist soldiers, who killed tens of thousands of people. But she and other voices in Taiwan have also taken pains to emphasize that the situations are significantly different. Unlike Ukraine, which has a land border with Russia, Taiwan is separated from mainland China by a wide body of water, making an invasion more difficult. The world, including China, also has much to benefit from a stable Taiwan, which is a key node in the global economy. In the face of growing belligerence from Beijing, Ms. Tsai’s government has highlighted the United States’ efforts to bolster its presence in Asia and its unofficial ties with Taiwan. On Monday, the Biden administration sought to demonstrate support for Taiwan in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by sending a delegation of former senior defense and security officials to the island. Still, many in Taiwan are aware that even as the United States provides political and military support, it has long avoided explicitly committing to defend Taiwan in the event of an attack by China. Some people have pointed to the reports of Ukrainian civilians standing in line for Kalashnikovs and volunteering to donate blood, urging Taiwan to invest in its nascent civil defense. In recent years, grass-roots programs have sprung up to teach citizens first aid skills and situational awareness, like how to locate the closest bomb shelter. Last week, one of those programs, Kuma Academy, posted on its Facebook account a flier for a two-day camp that was billed as an opportunity to build knowledge of modern warfare concepts and learn essential self-defense strategies. “Of course, the situation in Ukraine cannot be directly compared to that of Taiwan,” the camp’s organizers wrote in the accompanying post. “But the situation of the Taiwan Strait is such that we cannot let our guard down, and we must use this time of peace to prepare for the worst.” Other citizens of Taiwan have drawn a far different message from Russia’s invasion, seeing it as horrific evidence that a powerful country’s limits should not be tested. They say that rather than lean on the United States, Ms. Tsai’s government should work to improve relations with Beijing to avoid a war. For Tu Dong-siang, a 58-year-old retiree, the war in Ukraine reminded her of growing up in Matsu, part of a chain of Taiwan-controlled islands near China’s coast that was frequently shelled by mainland troops until the 1970s. Ms. Tu recalled the terror she often felt as a young girl, running with her family for cover in their local bomb shelter, sometimes while still carrying her dinner bowl. “We know how horrific war can be,” said Ms. Tu, who now lives in New Taipei City. “That’s why I think for Ukraine, and for Taiwan, being able to live is the most important.” And even as ties between Taiwan and China have deteriorated in recent years, some pockets of the island still retain strong familial ties with the mainland, which make the notion of going to war unfathomable. Ms. Tu’s son, Rick Hsieh, 26, said that while he had just completed the military service required of all Taiwanese men, he had no desire to fight China. Mr. Hsieh said that unlike many of his peers, he felt an affinity with the mainland, where he still had relatives. He was even open to the idea of unification. “Of course, I know there might be limits to freedom of speech, but overall I don’t think being absorbed by China would be that bad,” said Mr. Hsieh, a poet who works at a cafe in New Taipei City. For many others in Taiwan, though, the war in Ukraine has only reinforced their embrace of the island’s democratic values. At Saturday’s antiwar rally in Taipei, demonstrators hoisted signs with slogans such as “Ukraine is not alone” and “Taiwan stands with Ukraine!” Hours later, buildings around Taiwan, including the iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper not far from the protest, were lit with the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag in a show of solidarity. “In the end, Taiwan’s situation is not that different from Ukraine’s,” said Lillian Lin, a 50-year-old stay-at-home mother, who attended the rally with her husband and 9-year-old daughter. “To be honest, a dictator is a dictator, and the decisions they make are basically the same.”",22
2022-03-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/asia/india-russia-united-states-ukraine.html,"As World Rebukes Russia, India Tries to Stay Above the Fray","NEW DELHI — When India abstained from a United Nations vote and the chorus of Western condemnation against the Ukraine invasion, it appeared to be taking sides: offering tacit support for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. After all, the two nations’ deep ties are decades old, and their leaders, who have met nearly 20 times since Narendra Modi became prime minister of India in 2014, share a similar vision of muscular nationalism. But India was more subtle in its move, driven by its vulnerability in a hostile neighborhood that forces the country to play a constant balancing act between Moscow and Washington. India needs both the United States and Russia to contain China, which is pushing up against its borders and gaining influence with its neighbors. And it has been trying to navigate both sides over the war with Ukraine. The Indian government hasn’t offered outright support for Western positions or sanctions, because abandoning Moscow, a time-tested partner and its largest supplier of weapons, would leave India increasingly isolated in the region. But it has called for a return to diplomacy and engaged with Moscow’s adversaries, including Ukraine — seemingly a break from the past where India would keep discontent private. “This particular decision is a product of the geopolitical circumstances that India is looking at this point in time,” said Happymon Jacob, who teaches India’s foreign policy at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. Mr. Jacob described India’s situation in its immediate region of South and Central Asia as a “claustrophobia” that would get worse if India angered Russia. Chinese troops have been building up on the Indian border in the Himalayas, with the two countries on war footing for nearly two years after deadly skirmishes. Russia’s mutual relations with India and China gives the Modi government a mediating force in the case of escalation. Russia is also a close partner in places like Afghanistan, where the American retreat has left India out in the cold. The United States provides defensive help for India, which has increased its purchase of American military equipment significantly in recent years. And the two, along with Australia and Japan, are cooperating on maritime security in the Indo-Pacific as part of the Quad alliance. The balancing act on Ukraine does not entirely satisfy either side, and India could face scrutiny as Western nations increase sanctions on Russia. Historically, India has continued bilateral trade during moments of tension through creative currency arrangements that date to the Cold War. If India did set up such an arrangement this time, it wouldn’t help Russia much. The scale of the two nations’ bilateral trade, about $9 billion, is less than one-tenth of Russia’s trade with its largest trading partner, China. India also knows such deals can anger U.S. officials. India initially found ways to work around the American sanctions on Iran by importing oil and settling accounts largely in Indian currency. But it had to seek oil from other sources after the Trump administration in 2019 closed that loophole. “This is an evolving situation, and we have to see what kind of impact the sanctions will have on our own interests,” Harsh Vardhan Shringla, India’s foreign secretary, said at a recent news conference. “We have to study this carefully because any sanctions will have impact on our existing relationships. We have to acknowledge that factor.” Indian leaders have been working the phone since the Russian invasion began, with Mr. Modi speaking to both his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts, and his foreign minister engaged with diplomats around the world. The government is also occupied with an emergency that hits closer to home: trying to evacuate thousands of Indian citizens stuck in Ukraine. Mr. Modi’s political opposition has been using emotional videos of stranded students appealing for help to criticize his government. But criticism of India’s position on the war has remained subdued, reflecting the reality that the opposition was also stuck in a similar balancing act when it was last in power. After India became a republic following the end of British rule in 1947, the country had a neutral position — although its founding prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had a soft spot for Communist Russia. But India tilted toward the Soviet Union in the 1970s, when it saw the United States providing military and financial support to its archenemy, Pakistan. The Soviets came to India’s aid. India now relies on Russia for more than 60 percent of its military equipment. And Russia has often voted to support India in international forums, including refraining from criticism of its nuclear weapons tests in the 1990s. India’s bonds with the United States are the tightest they’ve ever been, increasingly connected by the shared threat in the rise of an aggressive China. India’s spending on military equipment from the United States has gone from nearly zero to about $20 billion in just a little over a decade. That proximity has created challenges, notably in the abrupt way the United States pulled out of Afghanistan, where India was closely coordinating its interests. While the troubled exit created some hesitancy among government officials and outside advisers, it has not significantly dented what Mr. Jacob described as a “growing sentiment of pro Americanism” on larger issues of strategic security. Pankaj Saran, a former deputy national security adviser who was also India’s ambassador to Moscow, said Russian relations have been tested in recent years by American ties. The Russians have expressed dismay at how closely India was working with the United States in Afghanistan, and both the Russians and the Chinese, he said, have seen the increased purchase of American weapons “in a magnified manner, extremely magnified.” “We have had to face a lot of fire from both of them about this growth in the relationship with the U.S.,” Mr. Saran said. While American and European officials have been urging India’s support for their measures against Russia, they appear to understand India’s strategic needs. Ned Price, a U.S. State Department spokesman, acknowledged in recent news briefings that “India has a relationship with Russia that is distinct from the relationship that we have with Russia.” Even after India abstained from the U.N. vote on Ukraine, Mr. Price said the two countries had “a very close relationship” and were in regular discussion about “our shared concerns.” American officials have previously acknowledged India’s complicated security environment When India bought a $5.4 billion Russian missile defense system, Indian officials brushed aside suggestions that the deal violated American sanctions, saying negotiations started before the measure went into effect in 2017. And the reaction from U.S. officials was muted in December 2021 after India announced during a visit to New Delhi by Mr. Putin that supplies for that system had started arriving. Many in the U.S. Congress echoed India’s position that the purchase was needed to counter the threat of China. James O’Brien, nominated by President Biden to oversee sanctions policy at the State Department, said in his confirmation hearing that the United States was discouraging the purchase, but that any prospect of penalizing India would have to be weighed against the “important geostrategic considerations, particularly with the relationship to China.” “I think there is sincere desire on India’s part to douse the fires a little bit, to not exacerbate, to not contribute to the ‘us vs. them’ paradigm,” Mr. Saran, the former Indian security adviser, said about the continuing tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “When the dust settles down, people are going to take a more long-term and strategic approach to the role of India.”",22
2022-03-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/us/politics/biden-putin-state-of-the-union.html,Biden Focuses on Global Unity Against Russia's Invasion in State of the Union,"WASHINGTON — President Biden vowed on Tuesday to make President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia “pay a price” for invading Ukraine, seeking to rally the world as Moscow’s forces rained down missiles on Ukrainian cities and prepared to lay siege to the capital of Kyiv. Appearing before a joint session of Congress at a fraught moment in modern history, Mr. Biden called for a united resistance to defend the international order endangered by Russian aggression and warned the oligarchs who bolster Mr. Putin’s regime that he would seize their luxury yachts and private jets. “Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways,” Mr. Biden said. “But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined. He met the Ukrainian people.” Hailing the heroism of the Ukrainian resistance, Mr. Biden introduced Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, who joined Jill Biden in the first lady’s box holding a small blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag. In a show of bipartisan solidarity, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, some of them wearing blue and yellow and many of them waving Ukrainian flags, leapt to their feet in an ovation to her and her country. While the guns of Europe overshadowed the political disputes at home that have weighed down his presidency, Mr. Biden sought to use his first formal State of the Union address to persuade glum Americans that the country is making impressive progress containing the coronavirus pandemic and rebuilding the economy. He made a new pitch for the social spending programs that have been logjammed in Congress, including expanded child care, elder care, prekindergarten education, climate change initiatives and prescription-drug price cuts, without explaining how he planned to overcome the opposition. And he vowed to take action to curb inflation, saying, “My top priority is getting prices under control.” Two years after the pandemic transformed American life, Mr. Biden declared that “we’ve reached a new moment in the fight against Covid-19,” and he generated bipartisan applause by calling for schools to remain open. “Our kids need to be in school,” he said. Yet he warned against complacency and called on lawmakers who have demonstrated unity over Ukraine to put aside their differences at home. “Let’s use this moment to reset,” he said in the hourlong speech. “So stop looking at Covid as a partisan dividing line. See it for what it is: a God-awful disease. Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies and start seeing each other for who we are: fellow Americans.” But the discord of today’s politics erupted in the House chamber in ways that would have once been unthinkable. When Mr. Biden talked about immigration reform, Representative Lauren Boebert, a far-right Republican from Colorado given to angry spectacle and conspiracies, tried to start a “build the wall” chant but was joined only by a like-minded colleague, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia. Later in the speech, when Mr. Biden was paying tribute to American troops in flag-draped coffins, Ms. Boebert interrupted again. “You put them in — 13 of them!” she shouted, referring to service members killed during the withdrawal from Afghanistan last year. Mr. Biden did not respond, but proceeded to the next line in his text citing his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died of brain cancer. No president had delivered his State of the Union address with such a large-scale and consequential land war underway in Europe since 1945, and Mr. Biden faced the challenge of holding together multinational and bipartisan alliances to counter Mr. Putin. But even before he arrived in the House chamber, congressional negotiations over an aid package bogged down in a partisan quarrel. Mr. Biden announced that he would ban Russian planes from American airspace and agreed with foreign counterparts to release a cumulative 60 million barrels of oil from their strategic petroleum reserves to try to curtail gasoline price increases stemming from the war. Private companies continued to flee the Russian market, with Apple cutting off sales of its products and Universal and Paramount joining other Hollywood studios in suspending movie releases there. Mr. Biden, who has teamed up with European leaders to impose sanctions not just on Russian institutions but on Mr. Putin personally, highlighted the unified response to Russia’s invasion. “Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked,” he said. “He rejected repeated, repeated efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. He thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber and this nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well. But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united.” He said Mr. Putin and his cronies should not go unpunished. “Throughout our history, we’ve learned this lesson — when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos,” Mr. Biden said. “They keep moving. And the costs, the threats to America, and America to the world, keeps rising.” Mr. Biden directly threatened the moneyed moguls who prop up Mr. Putin while keeping their fortunes and enjoying life in the West. “Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: No more,” he said, adding, “We’re joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets.” The speech, an annual rite of passage for any commander in chief, was originally envisioned as an opportunity for Mr. Biden to rejuvenate his presidency with new energy after months of political and economic travails at home, and the White House was loath to let the foreign crisis completely overwhelm his domestic agenda. In a sign of the times, the speech took place in a Capitol once again ringed by security fences and National Guard troops, almost 14 months after the building was stormed by a violent mob egged on by President Donald J. Trump in an effort to stop the counting of Electoral College votes sealing Mr. Biden’s victory. But in a more hopeful indicator, all members of Congress were invited and the chamber was fuller than last year, when the audience was limited to a fraction of its usual size out of concern over Covid-19. While testing was required and every other seat was supposed to be left vacant to encourage social distancing, masks were optional and only a few lawmakers covered their faces. For just the second time in history, two women stood behind a president on the rostrum during a joint session, and for the first time during a formal State of the Union: Vice President Kamala Harris and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Biden used the occasion to hail his nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who would become the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court if confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Biden spoke in a strong voice but stumbled occasionally over his words. At different points, he said “Iranian” when he meant “Ukrainian,” “America” when he meant “Delaware” and “profits” when he meant “prices.” But he appeared energized by the crowd and lingered afterward to chat with lawmakers. The speech came at a politically shaky moment for him and for the country. After two years of struggling with the pandemic and related economic troubles, the state of the union is sour. Fully 70 percent of Americans surveyed by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research said the nation was heading in the wrong direction, the kind of number that typically spells trouble in a midterm election year for the party in power. Mr. Biden has lost the confidence of many Americans since taking office. His approval rating in recent days has been measured anywhere from 44 percent by The A.P. and NORC to as low as 37 percent by The Washington Post and ABC News. Judging by Gallup’s numbers, no elected president in modern times had been as low at this point in his tenure other than Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden has struggled to command public support in a time of intense polarization, with Republicans staunchly resisting his legislative agenda and Mr. Trump relentlessly refusing to accept defeat and spreading lies about the 2020 election that have been accepted by many Americans. Moreover, the tradition of rallying around the president during a crisis has long since faded, and many Americans view the conflict with Russia through a partisan lens. Just 3 percent of voters who supported Mr. Trump in 2020 say Mr. Biden is doing a better job leading his country than Mr. Putin is in leading his own, according to a poll by Yahoo News and YouGov, while 47 percent believe the Russian leader is doing better than their own president. While some have pressed him to be even tougher and criticized him for not taking action sooner, Mr. Biden has generally enjoyed bipartisan backing from lawmakers as he imposes economic sanctions on Russia and sends American troops to NATO allies near Ukraine to reassure them. His comments castigating Moscow prompted that rarest of scenes during a State of the Union: both sides of the aisle rising to applaud. “I think there’s broad support for the president in what he’s doing now,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, told reporters before the speech. “Our biggest complaint is, what took him so long?” Yet talks over a $6.4 billion security and humanitarian aid package for Ukraine stalled in the Senate over whether the money should come out of the same total military spending allocation previously agreed to or be considered emergency money on top of that. “We’ve hit a snag,” Mr. McConnell reported. Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa, who delivered the official Republican response after the speech, more aggressively laid the blame for Russia’s invasion at Mr. Biden’s feet. “Weakness on the world stage has a cost, and the president’s approach to foreign policy has consistently been too little, too late,” she said. In a sign of the complicated political landscape, Mr. Biden was followed not just by Ms. Reynolds, but also by separate responses by several members of his own party: Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for the progressive Working Families Party, Representative Colin Allred of Texas for the Congressional Black Caucus and Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey for the bipartisan group No Labels. The president returned to the same chamber where he unveiled his ambitious $1.8 trillion social spending package to great fanfare a year ago only to watch it go nowhere amid lock-step Republican opposition and the defection of two moderate Democratic senators. To make the case for lowering the price of prescription drugs, he singled out Joshua Davis, a Virginia boy who has diabetes and needs daily insulin that costs his family considerably. Joshua, who just turned 13, smiled from the first lady’s box as Mr. Biden wished him a happy birthday. Mr. Biden presented an upbeat assessment of the country, talking about “the rebirth of pride” and “the revitalization of American manufacturing.” He sought to reassure Americans feeling the pain of rising inflation, which has taken a toll on his political standing as well, vowing to bring down prices by driving up production. “Lower your cost, not your wages,” he said. “That means make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.” But even as he promoted an agenda appealing to progressives, Mr. Biden appeared intent on reminding voters of his centrist pedigree, too. Citing protests against law enforcement abuse of people of color, Mr. Biden said that “the answer is not to defund the police,” but to reform their practices. Mr. Biden unveiled few concrete new domestic initiatives other than promising to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate fraud involving pandemic relief funds. But he emphasized that while there may be new variants, “Covid-19 no longer need control our lives.” The average number of new coronavirus cases has fallen more than 90 percent since its January peak, and deaths have come down 23 percent in the past two weeks. Even so, more than 1,800 people are still dying from Covid every day in the United States on average, and Mr. Biden tried to be careful not to sound too rosy. “I know some are talking about living with Covid-19,” he said. “But tonight I say that we never will just accept living with Covid-19. We’ll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases.”",1

2022-03-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/opinion/putin-disinformation-social-media.html,Opinion | Putin No Longer Seems Like a Master of Disinformation,"Late last week, as it started to become clear that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had united much of the world in condemnation of Vladimir Putin, I turned on my favorite international propagandist network, Russia Today, to see how the horror was being justified. And thus I discovered the real instigator of Europe’s worst conflict in decades: Karens. “We have these people called ‘Karens,’ and they’re able to become angry at the drop of a hat,” said Lionel, an American conspiracist and right-wing pundit who has frequently contributed to Russia Today. In an interview with an RT anchor, Lionel — who, like Madonna, goes by one name — suggested that the collective denunciation of Russia’s actions in Ukraine was as unhinged as demanding to speak to the manager about some minor customer-service flap: “We are being conditioned to overreact to everything — and this Ukraine situation is no different,” he said. Honestly, it was kind of sad. One does not expect much sophistication from Russia Today, the Russian government-funded television and internet outlet that has long been a haven for conspiracy theories and populist, anti-Western propaganda. Yet I was not prepared for the ineffectual clownishness of some of the arguments that RT has lately floated in defense of the invasion. And that was when RT mentioned the attack at all — many times in the past week I found the network mostly ignoring the present crisis and instead showing reruns of a grievance-laden documentary about Ukraine’s history originally aired in November. The overall impression has been one of surprising flat-footedness. Although Putin has been obsessed with Ukraine for decades and, according to U.S. intelligence, has been amassing forces for this invasion for months, Russia’s premier international mouthpiece appeared to be caught off guard by the incursion. It’s as if its programmers had actually believed Russian officials’ recent denials of any plans to invade. Ever since the 2016 election, when Russian operatives hacked and leaked the Democratic National Committee’s email and ginned up fake Facebook and Twitter posts to aid Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, Putin has enjoyed a reputation in the West as a wizard of the digital dark arts. With its “troll factories,” its fluency with divisive meme culture and its military’s apparent facility with politically valuable hacking plots, Russia’s “information operations” have been called a grave new threat to global democracy. During the Trump presidency, Putin became an all-purpose boogeyman for some on the American left — everywhere you looked, people were turning up supposedly scary evidence of a hidden Russian hand in media and politics. In the Ukraine invasion, though, we are seeing that Russian influence has significant limits — and perhaps the unraveling of the myth of Putin’s mastery over global discourse. Whatever the military and geopolitical outcome in Ukraine, it’s already clear that Russia has suffered a public-relations catastrophe. Repudiation of the invasion has been swift, forceful and widespread — spanning adversaries and even a few Russian allies and acolytes, and crossing from the world of foreign affairs into culture, sports and business. Even Putin admirers like Tucker Carlson and Trump himself have been forced to walk back early praise for Putin’s designs on Ukraine. “They’re just reading the room,” said Todd Helmus, a behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation who analyzes Russian propaganda. “Anyone who’s been watching this can see that Russia has been struggling to build any kind of narrative to support what it’s doing.” There are many theories for why Russian propaganda about Ukraine has fallen so flat. Perhaps the most obvious is that the invasion is just too ugly a pig to pretty up — an act so baldly unjustified that no amount of propaganda could set it right. But we’re seeing something else, too: that our fear of Russian domination over digital discourse may have always been a little overblown. In a 2016 paper, Christopher Paul and Miriam Matthews, both at RAND, described Russia’s model of digital propaganda as a “fire hose of falsehoods.” The operation, which Russia has been developing since at least its 2008 incursion into Georgia, is “high-volume and multichannel” — propagandistic memes, videos, social media posts and other content is produced in huge quantities and distributed across all forms of media. This great gusher of propaganda is characterized by a kind of chaos; because Russia’s messaging is produced in such high volume and because it often lacks any commitment to consistency or fidelity to objective reality, it seems aimed at confusing and overwhelming an audience just as easily as it persuades. This might be the model’s great limit. Like, alas, a lot of media now, Russia’s fire hose can amplify conspiracy theories bubbling online and sow chaos and confusion in pockets of society — all of which can certainly be helpful to an aggressive, authoritarian state. But how helpful? It’s very hard to say; the effectiveness of Russia’s internet chicanery has always been murky. I have read plausible theories, but after years of investigation, it still seems unlikely to me that Russia’s information operations made a decisive difference in the 2016 American presidential race — or even that they were any more significant than a half dozen other things that year, from the “Access Hollywood” tape to the Comey letter to that sniffy first debate. And with the world now clued in to Russia’s playbook, that race may have been the high-water mark for Putin’s digital meddling. The Ukrainian crisis shows that the West has learned a lot about countering Russian propaganda in the past few years. Social media companies are now adept at spotting and removing Russian disinformation. The Biden administration has been masterful at “prebunking” Russia’s moves; by disseminating intelligence about Russian plans almost as quickly as it collects it, the White House has managed to embarrass and undermine Russian efforts to control the Ukraine story. Then there’s the steadfast bravery and media wiliness of the Ukrainians, whom Helmus described as “a messaging adversary of the type Russia has never seen before.” As the Russian military bore down on their nation, Ukrainians began filling the internet with irresistible footage of their determination — the 79-year-old grandmother taking up arms against the invaders, the fearless young man kneeling in front of a Russian tank, the member of parliament who boasts on Fox News about kicking Putin’s derrière. In a series of inspirational battlefield dispatches, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has projected an air of heroic machismo of the sort that Putin has long tried to cultivate. Putin, meanwhile, looks anything but macho. Over the past few weeks he has appeared mainly in awkward, possibly scripted encounters with his advisers, often featuring comically long tables. The tables are apparently meant as a precaution against Covid-19, but one so over the top that it’s hard not to see the Russian leader as paranoid and isolated. Christopher Paul, of RAND, told me that assessing the effectiveness of Russia’s messaging strategy is difficult mainly because it’s the domestic audience that Putin cares about most, and it’s on that audience that Russia focuses its propaganda. “In the U.S., we’re kind of in the fourth ring of B.S.,” Paul told me.

2022-03-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/opinion/ukraine-zelensky-biden.html,Opinion | Biden Must Not Allow Ukraine to Fall,"In the cause of freedom, the world has found in Volodymyr Zelensky its most Churchillian figure in decades. “I need ammunition, not a ride” — the Ukrainian president’s spirited reply to an American offer to spirit him to safety — is a line for the ages. His inspiring appearances on the streets of Kyiv recall Britain’s wartime prime minister during the Blitz, personifying his nation’s determination to resist. Now it’s up to President Biden to play Franklin to Zelensky’s Winston. That begins by explaining to the American public that losing Ukraine would be a global, not local, calamity. I’m writing this before Biden delivers the State of the Union address on Tuesday night, so I hope he will say something along these lines by the time you read this. But the main point is this: Vladimir Putin’s goal in Ukraine isn’t merely to seize territory for Russia, even if he wouldn’t mind swallowing an additional chunk of it. He wants to crush its spirit. The threat a free Ukraine poses to his regime isn’t, and never will be, military. It’s political. It’s the thought that if democracy, the rule of law and civil rights can take root in Kyiv, they might soon take root in Moscow, too, bringing an end to his rule and accountability for his crimes. A Ukraine that’s a thriving member of the European Union would pose an even graver threat to Putin’s grip than would Ukrainian membership in NATO. But at stake in this war is more than the fate of Ukraine. Putin is a creature of the Soviet system and personifies its values: contempt for truth, contempt for the individual, contempt for international norms, the unprincipled pursuit of unbridled power. These values have no cultural or geographic limit. If Putin can impose them in Ukraine, just as China has imposed them in Hong Kong, then we will be thrust into a world in which, in the language of Thucydides, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” For America, such a world would be a never-ending test of strength at a moment when we are not particularly strong. China would challenge us — much sooner than we think — over Taiwan. Iran would use sanctions relief from any new nuclear deal to further arm its proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen, stirring chaos that will not spare the United States. A victorious Russia would turn its sights on another target and then another. Some European states, like Poland, might rise to the challenge, but others, like Hungary, would find their inner Quisling. Where will the Biden presidency be then? The administration acquitted itself well in the weeks leading up to the invasion. But if Kyiv falls, it will be the second geopolitical catastrophe the Biden administration will have sustained in barely six months. Republicans will say that the president has consistently been a day late and a dollar short and that this would never have happened on their watch. A growing number of Americans will believe them. But the courage of the Ukrainian people — matched by the remarkable ineptitude of the Russian military in its campaign so far — has given the administration an opportunity to help Ukraine, the world and itself. How? It can stop telegraphing to Putin what we are not going to do. Giving Putin every reason to believe that the United States is more afraid of him than he is of us provides him with additional incentives to ratchet up tensions and behave worse. It can do everything short of war to prevent the fall of Kyiv, including by establishing a humanitarian air corridor to keep the city from being starved and frozen into surrender. Like Leningrad in World War II or Berlin in 1948, the Ukrainian capital has become a potent symbol of defiance. Every day it doesn’t fall, Putin loses the perception of his invincibility. It can persuade Congress to fund covert efforts to support a long-term insurgency throughout Ukraine. The thought of thousands of sniper rifles and antitank missiles in the hands of Ukrainian partisans should keep Russian commanders awake at night. It can push for a declaration with the E.U. that Russia’s energy sector will face comprehensive sanctions if Zelensky is killed, harmed or captured by Russian forces. You don’t need to subscribe to the great man theory of history to recognize that right now, Ukraine’s hopes, and ours, rest on his life. Long before Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt understood that America could not be indifferent to Britain’s fate, even with the odds so overwhelmingly against it. At a meeting in Britain in January 1941, his closest adviser, Harry Hopkins, used the words of the Book of Ruth to convey to Churchill the feelings the two Americans shared: “Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.” Then he added, “Even to the end.” Biden ought to send Zelensky the same message.

2022-03-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/world/asia/asia-russia-ukraine-war.html,Asian Nations' Mixed Reactions to the Ukraine Invasion,"SINGAPORE — Much of the world has united against Russia in the aftermath of its incursion into Ukraine. Envoys have walked out of meetings rather than listen to a top Russian diplomat speak. Western nations have been in near lock step on international sanctions. Bartenders are banning Russian vodka. In Asia, the reaction has been far more mixed. Generals in Myanmar have called Russia’s actions “the right thing to do.” India abstained from a United Nations Security Council resolution to condemn the attack. China has refused to call the assault on Ukraine an invasion. And in Vietnam, Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, is being affectionately referred to as “Uncle Putin.” While most American allies in the region have fallen in line, authoritarian governments and those with weaker ties to the West have been more reluctant to act on the conflict in Ukraine. Across the Asia-Pacific, only Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Australia have agreed to international sanctions against Moscow. Taiwan, the self-governed territory that China claims as its own, has also agreed to sanctions and voiced support for Ukraine. The uneven response is unlikely to counterbalance the onslaught of Western anger, but it could test the limits of President Biden’s pledge to make Mr. Putin a “pariah on the international stage.” Russia’s influence in Asia is minimal compared with that of the United States, though it has grown in recent years, with a particular focus on arms sales. Already, the economic ministry in Moscow announced last Friday that it would seek to expand economic and trade ties with Asia to help offset Western sanctions. “I don’t think we will shun Russia,” said Bilahari Kausikan, Singapore’s former ambassador to Russia. “It is still a big country and is a nuclear weapons state.” It is also a permanent member of the Security Council, a status that is unlikely to change, Mr. Kausikan said. Russia has sold fighter jets to Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar, but its biggest customer in Southeast Asia is Vietnam. From 2000 to 2019, 84 percent of Vietnam’s weapons imports came from Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In its bid to counter China, Vietnam has bought billions of dollars worth of Russian artillery, aircraft and submarines, transforming its military into one of Southeast Asia’s most capable fighting forces while making itself dependent on Moscow for years to come. In India, Moscow has been seen as a reliable military partner for decades. New Delhi is the world’s second-largest importer of Russian arms, which account for about half of its military supplies. When Mr. Putin visited New Delhi late last year, Russia detailed the sale of a $5.4 billion missile defense system to the country. India has been careful not to condemn Russia over Ukraine and upset a time-tested friendship at a moment when China is threatening to encroach on its northeastern border. Moscow repeatedly used its veto power at the Security Council to block resolutions critical of India over Kashmir, a disputed territory India shares with Pakistan. In return, India abstained from a U.N. resolution condemning Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Indian officials said last week that they may even help Russia find workarounds for the new sanctions by setting up rupee accounts to continue trade with Moscow, similar to what it did after the annexation of Crimea. “Whose side is India on?” said Pankaj Saran, India’s former ambassador to Russia. “We are on our side. The cyclical bursts of Cold War antagonism are tiresome.” Indonesia, like India, has significantly increased its economic and defense ties with Russia over the years. Bilateral trade between the two countries rose to $2.74 billion in 2021, a 42.2 percent increase from the year before. Palm oil makes up about 38 percent of Indonesia’s exports to Russia. In December 2021, Jakarta hosted the first-ever joint maritime exercise between Russia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. “Indonesia does not see Russia as a threat to global politics or as a foe,” said Dinna Prapto Raharja, an associate professor in international relations at Bina Nusantara University in Jakarta. “Unilateral sanctions limit the chance for negotiation and heightens the sense of insecurity to the affected countries,” she added. Last Thursday, Teuku Faizasyah, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry, suggested that the country had no intention of imposing sanctions against Moscow, arguing it would “not blindly follow the steps taken by another country.” Where the United States has been quick to criticize Russia for its policies, Mr. Putin’s brand of authoritarian politics has appealed to many countries across Asia, and especially in Southeast Asia, where strongman rule is often favored. In a 2017 Pew Research Center global survey, more than half those polled in the Philippines and Vietnam said they trusted Mr. Putin. At the height of the pandemic, Moscow donated Covid-19 vaccines to the Philippines, Vietnam and Laos. “I am a big fan of Uncle Putin because he always takes drastic actions,” said Tran Trung Hieu, 28, an independent filmmaker in Hanoi, using the same term of respect that locals use for Ho Chi Minh, the revolutionary who led the independence movement in Vietnam. Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, has called Mr. Putin his “favorite hero.” The Philippines on Monday said it condemned the invasion in Ukraine but did not name Russia. Last week, Vietnam refrained from singling Russia out as an aggressor, and instead called on “all relevant parties to exercise restraint.” Two editors for a Vietnamese online magazine and Vietnam National Television said they were told to censor themselves in their reports on the war, including reducing the extent and frequency of coverage, and banning the word “invasion.” Both asked to remain anonymous for fear of government reprisals. But no country in Southeast Asia has been more supportive of Russia since the invasion than Myanmar, where the military seized power in a coup 13 months ago. Senior military officers from both nations, including Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar’s regime, exchanged visits several times last year. Last week, Maj. Gen Zaw Min Tun, the spokesman for the junta, told The New York Times that Moscow had “done its part to maintain its sovereignty,” and that the attack was “the right thing to do.” Russia has continued to sell arms to Myanmar after the coup, despite warnings as a humanitarian crisis unfolds. On Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called for an international tribunal to investigate Russia for war crimes, but governments in Asia have long understood that being vocal about human rights abuses risks inviting unwanted scrutiny on repressive policies at home. Thailand, a treaty ally of the United States, has said little about the war except that it supported “ongoing efforts to find a peaceful settlement.” Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University, called that stance “sitting on the fence and not wanting to get down from the fence at all.” “When Thailand engages abroad, it is concerned, it is fearful that there will be questions about domestic issues in Thailand,” Mr. Thitinan said. The country quelled recent nationwide protests by arresting dozens of young people. Even among the stalwart American allies in Asia, the decision to punish Russia has included some hesitation. South Korea, after a delay, said it would implement sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe but would not enact its own penalties. Officials said the country needed “to keep in mind that our trade relations with Russia are growing.” By contrast, Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, was quick to condemn Russian aggression and announce sanctions. In an interview, Kateryna Zelenko, Ukraine’s ambassador to Singapore, said a refusal to stop Russia would ultimately compromise global security. “It must be clear that keeping silent and standing neutral” is a form of consent, Ms. Zelenko said. She added: “We really hope that everyone soon understands that in this terrible war, nobody will be able to sit out.” Sui-Lee Wee reported from Singapore, Emily Schmall from New Delhi and Sameer Yasir from Srinagar, India.

2022-03-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/world/europe/chess-russia-ukraine-war.html,Chess Distances Itself From Russia,"It was a routine question from an interviewer at the FIDE Grand Prix 2022 in Belgrade, Serbia: How long does it take you to unwind after a chess game? But Alexander Grischuk, a Russian grandmaster who is one of the highest-ranked chess players in the world, ignored the softball. Instead, Mr. Grischuk condemned his country’s attack on Ukraine, calling it “extremely painful for me.” As he spoke, he made a point of not using the word “war,” saying it was banned in the Russian media and he wanted to be quoted back home. “I was, and would, support Russia in 99 percent of international conflicts, but this time I cannot manage to do this,” Mr. Grischuk said. “In my view, what we are doing is very wrong, from both moral view and practical view.” Mr. Grischuk’s comments were emblematic of a sudden and jarring shift in the international chess scene, which has been moving swiftly to cut ties with Russia, where the game remains a popular source of national pride on par with ballet and hockey. Just as the arts, sports and business worlds have moved to rebuke Russia, so, too, has chess, which is confronting questions over how far it should go to distance itself from a country with deep cultural and historical connections to the game. Over the last several days, the International Chess Federation, the game’s global governing body, has criticized the war, cut ties with Belarusian and Russian sanctioned or state-controlled companies, and canceled events in Russia and Belarus, including the 44th Chess Olympiad, which was scheduled to begin in Moscow in July. The federation, known as FIDE, also forbade Russian and Belarusian players from flying their countries’ flags at events and referred two Russian grandmasters who have supported the war, Sergey Karjakin and Sergei Shipov, to an internal disciplinary commission that could disqualify them from tournaments. And FIDE moved to strip one of the world’s most famous chess players, the Russian grandmaster and former world champion Anatoly Karpov, of his title of FIDE Ambassador for Life. As a member of the Duma, or Russian Parliament, Mr. Karpov supported President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to recognize the independence of two separatist regions in Ukraine, which set the stage for Russia’s assault, FIDE officials said. The moves surprised many because FIDE’s president, Arkady Dvorkovich, is a former Russian deputy prime minister believed to have close ties to the Kremlin. But Emil Sutovsky, FIDE’s director general, said the organization had a responsibility to protect chess as a “global game.” “The message is very clear: Russia and Belarus as states have to bear consequences,” but their citizens should be allowed to play under the FIDE flag as long as long as they refrain from making pro-war statements, said Mr. Sutovsky, an Israeli grandmaster who was born in Azerbaijan when it was part of the Soviet Union. Many Russian players have forcefully denounced their country’s invasion, despite Russia’s crackdown on dissent. On Thursday, more than 30 prominent Russian chess masters signed an open letter on a Russian sports website calling on Mr. Putin to end the war and reminding him that they have played dozens of matches and hundreds of games with the Ukrainian chess team, the reigning European champions. “Chess teaches responsibility for one’s actions; every step counts, and a mistake can lead to a fatal point of no return,” the letter states. “And if this has always been about sports, now people’s lives, basic rights and freedoms, human dignity and the present and future of our countries are at stake.” Chess has a long and storied history in Russia and the Soviet Union, where the game was not just a national pastime but a strategic, state-sponsored endeavor embraced as a source of national prestige, said Maxim D. Shrayer, a professor of Russian, English and Jewish studies at Boston College. Lenin and Trotsky were serious players, as was Nikolai Krylenko, Lenin’s supreme commander of the Soviet Army, who saw chess as “a scientific weapon in the battle on the cultural front,” according to “The Immortal Game: A History of Chess,” by David Shenk. Between 1948, when the first FIDE world chess championship was held, and 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Soviet players won every world chess championship save for one, in 1972, when the American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer took the title. In the 1984-85 competition, no winner was declared following the fight between the defending champion, Mr. Karpov, and the contender Garry Kasparov, who would win the next FIDE world chess championship and later emerge as a fierce Putin critic, Professor Shrayer said. He noted that Soviet players ruled during a period when Soviet troops brutally crushed an uprising in Hungary in 1956 and invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 during a season of political and cultural rebirth known as the Prague Spring. “Throughout some of the worst periods of the Cold War, the Soviet Union remains victorious at chess, and you don’t see this kind of movement that we see now,” Professor Shrayer said. “This is a new development in how the international chess community is reacting to the national origins of the chess players from the Russian Federation and Belarus, and linking them with the Russian leader, Putin, and the whole military machine,” he said. He suggested that the decisions were “a delayed reaction to the status of Soviet chess during the Cold War.” “It’s a story that is riddled with political tensions with Cold War politics,” he said. “I think part of it is the ghosts of the Cold War are now fighting their final duel.” It’s not only grandmasters that have been drawn into the conflict. Millions of everyday players who compete online have flooded chess sites with comments opposing the war and have debated whether Russian players themselves should be shunned. Chess.com, one of the most popular sites, denounced the invasion, although it said it would not restrict Russian or Belarusian players from tournaments or forbid them from using their countries’ flags, calling it a “personal and complex choice.” Andrii Baryshpolets, 31, a Ukrainian-born grandmaster who lives in Los Angeles, said he does not believe Russian chess players should be rejected because many do not support the war and others may not be able to freely express their views. But he said FIDE’s president, Mr. Dvorkovich, should resign to protect chess from financial and reputational ruin and to fully separate it from the Russian military assault. “Chess is not related to war,” he said. “Let’s stop the war and let’s play chess.” Alan Yuhas contributed reporting.",29
2022-03-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/us/politics/white-house-ukraine-pandemic-aid.html,White House Requests $32.5 Billion for Pandemic and Ukraine Aid,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has asked Congress for $32.5 billion in emergency spending to bolster the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and support Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion. The administration requested $10 billion in humanitarian and military aid for Ukraine, which was nearly $4 billion more than an initial amount floated late last month, underscoring how rapidly the country’s need for aid has grown as Russian forces continue their attack. As part of its new coronavirus response strategy, the administration also requested $22.5 billion for additional vaccines, oral antivirals and monoclonal antibodies, testing, and support for the global vaccination effort. Officials hope to include both pieces of emergency aid in a sprawling catchall spending package that would fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year. Congress has until March 11, when funding is set to lapse, to hammer out the details of a deal on the dozen bills needed to keep federal money flowing. In a letter on Wednesday, Shalanda Young, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, urged Congress to “act expeditiously” on the request. Lawmakers have struggled to reach a spending agreement for the current fiscal year, which began in October and is already almost halfway over. They have been haggling over how much money to direct to the Pentagon and key domestic programs. In her letter, Ms. Young urged lawmakers to meet the March 11 deadline in order to increase funding for the Defense Department and other agencies, in part because the government is still functioning with spending levels negotiated in late 2020, before President Biden took office. “I cannot begin to tell you the impact that that has had on the defense industrial base,” said Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia. “It doesn’t matter as much how we get it across the finish line, but that we have to get it across the finish line.” Key lawmakers suggested the proposed aid for Ukraine could help encourage a resolution to disputes that might otherwise hamper the funding talks, which have dragged on for months. “The sense of urgency around this is made stronger because of the need to get the dollars over there and get the military aid there,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican. “Having that in there is helpful, both in terms of votes, but also probably in terms of timing,” he added. White House officials initially floated a $6.4 billion request for Ukraine, but lawmakers in both parties quickly called for more aid as Russian forces bombarded the country. The $10 billion request includes $4.8 billion in additional funds for the Pentagon to cover the deployment of U.S. troops to NATO countries, to increase intelligence and cybersecurity support, and to replenish the military’s supply of weapons in response to arms being sent to Ukraine. The request also includes $4.25 billion in new funding for economic and humanitarian assistance to help provide support for Ukrainians, including the one million refugees who have already fled the country in the first week of President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion. And it includes money to enforce some of the economic penalties that the Biden administration has already imposed, including sanctions on Russian oligarchs and restrictions on Russia’s access to high-tech goods. The request for additional Pentagon funding may sour a number of conservative lawmakers, who have argued that the bulk of any new military aid should be spent on sending new lethal aid to Ukraine, rather than the deployment of additional U.S. troops or the replenishment of U.S. stockpiles of weapons. And Republicans were quick to pan the request for $22.5 billion in coronavirus aid, arguing that Congress already allocated plenty of money for responding to the pandemic in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package that was enacted last year without any Republican votes. “I think some of the requests are reasonable, but it doesn’t take new money,” said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and a member of the Appropriations Committee. The request is intended to support the administration’s plans to continue fighting the spread of Covid-19, as well as preparing for new variants and efforts to combat the virus abroad as new U.S. cases decline. Democrats warned that opposing the aid would jeopardize the country’s efforts to return to a semblance of normalcy and stop the spread of the virus and additional variants. “The $22 billion for Covid is absolutely necessary; in fact, we probably will need more as we need more therapies,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at her weekly news conference. She added of Republicans, “I would hope that they would see the wisdom of the science of what we need to do in terms of Covid.” Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.",1
2022-03-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/opinion/ukraine-livestream-videos.html,Opinion | Ukraine's Livestreamed War,"Like most Americans, I have followed the war in Ukraine in the usual, modern way: by consuming cable news, social media videos and rumors, newspapers and a couple of podcasts and YouTube lectures. Many of these have offered useful context — the back story of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the history of the conflict in the Donbas region and the complex cultural and linguistic relationship between the Russian and Ukrainian people. Still, there’s something both fragmented and innately suspect about today’s form of gathering information. The task at hand is to pull together as many bits of good information as possible, then try to stitch everything together into a coherent narrative. For the most part, the sparse moments of clarity — in terms of bringing all that splintered information into a clear understanding — have come from videos apparently shot by Ukrainians that show both the horrors of the invasion and the bravery of the resistance. Social media sites like Twitter, Instagram and TikTok are now filled with these images of Ukraine. This footage of ordinary citizens appearing to stand guard in Kyiv or motorists seeming to hector stalled-out Russian tanks or missiles striking targets in cities creates a visual language that fills in the gaps of knowledge about the war and breathes life into our moral outrage. The information that in previous generations would have come to us as a cohesive television broadcast or a newspaper story now comes in snippets that elicit fits of emotion. Or, to put it a bit more simply, these cellphone videos have become both the evidence of history and the text of history at once. The invasion of Ukraine, of course, is not the first time we’ve seen raw violence streaming through our social media feeds. Fighting that erupted during the Arab Spring more than a decade ago aired via posted cellphone videos. Several years later, phones continued to capture civilian deaths in Syria. After the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., I watched the first few nights of protests on video that was livestreamed by protesters on the ground. This is how I saw the military vehicles, the police officers in riot gear and the clouds of tear gas hovering over West Florissant Avenue. All these images would have been available on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News, but what the livestreams included were the reactions of the person holding the camera. Watching them felt almost illicit; we were seeing and hearing something we weren’t supposed to. About a year later, I met one of those livestreamers, a man named Bassem Masri, at an IHOP in St. Louis. Masri, who died in 2018, told me then about how many times he had been pulled over and harassed by the police, the ties he felt to the Black community in the city and the connections he saw between Ferguson and his Palestinian heritage. Those details mattered to me as a writer because they created those mostly facile links between a person’s background and their actions. But when I went home to write the story, I realized there was little that I could commit to print that could bring Bassem Masri to life in a way that rivaled his own video production of himself in a crowd of police officers and protesters. It became clear to me that this personalized form of reportage would eventually become the ultimate form of storytelling, especially in chaotic conflicts where nobody really could tell what was going on. Not only did it feel more immediate and real, but it also cut out the middleman, namely me and my colleagues in the media. In 2014, we were already thought of as somewhat untrustworthy by some, but now, in a time of widespread distrust of the legacy media by both the left and the right, we can be seen as full-on antagonists. There does seem to be something new this time about the speed and credulity with which these videos have traveled around the internet and the emotional response they’ve generated in the West. Perhaps the most accurate thing to say about social media and the invasion of Ukraine is that it’s the first time that millions of people watched a war on their phones and felt almost morally compelled to believe every image of bravery, no matter how implausible. Given the choice between seeing the footage on CNN or through their social media feeds, many now are choosing the latter because they believe it comes with an aura of authenticity and without the assumed “agendas” of the mainstream media. For the first few days of the conflict, it felt as if the desire to figure out the truth on the ground had evaporated. What replaced it was a fantastical vision that turned a brutal, terrifying and bloody invasion into the Ukrainian version of the film “Braveheart.” Scraps of footage of blown-up television towers, Russian helicopters coming under what looks like antiaircraft fire, apartment buildings being hit with missiles and the stirring footage of the citizens of Kyiv arming themselves have been seen around the world. Many of these are real, but many more have not been confirmed or verified. We might see what it looks like when an airstrike hits an apartment building, but we do not really know anything else. Where is this building? Who fired upon it? How many people are dead? Is it even in Ukraine? Predictably enough, some of the more stirring footage out of Ukraine has been debunked or had its veracity brought into serious question. This includes video of the so-called Ghost of Kyiv, the purported fighter pilot who took down six Russian planes, and the reported deaths of the soldiers stationed at Snake Island who Zelensky said had died heroically but in fact are all still alive. Widely circulated video that purportedly showed a young Ukrainian girl confronting a Russian soldier actually showed Ahed Tamimi, a young Palestinian activist who was filmed near her home in the West Bank. The footage was shot in 2012. We choose which videos we care about and which ones we do not. This seems simple enough. Our relative acceptance and the timbre of our emotional responses, of course, rely on a mélange of previously held beliefs. In this case, our understanding seems right: One should abhor Vladimir Putin and feel outraged by the invasion of a sovereign nation. As Americans, we should also applaud and feel inspired by the bravery of the Ukrainian people as they defend their homeland from a tyrannic invasion. But we should be able to hold two thoughts in our heads at once. One: The invasion of Ukraine is a humanitarian catastrophe and a uniquely destabilizing event that will destroy lives both in Ukraine and in Russia. Two: So much of what we’ve seen about Ukraine — the images and videos that have inspired the public — is not real. Last week, Sophie Pinkham, an expert on Ukraine and Russia, came on the podcast I host with two of my friends. She estimated that roughly 75 percent of what’s being said about what’s happening in Ukraine is either unverified or just flat out false. I can’t help wondering what the response would have been like during the Iraq war in 2003 if we’d been addicted to social media then and our feeds were flooded with livestreamed video from Iraqis when our troops and their allies stormed through the country in search of weapons of mass destruction. Would Americans have cared as much about footage taken by brown Muslim people? Would they have been more skeptical about its veracity than they have been about footage from Ukraine? If videos of the invasion of Iraq were being posted today, would they have even been allowed on American platforms, or would they have been tagged as “disinformation” and suppressed? Or would they have been blocked by some algorithm similar to the one that blocked Palestinian videos coming out of last year’s Sheikh Jarrah conflict? These questions must be asked and discussed as the world sinks itself into conflicts that may arise from climate change, the extended wreckage of the pandemic and a new Cold War between China and the United States. The emotional power of social media videos and the fact that many people actually assign more credibility to them because they’re so raw and seemingly unfiltered give them the potential to shape reality and unreality in ways that we cannot resist or control.

2022-03-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/us/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-policy-support.html,Why Americans Might Not Rally Around Biden Over Ukraine,"Few notions are as ingrained in political punditry as the idea that foreign crises unite Americans behind their president. It’s called the “rally ’round the flag effect” and it’s been taken as fact by commentators and chased by White Houses for decades. But it’s also something of a political urban legend. While there are examples of presidents seeing a public approval boost during a crisis, there is also evidence that the improvements are minimal and fleeting — and perhaps getting less common in our hyperpolarized politics. That hasn’t kept presidents from trying. On Tuesday night, President Biden used his State of the Union address to call on Congress to stand with him to condemn the invasion of Ukraine commanded by President Vladimir Putin of Russia. “He thought he could divide us here at home,” Biden said. “Putin was wrong.” On one level, the president was right: Biden does have solid bipartisan backing for his policy of isolating Russia while backing Ukraine. Foreign policy experts of all types have praised the administration for its deft handling of European politics, which has resulted in crippling sanctions on Russian oligarchs and financial institutions, and for its use of intelligence to expose Kremlin designs on Ukraine. And though many questions about U.S. strategy remain unanswered, even Senator Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate, said on Tuesday that there was “broad support for the president for what he’s doing now.” But Democrats expecting voters in both parties to give Biden credit are likely hoping in vain. “If the crisis is just fodder for the usual partisan debate, then there’s not much chance the president will see his approval rating increase much,” said John Sides, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University. The term “rally ’round the flag effect” was coined by John Mueller, a political scientist who studied the relationship between presidents’ actions and public opinion. In a 1970 paper, Mueller argued that under certain conditions, many voters will shed their partisan allegiances during foreign policy crises and support the commander in chief. The concept became conventional wisdom in the years that followed — and seemed to be borne out during conflicts like the Persian Gulf war of 1991, when President George H.W. Bush saw his approval rating zoom up. It even inspired a movie: “Wag the Dog,” a 1997 comedy in which a cynical political operative fabricates a war in Albania to divert attention from a presidential sex scandal. The phrase “wagging the dog” has since become pundits’ shorthand for the notion that a president can distract the public from troubles back home by focusing on a conflict overseas. More recent scholarship, however, has found the rally effect to be minimal. In 1995, when scholars John R. Oneal and Anna Lillian Bryan crunched the numbers for 41 foreign policy crises between 1950 and 1985, they found that the average change in the president’s approval rating was just 1.4 percent. (Interestingly, one variable they tracked was coverage in The New York Times, and specifically whether the crisis made the front page.) Since then, American politics has gotten even more polarized — meaning that voters’ views about the president are more likely to be set and approval ratings don’t bounce around as much as they once did. Donald Trump’s approval ratings were remarkably stable, for instance, despite a presidency marked by overwhelmingly negative press coverage. During his first two years in office, Jimmy Carter’s approval ratings fluctuated by 36 percentage points. Trump’s stayed within a band of 10 percentage points. Part of what’s going on here, according to researchers who study public opinion, is that Republicans tend to stand by their own leaders, while also being predisposed to judge Democratic presidents harshly. “Republicans have always been less inclined to rally behind a Democratic president than Democrats have been to rally behind a Republican president in times of crisis,” said Matthew Baum, a professor of global communications at the Harvard Kennedy School. Baum has found that when a Republican is president during a foreign crisis, the average boost in approval rating among Democrats is nearly 8 percent. But when a Democrat is president, the rally effects are “smaller and insignificant,” he wrote in a 2002 paper. Those figures do not include George W. Bush, who experienced a 35 percentage-point boost in support after Sept. 11. “It’s a little challenging to make the comparison for specific events, since each conflict is different,” Baum said in an email. “But the differences in rally size are pretty stark.” And just because there’s bipartisan support for what the administration is doing to help Ukraine doesn’t mean Biden will get credit for it. As Julia Azari, a political scientist at Marquette University, told us, “Presidents are polarized even when issues and actions are not.” Despite McConnell’s occasional words of support, other Republican lawmakers have been deeply critical of Biden’s handling of the crisis. Those comments McConnell made? They came during a news conference in which a group of Republican senators accused the president of driving up energy prices by limiting new oil and gas leases on public lands. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming said that Biden’s policies “have enabled, emboldened Vladimir Putin to do what he has done.” He added: “It’s as if Vladimir Putin were Joe Biden’s secretary of energy.” It’s a little more complicated than that. The president has very little control over oil prices, which are set by global market forces. There is little evidence that Biden’s drilling policies have had an impact on domestic crude production, which increased by 4.4 percent in 2021. Still, with gas prices soaring and set to go higher, you can expect energy to be a major Republican talking point as the 2022 midterm elections approach. The White House has pointed to polling that shows Americans’ views on Ukraine are in sync with the president’s policies. A CBS/YouGov poll of U.S. adults, for example, found 76 percent supported economic sanctions on Russia, 65 percent favored arming Ukraine and 63 percent wanted him to send troops to protect NATO allies. But that didn’t translate into support for the president. That same poll showed that only 41 percent of Americans approved of his handling of Russia and Ukraine. Other surveys are even more negative. A Suffolk University/USA Today poll published on Monday found that only 34 percent of registered voters approved, versus 49 percent who disapproved. Worse for Biden: Asked if he is a strong leader, only 32 percent said yes, while 63 percent said no. And in a Quinnipiac University poll released on Monday, 57 percent of Americans said the administration had not been tough enough on Russia, with only 29 percent saying Biden had it about right. All of which is to say: Not only is the war in Ukraine a humanitarian tragedy — it’s no political gift to Biden. “We could see some sort of modest rally in public opinion but that would mainly be a result of Democratic voters coming back into the fold,” said Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. “I don’t think we’ll see much increase in support for Biden among Republican voters. The country is just too deeply polarized.” Shelley Luther, a Dallas salon owner who was jailed in 2020 for violating lockdown orders, lost a Texas House primary on Tuesday, showing that even within the Republican base, there are limits to the potency of Covid politics. Luther gained national attention in the spring of 2020, when she was jailed for contempt of court after reopening her hair salon in defiance of Gov. Greg Abbott’s order that nonessential businesses stay closed. Armed protesters rallied outside the salon in her defense, and national figures like Sarah Palin spoke out in support. Just two days into her seven-day sentence, she was released, thanks to Abbott himself, who retroactively revised his lockdown orders to eliminate jail time as a punishment for noncompliance. With nearly all the votes counted, Luther won 41 percent of the vote in her race against Representative Reggie Smith, according to The Associated Press. Smith has held the seat since 2019. At a recent candidate forum, Luther said she wanted to shift the range of views that were politically acceptable on the right, much as officials like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had done on the left. She called Abbott a “tyrant.” Abbott easily won his nomination, despite facing multiple challengers from the right. Is there anything you think we’re missing? Anything you want to see more of?

2022-03-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/opinion/ukraine-russia-awoke-world.html,Opinion | The Week That Awoke the World,"Over the last several years, that famous poem has been quoted countless times: “The centre cannot hold,” William Butler Yeats wrote, before adding, “The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.” People cited it so often because it was true. But it was not so true this past week. The events in Ukraine have been a moral atrocity and a political tragedy, but for people around the world, a cultural revelation. It’s not that people around the world believe new things, but many of us have been reminded what we believe, and we believe it with more fervor, with more conviction. This has been a convicting week. The Ukrainians have been our instructors and inspirers. They’ve been the ordinary men and women in the Times video lining up to get weapons to defend their homeland. They’ve been the lady telling a Russian invader to put sunflower seeds in his pocket. They’ve been the thousands of Ukrainians who had been living comfortably abroad, who surged back into the country to risk death to defend their people and way of life. We owe them such a debt. They have reminded us not only what it looks like to believe in democracy, the liberal order and national honor but also to act bravely on behalf of these things. They’ve reminded us that you can believe things with greater and lesser intensity, faintly, with words, or deeply and fervently, with a conviction in your bones. They’ve reminded us how much the events of the past few years have conspired to weaken our faith in ourselves. They’ve reminded us how the setbacks and humiliations (Donald Trump, Afghanistan, racial injustice, political dysfunction) have caused us to doubt and be passive about the gospel of democracy. But despite all our failings the gospel is still glowingly true. This has been a week of restored faith. In what exactly? Well, in the first place, in leadership. We’ve seen so many leadership failures of late, but over the past week Volodymyr Zelensky emerged as the everyman leader — the guy in the T-shirt, the Jewish comedian, the guy who didn’t flee but knew what to say: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” It wasn’t only Zelensky. Joe Biden masterly and humbly helped organize a global coalition. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany understood the moment. So did Emmanuel Macron of France and Fumio Kishida of Japan. Across governments, businesses and the arts, we were well led this week. There’s been restored faith in true patriotism. Over the past few years, we’ve seen so much sour ethnonationalism from the right, an angry and xenophobic form of patriotism. From the left we’ve seen a disdain of patriotism, from people who vaguely support abstract national ideals while showing limited gratitude toward one’s own inheritance; people who rightly focus on national crimes but while slighting national achievements. Some elites, meanwhile, have drifted into a soulless globalism, an effort to rise above nations into an ethereal multilateral stratosphere. But the Ukrainians have shown us how the right kind of patriotism is ennobling, a source of meaning and a reason to risk life. They’ve shown us that the love of a particular place, their own land and people, warts and all, can be part and parcel of a love for universal ideals, like democracy, liberalism and freedom. There’s been a restored faith in the West, in liberalism, in our community of nations. There has been so much division of late, within and between nations. But now I wake up in the morning, pick up my phone and am cheered that Sweden is providing military aid to Ukraine, and I’m awed by what the German people now support. The fact is that many democratic nations reacted to the atrocity with the same sense of resolve. The same is true at home. Of course, there are bitter partisans who use the moment to attack the left for being weak, or to accuse the right of being pro-Putin. There are always going to be people who are happy to be factually inaccurate if it will make them socially divisive. But at this point almost every member of Congress is united about our general cause. That’s because we have learned to revile that which people for centuries took for granted — that big countries would gobble up small countries, that the powerful would do what they could and that the weak would suffer what they must. This week, perhaps, we’ve come to value more highly our modern liberal ethic. There’s been a mood of democratic pessimism, as authoritarianism has spread and strutted. Academics of left and right have criticized liberalism. This week we have a clearer view of the alternative. It looks like Vladimir Putin. The creed of liberalism is getting a second wind. There’s a school of academic realists who imagine that foreign affairs is all about cold national interest, conducted by chess master strategists. But this week we saw that foreign affairs, like life, is a moral enterprise, and moral rightness is a source of social power and fighting morale. Things will likely get even more brutal for the Ukrainians. But the moral flame they fueled this week may, in the end, still burn strong.

2022-03-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/world/ukraine-russia-war-authoritarianism.html,The War in Ukraine Holds a Warning for the World Order,"The liberal world order has been on life support for a while. President Biden, in his inaugural address, called democracy “fragile.” President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said two years ago that “the liberal idea” had “outlived its purpose,” while China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has extolled the strength of an all-powerful state and, as he put it last March, “self-confidence in our system.” The multinational response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shown that the demise of the global postwar rules-based order may not be inevitable. A month ago, no one predicted that Germany would reverse decades of military hesitancy and pour 100 billion euros into its defense budget, or that Switzerland would freeze the assets of Russian oligarchs, or that YouTube, World Cup soccer and global energy companies would all cut ties to Russia. But the reappearance of war in Europe is also an omen. With toddlers sheltering in subway tunnels, and nuclear power plants under threat, it is a global air raid siren — a warning that the American-led system of internationalism needs to get itself back into gear, for the war at hand and for the struggle against authoritarianism to come. “The global system was built in the 1950s, and if you think of it as a car from those years, it is battered, out of date in some ways, and could use a good tuneup,” said James Stavridis, a retired U.S. Navy admiral and former NATO commander in Europe. “But it is still on the road, rolling along, and, ironically enough, Vladimir Putin has done more in a week to energize it than anything I can remember.” Almost universally, from leaders in Europe and Asia to current and former American officials, Ukraine is being viewed as a test for the survival of a 75-year-old idea: that liberal democracy, American military might and free trade can create the conditions for peace and global prosperity. Because the founder of that concept, the United States, continues to struggle — with partisanship, Covid and failure in distant war zones — many foreign policy leaders already see Ukraine in dire terms, as marking an official end of the American era and the start of a more contested, multipolar moment. For at least a decade, liberal democracies have been disappearing. Their numbers peaked in 2012 with 42 countries, and now there are just 34, home to only 13 percent of the world population, according to V-Dem, a nonprofit that studies governments. In many of those, including the United States, “toxic polarization” is on the rise. For Ukraine and its democratically elected leaders, the prospects for survival look especially dim. Sanctions, the preferred weapon for the anti-Putin coalition, have a long history of failing to alter the behavior of rogue states or leaders. And for all the talk of defending freedom, Mr. Biden has repeatedly promised that no American soldiers will fight for Ukraine’s right to exist, even as a million refugees have already fled and Mr. Putin seems intent on taking the entire country. Ukraine may also be just the first of several tests for the old order. Mr. Xi, the Chinese leader, said a few months ago that “reunification” with Taiwan — another democracy living in the shadow of an authoritarian neighbor — “must be fulfilled.” Mr. Biden, in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, spoke bluntly of the future risk, saying, “When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos.” He insisted that the free world was holding Mr. Putin accountable. And even some skeptics do see signs of a liberal revival. Ryan C. Crocker, a retired former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, said that after the disastrous American withdrawal from Kabul, the Biden administration had proved that the United States could still lead and gather together a strong global response. Robert Kagan, a historian whose latest book, “The Jungle Grows Back: America and Our Imperiled World,” has been widely cited during the Ukraine conflict, said he too had been pleasantly surprised by how quickly the liberal order had “snapped back into place.” “There has been a significant reconfirmation of a lot of the old lessons we learned a long time ago and forgot about,” he said. One lesson seems to be that alliances matter. But for many, the most important lesson echoes what Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman concluded about World War II: America cannot retreat into isolationism; its own prosperity depends on actively trying to keep the world’s major powers at peace. “We have become increasingly indifferent — that’s why the Putin example has been so striking,” said Mr. Kagan, who served in the U.S. State Department from 1984 to 1988. “A lot of people had a comforting and benign view of what a post-American world would look like — it would just be adjusting to other people having different opinions — so for the consequence to be war, it’s shocking to people.” “It should make them rethink their earlier assumptions about what America should be doing,” he added. Any attempt to rebuild a model of intervention, however, must deal with fraught recent history. The costly “war on terror” that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, shifted the country’s focus and undermined the world’s confidence in American intentions and competence. Invading Iraq despite global protests, seeing wars drag on for decades without much progress — it was all too much for the American public, Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview from the Libya-Tunisia border. “You have this exhaustion of dying for nothing,” she said. “For the Taliban to come back to power, and with corrupt Iraqi politics run by Iran.” The American way of the world took another hit with the 2008 global financial crisis. Wall Street and Washington, not Moscow or Beijing, created economic havoc without addressing a surge of inequality tied to globalization. Then came President Donald J. Trump, who turned all the frustration into an inward-looking campaign of grievance. In his view, the United States had become a victim rather than a beneficiary of the “rules-based order.” European nations, for Mr. Trump, were not allies but hangers-on. And while Mr. Biden has since argued that “America is back,” most of the world is still asking: For how long? Polls have consistently shown declining interest in international affairs among Americans and declining faith in the ability of democracy to deliver. Political divisions have reached levels high enough for comparisons with the Civil War. “The biggest challenge to the system is the domestic basis of American power,” said Ivo Daalder, the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and an ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under President Barack Obama. “It’s still the only global military power, it’s still the largest economy and it’s the only power that brings other countries together. The question is: Does domestic politics allow America to play that leadership role?” After four years of “America First,” “there are,” Mr. Daalder said, “justifiable doubts.” Like Mr. Putin, Mr. Xi has more than just doubts. Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said that what’s happening in Ukraine “will not change Xi’s ideological beliefs one iota.” While the resistance to the invasion may inform his calculations on Taiwan, China’s most powerful leader in decades ultimately believes that “the U.S.-led Western world is fading and authoritarianism is the future,” Mr. Storey said. “While the liberal order has rallied to Ukraine’s defense, he will see this as a blip.” To be more than that, many argue, American politics needs to heal — fast. The country’s leaders have to explain the value of engagement, as Roosevelt did before World War II, historians note, and reinvigorate both American democracy and the institutions of the international order, which have yet to significantly change or expand their capacity to deal with the challenges of China and Russia. At the same time, other democracies must also take on more of the international burden, with money, defense and convening allies. Mr. Daalder envisions a system in which the world’s 12 or 13 largest democracies share leadership, “where the U.S. is maybe first among equals but still one among equals.” Michael Fullilove, the executive director of the Lowy Institute in Sydney and the author of a book about Roosevelt, described such a grouping as an ensemble in which countries like Germany and Australia step forward for larger roles. “The beneficiaries of the liberal international order have realized they must serve in its bodyguard,” he said. Mr. Crocker was one of many who laid out the stakes in the starkest of terms. “If we emerge from Ukraine with the narrative being that a united NATO, a united Europe, were able to face down Putin,” he said, then “we move forward to deal with the inevitable challenges ahead from a position of unity and American leadership.” If Russia takes over most or all of Ukraine and Mr. Putin is still in charge of a largely stable Russian economy, he added, “welcome to the new world of disorder.”",4
2022-03-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/world/europe/lindsey-graham-putin-russia.html,Lindsey Graham Says of Putin: Someone in Russia Should ‘Take This Guy Out’,"Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called on Thursday night for the assassination of President Vladimir V. Putin, saying in a television interview as Russian forces shelled a nuclear power plant in Ukraine that somebody in Russia should “step up to the plate” and “take this guy out.” “Is there a Brutus in Russia?” Mr. Graham asked on Fox News. “Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military? The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out.” “The only people who can fix this are the Russian people,” Mr. Graham continued. “Easy to say, hard to do. Unless you want to live in darkness for the rest of your life, be isolated from the rest of the world in abject poverty and live in darkness, you need to step up to the plate.” In Russia, the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, described Mr. Graham’s statement as an instance of a “hysterical Russophobic fit” that had captured the United States. “These days, not everyone can keep a sound mind,” Mr. Peskov said. “Unfortunately, many people go mad.” An aide to Mr. Graham noted that he had made similar comments on the conservative network Newsmax, stating that “he was OK with a coup to remove Putin as well.” Mr. Graham’s comments came as senior White House aides privately worried that Mr. Putin would feel cornered by an initial avalanche of global sanctions and lash out, potentially escalating the war he started. The senator faced a swift backlash from members of his own party, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who wrote on Twitter, “This is an exceptionally bad idea.” “Use massive economic sanctions; BOYCOTT Russian oil & gas; and provide military aid so the Ukrainians can defend themselves,” Mr. Cruz said. “But we should not be calling for the assassination of heads of state.” On Capitol Hill, Mr. Graham has been unsparing in his denunciation of Mr. Putin, introducing legislation supporting the Ukrainian government’s push to charge him with war crimes at the International Criminal Court and urging President Biden to stop the importation of all Russian energy products. His comments on Thursday night were the most bellicose yet, but they were also reflective of both Mr. Graham’s hawkish nature and his tendency to speak off the cuff. After Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, announced on Thursday that she supported the bill to ban Russian oil and gas, Mr. Graham cracked, “So Nancy Pelosi is with us, which made me wonder: What am I doing?” Many Republicans had the same question for Mr. Graham after his latest comments, particularly right-wing lawmakers who have veered away from their party’s hawkish traditions and toward the “America first” approach championed by former President Donald J. Trump. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, called Mr. Graham’s remarks “irresponsible, dangerous & unhinged.” “We need leaders with calm minds & steady wisdom,” she wrote in a Twitter post. “Not blood thirsty warmongering politicians trying to tweet tough by demanding assassinations. “Americans don’t want war,” Ms. Greene added.",1
2022-03-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/05/opinion/russia-free-speech.html,Opinion | Free Speech: A Reminder From Russia of How Precious It Is,"On Friday, the Russian government blocked access to Twitter, Facebook and multiple news sites, in an effort to stop people from speaking out against the war in Ukraine. The state also shut down the pillars of the country’s independent media, including the radio station Echo of Moscow that was launched by Soviet dissidents in 1990. And on Friday, the Duma passed a law punishing anyone who spreads “false information” about the Russian military, which could include anyone calling what is taking place in Ukraine a “war,” with a possible 15 years in prison. These efforts reminded me of something that happened in my hometown, Cincinnati, three decades ago, when I first thought about what speech — and keeping it free — meant. During the ’90s, when I was a kid, the city had a Christmas season tradition of sorts. The Ku Klux Klan would erect — or attempt to erect — a 10-foot plain wooden cross on Fountain Square downtown. This (non-burning) cross bore the Bible verse John 3:16 — “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him would not perish but have everlasting life.” — and was put up in response to a menorah raised by a local synagogue. It was an effort to, as one Klansman put in 1993, “put Christ back into Christmas.” Every time, the group’s effort would result in chaos that no one in Cincinnati — with the possible exception of the Klan — wanted. In 1990, for example, hundreds of protesters attacked six robed members of the Klan with rocks and tin cans (including a two-pound can of sliced pineapple). The group was holding a rally next to the cross, guarded by helmeted police officers. One protester told an Associated Press reporter, “It’s a damn shame the city’s protecting them.” In 1992, the cross stood for four hours before being pulled down by an unidentified man. In 1993, the city tried to stop the Klan from erecting the cross. In a lawsuit, it argued that the cross itself and the words on it represented “fighting words” and were thus not protected by the First Amendment. The “fighting words” doctrine established by the Supreme Court in 1942 stipulated that the “words” in question must “inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace” by their “very utterance.” The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio responded in a preliminary injunction that the cross and the Bible verse could stand because neither fulfilled the “fighting words” requirement. As Judge Carl Rubin wrote in his final ruling on the matter in 1994, “It is a well-settled principle of First Amendment law that the government cannot regulate speech simply because some may find it offensive.” The raising of the cross and the ensuing controversies continued. Of course, most Cincinnatians didn’t find the Bible verse or the cross itself offensive. They found the Klan, the most infamous domestic terror organization in American history, offensive. As Judge Rubin wrote, “The City stresses that the sponsor of the display, the Ku Klux Klan, has historically used the cross to frighten, intimidate and denigrate certain citizens.” And the protesters worried that by permitting that cross, they were empowering the Klan, breathing life and power into an organization responsible for violence going back more than a century. I thought of these perennial eruptions again during a conversation I had with my colleagues Jay Caspian Kang and Michelle Goldberg for an upcoming episode of the podcast I host, “The Argument.” Jay mentioned that when he was growing up in Chapel Hill, N.C., the Klan would occasionally march through the center of town, and his teacher would tell the class that the group had every right to do so and that the best response was to pay them as little attention as possible. The Klan would get their march, but they wouldn’t get the attention they so desired. Jay told us that he felt like something had changed in the liberal approach to free speech since he was a kid — as if the unquestioned sanctity of it was now up for question. Liberals once defended the right of neo-Nazis to march in Skokie, Ill. Now some had reservations about defending “hate speech” or anti-vaxxers or white nationalist activists that wax rhapsodic about the Holocaust and seem to think another one would be a fine idea. As we all know, it is extremely easy to defend speech we like and speakers we support and harder to stand up for the speech we despise or the speakers who would have us cast out of the public square (or far worse). It feels pretty unnerving to defend the rights of people whose ideas are so wrong and who could end up in positions of power. After all, a year after a few Klansmen raised a cross in Cincinnati, a former Klan grand wizard, David Duke, reached a runoff election for governor of Louisiana and won nearly 40 percent of the vote. And the Covid misinformation on Joe Rogan’s podcast came in the midst of a global pandemic that has killed nearly a million Americans. And of course, many people seemingly intentionally misunderstand the concept of free speech, arguing that they should be permitted to say whatever they want without opprobrium but that their ideological or cultural opponents should be forbidden from doing so — speech for me, not for thee. I tend to think that the reason that some people on the American right have previously voiced support for Vladimir Putin is because, in their view, he would act as a bulwark against some speech: he would protect their speech while restricting the words that scare them the most, speech on L.G.B.T.Q. rights or the speech of religious minorities. If no one ever heard the speech of lesbians or bisexual people or transgender people, they seem to reason, no one would be a lesbian, or bisexual or transgender. The people whose speech I have the hardest time wanting to protect are the people who would very much like to see me in jail or dead simply for the terrifying crime of being a bisexual, biracial woman. The neo-Nazis and white nationalists I used to cover at Vox.com and the attendees at a recent white nationalist conference that attracted two sitting members of Congress are all committed to limiting the rights of the people they deem inferior. Why should I need to stand up for theirs, particularly if doing so could help them gain more power? Well, as the rabbi who fought to put a menorah on Fountain Square told The Associated Press in response to the Klan cross, “If we want to play the American game, this is the price we pay for democracy.” And personally, I agree. Permitted by a court of law to speak freely, the Klansmen did not strike fear into the hearts of Cincinnatians. They looked like idiots, their speech rendered inert and inept. That’s the beauty of freeing even the worst speech: Sometimes it can shoot itself in the foot. The speech that offends me the most often represents ideas that are the most easily contested by basic facts, or gentle questioning. So bring on the speech and the confidence to respond to it, challenge it or mock it out of hand. That’s the confidence the Russian government doesn’t have. And that’s the confidence we must re-establish within ourselves.",29
2022-03-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/05/opinion/zelensky-ukraine-trump.html,"Opinion | Zelensky and Trump: Two Performers, One Hero","WASHINGTON — History is full of strange odysseys and intersections. But it’s bizarre that two men who were both front page news in the Friday Times started on similar paths and, with a consequential encounter along the way, ended up so differently. Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky both played leaders on TV shows and then became leaders in real life. They both used social media to gain power. And they both had zany acting gigs. In 2015, Trump, who had a cameo in “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,” debated whether to play a president in “Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!” or actually run for the presidency. Zelensky starred in romantic comedies and played the president of Ukraine in a sitcom. He shimmied in a fringed, hot-pink number to win the Ukrainian version of “Dancing With the Stars,” did the voice of Paddington Bear when the “Paddington” movies were dubbed in Ukrainian, and entertained a roaring live audience by dropping his pants and providing a lewd performance of “Hava Nagila” — a nod to his Jewish heritage. But after they ascended to power, the would-be president of “Sharknado 3” and the Ukrainian voice of Paddington Bear took on very different roles. Trump became a blackguard. Zelensky donned a white hat. Trump tried to overturn American democracy. Zelensky tried to save Ukrainian democracy. Trump was always a faux tough guy who bragged about grabbing women and loved all things military except serving in it. Cadet Bone Spurs. Courage was an alien concept to this spoiled brat; he has always been a bully who let other people do the fighting for him. He sicced a mob on the Capitol, while he went back to the comfort of the White House to watch his attempted coup play out on TV and to gloat about the frightened, barricaded lawmakers and his own trapped vice president. Zelensky has stayed rooted in Kyiv to rally the morale of his brutalized country and face down Vladimir Putin and the invading Russian army. He admits he is afraid, but he doesn’t show it as danger closes in. Zelensky knows, as Putin’s “Target No. 1,” he could lose his life. The 44-year-old Ukrainian president has become a symbol of bravery. His leadership has been defined by nimble action against overwhelming odds, great one-liners like “I need ammunition, not a ride,” and modesty. As he said in his inauguration speech in 2019: “I would very much like for you to not have my portrait in your offices. No portraits! A president is not an icon, nor an idol. A president is not a portrait. Put photographs of your children there, instead. And before making any decision, look them in the eyes.” Stubbly and exhausted, operating on three hours of sleep a night, dressed in an Army-green T-shirt, he dragged his own chair into position at a news conference he held while in hiding. Trump, in a nimbus of selfishness and narcissism, inverted revered American ideals. He soiled the image of his country and reshaped it around his grievances and inadequacies. Zelensky stood up for Ukrainian ideals. He helped imbue his country with a shining, resilient image, reinforced when the world saw remarkable images of battle-ready mothers and grannies making Molotov cocktails. Trump was impeached in 2019 for withholding military aid to Ukraine (“I would like you to do us a favor, though”) until Zelensky dug up dirt on Joe Biden, Trump’s rival, and Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. As Franklin Foer wrote in The Atlantic, before that call, America had always tried to inject morality into Ukrainian politics. But Trump “polluted Ukraine with his own transactional politics.” Representative Adam Schiff and other Democratic leaders of that impeachment say people can now see how wrong Trump was to try to withhold aid to Zelensky, then in office only two months. “It hammers home how despicable an act it was to treat Ukraine as a political plaything,” Schiff told Rolling Stone. The claim by Trump and his sycophants that his relationship with Putin had kept Russia out of Ukraine is ludicrous. He was Putin’s poodle and Putin would have rolled over him; he was biding his time as Trump weakened NATO. Trump praised Putin for an act of “genius” even as the rest of the world was watching in horror as the mad Russian president prepared to order the bloody march through Ukraine and suffocated the remnants of a free press in Moscow. That was a shameful moment, as was a House committee on Wednesday producing evidence it said showed that Trump had conspired to commit fraud and obstruction by bamboozling Americans about the election and trying to flip the result. There were even some Republicans — mirabile dictu — backing away from the toxic Trump over Ukraine. In a speech to top G.O.P. donors Friday night in New Orleans, Mike Pence included the line, “There is no room in this party for apologists for Putin.” By standing up to the Evil Empire, Zelensky could earn comparisons to another performer turned pol, and that should grate on Trump as much as having his vice president turn on him. Ronald Reagan helped lift the Iron Curtain. Zelensky is trying his best to stop it from slamming down again. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-03-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/no-fly-zone-ukraine-congress.html,"Rubio, U.S. Lawmakers Are Largely Opposed to No-Fly Zone Over Ukraine","WASHINGTON — Members of Congress on Sunday emphasized what has become a widely held position on Capitol Hill: that the United States should respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by banning Russian oil imports, but not by imposing a no-fly zone over the country that could draw nuclear powers into war. Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike took that position on a variety of Sunday morning television news programs. “It makes no sense whatsoever to continue to buy oil from Russia that they use to fund this war and this murderous campaign that they’re undertaking,” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He added that there was support for supplying Ukraine with supplies and aircraft after the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made that request to Congress on Saturday. But Mr. Rubio and others said the risks of the United States imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine — as Mr. Zelensky also requested — were too great. On ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Rubio said that move would draw the United States directly into the war between Ukraine and Russia, starting a conflict between two nuclear-armed powers. “It means starting World War III,” Mr. Rubio said, adding that “people need to understand what a no-fly zone means. It’s not some rule you pass that everybody has to oblige by. It’s the willingness to shoot down the aircraft of the Russian Federation.” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, agreed on “Fox News Sunday”: “I don’t think it’s in our interest, the interest of Europe, to have the United States and Russia — the two world’s biggest, most equipped nuclear superpowers — going to war directly against each other.” Mr. Murphy said he expected Congress would pass a $10 billion emergency spending bill this week to provide more arms and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, in response to requests by Ukrainian officials for additional support. The $10 billion proposal includes $4.8 billion in additional funds for the Pentagon to cover the deployment of U.S. troops to NATO countries, increased intelligence and cybersecurity support and to replenish the weapons the Defense Department has already sent to Ukraine, such as Stinger missiles. It also includes $4.25 billion in new funding for economic and humanitarian assistance for Ukrainians, including the 1.5 million refugees who have already fled from the bombarded nation. “We need to make sure that we’re reinforcing Ukraine and providing as much lethal aid as possible,” Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said on “Fox News Sunday,” adding that the United States should also reinforce humanitarian aid, “making sure that we are able to provide for those refugees that will be flowing into Europe.” There was one notable exception to the rejection of the no-fly-zone proposal. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, said on NBC’s “Meet The Press”: “I would take nothing off the table.” “For us to hesitate, or for anyone to hesitate in the free world is wrong,” Mr. Manchin said of taking additional steps to try to deter Russian aggression. The comments came a day after Mr. Zelensky spoke with more than 300 members of Congress, imploring them to ban the importation of Russian oil and to send more jets to his country.",1
2022-03-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/world/asia/putin-ukraine-china-xi.html,Xi and Putin’s 'No Limits' Bond Leaves China Few Options on Ukraine,"On a frigid day in Beijing last month as the Winter Olympics were set to open, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, celebrated a diplomatic triumph with a banquet for his honored guest, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. They had just finalized a statement declaring their vision of a new international order with Moscow and Beijing at its core, untethered from American power. Over dinner, according to China’s official readout, they discussed “major hot-spot issues of mutual concern.” The details remain secret, but their talks were a crucial moment in the events that culminated 20 days later with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, unleashing Europe’s worst war in decades and seismic jolts in global power likely to be felt for decades. Publicly, Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin had vowed that their countries’ friendship had “no limits.” The Chinese leader also declared that there would be “no wavering” in their partnership, and he added his weight to Mr. Putin’s accusations of Western betrayal in Europe. Now it appears that Mr. Xi’s display of solidarity may have, possibly unwittingly, emboldened Mr. Putin to gamble on going to war to bring Ukraine to heel. A retracing of Beijing’s trail of decisions shows how Mr. Xi’s deep investment in a personal bond with Mr. Putin has limited China’s options and forced it into policy contortions. Before and shortly after the invasion, Beijing sounded sympathetic to Moscow’s security demands, mocking Western warnings of war and accusing the United States of goading Russia. Over the past two weeks, though, China has sought to edge slightly away from Russia. It has softened its tone, expressing grief over civilian casualties. It has cast itself as an impartial party, calling for peace talks and for the war to stop as soon as possible. The quandaries for China, and Mr. Xi, remain. “He’s damned if he did know, and damned if he didn’t,” Paul Haenle, a former director for China on the National Security Council, said of whether Mr. Xi had been aware of Russia’s plans to invade. “If he did know and he didn’t tell people, he’s complicit; if he wasn’t told by Putin, it’s an affront.” A Western intelligence report concluded that Chinese officials told their Russian counterparts in early February not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, though it was not clear whether Mr. Putin told Mr. Xi directly of any plans. Chinese officials rejected the claim that Beijing had forewarning as “pure fake news.” In any case, the invasion evidently surprised many in Beijing’s establishment, leaving officials scrambling to respond and to evacuate Chinese nationals. Even if Mr. Xi knew anything about Mr. Putin’s plan, some experts said, he perhaps expected Moscow to limit its actions to the regions in Ukraine adjoining Russia. “They did not anticipate a full-scale invasion,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, who has studied Beijing’s actions in the lead-up to the war. “You do not need to invade Ukraine to get what you want. So why bother?” she said, summarizing what she described as a broad view among Chinese officials. The implications for China extend beyond Ukraine, and even Europe. Mr. Xi’s warm embrace of Mr. Putin only a month ago advertised their ambitions to build what they call a fairer, more stable global order — one in which the United States is a lesser presence. Instead, their summit was followed by the kind of reckless, unilateral military intervention in an independent state that China has long denounced. Mr. Xi’s statement with Mr. Putin on Feb. 4 endorsed a Russian security proposal that would exclude Ukraine from joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. By opposing the expansion of NATO, China waded into tensions over how far Russia’s eastern European neighbors could forge alliances with the West. “Putin may have done this anyway, but also it was unquestionably an enabling backdrop that was provided by the joint statement, the visit and Xi’s association with all of these things,” said Andrew Small, a senior fellow with the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. The blot on Mr. Xi’s image as a statesman has come as he seeks an untroubled march to a Communist Party congress this year, where he is likely to win a groundbreaking third term as party leader. “He owns that relationship with Putin,” Mr. Haenle said. “If you’re suggesting in the Chinese system right now that it was not smart to get that close to Russia, you’re in effect criticizing the leader.” Mr. Putin’s war has already dragged China to a place it did not aim to be. For decades it sought to build ties with Russia while also keeping Ukraine close. In 1992, China was among the first countries to establish ties with a newly independent Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It turned to Ukraine as a major supplier of corn, sunflower and grapeseed oil, as well as arms technology. Over the past years, as growing numbers of Ukrainians supported joining NATO, Chinese diplomats did not raise objections with Kyiv, said Sergiy Gerasymchuk, an analyst with Ukrainian Prism, a foreign policy research organization in Kyiv. Ukraine was “trying to sit on the fence and avoid any sensitive issues with Beijing, and expected the same from China,” he said. As opinion against China hardened in many countries, Mr. Xi became preoccupied with defending his nation against what he saw as threats to its rise, especially from the United States. Relations were showing no signs of lasting improvement under the Biden administration, so Mr. Xi moved to bolster ties with Mr. Putin to blunt American policies. The two leaders shared similar world views. Both lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union. Both saw Washington as a prime instigator of any political opposition to their rule. For both leaders, their partnership was an answer to Mr. Biden’s effort to forge an “alliance of democracies.” At a video summit in December, Mr. Xi told Mr. Putin that “in its closeness and effectiveness, this relationship even exceeds an alliance,” a Kremlin aide told reporters in Moscow at the time. Yet Mr. Xi remains a more cautious leader than Mr. Putin, and he appeared hopeful that China would not be forced to choose between Russia and Ukraine. Only a month before his Olympic summit with Mr. Putin, the Chinese leader hailed 30 years of diplomatic ties with Ukraine. “I attach high importance to developing the Chinese-Ukrainian strategic partnership,” Mr. Xi said in a Jan. 4 message to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Even so, as Mr. Putin became determined to reverse Ukraine’s turn to Western security protections, Chinese officials began to echo Russian arguments. Beijing also saw a growing threat from American-led military blocs. In late January, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken called China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, to warn him about a war against Ukraine. Mr. Wang, however, urged Mr. Blinken to address Russia’s security grievances. Europe needed a new, “balanced” security organization, he said, making clear that NATO did not serve that role. Beijing had its own complaints with NATO, rooted in the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, during NATO’s war in 1999 to protect a breakaway region, Kosovo. Those suspicions deepened when NATO in 2021 began to describe China as an emerging challenge to the alliance. As Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s borders, Chinese officials kept repeating their defense of Russia’s security concerns. They also scoffed at Western intelligence warnings about Russia’s imminent invasion. Washington, not Moscow, was the warmonger, they suggested, pointing to America’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. On Feb. 23, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, accused Washington of “manufacturing panic.” The next day, Russian forces struck. While governments across the world condemned Mr. Putin, Beijing directed its criticism at the United States and its allies. It even avoided calling Mr. Putin’s actions an invasion. In recent days, though, Beijing’s language has begun to shift, reflecting a desire to avoid standing too close to Mr. Putin. Chinese officials tweaked their calls to heed Russia’s security, stressing that “any country’s legitimate security concerns should be respected.” They still did not use the word “invasion,” but have acknowledged a “conflict between Ukraine and Russia.” China has also sought to position itself as a potential mediator, though so far only in vague terms. Mr. Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, told reporters on Monday that Beijing was willing to “play a constructive role” in bringing about peace talks. China’s efforts to distance itself from Russia have come too late, said Mr. Gerasymchuk, the analyst in Kyiv. He said China would wait to see who prevailed in the war and seek to improve relations with the winner. “Many decision makers in China began to perceive relations in black and white: either you are a Chinese ally or an American one,” said Mr. Gerasymchuk, who has been spending nights in a bomb shelter. “They still want to remain sort of neutral, but they bitterly failed.” Liu Yi and Claire Fu contributed research.",22
2022-03-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/world/europe/russia-letter-z-ivan-kuliak.html,"Letter ‘Z,’ Symbol of Support for War, Spreads Across Russia","The “Z” first drew attention several weeks ago when it was painted a couple feet high on the sides of the thousands of tanks, armored personnel carriers and other military vehicles mustering along the Russian border with Ukraine. In Russia, the letter then began to pop up all over the place. There are Z stickers on the backs of cars and commercial vehicles, and one talk show pundit recently appeared wearing a T-shirt with a large white Z on it. Some corporate logos and newspaper names that contained a Z manipulated the letter to highlight it. An advertising campaign using billboards in large cities featured a large Z created out of a black and orange ribbon, the St. George ribbon, which is a symbol of the Russian military. It is not uncommon for vehicles dedicated to a military campaign to display a readily identifiable mark — U.S. Army vehicles used to repulse the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait were painted with a big white chevron, for example. To see it spread among civilians is another matter. The campaign’s ubiquity led many to conclude that it was an orchestrated Kremlin effort to drum up support for the war, not least because it resembled so many previous efforts. It came with a hashtag with echoes of past wars: “We don’t abandon our own.” (As in soldiers.) “This is definitely a state-induced meme,” said Vasily Gatov, a Russian-American media analyst based in Boston. “There are always people receptive to this kind of message.” He noted that there was a small army of propagandists paid to spread the meme on social media to give it the false appearance of popularity. The fact that some of the usual suspects lined up added to the sense of government coordination. Maria Butina was deported from the United States in 2019 after being sent to prison for working as an unregistered agent for Russia. Now a member of the State Duma, or Parliament, she posted a video of herself drawing a white Z on the lapel of her suit jacket. “Do your work, brothers,” she said in an apparent reference to the Russian troops in Ukraine. “We will always support you.” The state-run RT television network also spread the symbol. Another video online showed what looked like a youth flash mob in a factory or meeting hall, wearing black T-shirts with a Z and dancing in formation amid a sea of Russian flags. Similar videos have cropped up during previous Kremlin campaigns, the only difference being the addition of the T-shirts. Critics on social media did not miss the opportunity to point out that Hitler mobilized thousands of black-shirted supporters, as well, and some manipulated the letter Z to make it resemble the Nazi swastika. No doubt some of the displays reflected genuine support. On Saturday, for example, the Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak wore a Z on his uniform at a competition in Qatar that also included Ukrainian gymnasts. The Russian head coach and some fellow Russian gymnasts publicly defended him, even as the sport’s international governing body opened a disciplinary proceeding. The symbol has also been deployed as a threat: Anton Dolin, a prominent film critic who left Russia over his opposition to the war, posted a picture on Facebook of a giant white Z that someone had spray-painted on his apartment door, which he called an effort at intimidation. Oddly for a nationalist symbol, the Z being used is the version from the Latin alphabet. The Russian version, from the Cyrillic alphabet, is more rounded, like a 3. After weeks of speculation about what it meant, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that it came from the preposition “Za,” the first word in the Russian phrase “Za pobedu,” or “For victory.” That explanation seemed to have provoked a sharp exchange on Monday in the United Nations Security Council, where the Ukrainian ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said that the “Z” actually stood for “zveri,” which means beasts or animals in Russian. His Russian counterpart, Vasily Nebenzya, shot back that the Russians had their own opinion of who the animals were.",29
2022-03-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/us/politics/russia-ukraine-climate-oil-gas.html,Climate Hawks Join the Debate on Ukraine,"In 2010, David Roberts, an influential left-leaning journalist and blogger, coined the term “climate hawk” to refer to activists pushing for aggressive solutions to the dangers of climate change. “For better or worse,” he wrote, “more Americans respond to evocations of toughness in the face of a threat.” The label caught on — and “climate hawk” has since become a badge worn proudly by a nucleus of politically savvy climate-action advocates. And now, days into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, leading climate hawks sense that the moment is ripe to connect the war to their cause. “America is lining Putin’s pockets by buying billions of dollars of Russian oil,” Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat of Massachusetts and an architect of the Green New Deal, said in an interview. “The United States doesn’t need Russian oil any more than we need Russian caviar.” Adding to the feeling of urgency: As the war began, a United Nations climate panel issued a landmark report detailing the catastrophic impacts of global warming, which include floods, deadly heat waves and extreme water scarcity that could affect millions. “This whole crisis points out the need for us to wean ourselves and the rest of the world off fossil fuels,” Tom Steyer, a billionaire former presidential candidate and major Democratic donor, said in an interview. He added: “How many wars have we been in, in countries that have deep relationships with fossil fuels? How many times have we seen this incredible volatility related to fossil fuels?” The climate hawks are in temporary alignment with foreign policy hawks, who also worry about importing oil and gas from unstable and undemocratic parts of the world — but for different reasons. The two groups agree on cutting off Putin’s energy lifeline, but that’s about it. And it’s not clear which way the White House, with gasoline prices surging past $4 a gallon, will go. There are various ideas floating around Capitol Hill for cutting off energy imports of Russian energy, all of which got a boost on Monday when lawmakers agreed on a legislative framework to do so. What happens next is where the agreement starts to break down. To vastly oversimplify, Capitol Hill divides into two basic camps on how to replace the Russian oil. On one side is a bipartisan group led by two senators from fossil fuel-producing states: Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who have recruited Republicans and many moderate Democrats to their bill implementing the Russian cutoff. On the other side are the climate hawks: Markey, Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and many progressive Democrats in the House. Last week, Markey and Heinrich unveiled their alternate proposal for banning Russian energy imports: the SPIGOT (Severing Putin’s Immense Gains from Oil Transfers) Act. Unlike Manchin and Murkowski’s legislation, their bill requires the U.S. to replace Russian imports with renewable energy over time. Some quirkier ideas have emerged. Bill McKibben, an activist close to the administration, is calling on President Biden to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up the manufacture of heat pumps — highly energy-efficient, all-in-one heating and cooling units — and ship them to Europe. “We could peacefully punch Putin in the kidneys,” McKibben wrote in his Substack newsletter. Biden has stacked his administration with climate hawks, and has put forward ambitious policies to rein in carbon emissions and move the country toward renewable, clean energy. But Ukraine’s crisis is testing that. White House officials say that over the long run, the world needs to move past fossil fuels. But, with oil prices already touching $130 a barrel, they don’t want to further roil the markets. So, administration officials are scouring the world to replace Russia’s oil output. There are no easy choices: Iran (which is under economic sanctions), Venezuela (also under sanctions) and Saudi Arabia (which is angry with the U.S. for various reasons) have been floated as possibilities. But as he worries about gas prices, Biden also has to worry about the left. Progressives criticized him last week for saying little about climate change in his State of the Union address. The bulk of his climate agenda was blocked when Mr. Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona torpedoed the Build Back Better Act, Democrats’ social policy bill. Democrats fear that could leave young voters who turned out for Biden in 2020 demoralized in 2022. Steyer, who founded a group that mobilizes young voters around climate issues, says he is optimistic that Biden will be able to cut a deal with Congress. “Over the rest of this year, I’m expecting to see concrete actions that will support a robust climate response and give young people a reason to turn out,” he said. Even as Republicans urge Biden to stop importing Russian energy, they’re redoubling their political messaging blaming him for high gasoline prices. And they’re demanding for him to “unleash” energy production in the United States. Republicans’ arguments are hollow, experts tell us. The surge in global economic activity as the coronavirus pandemic ebbs is the main factor driving up gasoline prices, not Biden’s energy policies. Domestic production of crude oil actually increased in 2021. The limits Biden has placed on drilling on federal lands don’t affect current production. And, as the White House has pointed out, the industry is sitting on thousands of unused drilling permits. Allies of the administration note, too, that even though Russia may be a minor supplier for the U.S., it exports around 5 million barrels of crude oil a day. Because oil prices are set globally, taking all of that off the market would send prices soaring. Biden can’t just flip a switch and replace Russian oil. It takes months to ramp up domestic production, and in any case he has little say over the market decisions of private companies. “People think presidents have more control over the price of oil than they actually do,” said Samantha Gross, an energy analyst at the Brookings Institution. None of which loosens the political vise the White House finds itself in. The bank J.P. Morgan has predicted that oil prices could jump more than 30 percent — reaching as high as $185 dollars a barrel — if buyers keep shunning Russian oil, ban or no ban. And Republicans aren’t likely to cut Biden a break if and when that happens. Politically, high oil prices are a nightmare. They make it difficult for Democrats to promote their stewardship of the economy, because they must temper any boasts about the fast growth in jobs and GDP on their watch with expressions of concern for the real pinch that many Americans are feeling. Climate hawks propose a way out of this jam: Democrats should brand themselves as the party of future, not the past, they say. That means unapologetically embracing new technologies like electric vehicles while portraying oil as yesterday’s energy solution. “Instead of ‘Drill, baby, drill,’ voters should hear: ‘Plug in, baby, plug in,’” Markey said. And he rejects the advice some pundits have offered Biden: a Jimmy Carter-like call for national sacrifice at a time of crisis abroad. “We’re not calling for sacrifice; we’re calling for innovation,” he said. Tom Matzzie, a former Washington campaign director for MoveOn.org, who now runs a company that builds solar farms, suggested Biden go after the oil companies, emphasizing any ties they have to Russia and investigating “war profiteering” they might be doing. “They’re trying to take advantage of the situation in Ukraine and pretend they have a solution when they don’t,” Matzzie said, of the companies that are calling on Biden to repeal a moratorium on drilling on federal land. Others worry that high oil prices will push Americans into embracing fossil fuels at the very moment they should be shifting away from them as fast as possible. Facing the prospect of a disastrous midterms, Democrats could follow suit. “Mixing up the difference between a short- and a long-term response would be an absolute failure for us intellectually,” Steyer said. “And a horrible decision for us as a country.” HOW THEY RUN Three events this week are showing that the Trump wing of the Republican Party and its old guard still have some work to do on the whole unity thing. Tonight, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, one of the most hawkish members of Congress on national security, is due to speak at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. He’s expected to give a full-throated defense of Donald Trump’s foreign policy, just two days after the former president called for bombing Russia using U.S. jets disguised as Chinese and praised Kim Jong-un, the totalitarian North Korean leader. On Friday, Mike Pompeo is scheduled to speak at a dairy farm in Donahue, Iowa, for an event sponsored by his political action committee. The former secretary of state has been a nonstop critic of Biden’s national security moves, and a loyal Trump defender. In pre-Trump times, you might see the likes of Cotton and Pompeo at the American Enterprise Institute’s World Forum in Sea Island, Georgia, a traditional gathering of Republican foreign policy leaders that is taking place this week. Instead, A.E.I. is hosting Mitch McConnell, the Senate’s top Republican, along with one of the Biden administration’s most prominent climate hawks: Brian Deese, the president's top economic adviser.

2022-03-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/opinion/ukraine-russia-cancel-culture-putin.html,"Opinion | Putin’s Getting Sanctioned, but Russia’s Getting Canceled","This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Wednesdays. A specter is haunting Russia — the specter of cancellation. As Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine enters its third week, conscientious consumers and businesses across the West have retaliated through what can be described only as a mass cultural boycott. In Russia, Disney and Warner Bros. have paused theatrical releases, and McDonald’s, Starbucks and Coca-Cola have suspended their business operations. In the United States, liquor stores and supermarkets have pulled Russian vodka from their shelves, and the Metropolitan Opera cut ties with one of its most acclaimed sopranos after she criticized the war but refused to distance herself from Putin. And in the international arena, Eurovision, FIFA and the Paralympic Games have banned Russians from participating in this year’s competitions. Are these informal sanctions of Russian culture and business justified, and can they alter the course of the war? Or are these histrionic gestures that risk stigmatizing an entire population for the crimes of one autocrat? And what does the invocation of “cancel culture” — as both a rhetorical cliché and a material phenomenon — reveal about the way the war is being metabolized through social media? Here’s what people are saying. About a century ago, sanctions emerged on the world stage as an alternative to conventional warfare, an “economic weapon” intended to impose such a high burden on a country’s political elite that it would be forced to change its behavior. While conceived as a tool to be wielded by nation-states against other nation-states, they can also be levied — however haphazardly — by nonstate actors against other nonstate actors, as we’re now seeing. In the arts, Javier C. Hernández reports for The Times, organizations are facing pressure from donors, board members, audiences and social media users to fire Russian artists who do not distance themselves from Putin or fail to speak out with sufficient fervor against the war. Such campaigns are not unprecedented, as some commentators have pointed out. But vetting artists for their political beliefs and ties raises difficult questions. “What is the point at which cultural exchange — always a blur between being a humanizing balm and a tool of propaganda, a co-opting of music’s supposed neutrality — becomes unbearable?” asks Zachary Woolfe, The Times’s classical music editor. “What is sufficient distance from authoritarian leadership? And what is sufficient disavowal, particularly in a context when speaking up could threaten the safety of artists or their families?” For the Russian-born pianist Igor Levit, the issue isn’t so complicated. “Being a musician does not free you from being a citizen, from taking responsibility,” he commented on his Instagram account, adding the #StandWithUkraine hashtag. “Remaining vague when one man, especially the man who is the leader of your home country, starts a war against another country and by doing so also causes greatest suffering to your home country and your people is unacceptable.” Others have argued that athletics are the better cultural theater in which to wage war against Putin. “Sanctions against Putin in the sphere of games have a reach unlike any other because they leave him sweatingly exposed to the only audience he really fears or courts: the Russians in the street,” Sally Jenkins argues in The Washington Post. “His brand of shirtless belligerent patriotism — his macho nationalism — has been a long con, and it’s no small thing to knock him off medal podiums and expose the lifts in his shoes, or to rip off his judo belt and show the softening of his belly and, in turn, weaken his influence.” So far, the cultural backlash doesn’t seem to have done much to get Putin to change course — and may even be playing into his preferred narrative of Russia being victimized by the West. Yet the longer the country’s cultural isolation persists, “the more chance such measures have of breaking through the state’s narrative,” Yasmeen Serhan writes for The Atlantic. “If ordinary Russians can no longer enjoy many of the activities they love, including things as quotidian as watching their soccer teams play in international matches, seeing the latest films, and enjoying live concerts, their tolerance for their government’s isolationist policies will diminish.” When holding a country’s people responsible for the transgressions of its political system, how do you decide whom it’s fair to punish? In Russia’s case, the economist Tyler Cowen argues that you can’t. “It is simply not possible to draw fair or accurate lines of demarcation,” he writes in Bloomberg. “What about performers who may have favored Putin in the more benign times of 2003 and now are skeptical, but have family members still living in Russia? Do they have to speak out?” Another question: “Who exactly counts as Russian? Ethnic Russians? Russian citizens? Former citizens? Ethnic Russians born in Ukraine?” Tricky moral calculus aside, the utility of these informal sanctions is still very much in doubt. “None of these measures will reduce the Ukraine war’s life span by a minute, let alone a day,” Jack Shafer argues in Politico. “It would be a mistake to even proclaim these gestures symbolic because they don’t really symbolize anything meaningful about the war,” he adds, noting that only about 1.5 percent of all vodka consumed in the United States comes from Russia. At worst, critics warn that these cancellation campaigns directed at ordinary Russians could backfire. “Contrary to expectations, making life harder for the population can bind them to the rulers who blame outside interference,” writes Samuel Goldman, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University. “Even when sanctions succeed in destabilizing the regimes they target, new dictators may come to power under conditions of economic collapse and social disorder.” A potential rise in anti-Russian bigotry is another concern. Already in the West, The Washington Post reports, people of Russian descent or association are reporting a rise in discriminatory attacks, comments and refusals of service from local businesses. In New York City, some Russian restaurants have seen a decline in customers. What might a more targeted informal sanctions regime look like? In Mondoweiss, Jonathan Ofir, an Israeli-born musician, suggests looking to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which calls — controversially, to be sure — for an end to the Israeli government’s occupation of Palestinian land captured in 1967, among other demands. The B.D.S. movement claims to reject on principle boycotts based on individuals’ identities, opinions or mere affiliation with Israeli cultural institutions. Rather, only those who represent the State of Israel or participate in Israel’s efforts to “rebrand” its occupation are targeted for sanctions. Insofar as measures are being taken against Russians with no apparent ties to their leader, “the B.D.S. movement takes a softer boycott than what was applied to apartheid South Africa, and than the one now readily applied to Russia,” Ofir says. When it comes to Russian goods, though, the biggest pressure point is fossil fuels, which are not within the average person’s ability to boycott. President Biden did take the striking step on Tuesday of banning imports of Russian oil and natural gas. But Europe, which is much more dependent on Russian energy, has not yet demonstrated the same resolve, and continues to pay Russia hundreds of millions of dollars every day for fuel. As Kyle Chayka writes for The New Yorker, the invasion of Ukraine is by no means the first conflict to play out over social media. But it is perhaps the first war to be mediated primarily by content creators and live-streamers rather than by traditional news organizations. As people and institutions watch the war get spun into content in real time, they react to it as social media has trained them to: through arguably superficial displays of solidarity, entreaties to practice self-care, the reflexive lionization of political figures, Twitter clapbacks (in one case, between the Russian and German Embassies in South Africa), and a desperate desire to be — or at least appear — useful. The cancellation of Russian cultural figures and products can be understood as a successive step in this familiar choreography. “This is the globalization of moral outrage,” the Times columnist Thomas Friedman writes. “It goes from watching a short video online showing Russian soldiers firing on a Ukrainian nuclear energy facility to an employee posting that video on his or her Facebook page to a group of employees emailing their bosses or going on Slack — not to ask their C.E.O.s to do something but to tell them they have to do something or they will lose workers and customers.” This decentralized response — “a kind of global ad hoc pro-Ukraine-resistance-solidarity-movement,” as Friedman calls it — is arguably quite inspiring. But there’s a danger to it too, Friedman warns: While nation-states may choose to lift their sanctions at some point for realpolitik reasons, everyone else may not. “When Anonymous, the global hacker consortium, announced that it was attempting to take down Russian websites, that was not by government order; it just acted on its own,” he writes. “Who does Russia call to get Anonymous to accept a cease-fire?” Do you have a point of view we missed?

2022-03-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/opinion/ukraine-freedom.html,Opinion | New Rules for a New World,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is being described as the end of the post-Cold War era. This isn’t quite accurate. Since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, we’ve seen three different eras. Each of them lasted about a decade. There were the End of History years of the 1990s, when Washington thought the main task of foreign policy was to usher the world into a more democratic, free-market, rules-based order. Those priorities faded after 9/11, when no international issue mattered more to policymakers than the fight against militant Islamism. A decade later, after Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011, Barack Obama effectively called an end to the war on terror, saying it was time to “focus on nation building here at home.” This was a decade whose animating instincts were typified by two telling reactions by two presidents to two crises — both involving Ukraine. The first was Obama’s tepid response to Russia’s 2014 seizure of Crimea, after which he refused to provide Kyiv with lethal military aid on the theory that Ukraine’s future was a core Russian interest but not an American one. The second was Donald Trump’s attempted shakedown of Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019, in which he tried to hold up security assistance to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on the Biden family. In other words, Obama looked at Ukraine and asked, “What’s in it for us?” Trump looked at Ukraine and asked, “What’s in it for me?” For neither president was the question of staving off another Russian invasion, much less of encouraging Ukraine’s democratic development, a particular priority. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin looked at Ukraine and concluded: “It’s all for me.” The Russian president may have had various motives for invading Ukraine. But it would be foolish to suppose that he wasn’t also enticed — by our seeming indifference to Ukraine’s fate; by the willingness of successive American presidents to continue to do business with him even as he invaded neighbors, poisoned dissidents, hacked our networks and meddled in our elections; by Europe’s military weakness and growing reliance on Russian energy; by the coalescing of an Axis of Autocracy bent on overthrowing the American-led liberal order. All of this made Putin’s Ukraine gambit seem like a good bet — except for his failure to reckon with the courage of the Ukrainian people, their magnificent president, and his own military’s ineptitude. That courage has given the West time to regroup to help save Ukraine. It should also be an opportunity to rethink the way in which we look at foreign affairs for the next decade. We need new rules for a new world. What should they be? A few ideas: Free trade for the free world. Economic nationalism never works. De-linking the Russian economy from the rest of the world is already painful. And the only long-term hope for decoupling from China is through deeper economic integration of free and allied nations. That means the revival of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and a free-trade agreement with the European Union and another one with Britain. Help those who help themselves. If a lesson of the past 20 years is that we cannot fight for the freedom of those who won’t fight for it themselves, the lesson of Ukraine is that we can at least give those who will fight the tools so they can finish the job. One model is the deal for nuclear-powered submarines that the U.S. and Britain signed last year with Australia, which the administration needs to accelerate if it’s going to be a deterrent to China. Another model is Israel, which we arm with American jets so that we never need defend it with American troops. Parallel global institutions. China has trashed the World Trade Organization by refusing to meet its commitments. Russia trashed Interpol by using the agency to persecute political dissidents. The Biden administration may not want to exit those legacy organizations, but it can downgrade their relevance by investing in new or nascent organizations in which democracy buys membership. Be honest about energy. The world will need carbon-based fuels for decades to come. And we are better off extracting more of it in North America — including on U.S. federal land — than by asking Saudi Arabia to ramp up production or hoping to get more from Venezuela and Iran with sanctions relief. The alternative to increasing domestic oil and gas production isn’t only clean alternative energy. It’s also filthy petrostate energy. Get serious about defense. The dumbest debate in foreign-policy circles is whether China or Russia is the graver threat. The real answer is that we don’t have the luxury of choosing. But we do have the luxury of spending more on defense, which, at less than 4 percent of gross domestic product, is about half of what we spent in the prosperous 1980s. A 500-ship Navy — an increase of 200 ships — should be a national priority. Play to win. “Here’s my strategy on the Cold War,” Ronald Reagan once told his adviser Richard Allen: “We win, they lose.” He said that in 1977, when it seemed like a pipe dream. Twelve years later, it was a fact. Let’s aim for a world unhaunted by the likes of Vladimir Putin. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-03-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/us/politics/republicans-ukraine.html,"Republicans, Once Harsh Ukraine Critics, Pivot to Strong Support","WASHINGTON — In the final years of Donald J. Trump’s presidency, Republicans portrayed Ukraine as an Eastern European Wild West run by nefarious oligarchs and unlawful politicians, a bad actor that sought to tamper in American elections and channel millions of dollars to Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son. “We’re talking Ukraine,” thundered Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, in 2019, describing the country as “one of the three most corrupt countries on the planet.” The setting was a hearing for Mr. Trump’s first impeachment, over his efforts to pressure Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, into digging up political dirt on Mr. Biden. Now such voices are fading, as the bulk of the Republican Party tries to get on the right side of history amid a brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine. Republicans are among the most vociferous champions for the United States to amp up its military response, and are competing to issue the strongest expressions of solidarity with Ukraine’s leaders. Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi has taken up Mr. Zelensky’s call for a western-enforced no-fly zone. Senator Rick Scott of Florida said deploying U.S. ground troops to Ukraine should not be “off the table.” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina encouraged the assassination of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to save a nation that many in his party had previously portrayed as hardly worth saving. “What was sort of a problematic, corrupt place is now the defender of freedom,” Mr. Graham quipped about his colleagues’ changing tunes. The Republican center of gravity has undergone what Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a longtime advocate for the Ukrainian community in his state, called a “sea change,” a swing of the pendulum so sharp that some fear it could lead Congress to unwittingly widen the war. “I am extremely concerned that some of these policies being pushed from policymakers on both sides of aisle will put us on a path toward a conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia,” said Dan Caldwell, the vice president of foreign policy for Stand Together, a group funded by the conservative billionaire Charles Koch that advocates military restraint. In January, as Russia continued to amass more troops near Ukraine’s borders, Republicans including Representatives Matt Rosendale of Montana, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia weighed in to oppose the United States confronting Russia or to suggest that President Biden had malevolent intentions in his handling of the matter. So did the Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance and Donald Trump Jr. Now, even the far-right flank seems confused. On Monday, Ms. Greene used her Twitter account to both call one of the whistle-blowers in former President Trump’s first impeachment, retired Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a “clown” who was “clueless about Americans being fed up with sending our sons and daughters to die in foreign lands,” and advise, “While innocent people are being murdered in Putin’s war on Ukraine, the U.S. response is critical.” Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, gave a lengthy speech on Monday at the Ronald Reagan President Library in California, trying to explain how the party of Reagan, with its aggressive stand against the Soviet Union, could be the same as the party of Trump, which stood by as a president sided with Russia’s autocratic president against the judgment of America’s intelligence community. “Vladimir Putin must pay for this unprovoked, naked war of aggression,” he concluded. “If Joe Biden won’t make him pay, the Republican Party must.” The Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, one of the last loud voices for isolationism from the conflict, expressed frustration on Monday night with the Republican pivot, saying the party is now more pro-war than Mr. Biden. “The ground has definitely shifted,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “Remember, they not only thought of Ukraine as at the bottom of the list of friendly nations for the U.S., but they also put Putin at the top of supposedly friendly leaders.” For a distant country on the edge of what was once the Soviet empire, Ukraine has played an outsized role in American politics for a half dozen years. One of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign managers, Paul Manafort, lobbied on behalf of the country’s ousted pro-Russia leader, pressing ahead of the Republican National Convention in 2016 to shift the party’s platform away from its support for the country. Mr. Trump and his supporters tried to deflect attention from Russia’s interference on his behalf in the 2016 election by accusing Ukraine of interfering on Hillary Clinton’s behalf. Mr. Trump’s first impeachment grew out of his effort to withhold military support from Ukraine until Mr. Zelensky agreed to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, and their involvement in a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma. After every Senate Republican except Mitt Romney of Utah voted to acquit Mr. Trump, Senators Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, turned the tables and began a formal investigation into whether Mr. Biden, as vice president, had tried to pressure Ukrainian authorities to protect his son, who was on the Burisma board. Even some Republicans at the time, like Mr. Graham and Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, worried that the Johnson-Grassley investigation was being used by Russia to spread disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. The inquiry ultimately found no evidence of wrongdoing. Now, that investigation is a distant memory, and Republicans are working to explain their stark change in perspective. “Corruption’s with politicians most of the time, or with big business people,” Mr. Grassley said on Tuesday. “In this case, you’ve got children being killed by bombs. There’s no connection.” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and another longtime defender of Ukraine, noted that for much of the Trump administration, Senate Republicans quietly bolstered Ukraine’s defenses and backed Mr. Zelensky, even as they remained silent on Mr. Trump’s undermining of the Zelensky government. Mr. Trump was withholding lethal military aid that Congress had provided to Ukraine with broad bipartisan support. “I wish they would have made clear that there should be consequences to a president who uses Ukraine as a political chess piece,” he said. “There’s been a subset of Republicans that are willing to use Ukraine as a political piece in whatever narrative they’re trying to spin to win elections.” “But,” he added, “that’s a subset of Republicans, not necessarily representative of the broader caucus.” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, resurrected talking points from the first Trump impeachment on Tuesday, insisting misleadingly that it was Mr. Biden who had withheld aid, while Mr. Trump had given anti-tank weapons to Ukraine after the Obama administration had refused. (In 2016, Mr. Biden, then the vice president, threatened to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a corrupt prosecutor was fired, in line with a broader international effort to oust that official, but did not ultimately hold back any resources.) During a now-infamous 2019 phone call that Mr. Trump had with his Ukrainian counterpart, Mr. Zelensky had raised purchasing those anti-tank missiles when Mr. Trump interjected, “I would like you to do us a favor though,” before launching into a series of politically charged requests. “President Trump stood with President Zelensky and in fact, the two of them had a really good relationship,” Mr. Scalise said. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, did not try to explain away the inconsistencies. “There’s a lot of things that happened in the past, none of which I think it makes a lot of sense to relitigate,” he said. “I just think we have to play the hand we’re dealt and do everything we can right now to try and stop this thing, and that means getting all the aid we can to the Ukrainian people to fight the good fight.” Annie Karni contributed reporting.",1
2022-03-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/opinion/ukraine-russia-invasion-west.html,Opinion | They Predicted the Ukraine War. But Did They Still Get It Wrong?,"It’s a curious feature of Western debate since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that a school of thought that predicted some version of this conflict has been depicted as discredited by the partial fulfillment of its prophecies. From the 1990s to the 2010s, from George Kennan’s opposition to NATO expansion to John Mearsheimer’s critique of American involvement in Ukraine, thinkers associated with foreign policy realism — the school known for its cold-eyed expectation of great power conflict, its doubts about idealistic visions of world order — argued that the attempt to integrate Russia’s borderlands into Western institutions and alliances was poisoning relations with Moscow, making great-power conflict more likely, and exposing nations like Ukraine to disastrous risks. “The West is leading Ukraine down the primrose path,” Mearsheimer averred in 2015, “and the end result is that Ukraine is going to get wrecked.” But now that Ukraine is, in fact, being wrecked by a Russian invasion, there’s a widespread view that his realist worldview lies in ruins too — that Mearsheimer has “lost his reputation and credibility” (to quote the Portuguese thinker Bruno Maçães) and that the realist conception of nations as “pieces in a game of Risk” with “eternal interests or permanent geopolitical orientations, fixed motivations or predictable goals” (to quote Anne Applebaum of The Atlantic) should be discarded on the evidence of Vladimir Putin’s invasion and the Ukrainian response. The larger critique of realism that Applebaum and Maçães are speaking for goes something like this: Yes, realists like Mearsheimer predicted some kind of conflict over Ukraine. But realism’s predictions still did not describe reality, for three reasons. First, the predictions imagined a defensive logic to Russian strategic conduct, oriented around the protection of a sphere of influence, a fear of encirclement by NATO. But the decision to invade seems to have been motivated more by Putin’s professed and very personal desire to restore a mystical vision of greater Russia — a grand ideological idea that the mere Western pledge not to admit Ukraine to NATO was unlikely to appease. Second, the realist predictions underestimated the agency and strength of Ukrainians themselves, treating Russia’s near abroad as a landscape where only great-power force projection really mattered, ignoring Ukraine’s potential capacity — now demonstrated on the battlefield — to resist Russia and rally global support even without direct military support from the United States or NATO. Finally, the realist predictions drained the moral dimension out of global politics, effectively legitimizing imperialist appetites and “blaming the victim,” as it were, when the moral responsibility for aggression ultimately rests with the aggressor, not with nations merely seeking self-determination or mutual defense. As someone who considers himself a realist (to the extent that it makes sense for a newspaper columnist to claim such affinities), I think part of this critique has bite. For instance, my sense is that because today’s realist thinkers mostly operate within the liberal West and define themselves against its pieties — especially the globalist utopianism that had so much purchase in the post-Cold War era — there is a constant temptation to assume that nonliberal regimes must be more rational actors, more realist in their practices and aims, than the naïve idealists in America or Europe. And thus when a crisis comes, it must be the unrealism of the West that’s primarily, even essentially, at fault. You can see this temptation at work in the interview Mearsheimer gave to Isaac Chotiner of The New Yorker, published soon after the Russian invasion began. On the one hand the interview offers a perspicacious realist critique of how idealism led America astray in the George W. Bush era, via a naïve theory of how aggressive war might democratize in the Middle East. But then when it comes to Putin’s aggressive war, Mearsheimer seems to assume that the Russian president thinks like him, the realist, rather than like the utopian politicians of the West. Putin, he says, “understands that he cannot conquer Ukraine and integrate it into a greater Russia or into a reincarnation of the former Soviet Union.” And if the United States only worked harder “to create friendly relations” with Moscow, Mearsheimer argues, there could be a tacit American-Russian “balancing coalition” against the rising power of China. But why should Putin necessarily be immune from the hubris and delusions of Western leaders? Why should we assume that he doesn’t dream of reintegrating Ukraine and Belarus into a greater Russia? Why should we take for granted that the right diplomatic strategy will bring him into an American coalition against China, when he might instead be committed to a sweeping ideological vision of Eurasian power aligned against the decadent West? Why should we assume, in other words, that structural and schematic explanations of Putin’s war are more important than personal and ideological explanations? After all, as the historian Adam Tooze points out, it appears that very few members of the Russian foreign policy elite — all presumably opponents of NATO expansion, all “devotees to Russia’s future as a great power” — actually believed that Putin would invade. And if so many participants in Putin’s regime, all good servants of the national interest as realists define it, wouldn’t have made his fateful choice, then did realist premises actually predict the war itself? Just as important, did they predict the way the war has played out so far? I myself did not: My assumption was that Ukraine might mount a strong resistance in the western part of its territory, but that Russia would sweep pretty easily to the Dnieper and probably put Volodymyr Zelensky’s government to flight. (Some version of this assumption was shared by U.S. intelligence, which was predicting the quick fall of Kyiv two days into the war.) After almost two weeks of stalled-out offensives and mounting Russian casualties, that faulty assumption does look a bit like a Risk-board view of the world, where all that matters is positioning and pieces, not patriotism, morale, leadership and luck. And there are a lot of ways that this kind of Risk-board mentality can deceive. Flash back a few decades, for instance, to the late Cold War, and a crude realist analysis might have insisted that Poland would always be in some kind of deep thrall to Russia — because it had so often been dominated by Moscow, its geography left it so open to invasion from the east, and so on — and that it was strategic folly to imagine otherwise. But Polish leadership and patriotism, Soviet weakness and unexpected historical events all contrived to change that calculus, so that today Poland’s strategic independence and Western alignment, while hardly invulnerable, both look relatively secure. Is it unrealistic for Kyiv to aspire to what Warsaw has gained? Right now I would still say yes. But is it impossible, in the way that some realist thinking tends to suggest — as though some law of physics binds Ukraine to Russia? No: I think anyone watching this war so far, watching both the struggles of the Russian military and the solidifying of a Ukrainian national consciousness, would have to give more credit to long-term Ukrainian ambitions, and a little less to the inevitability of Russian regional dominance. So those are two places where realist theory, or at least certain intellectual temptations associated with realism, has suffered from its contact with the reality of war so far. But now let me say something in realism’s defense. What we have learned this winter is that aggressive Russian power is weaker, and united Western power stronger, than a lot of prewar analysis assumed — meaning that American decline and European decadence are not so far advanced as it has sometimes lately seemed. But look at the global response to the war in Ukraine — the tacit support for Russia from Beijing, the neutrality of India, the cautious, self-interested reactions of the Gulf States — and you still see the landscape whose emergence probably encouraged Putin to make his gamble: a world where American hegemony is fading, where new great powers and “civilization-states” are bent on pursuing their own interests, and where 1990s-era dreams of moral universalism and liberal consensus are giving way to hard realities of cultural difference, moral relativism and post-liberal political competition. Indeed, even the rallying of Europe against Russia, the talk of rearmament and energy independence, fits this mold, because it represents a dawning recognition of continental interest as much as a stirring of cosmopolitan idealism. Yes, the inspirational example of Zelensky matters, but the fundamental reality is that under conditions of threat and competition, Europe is cutting short its holiday from history and beginning to behave like a great power in its own right — just as realist theory would predict. And if those threatening and competitive conditions are somewhat more favorable to the West than it appeared three weeks ago, they are still fundamentally hostile to the kind of crusading liberalism that was so powerful in the Clinton and Bush presidencies and lingered in the Obama years. What we have gained so far from Russia’s stumbles is the chance at a more favorable balance of power in a multipolar world, and that’s a very good thing. But the war is far from over, and the most plausible “good” outcome is still a realist’s peace, not an idealist’s triumph — one that will still probably leave Putin in power, with Crimea and the Donbas in his hands, and Russia more integrated with (and subordinate to) our rivals in Beijing. Are we allowed to hope for a better outcome, where Russians rise up, democratic revolution flowers and (in the poetry of the 1990s) “hope and history rhyme”? Certainly: A realism that cannot allow for idealistic possibilities is itself unreal. But in a conflict with a nuclear power, fought on its own borderlands, to seek that ideal outcome as a primary goal — to pursue total victory and regime change rather than provisional stability — is to court disasters worse than the ones that have befallen us in any recent war. And if realism didn’t anticipate everything about the current situation, it still has this fundamental insight to offer: The revolutionary moments in history are also the exceptional ones, and the most important task of statesmen is to prevent moments of great crisis from yielding tragedies too terrible to bear.

2022-03-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/opinion/ukrainian-russian.html,Opinion | Ukrainian Isn’t ‘Little Russian’ and Black English Isn’t Broken,"It was long ago common for Russians to regard Ukrainian as just a dialect of Russian. “Little Russian,” it was called. Writing for The Conversation this week, Florida International University’s Phillip Carter said, “If you ask some Russian nationalists, Ukrainian isn’t a language at all,” noting that in the 1863 Valuev Circular, Pyotr Valuev, Russia’s interior minister, decreed that a separate Ukrainian language did not exist. Ukrainian is indeed closely related to Russian — they both use a Cyrillic alphabet and have similar grammatical patterns — but Russian it is not. Through the auspices of my own nerdish obsession with language and opportunities to practice within a personal relationship, on a good day I can grasp maybe about half of what Russians are saying to each other in conversation if the topic isn’t too sophisticated. But years ago, when I moved to a neighborhood in Jersey City, I found that I couldn’t catch a single word of what my “Russian” neighbors were saying until it occurred to me that they weren’t speaking Russian at all. It was, rather, the distinct language Ukrainian. That Ukrainian was viewed, for so long, as just a minor variation on Russian was an erasure of a way of speaking and writing with centuries of history. And its story is not unique: In the 2017 anthology “Standardizing Minority Languages,” Diana M. J. Camps describes how, after the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages recognized Limburgish as a language, rather than a dialect of Dutch, in the late 1990s, the decision drew a letter of “disapproval” from the general secretary of the Dutch Language Union. Elfdalian, a language of its own under any neutral analysis, retains the three genders and other characteristics of Old Norse. But as Andrew Warner reported for Language Magazine last year, “the Swedish government only recognizes Elfdalian as a dialect of Swedish.” The world’s standard languages offer an impoverished picture of the global diversity of languages, analogous to seeing a group of icebergs from the air unaware of the vast masses of further frozen marvel beneath the water. Much of what linguists do is document the true range of languages in the world, including revealing the uniqueness of what traditionally have been dismissed as mere dialects. This mission becomes especially urgent when it comes to speech varieties with origins in colonialism and imperialism, created by subordinated, often nonwhite people under various conditions of forced labor or social isolation. In many cases, under conditions like these, adults (as opposed to children, who start learning a language from birth) learned additional languages quickly and without formal instruction, and filled out what they learned with aspects of their native languages, and a good bit of sheer creativity, to fashion something brand-new: creole languages, as linguists call them. These new ways of speaking usually discarded much of the older language’s random material (which any language accretes over time) that is harder for adults to learn and not necessary to communication, anyway. A creole language doesn’t present you with long lists of conjugational endings or randomly assign genders to inanimate objects because many languages worldwide do not, and a language need not. But even when a language doesn’t do these things, it still has a great many rules to pick up, its own grammar, tens of thousands of words and specific ways that sounds are shaped and sentences are intoned. In other words, it’s full human language. Yet this (rather efficient) shedding of the bric-a-brac, plus the creole’s being spoken by subaltern people, has encouraged a sense of it as a mere “broken” version of an older language. It often distracts even the speakers of these varieties themselves. While there has been, of late, a movement advocating recognition of Jamaican Patois as an official language, experts on the variety are perpetually frustrated by a general misimpression, especially beyond the academy and the arts, that Patois is just broken English, a bad habit. But one way we know that languages like this are indeed languages is that you can write a detailed grammatical description of each of them, full of complex rules (and exceptions) mapping out how to pronounce words, add tense to verbs, put sentences together, convey nuance — just as in grammatical descriptions of languages such as Ukrainian that aren’t creoles but have suffered similar disrespect. This brings to my mind Black English. It is a dialect of English rather than a separate language — while Standard English speakers may miss some of it when spoken rapidly, for the most part, they readily comprehend Black English. But traditionally, it has been seen as English gone wrong, just as Jamaican Patois has. The differences between Black English and Standard English are due in large part to the fact that it formed under circumstances like the ones that produced many creoles. Adult learners had a lot to do with its creation, and as such, it let go of some of Standard English’s unneeded bells and whistles, the absence of which is often presented in a way that inadvertently oversimplifies, even diminishes, Black English. For instance, in various sources providing guidance for teaching reading to kids who speak Black English at home, you encounter the same stock examples showing how Black English relaxes standard English rules: You’ll see the comparison “col’” vs. “cold” show up in more than one place to explain that for some words, the final consonant sound is dropped. You’ll see a basic explanation that the verb “to be” is often superfluous — “she my sister” instead of “she is my sister” and so on. These descriptions are well-meaning and technically correct. But often, in the way they’re presented, it’s hard not to hear or read them as if they’re describing what a toy piano lacks that a Bösendorfer has while insisting that Rachmaninoff will sound just as good on either one. With some of these sources, I’m surprised anyone comes away thinking of Black English as the equal of Standard English. More likely, they’ll come away with the impression that Black English is a kind of “Little Russian.” Making the case for proper recognition of Black English requires a heavier lift, more like the comprehensive efforts of advocates of Limburgish and Elfdalian — who see themselves as preserving a heritage — and less like “Fun with Dick and Jane.” Merely observing that it’s grammatically correct to chuck the verb “to be” is inadequate. A good starting point is Lisa J. Green’s “African American English: A Linguistic Introduction,” a useful primer on Black English grammar that has been available for 20 years now and covers it the way we expect a speech variety to be covered, addressing verbs, the sound system and so on, rather than just listing Standard English things you can get away with not doing. Then there’s this other book that includes a chapter on the aspects of Black English that are more complicated than their equivalents in Standard English: You’ve probably heard the phrases “They be frontin’” and “What had happened was …” but did you think of them as an explicit marking of habituality and a special marking of narrative tense? There is a great deal of linguistic analysis of Black English out there in academic sources, addressing discrete issues one at a time, the way academic work often does. For instance, as I wrote in November, in Black English the verb “to come” can be used to express disapproval. That’s a fascinating discussion, but it’s hard to go from that to getting a grasp on the big picture because a stand-alone observation doesn’t tell the story of Black English. I hope that specialists on Black English will one day embark on a project to produce an obsessive grammatical deep-dive, some hundreds of pages worth, incorporating all of the important findings from the past, say, 50 years into a single volume, of a weight you could use as a doorstop, throw on a desktop and savor a window-rattling thump or present to a body like the Académie Française — if English had one. Black English is no “Little English.” In fact, people who speak both Black English and Standard English speak, all together, a larger English. As a brand name, “Larger English” doesn’t really grab you — it’s not an elegant word or phrase, like “Patois” or “Old Norse.” But as a concept it’s vital, and as real as the knowledge that Ukrainian is not Russian.

2022-03-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/opinion/nato-russia-the-west-ukraine.html,Opinion | Putin Wants a Clash of Civilizations. Is ‘The West’ Falling for It?,"BERLIN — Amid the point-blank horror of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the expanding war zone in Europe seems to have become a comfort zone for much of America’s political establishment. In his State of the Union address, President Biden declared that in the face of Vladimir Putin’s aggression, “we see a more unified Europe, a more unified West.” He is correct. Polish nationalists and European Union bureaucrats are sudden brothers in arms. Back at home, Republicans and Democrats have put aside differences on climate change and voting rights for an enemy who appears to have emerged from Cold War central casting: An evil empire is again on the march in Europe. Russia’s invasion has also provided the geopolitical equivalent of CPR for NATO. Washington’s perennial requests that Europeans pay their share for the security organization that defends them has been met with an unprecedented vote in Germany to increase its country’s military budget and its contribution to the alliance. Turkey — for years a rogue member of NATO that bought arms from and forged tactical alliances with Mr. Putin — has returned to the fold as a member in good standing, having supplied the Bayraktar drones that have reportedly frustrated Russia’s forces, and closed the Bosporus and the Dardanelles Straits to war ships. The unification in Europe that Mr. Biden speaks of is certainly real, but in a cruel paradox, European cohesion appears achievable only by further binding itself to the mast of American power and prerogatives. The idea of a geopolitically autonomous Europe acting independently of the United States — a vision historically dear to the French — is rapidly becoming unutterable. Although the fact sometimes fails to register in Washington, Europeans live in Europe and assess their threats differently from their American security providers, who are 5,000 miles from Moscow. The more Europe and America conflate their security interests, the less Europe can develop its own place in the world and play the mediator between the United States and rival powers. But the greater problem is that “the West,” unified and committed to fighting authoritarianism as it claims to be, is itself showing signs of sharing Mr. Putin’s highly confected logic of civilizational identity and conflict. The result may be an escalatory contest in which each adversary dares the other to believe that its inflated, civilizational identity is — existentially — on the line. That’s because Mr. Putin’s aggression has also revived another idea that was struggling of late: Western civilization. In a notable speech in Poland in 2017, Donald Trump tried hard to revive the idea of the defense of Western civilization, but for Western liberals they were more hollow words from a man who questioned NATO’s existence. Now talk of the West is back, and its accompanying terms, “the free world” and “Western civilization,” have been called up for active duty. One of the striking things about Western civilization is that as an idea it is not particularly old. It came to the fore during World War I, when the fight against Germany and its allies — the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires — was conceived by Anglophone liberals as a war of Western civilization against Eastern despotism. John Maynard Keynes, a cosmopolitan liberal, was convinced there was a civilizational gulf even between Germans and Anglo-Saxons, while the Russians, though allied with the West, were well beyond the pale of Western modernity. In the wake of World War I, courses on Western civilization began to be taught at elite American universities. By the onset of the Cold War, the term “free world” supplanted “the West” because American power demanded a more globally inclusive banner that could rally South Vietnamese, Indonesians and others in the war on Communist “slave societies.” After the Cold War, however, conservative American thinkers, such as Samuel Huntington, revived the idea of Western civilization as a way of dramatizing how a set of values was now under siege from new threats: migrants, terrorists and moral relativists. The end of the Cold War was supposed to dissolve the East-West division. No one assumed this more than Mr. Putin himself, who was once keen to join the club of the West. When he first came to power at the turn of the century, he played with the idea of Russia joining NATO, which itself was miraculously not rendered obsolete by the disappearance of its raison d’être, the Soviet Union. “When are you going to invite us to join NATO?” Mr. Putin reportedly asked the alliance’s secretary general, George Robertson, in 2000. When Mr. Robertson explained that the club had an application process, Mr. Putin rebuffed him: “Well, we’re not standing in line with a lot of countries that don’t matter.” It was still imaginable in that period that the European Union, too, could one day include Russia. At the end of the Cold War, President François Mitterrand of France even floated the idea of a new organization — a European Confederation — that would pointedly include Soviet Russia, but not te United States. During his first years in power, Mr. Putin was viewed positively by Western politicians and journalists. Thomas L. Friedman of The Times advised his readers to “keep rootin’ for Putin” in 2001, while Madeleine Albright called him a “can-do person,” and Bill Clinton deemed him someone “the United States can do business with.” Mr. Clinton was perhaps more correct than he knew. The transactional attitude he identified appeared to be the key to understanding Russia’s president. Mr. Putin had inherited a very particular vision of what the West actually was. For him, it was, according to Gleb Pavlovsky, a former close aide, synonymous with the liberal capitalist order, which he understood in terms of Soviet caricature: It meant tolerating oligarchs, privatizing state industries, paying and accepting bribes, hollowing out state capacity and having some semblance of power-sharing. Mr. Putin thought his predecessors Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin had failed because they failed to understand this. Mr. Putin himself acted like a savvy applicant to the West in many respects. He gamely signed on to the “global war on terror,” later allowing the United States to use his bases for the war in Afghanistan, and extinguished a “terrorist” insurgency at home. Since coming to power, Mr. Putin has also made Moscow into a paragon of fiscal rectitude, and, according to the former aide, he explored the idea of installing an American-style two-party system in Russia. But as the economy Mr. Putin presided over threatened to crash in a state-stripping bonanza, he tried to shore up the state sector and turned to increasingly authoritarian measures at home. As former Warsaw Pact countries welcomed NATO expansion, he shifted to a more civilizational understanding of Russia’s place in the world, one based on “Eastern” values: the Orthodox Church, patriarchal chauvinism, anti-homosexuality edicts, as well as a notion of a greater ethnic Russian identity whose ancient wellspring is inconveniently Kyiv, Ukraine. Protesters such as Pussy Riot and others who struck directly at this neocivilizational image came in for swift retribution. Mr. Putin’s turn reflected a broader phenomenon of authoritarian-led liberalizing economies trying to fill an empty ideological space that seemed poised to be filled by Western idolatry. In China, too, in the late 2000s, there was a turn to a civilizational understanding in Beijing, where dutiful readers of Mr. Huntington have spread notions of Chinese civilization in the forms of global Confucius Institutes or a program for “cultural self-confidence,” and which President Xi Jinping today expresses in his elliptical “thought.” Turkey, too, under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has pushed a vision of a neo-Ottoman sphere stretching from North Africa to Central Asia, which is a direct repudiation of Ataturk’s more bounded vision of Turkish nationalism. More recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India has revived ideas about Hindu supremacy, glorifying his nation’s ancient past — Hindustan is his Kyivan Rus — and using it as a bludgeon against his opponents. The turn to civilizational imagining provides a useful lever for ruling elites who want to suppress other forms of solidarity, whether class, regional or ecologically based, and to restrict the attractions of cosmopolitanism for their economic elites. For all the talk about how Ukraine is — despite whatever losses on the battlefield — winning the P.R. war, there is a sense in which Mr. Putin has already won at another level of framing the conflict. The more we hear about the resolve of the West, the more the values of a liberal international order appear like the provincial set of principles of a particular people, in a particular place. Of the 10 most-populous countries in the world, only one — the United States — supports major economic sanctions against Russia. Indonesia, Nigeria, India and Brazil have all condemned the Russian invasion, but they do not seem prepared to follow the West in its preferred countermeasures. Nor do non-Western states appear to welcome the kind of economic disruptions that will result from, as Senator Rob Portman phrased it, “putting a noose on the Putin economy.” North Africa and the Middle East rely on Russia for basics from fertilizer to wheat; Central Asian populations rely on its remittances. Major disruptions to these economic networks seem unlikely to relieve Ukrainian suffering. Although they have been remarkably effective at starving Iraqi, Iranian and now Afghan children while satisfying the American appetite for moral aggrandizement, modern economic sanctions have rarely curbed any regime’s behavior. The lack of enthusiasm around the world for the West training its economic weapons on Russia indicates that the rest of the world is concerned not only about wider economic immiseration but also about the global escalation of a conflict between two “civilizations” that share the preponderance of the world’s nuclear weapons between them. Mr. Putin himself came to power atop the rubble of Russia’s 1990s economic chaos. It would be rash to think that out of the new economic chaos inflicted, a phoenix to the liking of the West will rise.

2022-03-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/us/politics/senate-spending-bill-approved.html,"Congress Clears $1.5 Trillion Spending Bill, Including Ukraine Aid","WASHINGTON — Congress cleared the first major federal spending legislation of President Biden’s administration on Thursday, approving a $1.5 trillion measure with substantial increases for domestic and national security programs, along with $13.6 billion in emergency aid for Ukraine as it battles Russia’s invasion. The Senate approved the more than 2,700-page measure by a vote of 68 to 31 less than two days after it was finalized and pushed through the House, a rapid timetable that reflected strong bipartisan support for assisting Ukraine and a sense of urgency to avert a government shutdown within days. The bill, which funds the government through September, includes generous spending on domestic programs long prioritized by Democrats and military investments championed by Republicans. Mr. Biden was expected to quickly sign the measure, which marked the first time since he took office and Democrats won unified control of Congress that they have been able to enact a spending bill that reflects their priorities, including investing in climate resilience, public assistance programs and unlocking aid for projects contained in the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law. In remarks on the Senate floor, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, called it “the strongest, boldest and most significant government funding package we’ve seen in a very long time.” But to clear the way for passage, Democrats had to drop some priorities, most notably a White House request for more pandemic aid. Republicans objected to spending any new federal money on the coronavirus response, prompting Democrats first to whittle down the size of that package, and then to claw back funding from existing aid programs, including money for state governments, to pay for it. But that strategy infuriated rank-and-file Democrats and governors in both parties, who balked at yanking promised state assistance, and leaders were forced to strip the aid from the package. They vowed to try again to pass it in the coming days, but Republican support was unclear, leaving in doubt the fate of the administration’s new pandemic plan. “The bipartisan funding bill proves once more that members of both parties can come together to deliver results for the American people,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. But, she added, “we continue to call on Congress to provide the funds urgently needed to prevent severe disruptions to our Covid response.” Republicans claimed credit for prodding Democrats to accept a $42 billion increase in military spending, bringing the total this year to $782 billion. The negotiations, said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, “put us Republicans in the surreal position of having to push a commander in chief’s party into giving his own commanders the funding they need.” “But over many Democrats’ objections, Republicans made sure this deal gets the job done for our armed forces,” he said. Democrats hailed the $46 billion increase they secured for domestic programs, calling the $730 billion total the largest investment in four years. “This bill invests in future prosperity, in our health, and reduces everyday costs for millions of Americans, such as child care, a college education, and heating and cooling costs,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who leads the Appropriations Committee. The last-minute scuffles reflected the arduous negotiations over the package, which dragged out more than five months past the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year that it is supposed to fund. To secure Republican support, Democrats agreed to go above the administration’s request for Pentagon spending and maintain a series of longstanding restrictions on federal money that they had hoped to remove, including the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions. The package provides $145 billion to invest in new aircraft, ships and other vehicles, including 13 new Navy vessels, a dozen F/A-18 Super Hornets and 85 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. It also provides a 2.7 percent pay raise for all 2.1 million uniformed service members as well as the approximately 750,000 civilian employees in the Defense Department. Even without the emergency aid package, Democrats secured additional funds for pandemic preparedness. That includes $745 million, an increase of $148 million, for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and $845 million, an increase of $140 million, for the Strategic National Stockpile, an emergency medical reserve intended to guard against infectious disease and bioterrorism threats. Democrats also won increases for maternal and child health programs, tribal programs, public education and programs addressing mental health crises. And Congress agreed to direct millions of dollars toward its own employees and support of the Capitol complex. The U.S. Capitol Police will receive $602.5 million, an increase of $87 million, to help expand its ranks after the Jan. 6 riot, while House congressional offices will see their budgets expand 21 percent, the largest increase since 1996, to try to stem the drain of institutional knowledge and prevent staff from seeking better pay off Capitol Hill. Because the package is one of the few must-pass bills remaining in the legislative session, lawmakers seized on the opportunity to attach an array of additional priorities. Most notably, the bill includes a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, a law aimed at preventing domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault that lapsed in 2019. Mr. Biden helped create the law as a senator in 1994, and a bipartisan group of senators had recently unveiled a deal on an expanded version. The legislation also includes $1 billion in funding for Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, which had been held up in the Senate because of objections from Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. And it would close a loophole to ensure that makers of flavored e-cigarettes can no longer sidestep the Food and Drug Administration’s ability to regulate products derived from tobacco. To push the package through the Senate, lawmakers had to navigate a series of objections from conservative Republicans, who complained that they had little time to examine the legislation and pushed to prioritize the emergency aid to Ukraine. “It’s hard to express my anger and frustration,” said Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, as Democrats blocked his effort to pass the emergency aid for Ukraine without the $1.5 trillion to fund the government. “What in the hell are we doing here?” Like other budget hawks, Mr. Scott also derided the return of earmarks, which allow lawmakers in both parties to direct money toward projects in their states or districts. But lawmakers rejected an amendment, offered by Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, that would have stripped those projects, now rebranded with stricter guardrails, from the package. “That’s what this is about — politics,” said Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, defending the package. He warned that Mr. Scott was risking a shutdown by seeking to change the spending measure. “You can be unhappy with the legislation,” he added, “but the fact of the matter is, it has been negotiated over the last year by Democrats and Republicans.” Before passing the sprawling measure, lawmakers also voted down additional Republican amendments, including a measure to prevent funding from going toward coronavirus vaccine mandates and an amendment providing disaster relief for Louisiana for recovery for hurricane damage. Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, instead called for a separate disaster aid bill to be passed in the future. Any changes to the spending package would have forced another House vote and risked a government shutdown. Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.",1
2022-03-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/opinion/germany-ukraine-invasion.html,Opinion | ‘We Live in a Different World Now’: Dispatch From a Changed Germany,"BERLIN — Nils Schmid, a member of Germany’s Parliament and a foreign policy spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, was explaining to me what a minor role the military plays in his country’s politics. “The average Bundestag member does not have this normal contact with the military he has with almost every other layer of society,” Schmid said, referring to members of Parliament. Germany may be a major arms exporter, but in terms of total German manufacturing, he said, “the arms industry is not really relevant,” and representatives don’t cater to it. There is a “huge distance, vis-à-vis all things military, in German society,” he said. That could soon change. Shortly after Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Germany’s Social Democratic chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced a radical shift in his country’s national security stance. Germany, he said, will arm Ukraine, ending its policy of not sending lethal weapons to conflict zones. It will ramp up military spending to more than 2 percent of its gross domestic product. “It is clear that we must invest much more in the security of our country,” he said. Schmid described the message German politicians now need to convey to the public. They must explain, he said, “that the military is part of the state and should be equipped accordingly,” just like schools and universities. For an American, this challenge — getting people to take warfare as seriously as education — has a through-the-looking-glass quality. But it’s a sign of how profoundly Putin’s aggression stands to alter German society. Germany is not alone in ramping up its defense. Denmark has announced plans to increase military spending to 2 percent of G.D.P., a target set by NATO that most member states haven’t hit. Sweden, which is not a part of NATO, also intends to increase military spending to 2 percent, and the country’s prime minister said that young people should be prepared to do military service. But Germany’s sudden foreign policy transformation is particularly astonishing. Since World War II, militarism has been deeply taboo in Germany. And the country has felt a special responsibility to Russia because of Soviet losses in that war. “That’s something that I feel like Americans are really underplaying,” said Susan Neiman, the Berlin-based author of “Learning From the Germans,” a book about Germany’s reckoning with its genocidal past. “Because when they think of the Second World War, they think of two things. They think of the Holocaust, and then they think of Western Europeans: Anne Frank and Paris and so on.” But it was the Soviet Union that suffered the most deaths in that war, an estimated 26 million. For years, Schmid said, there was an implicit bargain in Germany’s relationship with Russia: “We acknowledged our responsibility from history, and the Soviet Union and then Russia sort of granted us the benefit of accepting that this is a new Germany and that we could enter into a normal relationship.” In “Putin’s World,” Angela Stent’s 2019 book about Putin’s foreign policy, Stent wrote that German leaders since Willy Brandt, who became chancellor in 1969, “have been determined never to repeat the pattern of Russo-German enmity.” Putin’s attack on Ukraine has made that determination void. Now many compare the feeling in Germany to that in the United States after Sept. 11, minus the patriotic chest beating. (I’ve seen far more Ukrainian flags in Berlin this week than German ones.) “I have never seen a kind of cloud of uncertainty and a sense of feeling lamed descend over this city before,” said Neiman, who serves as director of the Einstein Forum, a German cultural institute. In the United States, Putin’s aggression and Ukraine’s heroic resistance have elicited horror but also strains of triumphalism. After years of American decline and self-doubt, a period when political momentum at home and abroad seemed to be with pro-Putin authoritarian populists like Donald Trump, some seem to welcome a renewed sense of moral clarity. “Among the many positive consequences of the Ukraine crisis is the death of wrongheaded and ultimately dangerous Republican nostalgia for isolationism,” The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin wrote. I don’t think there’s much talk of positive consequences in Germany. “Europeans know there is no complete security in Europe against Russia,” said Klaus Scharioth, who served as Germany’s ambassador to the United States during both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama presidencies. “You can unite, we all do that, which is absolutely necessary, but if Russia stays on the current path, then nobody is secure, because they have all these tactical nuclear weapons. They have also intermediate-range nuclear weapons. And they can, if they want to, they can destroy any European city within minutes.” Germany has reason to be proud of its reception of Ukrainian refugees, reprising the “willkommenskultur” that led it to accept a million Middle Eastern and North African refugees in 2015. A large section of the Hauptbahnhof train station has been transformed into a makeshift refugee processing center. On Wednesday evening, countless volunteers — wearing yellow vests if they speak only German or English, orange if they speak Russian or Ukrainian — helped new arrivals navigate toward free accommodations in Berlin or buses onward. But the scene is still unspeakably sad. Hundreds of people newly forced from their homes milled around, some laden with baggage, others with only rolling suitcases. Families were slumped on the floor. Some people clutched pets. The catastrophe they’d fled wasn’t that far away; Berlin is closer to Lviv than to Paris. “We live in a different world now,” said Ricarda Lang, a co-leader of the German Green Party, when I met her at a pro-Ukraine demonstration outside the Russian Embassy. “I, as a person who was born in 1994, I grew up in a peaceful Europe. For me, peace and democracy in many ways were something that was taken for granted.” Such assurance, she said, has now disappeared. Putin has murdered a whole constellation of post-Cold War assumptions. No one knows what new paradigms will replace them. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-03-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/12/opinion/sports-ukraine-espn.html,Opinion | Watching Sports During a War,"As I sit writing in a quiet part of my apartment building, I can see two televisions. One is playing CNN. Jake Tapper is asking a reporter how victims of the opioid crisis confronted the Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, at a hearing on Thursday. Earlier, the network focused on images from the war in Ukraine — bloodied victims of bombings, bodies buried in mass graves, buildings on fire. The other television is playing ESPN, which is currently celebrating the end of a monthslong lockout by Major League Baseball. Suffice it to say, I’ve been watching a lot of ESPN lately. When the world seems to be spinning even more out of control than usual, when Twitter friends are sharing a nuclear blast simulation map (which makes it pretty clear that a bomb dropped on Washington, D.C., would kill me immediately), ESPN is a beacon for me. It’s a font of news that isn’t news, of stories about the N.B.A. player Ben Simmons’s first game back in Philadelphia after his trade to the Brooklyn Nets, about big-time N.F.L. trades and college basketball buzzer beaters. It’s not that ESPN isn’t giving me information. Sports reporters are constantly covering stories and breaking news, working the phones at all hours. I used to work as a sportswriter, and even the very basic N.F.L. game coverage I did required hours of work as I checked box scores and playoff tiebreaker scenarios and emailed coaches. But the news on ESPN isn’t about the news. The news is about sports — and thus, technically, about games. I am, of course, not the first person to use sports, and sports television, as a form of escapism. Justin Ellis wrote in The Atlantic in September 2020 as N.B.A. players went on strike after a police shooting in Kenosha, Wis., that sports are viewed by many people as apart from regular life, a protected space where hard times don’t exist. “There’s also the popular myth that sports can give a sense of normalcy to buffer us from our lows, to act as a salve for an ailing nation. If you consider sports a sort of theater bound by rules that divide fair from foul, it provides order, a clear set of winners and losers. Because America hates not knowing winners from losers.” The world of sports has in fact been affected by the war in Ukraine — Ukrainian boxers are returning home to fight for their country, Russia and Belarus were barred from competing in the Paralympics, and FIFA barred Russia from competing in international soccer competition, including the World Cup in Qatar. And I like it when athletes don’t pretend — and aren’t forced to pretend — that sports is a sphere separate from the rest of the world — a place where there is no war or violence or police brutality or politics or pain, just fun dunks and big games. I loathe the “stick to sports” mind-set that some people had toward athletes like Colin Kaepernick when they talked about police brutality in their own communities, or argued for or against politicians and political parties. Sports are played by people, after all, and people — with widely varying cultural, societal, religious and racial backgrounds — are political. But right now, my brain, and maybe yours, is tired of thinking about horrible things — like the bombing of a maternity hospital and accusations of “false flags” and the exhausting, ever-present battle online over what information about the war is accurate. My brain wants to think about sports. But my brain also feels very strange, and very guilty, about its efforts to escape from what I am seeing only on television or listening to in podcast form. I have friends and colleagues who are reporting live from Kyiv, risking life and limb to get people like me the news that I am turning away from in favor of whatever Kevin Durant is up to. No one is bombing my house, my church, my gym. No one has killed my family and tried to lie about it. I’m not living this crisis. I’m experiencing it with privileged remove. I am a witness, at best, to what’s taking place. So shouldn’t I make sure I witness? And yet, I still sometimes want to watch someone on ESPN talk about the Arizona Cardinals instead. Someone like Mina Kimes, who is a senior writer at ESPN and an analyst on the network’s “N.F.L. Live,” a weekday show exploring the ins and outs of the league. I watch the show almost every day, in the same way I watch a lot of ESPN — in the background, a reassuring presence while reading about Russian propaganda or the scourge that is qualified immunity. So I reached out to Kimes to ask her about doing her job in the midst of a war in Europe and continuing crises at home. She told me that first and foremost, doing “N.F.L. Live” is her job. When I asked what it was like to do it in the midst of a war, she said that how she acted on TV was very different from how the crisis affected her as a person. “Along those lines, I try to be mindful of both what’s happening in the world and whether it intersects with what I’m covering, if that makes sense,” she said. Kimes told me that while the war in Ukraine wasn’t directly affecting the work she does covering the N.F.L. (and said, laughing, “People aren’t tuning in to “N.F.L. Live” to learn about global news. Or I hope they’re not.”), it did play a role in how she did her job. Viewers, she said, were people like her. “They’re cognizant of what’s happening. And I think that’s something I try to keep in mind.” She tries to keep the N.F.L. in perspective, reporting on the league and its players, trades and salary caps and whether the retired N.F.L. quarterback Tom Brady might unretire, with the knowledge that in the scheme of things, football is both important and … not. “As someone who is on sports television, I find myself balancing the awareness that there are people tuning in who want to escape,” she said, “with awareness that there are people tuning in who still have other stories and bigger things on their mind.” Kimes told me that when the war in Ukraine started, she, like many Americans, found it hard to focus on anything else, including sports. But she said that sports was sometimes a reprieve for her, too, even though it is also her profession. “And so in some ways, I definitely understand the desire and the impulse for some people to find a respite,” she said. “But I’m also aware that not everyone either wants that or has the luxury to look elsewhere.” Many people don’t. But I do. I could look to sports to take my mind to a place where the war in Ukraine is a faraway problem for other people. I won’t, though. Kimes helped me think about how a binary mind-set toward sports in a time of crisis is unhelpful. Sports and war often coexist, uneasily, sometimes interweaving, sometimes seemingly acting in parallel, each separate from the other. And I can follow sports for the same reasons I always have, while remaining informed about the war in Ukraine. I know what’s important. I know that life and liberty matter, and that the N.F.L. is a league based on a game. “ESPN” used to stand for the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network, after all. Sports can be important ways to shift critical conversations, but they can also be fun, engaging and enjoyable. At a time when nothing feels comfortable, it’s OK to find some semblance of comfort in sports.",29
2022-03-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/12/opinion/putin-ukraine-russia.html,Opinion | The Ukraine War and the Retro-Future,"Long before Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, his aggressions were often met by the accusation — leveled by John Kerry and Angela Merkel, among others — that he’s a 19th-century figure in a 21st-century world. It’s a line that seemed intended to judge Putin guilty not just of wickedness but of anachronism, which is somehow more confounding to the modern mind. But today there is a sense in which being a 19th-century man in the 21st century actually makes Putin extremely of the moment — a characteristic figure for our era, not an unfrozen caveman confused by a world that’s passed him by. He exemplifies our transition to a kind of retro-future, in which crucial elements of the Victorian age are superimposed on our era’s very different social, cultural and technological landscape. What’s returning from the past, as American primacy wanes, is a certain kind of great-power consolidation and competition, echoing the late-1800s dynamics of European empire but this time with global rather than mostly Western players. In this analogy the United States resembles both Victorian Britain (the great naval power and global imperium) and late-19th-century France (the republic torn apart by culture war) — a long-dominant power haunted by the specter of decline. Then contemporary China, India, Russia and arguably the European Union all have goals that echo the ambitions of 19th-century Germany and Italy, the Russia of the Romanovs and eventually the Empire of Japan: to establish the largest possible political union based on shared ethnicity or cultural inheritance; to grow strong enough to challenge Anglo-Saxon hegemony; to project power in regions of the globe that lack a dominant nation-state, whether in Central Asia and the Middle East or Africa and Latin America. Within this multipolar world, you have emergent alliances that echo alignments of the kind that preceded World War I — for now, Russia and China against Europe and America. And then you have the smaller nations and regions caught between, stirred by their own ambitions and offering potential tinderboxes for larger wars. Manchuria, Alsace-Lorraine and the Balkans then; today, Taiwan, Afghanistan, Syria and now Ukraine. But all these echoes and revivals have not brought the 19th century back to life in full. Instead the old geopolitics is re-emerging against a thoroughly 21st-century background. First, globalization has gone further than it ever did in the 19th century. The scale of our interdependence is sometimes exaggerated, but it’s still extraordinary, and so is the scale of wealth at stake in any sustained disruption of the world system. That doesn’t mean that some strands in the vast web cannot be unwound. But to have it happen suddenly and wrenchingly, as is happening to Russia at the moment, is a peril greater than the empire builders of the 19th century faced. Those empire builders also operated in a world where it was still possible to claim real public legitimacy for imperialism, conquest, autocratic rule. That day may come again, for now even de facto dictators like Putin feel they have to pretend to be democratically elected, pay lip service to self-determination, deny that they’re invading their neighbor even when it’s obvious to all. This fraudulence then feeds into the cynicism and alienation that are also defining features of our era. The consolidation of Germany or Italy or, for that matter, the United States in the 19th century shaped and was shaped by new forms of mass mobilization and mass politics — including the rise of political parties, labor unions, ideological movements and more. But our age is more a time of fragmentation and isolation, of a retreat into virtual escapes. This promises a near-future world, perhaps, where elites are invested in grand civilizational rivalries but the masses show little enthusiasm for the struggle. Then, too, today’s great powers are much older than their antecedents, lacking the youthful population that past empires relied upon for energy, creativity and cannon fodder. As the British writer Ed West has noted, the war in Ukraine is a war between two societies with fertility levels far below replacement, in which families might lose everything when they lose a single son. That raises questions both about how long such a war can be sustained and also what happens in the aftermath. An energetic figure like Volodymyr Zelensky, for instance, evokes the 19th century’s youthful nationalists and nationalisms — the Young Turks, Young Ireland. But the nation he’s trying to preserve is not actually a young one, and it’s possible to imagine a Ukraine that keeps its independence and simply stagnates alongside a senescent Russia, their conflict buried by old age. Then, finally, ours is a world with nuclear weapons, as the old great-power world was not. This is a difference for the better, one hopes, making certain forms of total war almost unimaginable, giving our leaders an existential reason to avoid that old world’s grim 1914-18 terminus. But those leaders will still need real wisdom to navigate a new age of nuclear-power rivalry that will probably be quite different from the Cold War era, and at times more like the distant 19th-century past.

2022-03-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/opinion/china-russia-ukraine.html,Opinion | It’s Time to Offer Russia an Offramp. China Can Help With That.,"Casualties are mounting in Ukraine. Bombs continue to fall. More than 2 million refugees have fled the fighting. Vladimir Putin seems to have assumed he could get a swift victory, underestimating the fierce resistance from Ukraine. Two weeks in, Russia is intensifying its assault on Ukraine, and Western nations in turn are intensifying their financial and economic punishments against Russia, including by triggering the financial “nuclear option” — banning some Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system. Meanwhile, Mr. Putin has put his actual nuclear forces on high alert. We are now in an escalatory spiral. Mounting pressure on Mr. Putin will likely make the situation more dangerous as Russia’s leader feels pushed to take increasingly extreme measures — such as what we’ve seen in the past few days with the Russian army’s siege tactics and attacks on civilian areas. And so, unpalatable as some in the West may find the idea, it is time to offer the Russian leader an offramp with China’s help. On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping of China held a virtual summit with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, urging a diplomatic solution. The United States and its allies might be reluctant to have China play any role in this crisis, given that they view Beijing as a strategic rival. That’s foolish and shortsighted; the conflict’s immediate dangers far outweigh any competitive considerations. Ukraine itself sees the potential of Chinese-led conflict resolution. So far, China has called for dialogue and says it supports humanitarian aid efforts. But Beijing’s interests in more proactive involvement are growing by the day. China has a significant economic interest in a quick resolution to the Russian-Ukrainian war. China enjoys strong ties with Russia and Ukraine and is both countries’ largest single trading partner, though each trades more with the E.U. bloc than with China. Russia and Ukraine are crucial components of the Belt and Road infrastructure program as well as conduits for China’s trade with Europe. China-Europe rail transports have experienced a hundredfold increase since the beginning of the 2010s, but the ongoing conflict threatens to disrupt these trade flows. China is also uniquely positioned to act as a neutral mediator between a Western-supported Ukraine and Russia. Yes, Beijing and Moscow have a strong and growing relationship, especially in the economic realm. China’s demand for resources that Russia has in abundance — food and energy — as well as a mutual dissatisfaction with the current state of the U.S.-led world order have increasingly drawn the two countries together. This alliance was cemented when Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi met last month and issued a joint statement underscoring their deep ties and reaffirming a partnership with “no forbidden zones.” It is not in Beijing’s interests to rely solely on an anti-Western alliance with Moscow. Russia may possess a mighty military, but its economy is in long-term structural decline, with a G.D.P. not much larger than that of Spain. For all the talk of ties with Moscow, it is worth remembering that China’s economic interests with Russia are dwarfed by those it shares with the West. In 2021, trade between China and Russia may have jumped by 36 percent compared to the prior year, to $147 billion — but that’s still less than a tenth of the combined trade with the United States ($657 billion) and European Union ($828 billion). Even if China isn’t joining in the sanctions, it is possible that Chinese businesses and banks will decrease involvement with Russia to avoid a backlash in other, more important markets. As Russia becomes isolated from the world economy, China will not want to shoulder Russia’s economic burden alone. The prospect of a growing economic relationship between Moscow and Beijing may be threatening to the West, but from Mr. Putin’s perspective, it provides China with leverage over him in potential negotiations. As he and his country face increasing isolation, he can’t afford to lose China, too. There are also political reasons China wants this conflict to end in a way that is appealing to all involved. The longer the war lasts, the more it will reinvigorate the Western alliance around the idea of a values-based confrontation between East and West, bringing the United States and the European Union into even closer alignment while driving military budgets up around the globe. That is not good for China, which would prefer to maintain lucrative economic ties with the West and focus its resources on domestic development. At a time when China faces increasing global criticism for its human rights violations, mediating an end to this conflict could help improve the country’s standing with the West. Beijing has long striven to convince political and business elites in Europe and America that the rise of China does not present a threat. Support for Russian aggression — even perceived support — threatens to undermine that assertion. By contrast, playing a constructive role in ending the war could help cast China as a strategic and not just economic partner. Ideologically, China has common ground with both Ukraine and Russia. China deeply values the principle of state sovereignty and has long opposed outside interference in what it considers internal affairs such as Taiwan. Last month, Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China once again called for a global respect of territorial integrity, saying, “Ukraine is no exception.” In this way, at least, Mr. Putin’s invasion directly undercuts one of China’s key values. China — like Russia — is wary of pro-democratic Western influence globally. So far, Chinese media has avoided criticism of Russia and even adopted Moscow’s narrative of the war. The two countries share grievances over perceived Western hostility and hypocrisy. Framing the invasion as anti-West and anti-NATO helps justify Mr. Putin’s action to a domestic audience. The longer the war goes on, though, China may find itself in a position of diminishing returns in its close relationship with Russia. This makes the argument for Beijing to take on an active mediation role even more compelling. What form could mediation take? Any serious resolution would have to involve the United States and the European Union as key actors in European security arrangements. Beijing could help to broker an immediate cease-fire as a prelude to talks among Russia, Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and China. Beijing’s goal would be to find a solution that gives Mr. Putin sufficient security assurances that can be presented as a win to his domestic audience while protecting Ukraine’s core sovereignty and NATO’s open-door policy. Finding a landing zone for such an agreement is challenging but not impossible. Some creative diplomacy could solve this, such as a formula for NATO expansion that rules out Ukrainian membership in practice while preserving its sovereignty and NATO principles in theory. Securing a multilateral resolution to the crisis in Ukraine will be a tough and risky challenge, but there is no country better placed to do so than China.

2022-03-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/14/opinion/ukraine-refugees-europe.html,Opinion | Ukraine’s Refugees Are Undertaking a Great Migration,"Another great migration is underway. At least two and a half million Ukrainians have fled Russia’s merciless bombardment to countries across Europe, while roughly another two million have been internally displaced within Ukraine. It is a tragic upheaval: families have been split apart, homes abandoned, lives upended. What’s happening is a horror, a human travesty. Yet the situation, however bleak, is not without precedents. At the height of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, one million people fled their homes. By the time the war ended in late 1995, half of the population had been displaced, many of them internally. Over the course of the 20th century, Europe — the “dark continent” in Mark Mazower’s memorable phrase — was the stage for numerous refugee crises. To the people seeking shelter and security amid a brutal war, that’s of little comfort. But there’s something significant in the fact that Europe — and the world — has risen to the challenge of accommodating and protecting great numbers of refugees before. What’s more, large movements of refugees have spurred the development of more humane and just approaches to refugee settlement. In an imperfect world, where at least 82.4 million people were forcibly displaced by the end of 2020, it’s worth remembering these efforts. In the past, calamity has often been the crucible of change. And today, in the welcome extended to Ukrainians across the continent, we might see the glimmers of a better future. “The word ‘refugee,’” wrote the renowned journalist and war correspondent Martha Gellhorn, “is drenched in memories.” In Europe, those memories cast a long shadow, none more so than World War II. And with good reason: In the war’s aftermath around 10 million ethnic Germans — men, women and children — were expelled from East-Central Europe. And more than half a million Ukrainians and at least one million Poles were displaced when the border between Poland and the Soviet Union was redrawn. World War I caused similar upheaval. Before, during and after the war, refugees moved in great numbers across the continent, maybe as many as 15 million during the war itself. The rapid flight of civilians from the enemy invasion of Belgium in 1914 and Serbia in 1915, for example, bears comparison with the situation in today’s Ukraine. The population loss was staggering: Between one-fifth and one-tenth of their respective populations sought refuge abroad until it was safe to return. Nor should we forget the scale and pace of displacement beyond Europe. In South Asia, the numbers beggar belief. Between 14 and 18 million people were displaced by the Partition of India. The situation in Punjab was particularly intense: Eight million refugees fled across the new border separating West Pakistan from India in the space of three months in late 1947. A couple of decades later, the war that led to the creation of Bangladesh in 1971 displaced around three million refugees within a matter of weeks. These historical episodes help us to understand the present. But the numbers tell only half the story. Alongside some of the great upheavals in the past have come collective, international responses. In many cases, as with the refugees fleeing Franco’s Spain during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, these have been, first and foremost, the provision of emergency humanitarian aid in the form of food, shelter and temporary settlement. Countries around the world, including Russia, have contributed to such efforts. But refugee crises have also led to more durable, institutional solutions. In fact, it was events in Russia and East-Central Europe that first led politicians and diplomats to hammer out some formal protections for refugees. The Russian Revolution and the ensuing civil war prompted the League of Nations to create the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees in 1921, the first international institution to support refugees. The arrangements were not universal — they did little or nothing for the victims of interwar fascism, or for non-European refugees such as Ethiopians who suffered at the hands of Italy’s occupation in 1935 — but they did represent a new departure. In interwar Europe, nearly two million Russian and Armenian refugees were provided with travel documents and an organization to which they could appeal for recognition and protection of their basic rights. The aftermath of World War II prompted another institutional innovation, mainly to support the victims of Nazism who had been forcibly recruited from occupied Eastern Europe during the war. When in 1946 significant numbers — including numerous Ukrainians, Poles and Balts — refused to return to their original homes now firmly under Communist control, the United States, Britain and France created an International Refugee Organization to protect and assist individuals who claimed a “well-founded fear of persecution.” Five years later it was replaced by the U.N.H.C.R. Together with the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, which obliges signatory states not to return refugees to their country of origin against their will, this remains the cornerstone of international refugee protection. It’s far from perfect, of course. For one thing, the convention applies only to people who have crossed an international frontier, effectively barring the internally displaced or those who can’t leave their homes from international legal protection. What’s more, the emphasis on persecution has led to a prohibitively narrow interpretation of who constitutes a refugee, especially when compared to the broader provisions of the convention adopted by the Organization of African Unity in 1969. In recent years, the architecture of refugee protection has been found severely wanting. The nearly seven million Syrians fleeing the country’s civil war, together with close to three million Afghan refugees — not to mention Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, refugees in Yemen, South Sudan and elsewhere — face enormous hardship and threats to life. Not only are these people cast adrift from any substantive institutional help but they also often disappear from the world’s media, as if they are irredeemably remote. This time the response has been different. Europe has been overwhelmingly hospitable to the Ukrainians escaping the war. European Union member states have agreed to provide them with the right to live and work within the bloc, as well as access to social welfare and education. This instant recognition is, of course, deeply welcome. But it’s strikingly more generous protection than is available to Syrian and other asylum seekers incarcerated in squalid camps in Greece. Likewise, the warmth extended to Ukrainian refugees contrasts starkly with the racist hostility experienced at Ukraine’s western borders by Africans and Asians trying to escape violence. Yet it’s possible to spy in the outpouring of sympathy for Ukrainians an opportunity to push for better treatment for all refugees. Can Europe’s leaders, so long at odds over the question of migration, be persuaded to enlarge their responsibility to safeguard the lives of people who flee violence, no matter where they come from? Could the current crisis in Ukraine actually be a catalyst for substantially improving the rights of refugees around the world? These might seem like utopian, even naïve, questions. But the history of Europe suggests otherwise. In dire circumstances, bold and creative thinking has produced a better, more humane world. It can happen again. Will anyone rise to the challenge?

2022-03-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/14/world/asia/china-russia-ukraine.html,China Sees at Least One Winner Emerging From Ukraine War: China,"The war in Ukraine is far from over, but a consensus is forming in Chinese policy circles that one country stands to emerge victorious from the turmoil: China. After a confused initial response to Russia’s invasion, China has laid the building blocks of a strategy to shield itself from the worst economic and diplomatic consequences it could face, and to benefit from geopolitical shifts once the smoke clears. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has avoided criticizing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, but he has also tried to distance China from the carnage. His government has denounced the international sanctions imposed on Russia but, so far at least, has hinted that Chinese companies may comply with them, to protect China’s economic interests in the West. Mr. Xi reached out to European leaders last week with vague offers of assistance in negotiating a settlement, even as other Chinese officials amplified Russian disinformation campaigns meant to discredit the United States and NATO. On Monday, President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met with a top Chinese official in Rome, and warned that the United States had “deep concerns” about Beijing’s growing alignment with Russia. In the end, China’s leadership has calculated that it must try to rise above what it considers a struggle between two tired powers and be seen as a pillar of stability in an increasingly turbulent world. “This means that as long as we don’t commit terminal strategic blunders, China’s modernization will not be cut short, and on the contrary, China will have even greater ability and will to play a more important role in building a new international order,” Zheng Yongnian, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, who has advised senior officials, wrote after the invasion in a widely circulated article. At the heart of China’s strategy lies a conviction that the United States is weakened from reckless foreign adventures, including, from Beijing’s perspective, goading Mr. Putin into the Ukraine conflict. In this view, which in recent days has been echoed in public statements and quasi-official analyses, Russia’s invasion has dragged American power and attention toward Europe, making it likely that President Biden, like his recent predecessors, will try but fail to put more focus on China and the broader Asia-Pacific region. “All the difficulties and all the balancing and all the embarrassment that we’re talking about, those are short-term,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, who has studied Beijing’s actions in the lead-up to the war. “In the long run, Russia is going to be the pariah of the international community, and Russia will have no one to turn to but China.” China’s path ahead is by no means certain. Drawing too close to Russia would risk entrenching animosity toward China in Europe and beyond, a possibility that worries Mr. Xi’s government, for all its bluster. And if Germany, France and other allies build up their defenses as promised, the United States could ultimately be freed up to shift more of its military resources toward countering China. Mr. Biden has vowed to rally an “alliance of democracies,” while American military leaders say they will not let Ukraine distract them from China. “We also feel very, very anxious because the Russia-Ukraine war will force Europe to lean to the U.S., and then China will be dragged deeper into a dilemma,” said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University. The United States’ allies in the Pacific, including Japan and Australia, “will also adopt a stronger military posture. So it all seems unfriendly to China.” Mr. Sullivan’s meeting in Rome with a top Chinese foreign affairs official, Yang Jiechi, came amid reports that Russia has asked China to give it military equipment and support for its war in Ukraine, as well economic assistance to help counteract the broad sanctions imposed after the invasion. China has denied those reports. China’s initial stumbles after the Russian invasion have raised questions about Mr. Xi’s ability to navigate the war’s aftershocks. He has repeatedly warned Chinese officials that the world is entering an era of upheaval “the likes of which have not been seen for a century.” Yet those officials seemed ill-prepared for the upheaval of Mr. Putin’s assault on Ukraine. Up to the day of the invasion, they scoffed at warnings that Russia was poised for war, instead accusing the United States of stoking tensions. Since then, they have struggled to reconcile sympathy for Mr. Putin’s security grievances with their often-stated reverence for the principle of national sovereignty, including Ukraine’s. Mr. Xi, in a video conference with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, lamented “the rekindling of the flames of war” in Europe. Yet his diplomats have fanned the flames of Russian disinformation, accusing the United States of developing biological weapons in Ukraine. “This is just not good for China’s international reputation,” said Bobo Lo, an expert on China-Russia ties at the French Institute of International Relations. “It’s not just China’s reputation in the West; I think it also affects China’s reputation in the non-West, because it’s essentially associating itself with an imperial power.” China could also face economic disruptions from the war and the Western efforts to punish Russia by restricting trade and cutting off its financial institutions. Chinese officials have denounced such measures, and while the United States and its allies have shown remarkable unity in imposing them, other countries share Beijing’s reservations about using powerful economic tools as weapons. In any case, China’s economy is large enough to absorb blows that would cripple others. Chinese companies may even end up well positioned to take advantage of Russia’s desperate need for trade, as happened when Moscow faced sanctions over the annexation of Crimea in 2014. China’s strategy reflects a hardening of views toward the United States since Mr. Biden came to office in 2021 — in large part, because officials had hoped for some easing after the chaotic and confrontational policies of President Donald J. Trump. “In its China strategy, the Biden administration’s policy continuities with the Trump administration are clearly bigger than any differences,” Yuan Peng, president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, wrote late last year. “Biden has repeatedly avowed that the United States is not in a ‘new Cold War’ with China, but China often feels the chill creeping in everywhere.” Whatever happens in the war, China sees its deepening ties to Russia as a way to cultivate a counterweight to the United States. The partnership that Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin celebrated last month at the Winter Olympics in Beijing has become too important to sacrifice, whatever misgivings some officials have about the war. Arguing that the era of American dominance after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991 was a historical anomaly, both Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin have embraced geopolitical doctrines that call for their countries to reclaim their status as great powers. Just as Mr. Putin depicts the United States as menacing Russia on its western frontier, Mr. Xi sees American support for Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its own, as a similar threat off China’s coast. In recent weeks, Chinese analysts have repeatedly cited the century-old writings of a British geographer, Sir Halford John Mackinder. Whoever controls Central Europe controls the vast landmass stretching from Europe to Asia, he argued. Whoever controls Eurasia can dominate the world. A modern Russian proponent of such thinking, Aleksandr G. Dugin, has written extensively on what he sees as a growing clash between the liberal, decadent West and a conservative Eurasian continent with Russia as its soul. Mr. Dugin, sometimes called “Putin’s philosopher,” has built a following in China, appearing in state media and visiting Beijing in 2018 to deliver a series of lectures. His host on that occasion was Zhang Weiwei, a propagandist-academic who has won Mr. Xi’s favor and who last year gave a lecture to the Politburo, a council of 25 top party officials. “The West should not have become a hegemon in defining universal standards because the West or Europe, or the West in general is only part of humanity,” Mr. Dugin told a Chinese state television interviewer in 2019. “And the other part, a majority of human beings, live outside the West, in Asia.” Such aversion to international standards for political or human rights, supposedly dictated by the West, has become a recurrent theme in Chinese criticism of the United States. It was the subject of a government position paper in December, intended to counter a virtual summit of democratic countries held by Mr. Biden, and of a long statement that Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi issued when they met in Beijing last month. As it turns to Beijing for support against Western sanctions, Russia will become increasingly beholden to China as its diplomatic and economic lifeline, while serving as its strategic geopolitical ballast, analysts say. “The old order is swiftly disintegrating, and strongman politics is again ascendant among the world’s great powers,” wrote Mr. Zheng of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. “Countries are brimming with ambition, like tigers eyeing their prey, keen to find every opportunity among the ruins of the old order.”",22
2022-03-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/us/politics/ukraine-politics-congress.html,"Ukraine War Shifts the Agenda in Congress, Empowering the Center","WASHINGTON — The escalating crisis in Ukraine is upending policy and political thinking on both the left and the right on Capitol Hill, as an immediate threat to the global order and soaring energy prices empower the political center at the expense of the two parties’ flanks. When lawmakers convene on Wednesday for a virtual speech by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Republicans and Democrats will be confronting a changed environment, for better and for worse. “It’s bringing Congress together in a way, frankly, I haven’t seen in my 12 years,” Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a confidant of President Biden, said on Tuesday of the consensus to support Ukraine. “You’d have to go back to 9/11 to see such a unified commitment.” That has meant a retreat by both parties from the policy proposals and political messages that most thrill their core supporters. On the left, Democrats are acquiescing to higher military spending and dropping a bid to pull back rapidly from fossil fuels. On the right, Trump-era isolationism and attacks on the trans-Atlantic alliance are being relegated to the fringe in Congress. Plans to make the president’s son Hunter Biden and Ukrainian corruption front and center in a Republican-controlled House now seem far-fetched. “It’s grounding,” said Representative Peter Meijer, Republican of Michigan, who was once an intelligence analyst in Afghanistan and now faces a challenger on his right endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump. “You can propose something that outstrips the bounds of reality, that’s fine. Then you look at what’s happening in Ukraine, and it’s like a car accident, a near-death experience that snaps you back to reality.” Mr. Zelensky is expected on Wednesday to reiterate his request for a complicated swap that would send MIG fighter jets to Ukraine from Poland, and U.S.-made F-16 fighters to Poland. That could prompt accusations from some Republicans that the Biden administration, which has opposed the swap as a dangerous escalation of the conflict with no real military purpose, is soft on Russia. He is also likely to ask the United States to help close the airspace over his country to Russian aircraft, as he did on Tuesday when he addressed Canada’s Parliament. Republicans and Democrats alike have questioned the MIG deal now that the Defense Department has raised specific concerns about whether Ukraine could even fly the planes. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Mr. Zelensky would not get congressional support for a so-called no-fly zone over Ukraine, and he signaled ambivalence on the fighter jet transfer. “Exactly how to make that happen is still under discussion,” he said. It is unclear whether the moment amounts to a hiatus in the partisan wars over national security. Republican leaders continue to strafe the president, accusing him of being weak toward Russia, coddling “petro-dictators” and betraying America’s energy security. “President Biden continues to have this attitude of, ‘Well, I don’t want to help Ukraine too much’ because he might offend Putin,” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, said this week on Fox Business, referring to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. Democrats are incredulous that Republicans — a vast majority of whom did not criticize Mr. Trump for repeatedly standing by Mr. Putin, undermining NATO and then withholding military aid from Mr. Zelensky to pressure him to dig up political dirt on Mr. Biden — have the gall to question the current president’s willingness to confront Russia. “If you are a reporter, and there is a battle for the free world led by Zelensky and Biden, you don’t have to pretend not to remember that Republicans exonerated Trump for extorting Zelensky,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. But beyond partisan potshots, there are signs of the war’s very real impact. In December, when the House passed defense policy legislation authorizing $768 billion in military spending, 51 Democrats voted no, mainly because they saw that as far too much money. Last week, when the House funded the military and provided even more money — $782 billion and billions more for Ukraine — the number of Democrats voting in opposition dropped to 15. “Defense budgets should be driven by our needs, not some artificial target, but it’s pretty clear we are living in a dangerous time,” said Representative Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, a Democrat in a difficult re-election fight. Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, conceded that the current crisis had sapped momentum, at least for now, from efforts to slash military spending. “I do think Ukraine has just made it harder,” she said. “We had thought with the ending of the war in Afghanistan, we could push for a real reduction in the defense budget, and there will be another opportunity. But look, this is an epic battle.” Republicans are getting their own reality check. Under Mr. Trump, a growing faction of the party was pushing isolationism, questioning alliances and trade pacts, and pressing an “America First” agenda that would have fit well in the national mood leading up to World War II, Mr. Meijer said. In recent days, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a traditionalist Republican, sat down with the German ambassador to the United States to thank her for her country’s commitment to NATO’s defense and its aid to Ukraine. In an interview, Mr. Cole even suggested reviving the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a landmark trade pact negotiated by President Barack Obama that would have tied together economies in Asia, Australia, New Zealand, North America and South America to isolate China. In one of his first acts as president, Mr. Trump scuttled the agreement. “Ukraine has got a lot of Republicans rethinking the importance of international alliances,” Mr. Cole said. “Other countries are not always a burden. They’re quite often an asset.” Fealty to Mr. Trump’s foreign policy suddenly seems like a potential liability. Former Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, who is running for the Senate seat held by Richard M. Burr, a Republican who is retiring, hit his Trump-endorsed primary opponent, Representative Ted Budd, as pro-Putin in a new advertisement this week. “Budd’s votes have been friendly toward Russia,” Mr. McCrory says in the ad. “He voted against sanctions on Russia. These are serious times, and we need serious senators.” For Democrats, the shift in priorities has had a price. Taking his cues from his party’s environmental wing, Mr. Biden had hoped to move the United States away from fossil fuels, blocking new leases for oil and gas exploration on federal land, opening up large swaths of ocean and land to wind and solar development, and pushing an ambitious timetable to move the country to electric cars and trucks. Now, the fossil fuel industry is ascendant. More mainstream Democrats are using the language of Republicans, talking about an “all of the above” energy strategy that includes renewable fuels and oil and gas. Natural gas is again spoken of as a “bridge” fuel to clean energy, not an enemy of the planet. “Some of my colleagues are presenting a false choice,” said Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, a leading voice of centrist Democrats. “You can be for alternative energy and energy independence with aggressive long-term goals, and be for fully tapping our domestic energy resources.” In private gatherings of House Democrats, Mr. Malinowski said, a few lawmakers still speak up against the extraction of any fossil fuels, “but they’re not really a powerful voice in our meetings.” Republicans have other course corrections to contend with. Conservatives like Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, have signaled that they want to revive investigations of Hunter Biden and the lucrative seat he once held on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company. With such investigations would come accusations of rampant corruption in Ukraine and unsubstantiated accusations that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered with U.S. elections in 2016. But Ukraine is not the political target it once was. In a September 2019 poll by YouGov, 36 percent of registered voters in the United States were not sure whether Ukraine was friendly or unfriendly. Only 41 percent called the nation friendly or an ally. In a new YouGov survey, 81 percent of American voters said Ukraine was either friendly or an ally, a number that rivals or surpasses those for longtime U.S. partners like France and Japan. Ms. Jayapal warned that dredging up Burisma would allow Democrats to remind the nation that every Republican except Senator Mitt Romney of Utah voted to allow Mr. Trump to go unpunished for humiliating and strong-arming Mr. Zelensky for his personal political benefit. And Mr. Cole counseled against such an approach. “People might be a little less likely to bring that up,” he said of Burisma, especially when Ukrainians are “the point of the spear against Russian aggression.” “These are people who have bought into defending their country with their lives, at great risk and sacrifice,” Mr. Cole said. “I don’t think there will be a lot of investigations that put Ukraine into a negative light.”",1
2022-03-16,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/opinion/ukraine-russia-populism.html,Opinion | Will the Ukraine War End the Age of Populism?,"If the past 10 years of Western history have featured an extended wrestling match between populism and liberalism, Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has inspired many liberals to hopefully declare the contest over, their opponent pinned. And with some reason. Putin’s war has struck two blows against populism, one direct and one indirect. First, there is the embarrassment involved for every populist leader, European or American, who has either offered kind words for Putin or at least held him up as an adversary whose statecraft runs circles around our own incompetent elites. Such flirtations have now largely ended in backpedaling and reversal, forcing populists to choose between self-marginalization and a shameless pivot. Which is to say: Don’t be surprised if Donald Trump somehow evolves into the biggest Russia hawk you’ve ever seen come 2024. The more damaging blow, though, is the indirect one, the way the Ukraine invasion has revealed how uncertain and at sea the populist instinct becomes when it’s confronted with an adversary that doesn’t fit easily into its focus on internal Western corruption, its narratives of elite perfidy and folly. This uncertainty isn’t confined to right-populists alone; rather, you see it among anti-establishment voices of all stripes at the moment — the left-wing gadflies who didn’t expect the Ukraine invasion because they did not expect Western intelligence to ever get something right, the critics of U.S. power who didn’t expect Ukrainian resilience because they assumed that any regime backed by our foreign policy elites would be too hapless to survive, the media personalities casting about for narratives that fit populist preconceptions because the bigger picture of Putinist aggression and Western unity does not. Amid all this flailing, the Republican Party, the main vehicle for populism, seems to be returning to its pre-Trump instincts. Throughout Trump’s presidency there was a basic uncertainty about what populism stands for in foreign policy. Retrenchment and isolationism or a new cold war with China? Leaving NATO entirely versus strengthening the alliance by forcing its members to pay up? Fighting fewer wars or taking the gloves off? Pat Buchanan or John Bolton? Now, though, if you look at polls of Republican voters or listen to G.O.P. politicians, what you see is mostly a reversion to straightforward hawkishness, to a view that the Biden White House probably isn’t being confrontational enough — which is to say, to where the party stood before the Trump rebellion happened. But in that reversion you can also see one of the difficulties with assuming that if populism is floundering, liberalism must be the beneficiary. After all, Bolton is hardly a champion of liberal internationalism, and the return of Republican hawkishness is mostly a revival of old-fashioned American nationalism — working against populism, this time, rather than the two forces pulling the same way. And what’s true within the G.O.P. is true more generally. The Ukrainian fighters everyone so admires are clearly fighting more for nationalism than for liberalism, and some aren’t fighting for liberal ideals at all. The European country arguably doing the most to assist them is Poland, until yesterday the bête noire of Western liberalism for its nationalist and socially conservative government. The sudden sense of Western unity seems very, well, Western; it’s not a global coalition confronting Putin so much as a Euro-American one, infused with more than a little of the civilizational chauvinism that liberalism aspires to stand above. In the American media, too, it’s centrist jingoism rather than liberal cosmopolitanism that seems ascendant at the moment — the wave of Russophobic cancellations; the sudden “America: Love or leave it” enthusiasms of daytime TV personalities; the zeal for military escalation, nuclear peril be damned, among supposedly responsible figures who once led the opposition to Trumpism. None of this should be surprising: It’s always been the case that a liberal society depends for unity and vigor on not entirely liberal forces — religious piety, nationalist pride, a sense of providential mission, a certain degree of ethnic solidarity and, of course, the fear of some external adversary. Liberalism at its best works to guide and channel these forces; liberalism at its worst veers between ignoring them and being overwhelmed by them. Among the optimistic liberals of the current moment, you can see how that veering happens. “A Russian defeat will make possible a ‘new birth of freedom,’” Francis Fukuyama wrote last week, “and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on.” Following up in an interview with The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent, Fukuyama framed the current moment as an opportunity for Americans and other Westerners to choose liberalism anew, out of a recognition that the nationalist alternative is “pretty awful.” But one of the key lessons of recent years is that the spirit of 1989 was itself as much a spirit of revived Eastern European nationalism as of liberalism alone. Which is one reason countries like Poland and Hungary have sorely disappointed liberals in their subsequent development … up until now, of course, when Polish nationalism is suddenly a crucial bulwark for the liberal democratic West. So liberals watching the floundering of populism need a balanced understanding of their own position, their dependence on nationalism and particularism and even chauvinism, their obligation to sift those forces so that the good (admiration for the patriotism of Ukrainians and the heroic masculinity of Volodymyr Zelensky) outweighs the bad (boycotts of a Russian piano prodigy, a rush toward nuclear war). And they also need to avoid the delusion that Putin’s wicked and incompetent invasion means that all complaints about the West’s internal problems can safely be dismissed as empty, false, self-hating. Last week, for instance, the Russia scholar Stephen Kotkin told The New Yorker’s David Remnick that Putin’s invasion disproves “all the nonsense about how the West is decadent, the West is over, the West is in decline, how it’s a multipolar world and the rise of China.” With the West rallying to a resilient Ukraine, “all of that turned out to be bunk.” What was bunk was the idea that Putin’s Russia represents some kind of efficient postliberal or traditionalist alternative to the problems of the West, and one whose military could simply steamroller Eastern Europe. But all those Western problems remain: American power is in relative decline, China’s power has dramatically increased, and none of what I, as a self-appointed expert on the subject, would classify as the key problems of American decadence — demographic decline, economic disappointment and stagnation, a social fabric increasingly shadowed by drugs and depression and suicide — have somehow gone away just because Moscow’s military is failing outside Kyiv. Since those problems are crucial to understanding where populism came from in the first place, it’s reckless for liberals to declare victory based on shifts in the international order while simply waving domestic discontents away. Populism’s poor fit for this particular moment has given an opportunity to its enemies and critics. But they will squander the opportunity if they convince themselves that the external challenge has somehow made the internal crisis go away.

2022-03-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/world/russia-ukraine-queer-activists.html,LGBTQ Activists in Ukraine Share the Fight Against Russia’s Invasion,"To look at videos from last year’s Pride Parade in Kyiv is to peer at a joyous moment of solidarity in the quest for gay rights in Ukraine. A video on YouTube shows a cheerful crowd of thousands. Some wave flags. Some carry banners. Drag queens dance on a float. But the war that started when Russia invaded on Feb. 24 has forced Ukraine’s L.G.B.T.Q. movement to confront a threat not only to national sovereignty, but also to its own community. A pro-Russian puppet government, they say, would be less supportive of the L.G.B.T.Q. agenda. Gay marriage would likely remain unrecognized, they say, and incidents of discrimination and hate crime would rise, as they have in Russian-backed separatist regions. Gay rights activists who have spent years struggling for equality have responded to the invasion with an intensified commitment to their cause, while mobilizing their network to offer support to people in need. “What has amazed me is how the activist community reacted,” said Lenny Emson, who leads KyivPride and uses the gender-neutral courtesy title Mx. “It’s very encouraging how people work and how people did not stay inside panicking. They organized themselves for the community.” The conflict has confronted people who are gay, lesbian or gender nonconforming with the same agonizing choices as the rest of the country’s 44 million people. Some have fled as refugees or moved to Ukraine’s west in search of safety. Others have stayed to help relatives or because they are trapped in besieged towns or cities. Still others have joined Ukraine’s defense forces. At the same time, some people who are L.G.B.T.Q. have faced problems unique to their sex or gender identity. Mx. Emson said that she was aware of about 100 transgender women who were in the process of attaining legal gender recognition when the war started. After the invasion, Ukraine banned men between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country to ensure they could be conscripted for military service. The transgender women are effectively trapped “because of the letter ‘M’ in their passports,” Mx. Emson said. Some people who are H.I.V. positive no longer have ready access to medication. Neither do people in the process of gender transition. Protests that led to a revolution in 2014, during which Ukraine’s pro-Moscow president was overthrown in favor of a Western-leaning one, served to deepen ties between gay rights activists and other branches of civil society. The drive for human rights, which underpins gay rights, was central to the protests that centered on Kyiv’s Maidan Square. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has promoted what he has called “traditional values,” and has denounced what he views as the West’s cultural decadence, which is taken to include the extension of legal rights and cultural acceptance to people who are L.G.B.T.Q. One sign of how Mr. Putin’s values could potentially be applied to Ukraine comes from Crimea, said Maksym Eristavi, a Ukrainian gay rights activist and journalist. The region was seized by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, along with parts of the eastern Donbas region. Human rights groups say both regions have seen a crackdown on human rights defenders and a rise in attacks on people who are L.G.B.T.Q. “It just breaks my heart that we had eight years of fantastic success bringing Ukraine even further but now this is being sabotaged,” said Mr. Eristavi. Some recent Pride Parades in Ukraine have been met with counterdemonstrations, and rights groups point to a string of hate crimes in the country. However, some activists say the overriding national goal of resisting the invasion could serve to increase the general public’s solidarity with people who are L.G.B.T.Q. Everybody is subject to Russia’s attacks, and straight Ukrainians can see that gay people are engaged in the same struggle for survival, several activists said. Mr. Eristavi said the invasion “reignites the desire to fight back.”",29
2022-03-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/world/europe/brittney-griner-basketball-russia-detention.html,Russian Court Extends Brittney Griner’s Detention,"A Russian court has extended the detention of the W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner to May 19, the Russian news agency Tass reported on Thursday, adding tension to the most dangerous moment in U.S.-Russia relations since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Ms. Griner, 31, a seven-time W.N.B.A. All-Star center for the Phoenix Mercury, is being held on drug charges that could carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. The Russian Federal Customs Service said earlier this month that its officials had detained the American basketball player after they found vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage at the Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow in February. They did not immediately release the name of Ms. Griner, who was later identified by Tass. Ms. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, is one of several W.N.B.A. players who compete on international women’s teams in the off-season to supplement paychecks that are a fraction of their counterparts’ salaries in the N.B.A. She has played for the Russian team, UMMC Ekaterinburg, since 2014. Representative Colin Allred, Democrat of Texas, told The New York Times last week that Ms. Griner, a Texas native, had been detained on Feb. 17 and that he was working with the State Department to have her released. Russian authorities have so far denied the State Department’s request for a meeting between consular officials and Ms. Griner, Mr. Allred said. American officials, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, have said that certain details surrounding Ms. Griner’s detention could not be disclosed due to privacy constraints. Since she was detained, family and friends of Ms. Griner have come forward to express their shared desire to get her home safely. Ms. Griner’s wife, Cherelle T. Griner, said in an Instagram post last week, “We love you babe!” and “There are no words to express this pain.” The State Department has advised all U.S. citizens in Russia to leave the country and has warned that the U.S. Embassy in Moscow has “severe limitations” on its ability to provide assistance to Americans there. The W.N.B.A. said on Mar. 5 that all of its other players in Ukraine and Russia had left those countries.",7
2022-03-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/opinion/why-autocracies-fail.html,Opinion | This Is Why Autocracies Fail,"Joe Biden correctly argues that the struggle between democracy and autocracy is the defining conflict of our time. So which system performs better under stress? For the past several years, the autocracies seemed to have the upper hand. In autocracy, power is centralized. Leaders can respond to challenges quickly, shift resources decisively. China showed that autocracies can produce mass prosperity. Autocracy has made global gains and democracy continues to decline. In democracies, on the other hand, power is decentralized, often polarized and paralytic. The American political system has become distrusted and dysfunctional. A homegrown would-be autocrat won the White House. Academics have written popular books with titles like “How Democracies Die.” Yet the past few weeks have been revelatory. It’s become clear that when it comes to the most important functions of government, autocracy has severe weaknesses. This is not an occasion for democratic triumphalism; it’s an occasion for a realistic assessment of authoritarian ineptitude and perhaps instability. What are those weaknesses? The wisdom of many is better than the wisdom of megalomaniacs. In any system, one essential trait is: How does information flow? In democracies, policymaking is usually done more or less in public, and there are thousands of experts offering facts and opinions. Many economists last year said inflation would not be a problem, but Larry Summers and others said it would, and they turned out to have been right. We still make mistakes, but the system learns. Often in autocracies, decisions are made within a small, closed circle. Information flows are distorted by power. No one tells the top man what he doesn’t want to hear. The Russian intelligence failure about Ukraine has been astounding. Vladimir Putin understood nothing about what the Ukrainian people wanted, how they would fight or how his own army had been ruined by corruption and kleptocrats. People want their biggest life. Human beings these days want to have full, rich lives and make the most of their potential. The liberal ideal is that people should be left as free as possible to construct their own ideal. Autocracies restrict freedom for the sake of order. So many of the best and brightest are now fleeing Russia. The American ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, points out that Hong Kong is suffering a devastating brain drain. Bloomberg reports, “The effects of the brain drain in sectors such as education, health care and even finance will likely be felt by residents for years to come.” American institutions now have nearly as many top-tier A.I. researchers from China as from the United States. Given the chance, talented people will go where fulfillment lies. Organization man turns into gangster man. People rise through autocracies by ruthlessly serving the organization, the bureaucracy. That ruthlessness makes them aware others may be more ruthless and manipulative, so they become paranoid and despotic. They often personalize power, so they are the state, and the state is them. Any dissent is taken as a personal affront. They may practice what scholars call negative selection. They don’t hire the smartest and best people. Such people might be threatening. They hire the dimmest and the most mediocre. You get a government of third-raters. (Witness the leaders of the Russian military.) Ethnonationalism self-inebriates. Everybody worships something. In a liberal democracy, worship of the nation (which is particular) is balanced by the love of liberal ideals (which are universal). With the demise of communism, authoritarianism lost a major source of universal values. National glory is pursued with intoxicating fundamentalism. “I believe in passionarity, in the theory of passionarity,” Putin declared last year. He continued: “We have an infinite genetic code.” Passionarity is a theory created by the Russian ethnologist Lev Gumilyov that holds that each nation has its own level of mental and ideological energy, its own expansionary spirit. Putin seems to believe Russia is exceptional on front after front and “on the march.” This kind of crackpot nationalism deludes people into pursuing ambitions far beyond their capacity. Government against the people is a recipe for decline. Democratic leaders, at least in theory, serve their constituents. Autocratic leaders, in practice, serve their own regime and longevity, even if it means neglecting their people. Thomas J. Bollyky, Tara Templin and Simon Wigley illustrate how life expectancy improvements have slowed in countries that have recently transitioned to autocracies. A study of more than 400 dictators across 76 countries by Richard Jong-A-Pin and Jochen O. Mierau found that a one-year increase in a dictator’s age decreases his nation’s economic growth by 0.12 percentage points. When the Soviet Union fell, we learned that the C.I.A. had overstated the Soviet economy and Soviet military might. It’s just very hard to successfully run a big society through centralized power. To me, the lesson is that even when we’re confronting so-far successful autocracies like China, we should learn to be patient and trust our liberal democratic system. When we are confronting imperial aggressors like Putin, we should trust the ways we are responding now. If we steadily, patiently and remorselessly ramp up the economic, technological and political pressure, the weaknesses inherent in the regime will grow and grow.

2022-03-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/opinion/moral-obligation-ukraine.html,Opinion | What Is Our Moral Obligation in Ukraine?,"In 1994, I was a young journalist in the information graphics department at The Detroit News, just two years out of college. In April of that year, the Rwandan genocide — a war of ethnic tensions — erupted, resulting in 100 days of unspeakable carnage. The United States, still stinging from its failed peacekeeping mission in Somalia the year before, refused to fully intervene. I saw it as an unconscionable abdication of moral leadership. I felt angry and helpless. It seemed to me that no one really cared. When the fighting ended in Rwanda, 800,000 people — a tenth of the population — were dead, many of them hacked to death with machetes. While the United States didn’t intervene to stop the genocide, it paid in dollars as its penance. As a working paper in a 1997 edition of The Journal of Humanitarian Assistance put it: “While it failed miserably to do anything about the genocide, the U.S. donated generously to the emergency relief effort. Assistance amounted to about $370 million during 1994, including $106 million for Operation Restore Hope.” In 2009, The Christian Science Monitor interviewed Ted Dagne, an Africa specialist at the Congressional Research Service. The Monitor reported: “If there is a lesson learned from Rwanda, Dagne says, it is that the international community needs to avoid giving the impression that it is willing or capable of rescuing civilians in a conflict. ‘It’s important to build the capacity of people to do the job themselves [of protecting themselves],’ Dagne says. ‘We must not give the expectation that people will be saved.’” But that wasn’t entirely true. Four years after Rwanda, the Kosovo war erupted. More than a million people were displaced, and more than 13,000 were killed. As Paul Starr wrote in The American Prospect in 1999, more than a year after the fighting began, “No obvious strategic or economic interest, in the usual sense, compelled the United States and NATO to intervene.” As he put it: “The issue for the United States and NATO was fundamentally moral: Was the Serbian ‘ethnic cleansing’ so deeply offensive to our values that we ought to go to war over it? Was it so abhorrent that, if left unanswered, it would threaten the moral basis of the international order?” The year before, President Bill Clinton (who, by the way, was also president during the Rwandan genocide) responded to the moral question but stretched his rationale impossibly thin, suggesting that America had a compelling strategic interest in the region and therefore had every reason to intervene. In June 1998, Clinton declared a national emergency under the pretense that the governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia, with respect to Kosovo, were threatening to “destabilize countries of the region and to disrupt progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina in implementing the Dayton peace agreement, and therefore constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.” NATO intervened, ended the war and brought an end to most of the immediate suffering. This poses the question: When does America have a moral obligation to intervene — particularly for humanitarian reasons — in conflict? And which factors contribute to the choices we make? America and NATO have a clear geopolitical interest in Ukraine: President Vladimir Putin of Russia cannot be allowed to get away with such unprovoked, naked aggression. What kind of precedent would that set? And who’s to say that he would stop there? But when President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine spoke via video to Congress on Wednesday, part of the appeal he was making was a moral one, an appeal to the American belief in and commitment to the very idea of democracy. He said: The question is: How far is America compelled to go? President Biden signed off on $13.6 billion in aid on Tuesday and announced on Wednesday that $800 million in military assistance would be sent to Ukraine as part of that funding. These are not trivial amounts. Furthermore, America and its allies have imposed stiff economic sanctions on Russia. The sanctions could contribute to inflation, which means that Americans may pay even more than what the administration is pledging in direct assistance. I say that the United States must supply military aid and should supply humanitarian aid. But I also say that we must be more consistent in determining who deserves outpourings of our humanitarian impulses. Human suffering is human suffering. It has been a constant in the story of mankind. Sometimes it overlaps with our national interests, and sometimes it does not. But our sense of morality must remain constant, and in it we must find a place for equity. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-03-18,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/world/asia/china-ukraine-russia-dissent.html,"In Rare Rebuke, Chinese Denounce Russia’s War in Ukraine","When Hu Wei, a politically well-connected scholar in Shanghai, warned that China risked becoming a pariah if it didn’t denounce Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he ignited a war of words on China’s internet. Some readers praised Mr. Hu’s article, which spread online last week, seeing its gloomy prognosis about China becoming isolated behind a new Iron Curtain of hostility from Western countries as a welcome challenge to official Chinese soft-pedaling of President Vladimir V. Putin’s aggression. Many others denounced him as a stooge of Washington, unduly critical of Russia’s war aims and prospects. Chinese authorities blocked the website of U.S.-China Perception Monitor, where his article first appeared, and tried to censor it on social media. Inside China, the war in Ukraine “has ignited enormous disagreements, setting supporters and opponents at polar extremes,” Mr. Hu wrote. His own stance was clear: “China should not be yoked to Putin and must sever itself from him as soon as it can.” Mr. Hu’s article has been the most striking instance of rising opposition to Russia’s assault on an independent neighbor, and rebukes of Beijing for its reluctance to criticize Moscow. The criticism at home comes as Beijing faces increasing pressure abroad from the United States and European governments to use its influence over Russia to help stop the war. On Friday, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, spoke with President Biden, a call in which the American leader warned Mr. Xi that supporting Russia’s aggression would have unspecified “implications and consequences.” In China, where the authorities tightly police and punish speech both online and offline, public opinion appears largely sympathetic to Mr. Putin. Yet despite the risks, some citizens have been voicing criticisms — in quips on social media ridiculing Mr. Putin and his nationalist devotees in China; in scathing online comments responding to official statements; and in essays laying out the moral, political and economic costs of the war not just for Russia, but for its partner, China. “We have never had any commentary that attracted so much attention,” said Yawei Liu, the editor of the U.S.-China Perception Monitor, referring to Mr. Hu’s article. The Chinese version of the article attracted 300,000 views on the Monitor’s website, and millions more from being shared on Chinese social media, Mr. Liu said in a telephone interview from Atlanta, where the online journal is based. “There is overwhelming support for the China-Russia partnership, and overwhelming support for Putin’s war against Ukraine,” he said of Chinese opinion. “But the political, academic and economic elite are different. There is this real worry.” Chinese critics of the war include academics with a foothold in the political establishment, like Mr. Hu, who are usually shielded from the worst pressure. He is a professor in Shanghai’s school for Communist Party officials, and a vice president of a public policy center under the State Council, the Chinese cabinet of government ministers. He declined to be interviewed. Chinese censors have tried to snuff out the sharpest criticisms. People have also come under pressure from the authorities for expressing their opposition to the war. In recent days, Chinese officials warned many among some 130 alumni of Chinese universities who had signed a petition against the war, said Lu Nan, a retired businessman in New York who helped organize the campaign. The petition, also signed by alumni living abroad, had declared that Russia’s invasion was an “affront to the bottom line of human conscience.” “Every single one was taken for tea,” Mr. Lu said in a telephone interview, using a common euphemism referring to being questioned by the police. The Chinese government was nervous, he said, because “it’s tied to Russia’s war chariot, and knows that this is very dangerous.” Still, critics continue to speak out, suggesting that a significant minority is so alarmed by the war that they are willing to defy the censors. Despite the censorship, plenty of dissenting views have been kept alive by readers on social media platforms like Weibo and WeChat. Most of those speaking out are political liberals also opposed to China’s deepening authoritarianism and nationalism under Mr. Xi. Other Chinese opponents of the war are near its frontline. Some Chinese residents in Ukraine are trying to break through the censorship back home to give their compatriots an unvarnished chronicle of life under fighting. Wang Jixian, one of the most popular of these video chroniclers, posts regular dispatches from his apartment or the streets in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odessa, where he lives. His posts often start with air raid sirens, a howling reminder of how the attacks put civilians’ lives in danger. Mr. Wang said he spent hours every day debating Chinese supporters of the war who see him on WeChat and other social media platforms. (By Friday, his WeChat video channel was erased.) “I tell them I didn’t start this war, and if you feel it’s a righteous cause, why not come here?” Mr. Wang said in a telephone interview from his apartment. “Why don’t you just come on over and give your life for Putin?” Mr. Wang hoped that over time his commentaries would turn some Chinese people against the increasingly brutal Russian invasion. But Zhao Rui, another Chinese video blogger in Ukraine, said opinion in China appeared hard to shift. Many Chinese people see Russia as a robust ally against what they say is American efforts to contain China’s rise. China’s leader, Mr. Xi, has invested his prestige in a close relationship with Mr. Putin. “China has always treated Ukraine as a failure, a reject,” Mr. Zhao said in a telephone interview. “Even now, the great majority still strongly supports Putin.” Of half a million comments on Ukraine over the past two months on Weibo, a Chinese social media service, about half blamed the war on Ukraine, the United States or “the West” in general, according to research by Jennifer Pan, a political scientist at Stanford University, and other researchers from Stanford and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. About one-tenth blamed Russia or Mr. Putin. That critical minority in China, though, includes academics and professionals whose views carry more weight. Opposition from the elite may eventually seep into government policy deliberations, encouraging Beijing to shift away from Mr. Putin, especially if Russia’s assault suffers more setbacks. “When I talk to Chinese scholars, they are very critical of Putin, they’re critical of Russia, they’re critical of the invasion,” said Paul Haenle, a former director for China on the National Security Council in both the Bush and Obama administrations, who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. China, Mr. Haenle said, “can’t move maybe as quickly as they would like. But many of them say they’re going to distance themselves over time.” Five historians issued an open letter denouncing the war. Lu Xiaoyu, an international relations academic in Beijing, wrote online that Russia’s war was “imperialist expansionism, not national self-defense.” Qin Hui and Jin Yan, two other widely respected historians in Beijing, have given online lectures on the background of the crisis. “The situation now is not a Cold War, but it may be even more dangerous than one,” Ms. Jin wrote in a recent essay about Russia. “The world order may again divide into two camps over its stance on Russia.” Still, Mr. Xi appears committed to staying close to Russia, even as China has sought to dissociate itself from the attack on Ukraine. The increasingly centralized decision-making process in Beijing has meant that even prominent scholars do not have the same access as under previous leaders. If Russia’s war and the ensuing Western sanctions drag down China’s economic growth, leaders in Beijing could become more receptive to the warnings from Chinese scholars, Mr. Liu from the U.S.-China Perception Monitor said. “To hang yourself on the Russian tree, I think that’s like committing suicide,” he said, “at least economic suicide.” Joy Dong and Liu Yi contributed research.",22
2022-03-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/19/world/europe/pasha-lee-ukraine-actor-killed.html,Ukrainian Actor Pasha Lee Reportedly Killed in Combat,"A male ballet dancer. An award-winning female actor. A biathlete. An actor who posted glamorous selfies on Instagram to his nearly 13,000 followers until he joined up and uploaded two final shots of himself looking stylish in camouflage. These are some of the Ukrainian celebrities killed since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. Their deaths add an extra dimension to the country’s shock and anguish over the war. Artem Datsishin, one of Ukraine’s leading dancers and a former principal dancer with the National Opera of Ukraine, died on Thursday at a hospital in the capital city of Kyiv. He had been wounded last month by Russian artillery fire, according to posts by two friends on social media. Mr. Datsishin was a past winner of the prestigious Serge Lifar prize, named after a Ukrainian considered one of the 20th century’s most important ballet dancers and choreographers. “I cannot express my heartache,” said Tatiana Borovik on Facebook, in a post that announced the date of Mr. Datsishin’s funeral. The Ukrainian actress Oksana Shvets was killed in a rocket attack on the capital, the Kyiv Post newspaper reported on Thursday. Ms. Shvets was a member of the city’s Young Theater and had won the Merited Artist of Ukraine award in 1996. A photograph on the theater’s website shows her in costume onstage. The war is reducing the distance between famous and ordinary Ukrainians because so many non-celebrities are making heroic sacrifices, said Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of Ukraine’s Center for Civil Liberties. It has also made many people focus on issues of life and death that eclipse focus on fame. “Prominent people do not use their privileged status to escape but to stand with the whole nation in this dramatic time,” Ms. Matviichuk said, though she added that what has shocked her most about the war has been the killing of children. The International Biathlon Union mourned the death of a 19-year-old athlete, Yevhen Malyshev. It said in a Twitter post on March 2 that he died while serving in the military. Biathlon is a sport combining cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. Pasha Lee, an actor from Crimea, was killed in Irpin on Sunday, according to local journalists and the Odessa International Film Festival. The city, 15 miles northwest of Kyiv, has seen intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Mr. Lee, 33, worked in theater and cinema. He was also a television host, singer and composer. Before the war, his Instagram feed reflected a glamorous lifestyle. One picture showed him on a yacht, another scuba diving, a third in Dubai. Mr. Lee joined Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces when the war began. On March 1, he was pictured seated at a table in army fatigues and a beret. In his last Instagram post on March 4 he is again in combat gear, this time seated next to a woman also in uniform. The caption says they were being bombed, adding that “we smile because we will manage.” He died in shelling two days later.",29
2022-03-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/19/opinion/ukraine-russia-putin-history.html,Opinion | Putin Got Ukraine Completely Wrong,"LVIV, Ukraine — Ukraine is once again at the center of a potentially global conflict. World War I, as the historian Dominic Lieven put it, “turned on the fate of Ukraine.” World War II, according to the legendary journalist Edgar Snow, was “first of all a Ukrainian war.” Now the threat of a third world war hinges on what could happen in Ukraine. It’s a striking repetition. Why has Ukraine, a midsize country of more than 40 million people on the eastern edge of Europe, been at the epicenter of warfare not once, not twice, but three times? Part of the answer, at least, is geographical. Set between Russia and Germany, Ukraine has long been viewed as the site of struggle for the domination of the continent. But the deeper reasons are historical in nature. Ukraine, which has a common origin point with Russia, has developed differently over the course of centuries, diverging in crucial ways from its neighbor to the east. President Vladimir Putin likes to invoke history as part of the reason for his bloody invasion. Ukraine and Russia, he asserts, are in fact one country: Ukraine, in effect, doesn’t exist. This, of course, is entirely wrong. But he is right to think history holds a key to understanding the present. He just doesn’t realize that far from enabling his success, it’s what will thwart him. In 1904 an English geographer named Halford John Mackinder made a bold prediction. In an article titled “The Geographical Pivot of History,” he suggested that whoever controlled Eastern Europe would control the world. On either side of this vast region were Russia and Germany, poised to do battle. And in between was Ukraine, with its rich resources of grain, coal and oil. There’s no need to go into the finer details of Mackinder’s theory; it had its flaws. Yet it proved extremely influential after World War I and became something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thanks to the Nazi geopolitician Karl Haushofer, the concept migrated into Hitler’s “Mein Kampf.” Lenin and Stalin had not read Mackinder but acted as if they had. For them, Ukraine was the bridge that would carry the Russian Revolution westward into Germany, making it a world revolution. The path to conflict again ran through Ukraine. The war, when it came, was catastrophic: In Ukraine, around seven million perished. In the aftermath, Ukraine was sealed up in the Soviet Union, and the question for a time seemed settled. With the collapse of Communism, many believed that Mackinder’s thesis was outdated and the future belonged to independent and sovereign states, free from the ambitions of bigger neighbors. They were wrong. Mackinder’s argument — that Eastern Europe and Ukraine held the key for a contest between Russia and Germany — never went away. In fact, it took pride of place in Mr. Putin’s mind. With one change, however: He substituted Germany with the West in its entirety. Ukraine, to Mr. Putin, became the battleground for a civilizational contest between Russia and the West. He didn’t act on it at first. In the early years of his tenure, he seemed to expect — in line with those in Boris Yeltsin’s circle who oversaw the end of the Soviet Union — that Ukrainian independence wouldn’t last long. In time, Ukraine would be begging to be taken back. It didn’t happen. Though some Ukrainians remained under the sway of Russian culture, politically they leaned to the West, as shown by the Orange Revolution of 2004, when millions of Ukrainians protested against electoral fraud. So Mr. Putin changed course. Soon after the war in Georgia in 2008, in which the Kremlin seized control of two Georgian regions, he designed a new strategic policy for Ukraine. According to the plan, any steps Kyiv might take in the direction of the West would be punished with military aggression. The objective was to cleave off Ukraine’s Russophone east and turn the rest of the country into a vassal state headed by a Kremlin puppet. At the time, it seemed fantastical, ludicrous. Nobody believed it could be genuine. But by the final weeks of Ukraine’s Maidan revolution in 2014, in which Ukrainians demanded an end to corruption and an embrace of the West, it became horribly clear that Russia was intent on aggression. And so it proved: In a rapid-fire operation, Mr. Putin seized Crimea and parts of the Donbas. But crucially, the full extent of his ambition was thwarted, in large part through the heroic resistance mounted by volunteers in the country’s east. Mr. Putin miscalculated in two ways. First, he was hoping that, as had been the case with his war against Georgia, the West would tacitly swallow his aggression against Ukraine. A unified response from the West was not something he expected. Second, since in his mind Russians and Ukrainians were one nation, Mr. Putin believed Russian troops needed barely to enter Ukraine to be welcomed with flowers. This never materialized. What happened in Ukraine in 2014 confirmed what liberal Ukrainian historians have been saying for a long time: The chief distinction between Ukrainians and Russians lies not in language, religion or culture — here they are relatively close — but in political traditions. Simply put, a victorious democratic revolution is almost impossible in Russia, whereas a viable authoritarian government is almost impossible in Ukraine. The reason for this divergence is historical. Up until the end of World War I (and in the case of western Ukraine, the end of World War II), Ukrainian lands were under the strong political and cultural influence of Poland. This influence was not Polish per se; it was, rather, a Western influence. As the Harvard Byzantinist Ihor Sevcenko put it, in Ukraine the West was clad in Polish dress. Central to this influence were the ideas of constraining centralized power, an organized civil society and some freedom of assembly. Mr. Putin seems to have learned nothing from his failures in 2014. He has launched a full-scale invasion, seemingly intended to remove the Ukrainian government from power and pacify the country. But again, Russian aggression has been met with heroic Ukrainian resistance and united the West. Though Mr. Putin may escalate further, he is far from the military victory he sought. A master tactician but inept strategist, he has made his most profound miscalculation. Yet it’s one based on the belief that he is at war not with Ukraine but with the West in Ukrainian lands. It’s essential to grasp this point. The only way to defeat him is to turn his belief — that Ukraine is fighting not alone but with the help of the West and as part of the West — into a waking nightmare. How this could be done, whether through humanitarian and military help, incorporating Ukraine into the European Union or even supplying it with its own Marshall Plan, are open questions. What matters is the political will to answer them. After all, the struggle for Ukraine, as history tells us, is about much more than just Ukraine or Europe. It is the struggle for the shape of the world to come. Yaroslav Hrytsak is a professor of history at the Ukrainian Catholic University and the author, most recently, of a global history of Ukraine.

2022-03-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/world/asia/china-ukraine-russia-diplomacy.html,China Takes a Back Seat in International Diplomacy Over Ukraine,"China has repeatedly called for peace talks in Ukraine. What it has not done is press Russia to negotiate an end to a war that has already cost thousands of lives, displaced millions and threatened to disrupt the world’s economy and even food security. Despite calls from other world leaders to play a more proactive role, China has instead tried to keep its distance. It has urged peace but not stepped up to mediate or organize talks, leaving such efforts to far smaller powers, including France, Turkey and Israel. Intervening more forcefully, in the view of officials in Beijing, is fraught with political and economic risks that the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, appears reluctant to take. Instead it has sought to walk a careful line between the international outrage over Russia’s invasion and support for one of its most powerful partners. The result has been to leave China, diplomatically, on the sidelines of the conflict, unable or unwilling to wield influence commensurate with its growing economic and military might. “If Xi truly wants the crisis to end,” John Delury, a professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, said, “then the flat-footed response testifies to China’s impotence in world politics, despite decades of rising to great power status.” Officials in Beijing say they do want to see the carnage stop. In a video conference call with President Biden last Friday, Mr. Xi endorsed a two-part approach — a cease-fire, followed by humanitarian aid, according to Chinese officials. It is not clear, however, whether Mr. Xi has communicated that to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. They spoke the day after the war began on Feb. 24 but not since. Mr. Xi has yet to speak with Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky. As the fighting has dragged on, and with it the toll in human suffering, China’s diplomats have been forced into increasingly contorted defenses of Beijing’s stance. They have touted humanitarian aid to Ukraine but refused to criticize Mr. Putin’s government for causing the humanitarian crisis. China’s ambassador to Ukraine, Fan Xianrong, told officials in Lviv that China was “a force of good” for the country and praised the Ukrainian unity in the face of a war that officials in Beijing will not describe as an invasion. China’s avoidance of any criticism of Russia undermines its claim to be a neutral party. “Don’t be naïve,” China’s ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday when pressed to explain why China refused to criticize Russia’s invasion. “Condemnation doesn’t solve the problem.” China’s stance has already hardened views toward it in Europe, which has shown remarkable unity against the Russian invasion ahead of a planned summit between the European Union and China on April 1. It has also prompted warnings from the United States that explicit economic or military assistance to Russia would prompt harsh punishment against China. China’s policy is bound by the deep, even personal relationship Mr. Xi has forged with the Russian leader. The war has strained but so far not broken those bonds. Chinese officials also share Mr. Putin’s view of the United States, accusing it of fanning the flames that ignited the war by expanding NATO. They have also criticized the American use of economic and trade sanctions to punish Russia. In the zero-sum calculation that drives policymaking, pressing Russia to make concessions would effectively bolster the position of the United States and its allies. At the same time, China cannot afford to sever its ties with them, either. “China does not have any other partner of the same strategic weight as Russia, who shares his distrust of the current international order,” said Bilahari Kausikan, Singapore’s former ambassador to Russia and the United Nations. “And that’s the bottom line. They won’t do anything that would fundamentally jeopardize the relationship with Russia or undermine Putin’s grip on power.” In Washington, officials view Mr. Xi’s position as duplicitous, comparing it to China’s handling of the diplomacy around North Korea’s nuclear program. In that case, it has called for the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions, while still providing it with energy and other products to blunt the impact of United Nations sanctions. In some respects, the talks over North Korea’s nuclear program were a high-water mark for China’s international diplomacy. It played host to several rounds of negotiations that reached a landmark agreement in 2005 for North Korea to forsake its weapons in exchange for economic aid and security assurances. A year later the deal fell apart and the country’s leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, conducted a nuclear test. Since then, China’s role in international diplomacy has remained limited. On the United Nations Security Council, where China is one of the five permanent, veto-wielding powers, it has often played more of a supporting role than a leading one. In many cases that means joining Russia. When the war began, however, China was one of three of the 15 members that abstained from a resolution that condemned the invasion. (Russia vetoed it.) That raised some expectations that a crack might open between the two countries, but since then China has continued to provide diplomatic cover for Russia. Last week, Xue Hanqin, China’s judge on the International Court of Justice, the United Nations’ top judicial body, joined a Russian judge in dissenting from a ruling last week calling for Russia to halt its military campaign in Ukraine. In her dissent, Judge Xue wrote that a provisional ruling on Ukraine’s claim of a genocide unfolding would “not contribute to the resolution of the crisis in Ukraine.” In other international forums, too, China has gone so far as to discourage multilateral peace efforts, dismissing an appeal by Ukraine to bring up the war for debate in the ministerial meetings of the Group of 20 major economies, being held this year in Indonesia. “The G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation, not an appropriate platform to discuss political security issues such as Ukraine,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhao Lijian, said. The organization, he added, “should stick to its mandate.” China may find its position increasingly untenable as the human and economic toll rises in Ukraine, and beyond. The European Union’s chief diplomat has called on China to do more. So did the foreign minister of Singapore, which has maintained friendly relations with Beijing. “I think the first thing is that China has enormous influence on Russia, both politically, economically and diplomatically,” the minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, said in a forum organized by Bloomberg News. Even in China, there are voices urging the Chinese government to do more, arguing that bolder efforts should be expected of a country that aspires to global leadership. “We need to really get everybody together,” said Wang Huiyao, the president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing who has called for China to mediate and give Mr. Putin an off-ramp. “That’s where something is missing right now.” Others, though, see the war as an opportunity for China, if handled carefully. At a recent meeting of Chinese foreign policy and security scholars in Beijing to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, at least some concluded that there was “no urgency in bringing about an end to the war,” according to a summary of their discussion that was posted on a Chinese website. China also lacked experience in leading global negotiations, some of the scholars argued at the meeting organized by MacroChina, an economic research group based in Beijing. (The summary was later removed.) “The war is sapping the national strength of the old powers of the United States, Europe and Russia,” the summary described the scholars as saying. “China needs to watch the fire from the opposite bank and stay out of the war.” Claire Fu and Liu Yi contributed research.",22
2022-03-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/opinion/xi-putin-trump.html,"Opinion | Xi, Putin and Trump: The Strongmen Follies","The last five years have been a master class in comparative politics, because something happened that we’d never seen before at the same time: The world’s three most powerful leaders — Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Donald Trump — each took drastic steps to hold on to power beyond their designated terms of office. One failed. Two succeeded. And therein lies a tale that says so much about our world today. Trump failed for one very simple reason: American institutions, laws and norms forced him to cede power at the end of his four years — barely — despite both his efforts to discredit the electoral results and his unleashing of supporters to intimidate lawmakers into overturning his loss at the polls. Putin and Xi fared better — so far. Unencumbered by institutions and democratic norms, they installed new laws to make themselves, effectively, presidents for life. Pity their nations. Lord knows democracies have their problems today, but they still have some things autocracies lack — the ability to change course, often by changing leaders, and the ability to publicly examine and debate alternative ideas before embarking on a course of action. Those attributes are particularly valuable in an age of accelerating technological and climate change, when the odds are low that one person in his late 60s — as both Putin and Xi are — will make better and better decisions, more and more alone, as he gets older and older. Yet Putin arm-twisted his Duma in 2020 to essentially eliminate his term limits, allowing him to run for president again in 2024 and the chance to remain in office until 2036. And in 2018, Xi induced his lawmakers to change China’s constitution and abolish presidential term limits altogether, so he can officially remain in office forever — assuming that he is re-elected president at the National People’s Congress session in 2023. And you can assume that he will be. Deng Xiaoping imposed a two-consecutive-term limit to China’s presidency in 1982 for a reason — to prevent the emergence of another Mao Zedong, whose autocratic leadership and cult of personality combined to keep China poor, isolated and often in murderous chaos. Xi has driven right through that roadblock. He sees himself as indispensable and infallible. But as we can all see plainly, Putin’s performance in Ukraine is a walking, talking, barking advertisement for the perils of having a president for life, who believes that he’s indispensable and infallible. Ukraine is Putin’s war, and he got everything wrong: He overestimated the strength of his own armed forces, underestimated the willingness of Ukrainians to fight and die for their freedom and totally misread the willingness of the West, both governments and businesses, to unite to support Ukraine. Either Putin was fed nonsense by aides afraid to tell him the truth, or he had grown so sure of his infallibility that he never questioned himself or prepared his government or society for what his own spokesman has described as an “unprecedented” economic war by Western sanctions. All we know for sure is that he has banned all media criticism and made it virtually impossible for Russians to punish him at the polls for his barbaric folly. China is a more serious place, having brought some 800 million Chinese out of extreme poverty since the late 1970s. And Xi is more serious than Putin. Nevertheless, the perils of autocracy are showing. Xi was unwilling to do a serious investigation of how the coronavirus emerged, most likely in Wuhan, or, at least, share any findings with the world — for fear, it seems, that doing so might reflect poorly on his leadership. His reliance on a strategy of lockdowns, and on Chinese vaccines that appear to be less effective than other vaccines against the Omicron variant, is now seriously stressing his economy. And Xi’s bet on an alliance with Putin’s Russia has gone bad fast. When the two leaders met on Feb. 4, at the opening of the Olympics in China, they released a statement declaring that the “friendship between the two states has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation.” The fact that Putin apparently took that limitless friendship as a green light to invade Ukraine has clearly left Xi flummoxed and floundering. China is a big importer of oil, corn and wheat from Russia and Ukraine, so the Russian invasion has nudged up its costs for these and other food imports, while also helping to drive down China’s stock market (though it is bouncing back). It has also forced China to appear indifferent to Russia’s savaging of Ukraine, straining Beijing’s relations with the European Union, China’s biggest trading partner. I wonder how many officials in Beijing are now muttering: “If this is what happens when you have a president for life. …” I do take succor in the fact that one of the most hackneyed clichés in foreign policy is being exposed as nonsense: The leaders of China and Russia are so savvy, and always play the game of nations like chess grandmasters, while those stupid Americans — with their plodding, meat-and-potatoes approach to the world — know only how to play checkers. It actually looks to me as if Putin has not been playing chess, but Russian roulette — and that he ran out of luck and blew a hole right through the heart of the Russian economy. And Xi seems paralyzed, unable to figure out what game to play, as his heart wants to oppose the West and his head tells him that he can’t afford to. So, China stands neutral in the face of the biggest war crimes perpetrated in Europe since World War II. Meanwhile, Sleepy Joe over in the corner has been playing Legos — methodically adding one piece, one ally, after another, bound together by shared values and threats, and has built a solid coalition to manage this crisis. In short, for now at least, the messy democracies with their regular rotations in powers are outmaneuvering the presidents for life, who need to choke off all sources of dissent more than ever. This contrast could not come at a better time — when the global democracy movement had been stalling everywhere. Think of the evolution of democracy around the globe since World War II as having gone through several phases, argues Larry Diamond, the Stanford democracy expert and author of “Ill Winds: Saving Democracy From Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American Complacency.” After World War II, the U.S. and its Western allies had amazing momentum, so democracy began spreading across the globe before getting bogged down by the Cold War and actually going in reverse in the 1960s, as a result of a wave of military and executive coups in Africa, Asia and Latin America. But another wave of democracy started in the mid-1970s, after the downfall of dictatorships in Portugal, Spain and Greece. Democracy also spread to Asia — and almost China in Tiananmen Square. Then the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 let loose another democracy wave in Eastern and Central Europe, and Russia. But beginning in 2006, with the weakening of America because of two wars in the Middle East and the 2008 financial crisis — and the stunning economic rise of China — democracy went into “a global recession,” Diamond told me. “And China and Russia relentlessly pushed the narrative: ‘Democracies are weak and morally and politically decadent. They can’t get things done. Authoritarianism is the future.’” The question now, Diamond added, is this: Was that Feb. 4 declaration by Xi and Putin — “spelling out all the reasons why their ‘democratic’ systems were superior to the bankrupt, feckless liberal democracies”— actually the high-water mark for their autocracies? Because one thing is clear, quipped Diamond: The recent missteps of Putin and Xi “are giving authoritarianism a bad name.” But for the authoritarian wave to be sustainably reversed, two big things are necessary. One is for Putin’s savaging of Ukraine to fail. That could cause him to lose power. To be sure, a Russia with no Putin could turn out to be no better — or even worse. But if it is better, the whole world becomes better if Russia has a decent leader in the Kremlin. The second thing is even more important: It would be for America to demonstrate that it’s not just good at forging alliances abroad but that it can also build healthy coalitions again at home — to deliver good government, growth, uncontested transfers of power and a more perfect union. Our ability to do that in the past is what earned us the world’s esteem and emulation. That used to be us — and it can be again. If it is, then my favorite lyrics from the musical “Hamilton” will be so relevant. It is when George Washington explains to Alexander Hamilton why he is voluntarily stepping down and not running for a third term: The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-03-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/opinion/ukraine-war-russia-dissent.html,Opinion | Why We Need Wartime Dissent,"On Sept. 14, 2001, the House of Representatives passed what was understood to be a declaration of war against the perpetrators of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, by a vote of 420 to 1. The one dissenter was Barbara Lee, Democrat of California. At the time, her protest vote seemed like embarrassing peacenik nonsense, an example of left-wing folly at a time of moral clarity and necessary war. In recent days, since the invasion of Ukraine, the House has cast votes by similarly lopsided margins — 426 to 3 for a resolution urging various kinds of support for Kyiv, 424 to 8 to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus. The dissenters this time have been Republicans, a mixture of eccentric libertarians like Thomas Massie of Kentucky and crackpot populists like Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Just as I didn’t agree with Barbara Lee’s worldview, I don’t agree with the views that seem to be motivating today’s dissenting votes — and not just in their most paranoid, Greene-ian expressions. As I wrote last week, the Ukraine war has exposed certain limits to populist thinking generally: Organized as it is around the internal failures of Western and American elites, the populist response to a clear external threat has been a kind of anticipatory opposition, a critique of elite mistakes not yet in evidence. The shared populist assumption — on the anti-establishment right, the heterodox left and the new spaces where they intersect — seems to be that the Biden administration is destined to repeat the Bush administration’s War on Terror and Iraq-era mistakes. But so far this White House has taken a more cautious and controlled approach. Certain individual voices in the establishment have pushed for reckless escalation, but no equivalent of the hawkish “uniparty” of the early 2000s has yet reassembled. Instead, President Biden’s team seems to be following a Cold War playbook of cautious proxy war rather than embracing sweeping Bushian ambitions. And for every would-be Curtis LeMay on cable television or in the White House press room, there are noted anti-populists like David French and Tom Nichols warning their readers about the dangers of escalation, the threat of nuclear war. So I’m not here to offer three cheers for Massie or Greene or any other dissenter from our effort to support Ukraine. But having lived through the last two decades of failed American military efforts, and having watched as Lee’s lone vote in 2001 came to seem eventually like an admirable dissent rather than a far-left folly, I want to offer a single cheer, at least, for such dissent in present circumstances. At the very least, it should be possible to disagree with the dissenters provisionally, and to reject the kind of anti-anti-Putinism to which they’re often tempted, without pretending that all the reasons to doubt the wisdom of our foreign policy establishment have suddenly evaporated. Three connected realities, in particular, should guarantee the dissenters a place in the discussion. The first is simply the recent track record of American involvement in military struggles overseas. Since the Cold War’s end, whether we’ve put boots on the ground, dropped bombs or confined ourselves — as in Ukraine, so far — to arming combatants, our record of interventionism features numerous debacles, on the small scale of Somalia and Libya as well as the large scale of the Iraq war, and fewer unalloyed successes. If you made decisions retrospectively and reduced every case to a binary choice, “intervene or stay out,” the side saying “stay out” would generally have the better of the argument. There are excellent reasons — starting with the performance of the Ukrainians themselves — to think that this time is different, that a limited effort in support of the Kyiv government is in the American national interest in the way our bombing campaign in Libya or our endless quest for the “moderate rebels” in Syria wasn’t. But this leads to the second point, which is that dissent can still be important in cases where the interventionists are initially correct. Our decision to topple the Taliban in 2001, for instance, remains the right and necessary call in hindsight, notwithstanding the debacles that followed. But that didn’t make Lee’s dissenting vote any less important — because it anticipated the disaster of our nation-building effort, the over-expansive application of the authorization to use military force, the various abuses of presidential power in the War on Terror. Likewise, in the current moment there’s no way to know for sure whether Thomas Massie’s libertarian warnings about the House’s measures — that they’re overly broad, escalatory and liable to presidential abuse — will be borne out by events. But it’s entirely possible for arming Ukraine to be good policy and for Massie to be right that some elements of the American response to Russian aggression could go badly or disastrously astray. Finally, dissent matters because the potential scale of a disastrous outcome in a conflict with Russia is so much greater than even the worst-case scenarios in other recent wars. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that because of the Biden administration’s caution, there’s only a 5 percent chance that our support for Ukraine leads to unexpected escalation, to the American military’s direct involvement in the war. Whereas if you looked at the Bush administration’s policy toward Iraq in late 2002, you would have said that the odds of a war for regime change in that case were well over 50 percent. On that level, the Biden policy seems much safer for a cautious realist to support. But that hypothetical 5 percent risk carries with it some still-more-fractional risk of nuclear escalation, which is a much more existential danger than even the more disastrous scenarios for Iraq. That has to create its own distinctive set of calculations. Even if the Biden policy is the best course, you still need an unusual level of vigilance, a somewhat hyperactive caution, around the possibility of escalation. And here the anticipatory critique of elite failure that we’re getting from the populists becomes valuable: Not because it will necessarily be vindicated, but because even a small risk of elite folly is worth worrying over when nuclear weapons are potentially involved. For a practical example of that folly from Republican politics, consider the G.O.P. Senate primary in Ohio, where J.D. Vance has been running as a populist traitor to the intelligentsia that helped make his “Hillbilly Elegy” a best seller. (Full disclosure: I used to have long conversations with Vance about the future of the G.O.P., if you’d like to hold me responsible for the tone of his campaign.) That populist pitch has included a strong dose of anti-interventionism, which led him to declare his indifference to “what happens to Ukraine,” relative to domestic concerns, just before Vladimir Putin gave the order to invade. It’s a comment that has been highlighted and condemned by populism’s critics since the invasion, and in the recent Republican Senate debate Vance took predictable fire over the issue. But in the same debate the two candidates who are seemingly ahead of him in the polls, Mike Gibbons and Josh Mandel, both endorsed an improbable halfway kind of escalation — a no-fly zone somehow imposed by Europeans rather than Americans, with the idea that this would thread the needle between thwarting Russia and accidentally starting World War III. It was an idea that only Vance wholeheartedly condemned, and he was right. Under wartime conditions, the escalatory fantasies of his rivals — have our European allies close Ukraine’s skies, and then when they get into a shooting war with Russia, we do … what? — carry a more immediate risk than the dangers of populist indifference, the flaws of isolationist dissent. Dissent, the Bush-era left often proclaimed, is the highest form of patriotism. That may be overly dramatic and self-flattering. But at the very least we can say this much: In a context where elite mistakes and hawkish temptations could have atomic consequences, to read dissenters out of the debate makes the path to destruction much too wide and smooth for comfort.

2022-03-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia.html,U.S. Officials Meet With Brittney Griner in Russia,"One of the last times Brittney Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and seven-time All Star center for the women’s professional basketball team in Phoenix, appeared in public, it was on a Russian airport security video. She wore a Black Lives for Peace sweatshirt and rolled her luggage through security, where officers with Russia’s Federal Customs Service said they had found in her bag illegal vape cartridges that contained hashish oil. The authorities detained her on drug charges. Now, a month later, as Ms. Griner — too tall at 6-foot-9 for her top-bunk mattress — languishes in a cell she shares with two Russian inmates also accused of drug trafficking in a pretrial detention center near Moscow, American officials have finally been able to see her. “A consular official was able to visit Brittney Griner today and found her to be in good condition,” Jennifer L. Palmer, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said Wednesday. “We will continue to do everything we can to see to it that she is treated fairly throughout this ordeal.” Some supporters in Moscow and Washington are wary of raising Ms. Griner’s profile too high, or linking her case to the war in Ukraine and thus politicizing her as a pawn in a great power struggle. Family and friends of Ms. Griner, who if convicted faces 10 years in prison, have followed that advice, maintaining silence in the hopes of a back-channel resolution. Russia experts largely concur, saying that given the harsh sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its Western allies, a public pressure campaign adds little leverage, while more subtle attempts at de-escalation might yield some results. But as her detention has been prolonged to at least May, some frustrated supporters complain that the government is not doing enough, and are calling for a more vocal pressure campaign to free one of the most prominent and decorated athletes in American sports. “That keeps it in the public eye, so that we the people can keep demanding that the government do everything in its power to help Brittney,” said Debbie Jackson, Ms. Griner’s high school basketball coach in Houston, who said she believed there would be more attention on her case if she were a man playing in the N.B.A. Ms. Griner could hardly be more prominent: championships in college and professional basketball; a No. 1 overall selection in the 2013 draft; the Olympic medals; and four Euroleague crowns. And yet, the prospect of her being detained has been met mostly with silence. That is even more jarring because her sport has taken on a reputation for speaking out and raising social consciousness. Ms. Griner, the first openly gay athlete endorsed by Nike, contributed to that tradition by helping defeat a Texas bill that mandated transgender people use restroom facilities consistent with the gender of their birth certificate. The vacuum of outrage around the case may be a result, as Ms. Jackson and others believe, of Ms. Griner being a dominant woman in the W.N.B.A., rather than a male star in the N.B.A. Or it could be deference to the family’s desire to keep quiet and not upset any diplomatic efforts. But what is clear, according to Russia experts, is that the timing of Ms. Griner’s detention made an already excruciating situation worse. “The family and advocates of people being held in Russia on trumped-up charges face a horrible dilemma: Will quiet outreach pay off better than a public pressure campaign?” said Andrew S. Weiss, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Any calculation they might make is vastly complicated by the pressures imposed by the war in Ukraine,” he added, “and the near-total collapse of effective lines of communication between the U.S. and Russian governments.” According to one State Department official, part of the strategy has been to keep Ms. Griner’s case as low-key as possible to prevent the Russian authorities from seeing her as a valuable asset that increases their leverage. The official also said increasing focus on Ms. Griner could complicate her consular access, which has been a problem for other Americans detained in Russia. But Jason Rezaian, a writer for The Washington Post’s Global Opinions section whom Iran unjustly imprisoned for 544 days, said he fell squarely in the “amping up public pressure camp,” especially if an authoritarian government’s state-run news media publicized the detention. Calling more attention to a case might make the jobs of government officials “harder, in that they have to address this problem,” he said. “They would love nothing more sometimes than not to have to deal with these problems.” Mr. Rezaian said that in his own experience, but also in coordinating with other families held hostage by authoritarian governments, “everyone is always told to keep it quiet” to better their chances of release. But public pressure, he said, can work. Still, other former hostages acknowledged that it was an extremely difficult decision. “I think it’s a question all families struggle with. Six years on, I don’t think I know what the best solution is, to be honest,” Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman held for six years by the Iranian authorities, said on Monday. But Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe appeared to appreciate the benefits of having one’s plight on the public radar. “It has been cruel what happened to me,” she said. But she added that although her release had taken a long time, others remained in prison and she “was the lucky one who got to be recognized internationally.” In the meantime, Ms. Griner, 31, whose wife, Cherelle, has appealed for privacy “as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely,” remains in prison, with limited visibility. “It is our expectation that this not be a one-off visit,” Ned Price, the State Department’s spokesman, told reporters in Washington. Yekaterina Kalugina, a member of the public monitoring group allowed to visit prisons and check on inmate conditions, had a chance to visit Ms. Griner last week. She said in an interview that the basketball star “has a positive attitude” and had received from her lawyers shampoo for her dreadlocks and some books, including Dostoyevsky’s “Demons.” Her two cellmates speak some English, but the three, allowed a daily walk and a biweekly shower, mostly pass their time watching Russian television. Ms. Griner has been unable to send a letter to her family in the United States, Ms. Kalugina said, because they cannot register on the Russian prison’s service website. “She doesn’t pull her hair out,” Ms. Kalugina said. “She keeps herself calm and dignified.” The American embassy in Moscow said it has now procured a privacy waiver to speak about Ms. Griner’s case. The U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, has pressed Ms. Griner’s case with Russian officials, when given the chance. That occurred earlier this week, when Russia’s Foreign Ministry summoned Mr. Sullivan to express anger at President Biden for calling President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a “war criminal.” During the meeting, Mr. Sullivan, whose uncle served as the last U.S. ambassador in Tehran and was briefly held hostage in the American embassy during Iran’s 1979 revolution, demanded that the Kremlin follow international law and allow consular access to detained U.S. citizens. But beyond getting that access, it is not clear what pressure — especially publicly — would help get Ms. Griner home. Russia has for years sought the release of two intelligence agents arrested by American officials. In an apparent response, Russia arrested Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine, who is serving a nine-year sentence on charges of assaulting police officers, which his family argues were politically trumped up. In 2020, another former Marine, Paul Whelan, received a 16-year jail sentence in an espionage trial that was itself secret. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken has brought up their cases to his Russian counterpart, but the United States seems to have resisted a prisoner swap. Ms. Griner’s case is much different. Like many W.N.B.A. players, she plays abroad in the off-season to supplement her salary, in her case for the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg. Her detention would appear to set a dangerous precedent for athletes, including Russian athletes, in tournaments around the world. Ms. Griner was one of the first women to dunk a basketball in a college game and holds the N.C.A.A. distinction, among men and women, for scoring at least 2,000 points and blocking 500 shots. But during this month’s N.C.A.A. tournament, the showpiece event of the college season, her name has hardly been uttered. One exception was the N.B.A. player Chris Boucher, a forward for the Toronto Raptors, who last weekend brought her situation up in a postgame interview. “I just want to talk about Brittney Griner,” he said. “She’s in Russia, and it’s like nobody is talking about it. So, it would be good to put attention on that because she’s still holed up over there.” Jason Horowitz reported from Rome, Jonathan Abrams from Charlotte, N.C., and Ivan Nechepurenko from Istanbul.

2022-03-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/us/politics/pegasus-israel-ukraine-russia.html,Israel Blocked Sale of Pegasus Spyware to Ukraine and Estonia,"KYIV, Ukraine — The Israeli government rejected requests from Ukraine and Estonia in recent years to purchase and use Pegasus — the powerful spyware tool — to hack Russian mobile phone numbers, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Israel feared that selling the cyberweapon to adversaries of Russia would damage Israel’s relationship with the Kremlin, they said. Both Ukraine and Estonia had hoped to buy Pegasus to gain access to Russian phones, presumably as part of intelligence operations targeting their increasingly menacing neighbor in the years before Russia carried out its invasion of Ukraine. But Israel’s Ministry of Defense refused to grant licenses to NSO Group, the company that makes Pegasus, to sell to Estonia and Ukraine if the goal of those nations was to use the weapon against Russia. The decisions came after years of Israel providing licenses to foreign governments that used the spyware as a tool of domestic repression. Pegasus is a so-called zero-click hacking tool, meaning that it can stealthily and remotely extract everything from a target’s mobile phone, including photos, contacts, messages and video recordings, without the user having to click on a phishing link to give Pegasus remote access. It can also turn the mobile phone into a tracking and secret recording device, allowing the phone to spy on its owner. In the case of Ukraine, the requests for Pegasus go back several years. Since the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, the country has increasingly seen itself as a direct target of Russian aggression and espionage. Ukrainian officials have sought Israeli defense equipment to counter the Russian threat, but Israel has imposed a near-total embargo on selling weapons, including Pegasus, to Ukraine. In the Estonian case, negotiations to purchase Pegasus began in 2018, and Israel at first authorized Estonia to have the system, apparently unaware that Estonia planned to use the system to attack Russian phones. The Estonian government made a large down payment on the $30 million it had pledged for the system. The following year, however, a senior Russian defense official contacted Israel security agencies to notify them that Russia had learned of Estonia’s plans to use Pegasus against Russia. After a fierce debate among Israeli officials, Israel’s Ministry of Defense blocked Estonia from using the spyware on any Russian mobile numbers worldwide. Israel’s relationship with Russia has come under close scrutiny since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began several weeks ago, and Ukrainian officials have publicly called out Israel’s government for offering only limited support to Ukraine’s embattled government and bowing to Russian pressure. During a virtual speech to the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine criticized Israel for not providing his country with the Iron Dome antimissile system and other defensive weapons, and for not joining other Western nations in imposing strict economic sanctions on Russia. Invoking the Holocaust, Mr. Zelensky said that Russia’s war was aimed at destroying the Ukrainian people just as the Nazis had wanted destruction for the Jewish people. Mr. Zelensky, who is Jewish, said “mediation can be between states, but not between good and evil.” The New York Times reported last month that Israeli officials in August rejected a request by a Ukrainian delegation to purchase Pegasus, at a time when Russian troops were massing at the Ukrainian border. On Wednesday morning, The Washington Post and The Guardian, part of a consortium of news organizations called The Pegasus Project, reported that these discussions dated back to 2019, and first reported that Israel had blocked Estonia’s efforts to obtain Pegasus. A senior Ukrainian official familiar with attempts to acquire the Pegasus system said that Ukrainian intelligence officials were disappointed when Israel declined to allow Ukraine to purchase the system, which could have proved critical for monitoring Russian military programs and assessing the country’s foreign policy goals. The official said Ukraine’s view was that Israel, in making decisions about licensing Pegasus, gave more weight to a government’s relationship with the Kremlin than its human rights record. Representatives of the Ukrainian embassy in Washington and the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. In a statement, NSO said the company “can’t refer to alleged clients and won’t refer to hearsay and political innuendo.” Both Ukraine and Estonia were once part of the Soviet Union, and since then have had to live in the long shadow of Russia’s military. Estonia is a member of NATO. Russia plays a powerful role throughout the Middle East, particularly in Syria, and Israel is wary of crossing Moscow on critical security issues. In particular, Russia has generally allowed Israel to strike Iranian and Lebanese targets inside Syria — raids the Israeli military sees as essential to stemming the flow of arms that Iran sends to proxy forces stationed close to Israel’s northern border. Israel’s government has long seen Pegasus as a critical tool for its foreign policy. A New York Times Magazine article this year revealed how, for more than a decade, Israel has made strategic decisions about which countries it allows to obtain licenses for Pegasus, and which countries to withhold them from. Israel’s government has authorized Pegasus to be purchased by authoritarian governments, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, that have used the weapon to spy on dissidents, human rights activists and journalists in those countries. Democratically elected leaders in India, Hungary, Mexico, Panama and other countries also abused Pegasus to spy on their political opponents. Israel has used the tool as a bargaining chip in diplomatic negotiations, most notably in the secret talks that led to the so-called Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and several of its historic Arab adversaries. “Policy decisions regarding export controls, take into account security and strategic considerations, which include adherence to international arrangements,” the Israeli defense ministry said in a statement in response to questions from The Times. “As a matter of policy, the State of Israel approves the export of cyber products exclusively to governmental entities, for lawful use, and only for the purpose of preventing and investigating crime and counter terrorism, under end use/end user declarations provided by the acquiring government.” Since NSO first sold Pegasus to the government of Mexico more than a decade ago, the spyware has been used by dozens of countries to track criminals, terrorists and drug traffickers. But the abuse of the tool has also been extensive, from Saudi Arabia’s use of Pegasus as part of a brutal crackdown on dissents inside the kingdom, to Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary authorizing his intelligence and law enforcement services to deploy the spyware against his political opponents. Last November, the Biden administration put NSO and another Israeli cyberfirm on a “blacklist” of firms that are barred from doing business with American companies. The Commerce Department said the companies’ tools “have enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression, which is the practice of authoritarian governments targeting dissidents, journalists and activists outside of their sovereign borders to silence dissent.” Ronen Bergman reported from Kyiv, and Mark Mazzetti from Washington.",8
2022-03-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/world/europe/ukraine-cellist-bach-kharkiv.html,"Ukrainian Cellist Plays Bach in the Ruins of His Hometown, Kharkiv","LVIV, Ukraine — Denys Karachevtsev has played his cello in some of the most prestigious concert halls in Austria, Japan and Turkey and even in Tunisia’s ancient amphitheater, El Jem. Now he is playing in the ruins of his Ukrainian hometown, Kharkiv. In a recently posted video, Mr. Karachevtsev performs Bach’s somber Cello Suite No. 5 in the center of a deserted street strewn with the debris. His backdrop: the regional police headquarters, its windows blown out by Russian shelling. On Facebook, he said he hoped to draw attention to the plight of the city, Ukraine’s second largest, which has been bombed mercilessly by the Russian military. Ukraine’s police said that as of March 20 more than 600 multistory buildings in Kharkiv, including schools, had been destroyed. “I am a cellist and a citizen of Kharkiv,” Mr. Karachevtsev wrote in an appeal on Facebook in English, Ukrainian and Russian. “I love my heroic city, which is now struggling to survive the war,” he wrote. “I deeply believe that we can help. I believe we can restore and rebuild our city and our country when the war is over. I am launching my project in the streets of Kharkiv to raise funds for humanitarian aid and restoration of the city’s architecture. Let’s unite to revive our city together!” In recent days, Mr. Karachevtsev has performed the national anthem of Ukraine in the city center. Mr. Karachevtsev is a graduate of the Ukrainian National Tchaikovsky Academy of Music, in the capital, Kyiv. His performance called to mind stories of Ukrainian musicians performing in extreme conditions, like Vera Lytovchenko, who played lullabies on her violin in a Kyiv bomb shelter. Or the professional pianist Irina Maniukina playing Chopin’s Aeolian Harp Étude on a baby grand piano that survived a missile strike on her hometown Bila Tserkva, before leaving home for the last time. The rest of the apartment was covered in debris and shards of glass. As she sat down to play, she brushed the patina of destruction off the keys. During the nearly four-year siege of Sarajevo that ended in 1996, Vedran Smajlovic played Albinoni’s Adagio in G Minor on his cello in ruined buildings, including the Vijecnica, the Bosnian capital’s destroyed city hall. He also played at funerals despite the threat of sniper fire. His powerful music became a sign of resilience and of the triumph of humanity over brutality. Now it is Mr. Karachevtsev doing the same.",29
2022-03-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/opinion/demography-russia.html,Opinion | A Low Birthrate Was Supposed to Weaken Russia. What Happened?,"Pundits like to say demography is destiny, but the people who know the subject best — demographers — don’t entirely agree. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is an example of how a purely demographic analysis can be more confounding than clarifying, says Jennifer Sciubba, the author of a forthcoming book, “8 Billion and Counting: How Sex, Death and Migration Shape Our World.” After the breakup of the Soviet Union, many experts viewed its remnant, Russia, as a lessened threat because of its low birthrate and high death rate, says Sciubba. In her book she cites Robert Gates, who served as secretary of defense under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama from 2006 to 2011. In a 2009 article in Foreign Affairs, Gates, who has a doctorate in Russian and Soviet history from Georgetown University, wrote that Russia’s nonnuclear forces were weaker than those of the Soviet Union and “adverse demographic trends in Russia will likely keep those conventional forces in check.” Sciubba, who has a doctorate from the University of Maryland and teaches at Rhodes College in Memphis, had heard that argument before. “When I worked in the Pentagon in the mid-2000s, people were eager to write off Russia because of its ‘dire demographics,’” she writes in “8 Billion and Counting.” (President Vladimir Putin of Russia himself said in 2006 that population decline was the biggest crisis facing the country.) Doubters about Russia were right about the demographics: Before its breakup, the Soviet Union was more populous than the United States, but Russia alone is considerably smaller, and its population is on a slow downward trajectory, while the U.S. population is expected to keep growing, according to United Nations projections. But the invasion of Ukraine, which began after Sciubba finished the book, shows that demographic liabilities haven’t sidelined Russia. “Perhaps,” Sciubba writes, “we should recalibrate our expectation of the relationship between aging and national security. One relevant theory does come to mind: Power transition theory, which argues that a state with declining power will act aggressively while it still can, would explain Russia’s actions as a last gasp and shed light on why rapidly aging China is doubling down on its military.” Sciubba warns policymakers against letting their hopes influence their predictions. For example, she writes: “China’s population growth and high fertility were criticized as a huge weakness, sure to undermine any of the communist government’s efforts at global domination. Now, its aging population and low fertility are criticized as a liability. Can both criticisms be valid?” I interviewed Sciubba ahead of the book’s publication date, which is Tuesday. “There’s a lot of desirability bias” in demographic analysis, she said. “People see what they want to see.” Used incorrectly, a demographic analysis can put a sheen of scientific credibility on what’s essentially a guess about the future. “Demography,” she writes in the book, “is not destiny.” The decline in labor’s share of national income in the United States is sometimes portrayed as a defeat for the proletariat in the kind of power struggle that Karl Marx wrote about. That’s not completely wrong. But tax policy, starting with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 signed by President Ronald Reagan, accounts for about a third of the decline of labor’s share of corporate-sector income, according to research by Matthew Smith of the Treasury Department; Danny Yagan of the University of California, Berkeley; Owen Zidar of Princeton; and Eric Zwick of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. “Entrepreneurs have flexibility to characterize their income as labor payments or as profits” and, to minimize tax rates, are choosing to label the income as profits, the authors write in the latest version of a paper that’s forthcoming in American Economic Review: Insights. Also, they write, “many labor-intensive firms are now organized outside the corporate sector as tax-preferred partnerships.” Zwick told me he’s “definitely sympathetic” with the view that capitalists are winning against labor. But he said that highly paid consultants, lawyers and others whose compensation is being relabeled as profit instead of wages don’t fit the picture of exploited workers: “They’re the bourgeoisie in the Marx story.” How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins (Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines, But) of fine unclipt gold, where dully rests Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines, Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp: — Yes! ready money is Aladdin’s lamp. — Lord Byron, “Don Juan,” canto 12, stanza 12 (1819-24) Have feedback?

2022-03-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/opinion/ukraine-democrats-fossil-fuel-climate-change.html,Opinion | We’re in a Fossil Fuel War. Biden Should Say So.,"On one hand, it would seem uncontroversial to point out that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a war enabled and exacerbated by the world’s insatiable appetite for fossil fuels. It couldn’t not be so: Russia is a petrostate — its economy and global influence are heavily reliant on its vast reserves of oil and natural gas — and Vladimir Putin its petromonarch, another in a line of unsavory characters whom liberal democracies keep doing business with because they’ve got something we can’t live without. The way out of this bind would also appear obvious and urgent. By accelerating our transition to cheap and abundant renewable fuels, we can address two grave threats to the planet at once: the climate-warming, air-polluting menace of hydrocarbons and the dictators who rule their supply. And yet American politicians on the left sure seem incapable of drawing out this connection, don’t they? In his State of the Union address shortly after Russia’s invasion, President Biden whiffed on a major opportunity to revive his stalled climate change agenda by underlining the geopolitical dangers of fossil fuels. His references to climate change — what he has previously called an “existential threat” to the planet — were buried under, rather than connected to, his comments about the war. Concerned with the effects that disruptions might have on fuel supplies, gas prices and inflation in general, he also announced the release, with 30 other nations, of 60 million barrels of oil. Meanwhile, pundits on the right have had a field day with the notion that Russia’s invasion somehow points up the folly of focusing on climate change. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board blamed “the Biden Administration’s obsession with climate” for making “the U.S. and Europe vulnerable to Mr. Putin’s energy blackmail” and wrote that “the climate lobby has made Mr. Putin more powerful.” I feel like I’m in the upside-down. If the “climate lobby” were truly so powerful, it might have long ago prevented Europe from building its society upon a devilish bargain with Russian energy. For all their “obsession with climate,” Democrats in the United States Senate have been unable to pass legislation to address climate-warming emissions. Instead, their bill has been stymied by a coal-friendly senator. Now the problem of climate change has been all but overshadowed by the war. Some Democrats seem to have forgotten the planet altogether — Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, wants to give every car owner in his state up to $800 in rebates to offset the high price of gas. This could have been a moment for moral clarity on the dangers of fossil fuels — but so far, Democrats have fumbled that message. “This narrative has not been out there — that this war is why we need to get off of fossil fuels,” said Leah Stokes, a political scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies environmental politics. “More groups need to be connecting the dots, making the case that true energy independence is about running on sunshine, because sunshine is free and abundant and cannot be controlled by dictators.” Stokes points out that such a message is likely to resonate with people. A study she and a co-author published online in 2017 examined the political factors that led to clean energy policies. “What we found was, overwhelmingly, these policies were passed during energy crises,” she told me. It’s when energy is expensive or hard to get that Americans begin to realize that they ought to look for some new way. The good news is that Democrats have that new way all lined up. Build Back Better, the massive social and environmental policy bill that fell apart in the Senate late last year, includes a litany of excellent ideas to address the current crisis. That effort is not totally dead; Democrats are still negotiating with Joe Manchin, the West Virginia senator holding up the bill, and they could still rally and pass some parts of it. But I’m flummoxed why Biden and the Democrats have yet to aggressively make the case for their proposals in the new context of war — to point out that climate policy is not unrelated to foreign policy, and that freeing ourselves from other people’s fuels is the best long-term solution to skyrocketing energy prices. I spoke to several climate policy advocates who lamented the White House’s apparent reluctance to sharpen this message. Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the director of climate policy at the Roosevelt Institute, told me that “the ways in which fossil fuels make energy prices far more volatile and put us at the behest of powers and leaders that can act in ways that are dangerous and unjust” has rarely been more obvious. “I have not seen that more visibly in my lifetime,” she said. But it was an interview that Svitlana Krakovska, a Ukrainian climate scientist who is a member of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, gave that brought home the argument for me. Krakovska recently told The Guardian that as Russian bombs began to fall on Ukraine, she reflected on the interconnected nature of her area of study and her country’s peril. I’ll let her have the final words: “I started to think about the parallels between climate change and this war and it’s clear that the roots of both these threats to humanity are found in fossil fuels,” Krakovska said in the interview. “Burning oil, gas and coal is causing warming and impacts we need to adapt to. And Russia sells these resources and uses the money to buy weapons. Other countries are dependent upon these fossil fuels; they don’t make themselves free of them. This is a fossil fuel war. It’s clear we cannot continue to live this way; it will destroy our civilization.” Farhad wants to chat with readers on the phone.

2022-03-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/world/europe/european-tree-of-the-year-russia.html,Poland Wins European Tree of the Year After Russia Is Banned,"Drinkers are boycotting Russian vodka. Small and large U.S. cities are cutting ties with their Russian “sister cities.” And in one of the latest examples of symbolic efforts to isolate Russia from the rest of the world, a group in Brussels disqualified Russia’s candidate — an oak tree said to have been planted 198 years ago by the novelist Ivan Turgenev — from the European Tree of the Year competition. “We cannot stand idly by and watch the unprecedented aggression of the Russian leadership against a neighboring country,” the organizers of the competition, one of the largest competitions devoted to trees, said in a statement. The European Tree of the Year competition was founded in 2011 as a way to celebrate the histories of old trees and develop bonds between nations around a subject that was seemingly as neutral as anything could be: trees. But with war escalating in Ukraine, even a competition devoted to celebrating trees found itself unable to remain separate from global politics. At an awards ceremony in Brussels on Tuesday, the organizers announced this year’s winner: Poland, for a 400-year-old oak tree that organizers said had become a symbol of Polish resistance to aggression and its warm welcome to refugees from Ukraine. The second place tree was a 250-year-old oak tree in the Santiago de Compostela region of Spain, and third place went to a 250-year-old cork oak tree in Vale do Pereiro, a village in Portugal. The Polish tree sits in the Bialowieza forest, the last primeval forest in Europe’s lowlands, which stretches across the border of Poland and Belarus. This year, construction workers began work on a 115-mile, 18-foot-high metal wall through the forest, intended to block migrants, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, from crossing into Poland from Belarus. When the candidates in this year’s competition were announced in early February, the tree was a symbol of the protest against that wall, said Josef Jary, one of the organizers. But since Russia invaded Ukraine, prompting more than three million people to flee across Europe, it’s become a symbol of the protection that Poland provided to some of them, he said. Most of the 15 countries — 16, with Russia — that participated in the competition this year first held a national contest to select the year’s entry. They submit the winner to the European-wide competition, and then members of the public vote for their two favorite entries on the European Tree of the Year website. This year, nearly 770,000 votes were cast. Some countries participate more enthusiastically than others. Rob McBride, the British liaison of the tree competition, said that every year, he struggles to rally support for the competition in Britain, which has never won. “When it goes to Europe, people switch off a bit,” Mr. McBride said. This year, Britain entered a hawthorn tree that was crowned British tree of the year in December, but Mr. McBride said he voted for the Polish tree and the Spanish tree. Mr. McBride objected to Russia’s elimination from the competition, because he said what drew him to trees were their connections to shared histories. “I’d rather keep politics out of nature projects and trees especially,” he said. “Trees are apolitical.” Mr. Jary, who is based in Brussels, said the decision to join other cultural and sports groups in boycotting Russia was painful. “I can imagine a lot of normal Russian people without any political interest voted for their lovely tree, and they were very disappointed,” he said, but added that the organizers felt it was necessary to protest President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. While grass-roots efforts are largely symbolic and do not carry the weight of sanctions and other restrictions on Russian financial institutions, they still leave Russians isolated from the rest of the world. In a letter to the competition’s organizers, Sergey Palchikov, Russia’s tree competition liaison, said that Russia was withdrawing indefinitely and would focus its national competition. “With unconcealed surprise and chagrin, we learned that the Russian tree, the famous Turgenev Oak, planted by the hands of the great Russian writer Ivan Turgenev and killed by a hurricane at the end of last year, was practically killed with your help for the second time,” Mr. Palchikov wrote, pointing out that Russia’s trees were among the winning trees in previous years. (Those results had themselves been the subject of some controversy. Last year, the competition’s organizers announced they had identified “attempts to distort the just competition and deceitfully influence the results” in favor of one of the entries — Russia’s, Mr. Jary said. Mr. Palchikov said he did not know who was responsible for the fraudulent votes.) Ludek Niedermayer, a member of the European Parliament, said he fully supported the decision to ban Russia from the competition because it would be unacceptable to celebrate together with Russians right now, given the events unfolding in Ukraine. Competitions like the Tree of the Year help engage members of the public, and engagement and awareness is crucial for building a better, more peaceful and connected world, he said. “It makes people active, and people that are active care about what’s going on,” he said. The tree competition “shows us we’re different, but in many things we’re similar — we can talk to each other, compete and cooperate.”",29
2022-03-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/world/europe/ukraine-war-social-media.html,How Ukrainians Are Using Social Media to Stir Resistance,"KRAKOW, Poland — A peace activist in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv rolled 109 baby strollers into a square last week to represent the children who had been killed in the war with Russia. Hours later, the image was available to millions on their phones. A little girl sheltering in a basement in Kyiv sang a haunting rendition of “Let it Go,” from the movie “Frozen,” and the clip sped around the world. A cellist performed a somber Bach suite on a street in Kharkiv, with debris and the windowless facade of a damaged building serving as his backdrop, and thousands watched. These heart-wrenching glimpses of life in Ukraine since the Russian invasion have become powerful ammunition in an information war playing out on social media. For some, the messaging has become a crucial battleground complementing the Ukrainian military’s performance on the physical front lines, as images and information ripple out on Instagram, Facebook, Telegram and TikTok. “We are experiencing the war very viscerally through social media feeds,” said Emerson Brooking, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based international-affairs think tank. “The transformation of Ukraine into a nation at war is just stark. And so it has especially resonated with Western audiences.” Social media has long been a place where activists organize and share news, as well as a place to recruit fighters or seed disinformation. But in this battle, the proliferation of pictures showing the human toll of the war has helped Ukraine project an image of a country of stalwart survivors with the moral high ground, while casting Russia as a merciless aggressor — an impression reinforced by global condemnation and sanctions. Mr. Brooking said that Ukraine had an additional advantage because Russia had not engaged in the same level of disinformation as it has in the past, in part because the government in Moscow has denied the extent of the war. But Russian government accounts have actively questioned the veracity of verified Ukrainian civilian accounts appearing on social media. Those efforts have only deepened Anastasiya Magerramova’s determination to show the world the devastation in Ukraine. Ms. Magerramova, 27, press secretary for the Okhmatdyt pediatric hospital in Kyiv, said she feels that she is fighting her own battle — a struggle for truth alongside the conflict among soldiers — as her compatriots take up arms. Ms. Magerramova and a handful of colleagues have documented the civilians streaming in with injuries. She and some others have moved into the hospital, sleeping in the wards and working around the clock, phones in hand and cameras at the ready. They post the images on Instagram, Facebook, and Telegram with detailed descriptions of what happened to those shown in the pictures. “I feel that my job is important, it is also like a weapon,” she said. “I want to show the people the consequences of this war: poor children with shrapnel in their legs, their arms, in their heads. It’s not OK, it shouldn’t be like this.” The hospital’s social media accounts have become a running documentation of the civilian toll, showing — often in excruciating detail — the suffering of those caught up in the war. On Saturday, Ms. Magerramova posted a photo on social media of a young mother, Olga, who had used her body to shield her baby from shelling. The family’s travails — the father was also injured — instantly reverberated around the world, picked up first by the government, then by activists, Ukrainian news media and later, international outlets. The personal stories keep Ms. Magerramova’s phone ringing as she fields calls from journalists around the world. Civil society groups and humanitarian organizations based inside and outside of Ukraine have also played a vital role in amplifying voices, turning into a sort of activist army to verify and disseminate information. Marta Barandiy set up Promote Ukraine, a nongovernmental media hub, in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. When the full-scale invasion began in February, the group’s volunteer ranks swelled and it expanded its online presence. Dozens now volunteer, spending their days posting information online, some working remotely from Europe and some sharing updates from Ukrainian cities under siege. “We are trying to be a deep communication platform for Ukrainians who are in Ukraine, as well as for Ukrainians who have fled Ukraine who have stories to share,” Ms. Barandiy said. Her group translates reports from those on the ground and from government sources into English, and this week began staging news conferences to further amplify the stories. Some of her group’s volunteers are working out of a Ukrainian civil society hub recently opened in a European Parliament building in Brussels. Maryna Yaroshevych, head of advocacy for Promote Ukraine, said she thought the power of some of the images had already contributed to public pressure for sanctions on Russia. “They are opening the hearts of Europeans and people around the world,” she said. “This way, average people can pressure politicians to intervene and do something.” While some information sharing is coordinated, many of the most wrenching images have spread organically, Mr. Brooking of the Atlantic Council said. There have also been a number people aggregating details shared on Telegram accounts run by the government and written in Ukrainian, and then sharing them on Twitter in English, putting them in front of the eyes of thousands of international journalists. “There are definitely funnels which are releasing more raw war footage into Twitter,” Mr. Brooking said. “So it is coordinated in that fashion, but after those images are released, my sense is really viral momentum is based more on the images themselves.” Because the fighting has made some parts of Ukraine inaccessible to all but a handful of journalists, the personal tales shared by civilians on social media have become even more compelling. Nadezhda Sukhorukova, who managed to escape the besieged southern port of Mariupol and is now near Odessa, a city further to the west, with her son, has described living a “hell” as the Russians shelled Mariupol incessantly. For weeks, she hid out in a basement, only daring to venture out for necessities. “A neighbor said that God left Mariupol. He was afraid of everything he saw,” Ms. Sukhorukova wrote in a series of Facebook posts after her escape late last week. The only international journalists who had remained in recent weeks were a team from The Associated Press. But they were forced to flee last week after appearing on a Russian hit list. So Ms. Sukhorukova’s account, like the other sporadic retellings that have filtered out, has been crucial to conveying the devastation in Mariupol. “The dead lie in the entrances, on the balconies, in the yards,’’ Ms. Sukhorukova wrote in one of the posts shared thousand of times. She said in an interview by phone that she did not expect her story to be of interest to anyone and had composed the ideas in her head when the internet was cut “just to not go crazy.” Her first posts were to tell friends that she was alive. “Once, I thought that if I write, everything will change,” she said. “But, unfortunately, no one is taking people out of the city, no one is closing the sky.” Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy who has studied how information spreads online, said that while social media sometimes allows disinformation to thrive, it can also be an amplifier of unheard voices. She said she hoped to see the focus remain on the accounts streaming out from Ukraine, particularly if and when the Western media’s focus on the war wanes. “It’s going to be even more important that people document and share their direct experiences of the war,” she said, “and that concerned audiences don’t look away.” Nataliia Novosolova contributed reporting from Vinnytsia, Ukraine.",29
2022-03-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/26/opinion/culture/social-media-war-ukraine.html,Opinion | What Elon Musk’s Putin Challenge Shows About the Meme-ification of War,"Last week, as heavy bombardment rocked Ukrainian cities, killing civilians and sending millions fleeing, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, the man behind the vicious attacks, was challenged to a duel by the billionaire Elon Musk. Mr. Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, tweeted at the official Twitter account of Mr. Putin’s presidential office, challenging the president to “single combat” with the “stakes” being Ukraine. The response in the Twittersphere was gleeful: There were mock-up posters promoting the big fight, and Photoshopped images that cast Mr. Musk as the Terminator or Rocky Balboa. Putin supporters — including the Russian space chief Dmitry Rogozin — mocked Mr. Musk for the tweet, and Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman head of Chechnya, a part of Russia, offered to train Mr. Musk, to “change from the gentle (effeminate) Elona into the brutal Elon you need to be.” “I’ve seen this movie before,” one person tweeted, alongside a meme of the billionaire superhero Iron Man with Mr. Musk’s face overlaid. There was something unsettlingly familiar and Hollywood-like about the moment. It was almost as if the tweeters had forgotten they were discussing a complex geopolitical situation, in which millions of lives are at stake — and not just another celebrity feud. And perhaps that’s inevitable, when Russia’s war on Ukraine itself has became a kind of meme on social media, with images of exploded tanks, refugee convoys and body bags interspersed with Wordle humble brags, NFT hype-tweets and your friends’ adorable pets. “One of the strangest experiences of the modern world is following a war on social media,” Trevor Noah said on a recent segment of The Daily Show. “Because all the other stuff on social media doesn’t go away. It just gets mixed in together.” The war in Ukraine, which has been called the world’s “first TikTok war,” has eroded the boundaries between war journalism and social media #content — from celebrities and socialites posting glamorous selfies with promises of thoughts and prayers in the captions to whatever the heck the actor AnnaLynne McCord’s slam poetry was. The Atlantic has called the flood of war-adjacent content “milling,” a sociological term to describe what the magazine called the often “Ugly, Embarrassing Spectacle” that ensues in the immediate aftermath of tragedy. But it’s important to note that this is not necessarily a natural social phenomenon. Rather it is the direct result of an algorithm developed by profit-seeking companies. “Social media is optimized for the quickest and hottest and most outrageous takes,” Max Stossel, an adviser at the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit organization dedicated to reimagining digital infrastructure, told me. “It’s a process that’s really at odds with accuracy and thoughtfulness.” And as social media becomes, for an increasing number of people, a primary source of news, the structures of the medium itself can warp our understanding of what’s happening in the world. The Canadian communication theorist Marshall McLuhan noted in 1951 that the front page of a newspaper illustrated daily the “complexity and similarity of human affairs,” with news from all over the world printed side by side. Despite what he called “the frequent sensational absurdity and unreliability of the news,” Mr. McLuhan conceded that the total effect of this mosaic approach “is to enforce a deep sense of human solidarity.” On social media, however, these disparate items appear singularly, and they disappear as we slide our thumbs down our screens. The result isn’t a mosaic but a blur in which the trivial follows the dire, the personal appears alongside the public. War starts to blend with entertainment (after all, it keeps popping up on one of the devices many turn to for entertainment). Before we know it, we have a tech billionaire challenging the Russian president to a fight, as if they were in a high school locker room. And the crowd cheers them on. What’s the harm, you might ask? For one thing, some of what we see on social media is simply untrue, which can mislead us about the facts of what’s happening. Take, for example, a video of what appeared to be a young Ukrainian girl confronting a Russian soldier, which went viral at the end of February. In fact, the video was from 2012, and showed the Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi confronting an Israeli soldier. Besides raising important questions about why certain conflicts seem to garner our clicks and others do not, the mislabeled video is illustrative of the kind of broken-telephone messaging that happens when we mindlessly “like” and share. Even without blatant untruths, by compressing complex global events into flat images that can be understood with little context, social media tends to promote simplistic narratives that confirm existing biases. This leaves users incredibly vulnerable to misinformation and propaganda — as in Russia, where misleading videos, images and clips present the war as a righteous conflict. All this scrolling can also lead to compassion fatigue. For Mr. McLuhan, who famously declared that “the medium is the message,” the tactile experience of media — in his time print publications, radio and television — was an essential component of its effect on the audience. On social media, as we banish posts to the ether with a flick of the thumb, we caress their images, gently touching the army tanks, the faces of celebrities, the bodies of civilians in the street; we wear them close to our chest and sleep next to them at night. This intimacy with violence and suffering can feel disturbing or emotionally triggering; it can also be desensitizing. It also promotes a sense of complacency; we believe we already know what is happening, and can be downright smug in our convictions about who are the “bad guys” and who are the “good guys.” For Putin supporters, Mr. Musk’s tweet was further evidence of the West’s plot against Russia; for Mr. Musk’s fans, it was just another reason to love the irreverent billionaire. Some of the strangest replies to Mr. Musk’s tweet were the ones thanking him for “helping” Ukraine. It’s unclear how, exactly, they believed the tech executive was helping the country, or why they would think Ukraine was his to gamble, but it’s indicative of how attention is often conflated with activism on social media. This isn’t to say that nothing good can ever come from attention garnered on social media. For a counterexample, see President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine’s effective pleas for international support, which have raised morale and helped to raise substantial funds for Ukrainian people (including, according to Zelensky, $35 million, thanks to the efforts of Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, largely through social media). The videos he has released have helped him come across as statesmanly and unifying, a leader who has been compared to Winston Churchill. In the foreword for “The Mechanical Bride,” Mr. McLuhan references Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, “A Descent Into The Maelström,” in which a sailor saves himself from drowning in a whirlpool by studying its currents and observing its movements with detachment. In this same way, we might try to identify and recognize the algorithmic undercurrents at the center of social media — but for most of us, the more practical solution is probably to just step away, and to find a better way to stay informed about world events.

2022-03-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/opinion/putin-culture-war.html,Opinion | Putin’s Proxy Culture War,"Recently I reached out to Serhiy Leshchenko, one of Ukraine’s most prominent investigative journalists, whom I’d met in Kyiv shortly before Donald Trump’s first impeachment. At the time, Leshchenko was being regularly smeared by people in Trump’s orbit who placed the journalist at the center of an elaborate conspiracy theory designed to make it look as if Trump was fighting corruption in Ukraine, not encouraging it. Now Leshchenko is advising the chief of staff for Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, on Russian disinformation. He’s been especially worried about Russian lies about Ukrainian chemical and biological weapons, fearing that their purpose is to sow confusion ahead of a possible Russian chemical weapons attack. “Every day they have dozens of different stakeholders” promoting falsehoods about unconventional weapons made in Ukraine, he said. “It has to have an explanation. Why do they repeatedly say the same stuff?” Leshchenko’s fear is shared by some American officials. “Based on a number of factors, some of which I can’t discuss, I sadly would be surprised if they don’t use chemical weapons,” Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, told me last week. Given the stakes, it’s alarming to Leshchenko to hear influential Americans repeating Russian talking points. “You maybe know this Georgia congresswoman, Marjorie Greene?” he asked, and then mentioned a recent floor speech in which Greene speculated that bioweapons labs in Ukraine could end up killing people. Last week, further juicing the conspiracy theory, the Russian government linked the alleged biolabs to Hunter Biden and George Soros. On Thursday, Tucker Carlson picked up the Hunter Biden story line. (America has funded programs in Ukraine to secure labs studying pathogens and toxins, sometimes for vaccine development, and to watch for disease outbreaks.) There is, said Leshchenko, a pattern to Russian disinformation campaigns. This one started, he said, with anonymous social media accounts. Then it was propagated by Russian propaganda outfits like Russia Today, followed by Russian officials like Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and Vladimir Putin himself. Finally it went global. In information warfare, Leshchenko said, it helps to have “international recognition” of fictitious claims. Elements of the American right were happy to supply it. Russia’s war on Ukraine has for the moment led many Republicans to rediscover their inner Cold Warriors. But pro-Putin sentiment — or, at least, anti-anti-Putin sentiment — remains strong on parts of the right. As NBC’s Ben Collins and Kevin Collier reported, “The biolab conspiracy theory has taken over as the prevailing narrative on pro-Trump and QAnon websites like The Great Awakening and Patriots.” With Trump out of power, it can be tempting to dismiss the import of such fantasies, but the Republican Party doesn’t have a great record of standing up to its fringe — witness the recent QAnon-inflected attempt to link the Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson to pedophilia. Having watched Trump try to extort Zelensky, Ukrainians know it can be geopolitically consequential when crackpot Russian conspiracy theories gain a foothold in American politics. Putin, presumably, knows this as well, which helps explain why he’s appealing to Anglophone culture warriors. On Friday, Putin gave a speech in which he complained about cancel culture and compared Russia’s international isolation to denunciations of the “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling for her views on gender. It was preposterous, but it was also a signal to the Western right that his struggle is theirs. It’s what Putin has been doing for years, particularly in the wake of the annexation of Crimea in 2014, when, as Casey Michel wrote in Politico, “Moscow began forging a new role for itself at the helm of the global Christian right.” Defending itself from Russia, Ukraine has been waging a globalized culture war of its own, trying to rally the world to an idealized liberal internationalism. Zelensky has framed Ukraine’s fight for survival as a fight not just for national self-determination, but for progressive modernity. As he said in his address to Congress, “Today, the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the future.” He speaks to the highest aspirations of Western audiences who’ve been starved for inspiration. Some of the most resonant videos coming out of Ukraine are about their determination to keep music in their lives even in wartime — like the man playing cello on a ruined street in Kharkiv, and the people in Odessa building fortifications while a band performs Bon Jovi’s “It’s My Life.” These videos go viral because they link the staggering courage of the Ukrainians to a common Western culture: Ukrainians seem like us as we wish we were. The ability of Ukraine to elicit international solidarity has been among its most potent weapons in this war. Against it, Putin needs some solidarity of his own, and the natural place for him to look for it is among liberalism’s enemies. He is working to cultivate cynicism about Ukrainian heroism, and convince those alienated by Western culture to identify with Russia. If he’s going to visit further atrocities on the Ukrainians, it helps to have Americans claiming it’s their own fault. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-03-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/opinion/tulsi-gabbard-tucker-carloson-ukraine.html,Opinion | Calling Gabbard and Carlson Traitors on Russia Only Grows Their Appeal,"It’s an old story: In times of war, antiwar voices are labeled disloyal. This month, the former Democratic representative Tulsi Gabbard appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show on Fox News, where they both alleged that the United States was secretly funding dangerous biological research laboratories in Ukraine. Prominent politicians and commentators responded by calling them traitors. Senator Mitt Romney declared that “Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda. Her treasonous lies may well cost lives.” Representative Adam Kinzinger suggested that “Tulsi should go to Russia.” The former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann insisted that Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Carlson “are Russian assets and there is a war. There’s a case for detaining them militarily.” On the ABC daytime show “The View,” the co-host Whoopi Goldberg observed, “They used to arrest people for doing stuff like this.” Indeed they did. In 1918, the socialist labor leader Eugene Debs was sentenced to 10 years in prison for urging Americans not to fight in World War I. During World War II, the Justice Department indicted 26 Americans who espoused pro-Nazi views, even though none were shown to have conspired with Hitler’s regime. Sometimes the people who challenge American foreign policy are noble. Sometimes they’re loathsome. Either way, calling them traitors is almost always wrong. It’s wrong morally because rhetorical intimidation can easily become legal persecution. And it’s wrong conceptually because domestic dissenters are rarely the marionettes of foreign foes. Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Carlson’s isolationist, populist and conspiratorial foreign policy views are quintessentially American. As self-styled dissidents, Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Carlson gain strength by skewering the corruption and insularity of America’s foreign policy elite. Their views are often odious, but calling them disloyal is precisely the wrong way to blunt their appeal. The genesis of Ms. Gabbard’s and Mr. Carlson’s opinions about Russia and Ukraine isn’t the Kremlin. It’s the war in Iraq. Ms. Gabbard has said her deployment there in 2004 “changed my life completely, as an individual as well as my perspective on the world.” Since then, she’s made opposition to U.S. military intervention her ideological North Star. At times that has led her to ignore the atrocities of America’s foes, such as when she voted in 2016 against a resolution accusing Syria’s government of war crimes. But at other times her anti-interventionist instinct has proved sound. Had the Obama administration heeded her call for a full withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2011, the United States might not have wasted billions of additional dollars on an unwinnable war. Mr. Carlson has traveled a parallel journey. After working early in his career at The Weekly Standard, which aggressively promoted the Iraq invasion, he felt betrayed by the Washington hawks who he claimed had persuaded him to support it. “I think it’s a total nightmare and disaster,” he said in a 2004 interview, “and I’m ashamed that I went against my own instincts in supporting it.” In the interview, he mentioned that he had called the antiwar conservative Pat Buchanan to apologize for having publicly criticized him. By 2008, when Mr. Carlson was still working at MSNBC, he was speaking at rallies for the isolationist presidential candidate Ron Paul. None of this had anything to do with Vladimir Putin. Tragically, Mr. Carlson decided Mr. Buchanan was right not only about Iraq. Mr. Carlson became a vocal proponent of Mr. Buchanan’s broader worldview, which fused skepticism about military intervention with disdain for nonwhite immigrants. And since Donald Trump’s election, Mr. Carlson has become television’s most influential purveyor of racist views. He’s lavished praise on Hungary’s authoritarian, nativist prime minister, Viktor Orban, and claimed that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court nomination has turned the United States into “Rwanda.” Last month he said that Mr. Putin can’t be that bad because he doesn’t call white people racists. Mr. Carlson and Ms. Gabbard are the latest in a long line of American politicians and commentators whose disillusioning experience with an ill-fated war mushroomed into paranoia about the interventionist inclinations of the American foreign policy elite. When Mr. Carlson says “the Biden administration may be finally getting the conflict it has longed for” and Ms. Gabbard alleges that some in the Biden administration “actually want Russia to invade Ukraine” because “the military-industrial complex is the one that benefits from this,” they are echoing 20th-century isolationists like Senator William Borah of Idaho and the historians Charles Beard and Harry Elmer Barnes, whose bitterness over America’s entrance into World War I led them to blame America and Britain, more than Nazi Germany, for the outbreak of World War II. Mr. Carlson’s and Ms. Gabbard’s views may be marginal in Washington. But as Mr. Trump’s election showed, telling Americans they’re being duped by a warmongering, globalist elite can be a potent message. And answering it requires recognizing the way America’s foreign policy establishment fuels populist distrust. Washington’s military-industrial complex did not orchestrate Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But many of President Biden’s top foreign policy aides did spend their years between government service at either consulting firms funded by defense contractors or think tanks funded by defense contractors. Few politicians acknowledge how unethical that is. By contrast, Ms. Gabbard — who this year claimed that both Democrats and Republicans in Washington are “essentially in the pocket of the military-industrial complex” — calls the defense industry’s political influence a scandal. Many Americans who don’t share Mr. Carlson’s racial views still find it galling that politicians and pundits who lauded America’s wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya can appear on television to promote their latest hawkish stance without being reminded of the disasters those wars became. Mr. Carlson does remind them, often viciously. Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Carlson have identified a genuine problem: the corruption and lack of accountability that plague American foreign policy. Addressing that problem will sap their appeal. Calling them traitors will only ensure that it grows.

2022-03-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/opinion/ukraine-war-putin.html,Opinion | What if Putin Didn’t Miscalculate?,"The conventional wisdom is that Vladimir Putin catastrophically miscalculated. He thought Russian-speaking Ukrainians would welcome his troops. They didn’t. He thought he’d swiftly depose Volodymyr Zelensky’s government. He hasn’t. He thought he’d divide NATO. He’s united it. He thought he had sanction-proofed his economy. He’s wrecked it. He thought the Chinese would help him out. They’re hedging their bets. He thought his modernized military would make mincemeat of Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainians are making mincemeat of his, at least on some fronts. Putin’s miscalculations raise questions about his strategic judgment and mental state. Who, if anyone, is advising him? Has he lost contact with reality? Is he physically unwell? Mentally? Condoleezza Rice warns: “He’s not in control of his emotions. Something is wrong.” Russia’s sieges of Mariupol and Kharkiv — two heavily Russian-speaking cities that Putin claims to be “liberating” from Ukrainian oppression — resemble what the Nazis did to Warsaw, and what Putin himself did to Grozny. Several analysts have compared Putin to a cornered rat, more dangerous now that he’s no longer in control of events. They want to give him a safe way out of the predicament he allegedly created for himself. Hence the almost universal scorn poured on Joe Biden for saying in Poland, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” The conventional wisdom is entirely plausible. It has the benefit of vindicating the West’s strategy of supporting Ukraine defensively. And it tends toward the conclusion that the best outcome is one in which Putin finds some face-saving exit: additional Ukrainian territory, a Ukrainian pledge of neutrality, a lifting of some of the sanctions. But what if the conventional wisdom is wrong? What if the West is only playing into Putin’s hands once again? The possibility is suggested in a powerful reminiscence from The Times’s Carlotta Gall of her experience covering Russia’s siege of Grozny, during the first Chechen war in the mid-1990s. In the early phases of the war, motivated Chechen fighters wiped out a Russian armored brigade, stunning Moscow. The Russians regrouped and wiped out Grozny from afar, using artillery and air power. Russia’s operating from the same playbook today. When Western military analysts argue that Putin can’t win militarily in Ukraine, what they really mean is that he can’t win clean. Since when has Putin ever played clean? “There is a whole next stage to the Putin playbook, which is well known to the Chechens,” Gall writes. “As Russian troops gained control on the ground in Chechnya, they crushed any further dissent with arrests and filtration camps and by turning and empowering local protégés and collaborators.” Suppose for a moment that Putin never intended to conquer all of Ukraine: that, from the beginning, his real targets were the energy riches of Ukraine’s east, which contain Europe’s second-largest known reserves of natural gas (after Norway’s). Combine that with Russia’s previous territorial seizures in Crimea (which has huge offshore energy fields) and the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk (which contain part of an enormous shale-gas field), as well as Putin’s bid to control most or all of Ukraine’s coastline, and the shape of Putin’s ambitions become clear. He’s less interested in reuniting the Russian-speaking world than he is in securing Russia’s energy dominance. “Under the guise of an invasion, Putin is executing an enormous heist,” said Canadian energy expert David Knight Legg. As for what’s left of a mostly landlocked Ukraine, it will likely become a welfare case for the West, which will help pick up the tab for resettling Ukraine’s refugees to new homes outside of Russian control. In time, a Viktor Orban-like figure could take Ukraine’s presidency, imitating the strongman-style of politics that Putin prefers in his neighbors. If this analysis is right, then Putin doesn’t seem like the miscalculating loser his critics make him out to be. It also makes sense of his strategy of targeting civilians. More than simply a way of compensating for the incompetence of Russian troops, the mass killing of civilians puts immense pressure on Zelensky to agree to the very things Putin has demanded all along: territorial concessions and Ukrainian neutrality. The West will also look for any opportunity to de-escalate, especially as we convince ourselves that a mentally unstable Putin is prepared to use nuclear weapons. Within Russia, the war has already served Putin’s political purposes. Many in the professional middle class — the people most sympathetic to dissidents like Aleksei Navalny — have gone into self-imposed exile. The remnants of a free press have been shuttered, probably for good. To the extent that Russia’s military has embarrassed itself, it is more likely to lead to a well-aimed purge from above than a broad revolution from below. Russia’s new energy riches could eventually help it shake loose the grip of sanctions. This alternative analysis of Putin’s performance could be wrong. Then again, in war, politics and life, it’s always wiser to treat your adversary as a canny fox, not a crazy fool. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-03-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/opinion/ukraine-clash-of-civilizations.html,"Opinion | Yes, There Is a Clash of Civilizations","In 1996 the political scientist Samuel Huntington offered several strong claims about the post-Cold War world. Global politics was becoming not just “multipolar” but “multicivilizational,” he argued, with competing powers modernizing along different cultural lines, not simply converging with the liberal West. “The balance of power among civilizations” was shifting, and the West was entering a period of relative decline. A “civilization-based world order” was emerging, in which societies “sharing cultural affinities” were more likely to group themselves into alliances or blocs. And the would-be universalism of the West was setting the stage for sustained conflict with rival civilizations, most notably with China and the Islamic world. These claims were the backbone of Huntington’s book “The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order,” which was seen as a sweeping interpretive alternative to Francis Fukuyama’s “end of history” thesis, with its vision of liberal democracy as the horizon toward which post-Cold War societies were likely to converge. The Huntington thesis would seem ripe for new attention in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the surprisingly unified Western response, the more uncertain reactions from China and India. But more often lately Huntington has been invoked either warily, on the grounds that Putin wants a clash of civilizations and we shouldn’t give it to him, or in dismissal or critique, with the idea being that his theory of world politics has actually been disproved by Putin’s attempt to restore a Greater Russia. That’s the argument offered, for instance, by the French scholar of Islam Olivier Roy in a recent interview with Le Nouvel Observateur. Roy describes the Ukraine war as “definitive proof (because we have many others) that the ‘Clash of Civilizations’ theory does not work” — mostly because Huntington had predicted that countries that share Orthodox Christianity would be unlikely to go to war with one another, but instead here we have Putin’s Russia making war, and not for the first time, against a largely Orthodox Christian neighbor, even as he accommodates Muslim constituencies inside Russia. Writing for the new outsider journal Compact, a would-be home for radicals of the left and right, Christopher Caldwell also invokes Huntington’s seemingly falsified predictions about Orthodox Christian unity. But then he also offers a different reason to reject Huntington’s application to our moment, suggesting that the civilizational model has been a useful framework for understanding events over the last 20 years, but lately we have been moving back to a world of explicitly ideological conflict — one defined by a Western elite preaching a universal gospel of “neoliberalism” and “wokeness,” and various regimes and movements that are trying to resist it. This is a right-wing reading of the global landscape, one hostile to the Western missionary zeal that it describes. But Caldwell’s analysis resembles the popular liberal argument that the world is increasingly divided between liberalism and authoritarianism, democracy and autocracy, rather than being divided into multiple poles and competing civilizations. Yet both of those contemporary arguments offer weaker interpretive frameworks than the one Huntington provided. No theory from 25 or 30 years ago is going to be a perfect guide to world affairs. But if you want to understand the direction of global politics right now, the Huntington thesis is more relevant than ever. To see why, cast your mind back to the years just after his book was published — the turn of the millennium, the Bush and early Obama years. In those days Huntington’s analysis was often invoked to explain the rise of jihadi terrorism, the Islamist resistance to the power of the West. But in every other theater of the world, his thesis looked relatively dubious. American power didn’t seem to be obviously declining. China was integrating with the Western world and liberalizing to some degree, not charting its own civilizational course. Russia in Putin’s first term seemed to aspire to alliances with America and Europe and to a certain kind of democratic normalcy. In India the forces of Hindu nationalism weren’t ascendant yet. And even in the Muslim world, there were repeated moments, from the Green Movement in Iran to the Arab Spring, that seemed to promise 1989-style democratic revolutions followed by convergence with the West. The first years of the 21st century, in other words, provided a fair amount of evidence for the universal appeal of Western capitalism, liberalism and democracy, with outright opposition to those values confined to the margins — Islamists, far-left critics of globalization, the government of North Korea. The last decade, on the other hand, has made Huntington’s predictions of civilizational divergence look much more prescient. It isn’t just that American power has obviously declined relative to our rivals and competitors, or that our post-9/11 efforts to spread Western values by force of arms so often came to grief. The specific divergences between the world’s major powers have also followed, in general ways, the civilizational patterns Huntington sketched out. China’s one-party meritocracy, Putin’s uncrowned czardom, the post-Arab Spring triumph of dictatorship and monarchy over religious populism in the Middle East, the Hindutva populism transforming Indian democracy — these aren’t just all indistinguishable forms of “autocracy,” but culturally distinctive developments that fit well with Huntington’s typology, his assumption that specific civilizational inheritances would manifest themselves as Western power diminishes, as American might recedes. And then, just as tellingly, the region where this recent divergence has been weaker, the post-Cold War wave of democratization more resilient, is Latin America, about which Huntington acknowledged some uncertainty whether it deserved its own civilizational category, or whether it essentially belonged with the United States and Western Europe. (He chose the former; the latter seems more plausible today.) Then what about Huntington’s specific predictions about Ukraine, raised by Roy and Caldwell in critique? Well, there he did get something wrong: Though he accurately foresaw internal Ukrainian divisions, the split between the Orthodox and Russian-speaking east and the more Catholic and Western-leaning west, his assumption that civilizational alignments would trump national ones hasn’t been borne out in Putin’s war, in which eastern Ukraine has resisted Russia fiercely. That example fits a larger pattern: None of the emerging non-Western great powers have yet built grand alliances based on civilizational affinities, meaning that the third of the four big Huntingtonian predictions looks like the weakest one today. He imagined, for instance, that a rising China might be able to peacefully integrate Taiwan and maybe even draw Japan into its sphere of influence; that scenario seems highly unlikely at the moment. Instead, wherever smaller countries are somehow “torn,” in his language, between some other civilization and the liberal West, they usually prefer an American alliance to an alignment with Moscow or Beijing. This speaks to the West’s resilient appeal, to enduring American advantages even in a multipolar world. But it doesn’t mean that liberalism is poised for some sweeping return to the position it occupied when American strength was at its height. None of the ambiguous and ambivalent reactions to Putin’s war outside the Euro-American alliance suggest a sudden springtime for the liberal-international world order. And while aspects of Fukuyama’s end of history have clearly spread beyond the liberal West, it’s as often the shadow side of his vision — consumerism and childless anomie — as the idealism of democracy and human rights. Still less does the conflict in Ukraine mean that the export of American-style “wokeness,” however much it may preoccupy Putin, is poised to become the focal point for a new global ideological conflict. Quite the reverse: Most of wokeness feels inward-looking and parochial, a specifically Western and especially Anglo-American response to disappointments with the neoliberal period. Rather than offering a universal message, its key slogans and ideas really make sense only inside America and Europe — what could “interrogating whiteness” possibly mean to the middle class of Mumbai or Jakarta or to the young elites of Bahrain or Beijing? And it’s clearly tailored to an age of perceived American decline, offering a program of moral and spiritual renewal on the one hand but also a way to justify a certain mediocrity and torpor because, after all, too much focus on excellence or competition smacks of white supremacy. Interestingly, the wokeness wars reveal another key thing that Huntington may have gotten wrong. His main fear for the Western world in an age of civilizational competition was that it would abandon its own cultural distinctiveness and that multiculturalism especially would be its undoing — that the United States might even fragment into English- and Spanish-speaking enclaves under the pressure of mass immigration. And some of the recent convergences between North American and Latin American politics — the growing appeal of right-wing populism and socialism in the United States, the rise of evangelicalism and Pentecostalism in South America — map onto those predictions. But the battles over wokeness are not necessarily an example of ethnic Balkanization or multiculturalism gone too far. Instead the current culture war may actually be reducing ethnic polarization in our political parties — drawing some racial minorities rightward, for instance — while resurfacing some of the oldest divides in Anglo-American politics. The woke often seem like heirs of the New England Puritans and the utopian zeal of Yankeedom; their foes are often Southern evangelicals and conservative Catholics and the libertarian descendants of the Scots-Irish; and the stakes in the debates are competing interpretations of the American founding, the Constitution, the Civil War and the settlement of the frontier. The present American culture war, then, vindicates Huntington in the larger sense, while cutting against one of his specific fears. Our various battles over race and sex, liberalism, education and religion, are indeed a response to a world that no longer takes American hegemony or liberal universalism for granted. But they aren’t — or at least aren’t yet — a surrender to dissolving forces, a post-American descent. Rather, if there’s going to be a clash of civilizations, the clash inside America is over what kind of civilization ours should be.

By erasing the demarcation between work time and leisure time, there is a risk that employers will consider all hours of the day work time. The use of technology to keep us connected has already done much to erode the division between professional and personal. A fuzzy schedule could make it much worse if the result is workers who are always working. There is also the risk of a new form of class division. Would those who write their own schedule accept the same from the cooks, restaurant servers, parcel delivery drivers, teachers, retailers and repair technicians who provide services for them? Some jobs need to happen during certain hours, and workers will need to work schedules that do not match their biological rhythms or allow them “flextime.” When some are allowed to live in utopia, how do you compensate those who are not? Wayne SmithGrand Junction, Colo. To the Editor: Re “Who Is the Office For?” (Sunday Business, March 13): Emma Goldberg highlights consequential changes in the workplace, induced by the pandemic but long in coming. Remote work has become common practice for a growing proportion of Americans. Individuals are no longer hostage to fixed, daily 9-to-5 routines controlled by employers, but are empowered to negotiate work lives as partners in professional relationships, not as members of an underclass in a two-tier economic system. Personal productivity is rewarded more than office socialization, especially for women who are relieved of pressures to “fit in” to the male-woven cultural fabric of the traditional office, and are freed to confine their interactions to work and their downtime to themselves and their families. Tradition-bound institutions are proving that decisive leadership can change entrenched workplace behaviors, loosening organizational chains that bind people to their desks, and burden them with work rules and practices they may abhor.

To the Editor: Re “The Evolution of an Enigma” (front page, March 27): Roger Cohen points out in his analysis of Vladimir Putin’s leadership in Russia that among the reasons that Mr. Putin decided to invade Ukraine was that he perceived Europe, the U.S. and NATO to be weak and divided, as shown by the modest sanctions imposed on his country in the face of its earlier incursions into Georgia and Ukraine. But there may be another reason that Mr. Putin struck Ukraine now — he feared he might not have many more years to live. He will turn 70 in October, and over the past two years he has isolated himself against Covid, using a comically long table for meetings for fear of getting the disease. Presumably he is also aware that he has already exceeded the male life expectancy in Russia (68 as of 2019). In other words, I think Mr. Putin wanted the glory of conquering Ukraine — and emerging, in his view, as another Peter the Great or Stalin — but it had to happen before he died.

At 75, that’s a long time. Senator Joe Manchin has been in “public service” in West Virginia for four decades.

2022-04-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/world/europe/eu-europe-china-summit-ukraine-russia-trade.html,Europe Asks China Not to Aid Russia’s War in Ukraine,"BRUSSELS — The European Union on Friday called on China not to aid Russia’s war against Ukraine or to subvert Western sanctions on Moscow, in the first summit meeting between the two sides in two years. The summit, in separate sessions with Beijing’s leaders, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping, came as tensions were high over Beijing’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, China’s record on human rights and its trade boycott of Lithuania for hosting a representative office of Taiwan. Europe-China relations have essentially been in a deep freeze since the E.U. imposed sanctions on China last year for its abuses against the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, and China answered by penalizing members of the European Parliament. Friday’s summit meeting produced no joint statement or any specific agreement, and there was no joint news conference. But China and the bloc are each other’s largest trade partners, and China is eager to preserve and enhance its trade with the bloc, but without upsetting its relations with Russia, a friendship it declared had “no limits” just days before the Ukraine invasion. With tensions high, the main effort of the meeting Friday was to try to manage the relationship with China, E.U. officials said. As expected, the Chinese leaders said that they favored an early peace in Ukraine, but did nothing to pull back from their alliance with Russia. Both sides agreed that “this war is threatening global security and the world’s economy,” said Charles Michel, president of the European Council, after the virtual summit. “Any attempts to circumvent sanctions or provide aid to Russia would prolong the war,” he said, leading “to more loss of life and greater economic impact.” Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission president, said that the Europeans emphasized that “no European citizen would understand any support to Russia’s ability to wage war,” which “would lead to major reputational damage for China here in Europe.” But China, as a member of the U.N. Security Council committed to upholding international law, could do much good for itself by influencing Russia, its ally, to quickly end the war, she said. In normal times, Ms. von der Leyen noted, Chinese trade with the European Union is nearly 2 billion euros a day, while Chinese trade with Russia is about 330 million euros a day. There was little doubt, then, that for the Chinese leaders, economic relations were paramount. In a statement issued by Mr. Xi, he concentrated on mutual cooperation and urged Brussels “to form its own perception of China, adopt an independent China policy and work with China for the steady and sustained growth of China-E.U. relations.” China has regularly tried to break the European Union’s close relations with the United States, which have only been reinforced because of the war in Ukraine. Mr. Xi mentioned the war in Ukraine only in passing, noting that it came on top of the coronavirus pandemic and slower global growth, while urging Brussels and Beijing to help stabilize “a turbulent world.” The statement issued after the session with Mr. Li, which came first and lasted two hours, twice as long as the session with Mr. Xi, was similarly bland. “China has been promoting talks for peace in its own way and will continue to work with the E.U. and the international community to play a constructive role for early easing of the situation, cessation of hostilities, prevention of a larger-scale humanitarian crisis, and the return of peace at an early date,” the statement said. But as it aligns itself with Russia, China has for the first time criticized the NATO alliance in terms copied from Moscow. Since then, Washington has publicly warned China not to provide any material or financial support to Russia’s war, including helping Russia to avoid Western sanctions. China has always been eager to divide European Union countries from the United States and even from one another, said Philippe Le Corre, a China expert and a senior fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and at the Carnegie Endowment. But with China’s positions on Ukraine, its “no limits” friendship with Russia, its attacks on NATO, its actions in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, its refusal to let the world investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and its moves against Lithuania, Mr. Le Corre said, “China has an increasingly bad image in Europe, too.” Consequently, he said, “this meeting seems to have been a dialogue of the deaf.” The Europeans tried to convince the Chinese not to interfere with sanctions against Russia, he said, “but that’s the best they can hope for.” Still, China seems caught by the difficulties of Russia’s war and embarrassed by the destruction. Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that China still supports Ukraine’s independence and would work with the international community to call for a cease-fire. But two days ago, on Wednesday, Mr. Wang hosted his Russian counterpart, Sergei V. Lavrov, and insisted that relations between China and Russia had withstood “the test of changes in the international situation” and that Beijing wants to take bilateral relations to “an even higher level.” He added, echoing China’s past language, that “China-Russia cooperation has no limits.” China is also unhappy with how closely Brussels has aligned itself with Washington over Ukraine. The state broadcaster CCTV wrote in an editorial on Tuesday that Europe, “which has been repeatedly stabbed in the back by the United States,” should not make the same mistakes and be “dragged into danger by the U.S.” The last summit meeting between the European Union and China was in June 2020. Then in December 2020, just before President Biden took office, the E.U. and China sides signed a Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, a deal that was much criticized by the European Parliament and by Washington. Later, after China responded to E.U. sanctions over its abuses in Xinjiang by sanctioning members of the European Parliament, the parliament refused to take up ratifying the agreement, which is now considered dead. One of those sanctioned, Reinhard Bütikofer, a German Green Party member who heads the European Parliament’s China delegation, noted the surprise to Moscow and Beijing of Western solidarity over Ukraine. The European Union, he said, must “underpin this strategic solidarity with democratic countries by making it clear to the Chinese leadership that any violation of the Western sanctions regime against Russia will have direct consequences.” Relations are hardly improved by China’s economic sanctions against tiny Lithuania, which last year dared to open a representative office of the Taiwan government, effectively an embassy, and allow it to use the word Taiwan, instead of Taipei, the capital, which China prefers. While the world considers Taiwan legally a part of China, Taiwan considers itself a separate, democratic nation and has also proved itself vital in producing sophisticated semiconductors, on which Europe depends. China has not only organized a boycott of trade with Lithuania, but has also attempted to block trade in any goods that use components made in Lithuania. The European Union has brought a case against China in the World Trade Organization, which may take years to resolve and has complicated relations with Beijing.

2022-04-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/02/world/europe/ukraine-photojournalist-maks-levin-dead.html,Ukrainian Photojournalist Who Went Missing Near Kyiv Is Found Dead,"A Ukrainian photojournalist who went missing over two weeks ago while documenting the Russian invasion of Ukraine near the capital, Kyiv, has been found dead, according to the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general. The photojournalist, Maks Levin, 40, was a prominent freelancer who had spent years covering the conflict in Ukraine. There had been fears for his safety after he and a colleague went missing in mid-March while reporting near the front line of Russian fighting in the Vyshhorod area. His body was found in a village in the Vyshhorod district north of Kyiv on Friday, according to the Institute of Mass Information, a Ukrainian civil society organization focused on press freedom. He is survived by his wife, four sons and his parents. The prosecutor’s office said in a statement that based on preliminary information, Mr. Levin was shot by Russian armed forces with “small arms fire,” and that a criminal investigation into his death was underway. The colleague Mr. Levin had been traveling with, Oleksiy Chernyshov, has not been found, according to the Institute of Mass Information. Days before his disappearance, Mr. Levin had posted a series of harrowing images on his Facebook page showing the mass evacuation of residents, many of them draped in white cloth to signal their civilian status. “It’s like a horror movie,” he wrote in a message accompanying the post. As news of his death circulated on Saturday, there was an outpouring of grief from fellow journalists who had worked alongside Mr. Levin. Many had spent the last two weeks appealing for news of his whereabouts. According to the LB.ua, a Ukrainian news outlet where Mr. Levin worked for more than a decade, he was born in 1981 in the Kyiv region. He had extensively documented the conflict in Ukraine beginning in 2014, with his work published in several Ukrainian and international news outlets, and also worked on photo projects with a number of humanitarian organizations. Mr. Levin collaborated with Reuters, the BBC, and The Associated Press, among other news outlets. “Every Ukrainian photographer dreams of taking a photo that will stop the war,” Mr. Levin once explained, according to LB.ua.",29
2022-04-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/opinion/putin-ukraine-liberalism.html,Opinion | The Enemies of Liberalism Are Showing Us What It Really Means,"“After three decades of dominance, liberalism is losing its hold on Western minds,” Matthew Rose writes in his powerful new book, “A World After Liberalism.” Rose does not mean liberalism in the way we typically use the word. This is not about supporting universal health care or disagreeing with Justice Samuel Alito. Rose means liberalism as in the shared assumptions of the West: a belief in human dignity, universal rights, individual flourishing and the consent of the governed. That liberalism has been battered by financial crises, the climate crisis, checkered pandemic responses, right-wing populists and a rising China. It seems exhausted, ground down, defined by the contradictions and broken promises that follow victory rather than the creativity and aspiration that attend struggle. At least, it did. Ukraine’s refusal to bend the knee to Vladimir Putin has reminded the West that, for those who have not yet learned to take it for granted, life under liberalism is worth fighting for. But true renewal will require more than horror at Russia’s invasion or paeans to Ukraine’s courage. It will mean grappling with liberalism’s deficiencies and rediscovering its core radicalism. “A World After Liberalism” is a bracing place to begin this rediscovery, in part because so much of it takes place in liberalism’s era of ascendance, even as it came under violent threat. In the book, Rose profiles Oswald Spengler, Julius Evola, Francis Parker Yockey, Alain de Benoist and Samuel Francis, five thinkers of the 20th century far right who are experiencing a revival in today’s — increasingly near — right. Some of them reach into our world directly. To take one example, Evola, a not-quite-fascist Italian theorist, has been cited by Steve Bannon and was translated into Russian by Aleksandr Dugin, the philosopher and mystic now sometimes known as “Putin’s Rasputin.” The argument of the anti-liberals goes something like this: Our truest identities are rooted in the land in which we’re born and the kin among whom we’re raised. Our lives are given order and meaning because they are embedded in the larger structure and struggle of our people. Liberalism and, to some degree, Christianity have poisoned our cultural soil, setting us adrift in a world that prizes pleasure and derides tradition. Multiculturalism, in this telling, becomes a conservative ideal: We should celebrate the strength in cultural difference, reject the hollow universalist pieties of liberals and insist on the preservation of what sets people apart. The genius of this critique, as Rose writes, is that it recasts liberalism’s virtues into vices: And yet the process runs in reverse, too. Both liberalism and Christianity become thrilling when described by their critics. Far from the technocratic slog of trade regulations and the deadening work of dragging laws past the filibuster, this liberalism is a marvel of imagination and ambition. It’s an ideology that believes human beings capable of new forms of social organization and a movement capable of untethering them from hierarchies so deeply embedded in our societies that they were thought to represent a natural, or even divine, order. Christianity, too, gleams with a light it often lacks in today’s politics, and even in its pews: Here is a religion that insists on the dignity of all people and centers the poor and the marginalized. Rose’s subjects fear Christianity because they fear it cannot be tamed; even when the leaders they admire try to subvert it for their own purposes, it infects their societies with a latent egalitarianism, setting a trap that will inevitably be sprung. Part of the book’s eerie relevance comes from the role Russia plays throughout. Spengler thought that the West was collapsing into incoherence and the next great cultural force might well emerge from a post-Bolshevik Russia. Yockey, one of the most egregious white supremacists in Rose’s menagerie, wrote in “anticipation of a resurgent Russia helping to correct a decadent West.” That is certainly the role Putin has claimed for himself, in speech after speech insisting on an identity rooted in soil and culture, on an imperialism justified by power and past, and on a conception of himself and Russia as lonely bulwarks fighting for traditional European culture. When Putin gives a wartime statement standing with J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, against cancellation by those seeking rights and recognition for transgender people, this is the serious argument lurking in the inane juxtaposition: Putin is trying to rally those yearning for the certainties of the past and offended by the constant instability of the liberal present. The logic that says Ukraine belongs to Russia now because it belonged to Russia then is close cousin to the logic that defends the social hierarchies of today on the basis of their power in the past. (Rowling, it should be said, wants nothing to do with Putin.) The misplaced shock that Putin would act as so many past leaders acted, that he would try to take what he wants just because he can, reflects liberalism’s long work remaking not just what we believe to be moral but what we believe to be normal. At its best and sometimes at its worst, liberalism makes the past into a truly foreign land, and that can turn those who still inhabit it into anachronisms in their own time. But liberals deceive themselves when they believe that that happens only to liberalism’s enemies. It also happens to liberalism’s would-be friends. You can see this clearly in “Ukraine in Histories and Stories,” a collection edited by Volodymyr Yermolenko. There’s a particular poignancy in reading this book now, as it was released in 2019, in the interregnum between Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its current invasion of Ukraine. This is the recent past, but it, too, feels foreign. In this collection of essays, written by Ukrainian intellectuals, Ukraine is not a darling of the West; it is a country that aspires to be part of the West and struggles against the indifference and even contempt of those it admires. Throughout the book, the West’s ignorance of Ukraine is a theme, with author after author recalling futile efforts to try to interest Europeans in their experience and history and possibilities. “We, Ukrainians, are in love with Europe, Europe is in love with Russia, while Russia hates both us and Europe,” the novelist Yuri Andrukhovych writes. The authors see Ukraine as a nation trapped painfully in a state of becoming, neither truly modern nor confidently traditionalist. Andrij Bondar, a Ukrainian essayist, offers a tragicomic list of what Ukraine lacks, including “trust in institutions,” “the culture of comic books,” “the Protestant work ethic” and “Calvados or any other apple spirits.” But there is also much it has, including “a generally highly tolerant society,” “the ability to consolidate and unite efforts to attain a common goal,” “elements of democracy” and “a talent for enduring hardship.” Today it is clear that these were the things that mattered. The authors also see that Europe is not all that it claimed to be. “For us, citizens of Ukraine, Europe still looks like the Europe of the late 20th century, while it has become absolutely different today,” writes Vakhtang Kebuladze, a Ukrainian philosopher. “I understand this, of course, and it hurts when I see the actions of Putin’s European right-wing and left-wing friends. I certainly do not like this Europe.” Prophetically, Kebuladze saw that Western renewal might lie in attending to the experience of those struggling toward liberalism, not those comfortably ensconced in it. “Europeans could look at themselves through the eyes of those citizens of Ukraine who came to Maidan for the sake of the European future of their country, those who are dying in the east of our country while protecting it from Russian invasion and those who are slowly dying in Russian prisons sent there on trumped-up charges,” he writes. “Will you then perhaps like yourselves? Or will you see a way to overcome something that you do not like?” The anti-liberals Rose profiles all believed that liberalism prescribed a life without sacrifice, an age when individual contentment reigned supreme and collective struggle disappeared. This was not true then, and it is not true now. What they missed is what liberalism actually believes: that there is a collective identity to be found in collective betterment, that making the future more just than the past is a mission as grand as any offered by antiquity. But a critique they make thrums through our present and should be taken seriously: Liberalism needs a healthier relationship to time. Can the past become a foreign country without those who still live there being turned into foreigners in their own land? If the future is to be unmapped, then how do we persuade those who fear it, or mistrust us, to agree to venture into its wilds? I suspect another way of asking the same question is this: Can the constant confrontation with our failures and deficiencies produce a culture that is generous and forgiving? Can it be concerned with those who feel not just left behind, as many in America do, but left out, as so many Ukrainians were for so long? The answer to that — if there is an answer to that — may lie in the Christianity the anti-liberals feared, which too few in politics practice. What I, as an outsider to Christianity, have always found most beautiful about it is how strange it is. Here is a worldview built on a foundation of universal sin and insufficiency, an equality that bleeds out of the recognition that we are all broken, rather than that we must all be great. I’ve always envied the practice of confession, not least for its recognition that there will always be more to confess and so there must always be more opportunities to be forgiven. You can see some of this spirit, in secular form, in the Ukrainian essays. The tone is anything but triumphalist, with Russia having taken Crimea and the rest of Europe and the United States shrugging it off. The perspective is largely tragic, cleareyed about the work that may go undone and the distance left to travel. But the writing is generous, too: suffused with love for country, honesty about an often bloody history, determination despite a disappointing present and, above all, a commitment to one another. There is much to learn from in that merger of self-criticism and deep solidarity. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-04-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/opinion/ukraine-russia-wired.html,Opinion | Putin Had No Clue How Many of Us Would Be Watching,"Almost six weeks into the war between Russia and Ukraine, I’m beginning to wonder if this conflict isn’t our first true world war — much more than World War I or World War II ever was. In this war, which I think of as World War Wired, virtually everyone on the planet can either observe the fighting at a granular level, participate in some way or be affected economically — no matter where they live. While the battle on the ground that triggered World War Wired is ostensibly over who should control Ukraine, do not be fooled. This has quickly turned into “the big battle” between the two most dominant political systems in the world today: free-market, “rule-of-law democracy versus authoritarian kleptocracy,” the Swedish expert on the Russian economy Anders Aslund remarked to me. Though this war is far from over, and Vladimir Putin may still find a way to prevail and come out stronger, if he doesn’t, it could be a watershed in the conflict between democratic and undemocratic systems. It is worth recalling that World War II put an end to fascism, and that the Cold War put an end to orthodox communism, eventually even in China. So, what happens on the streets of Kyiv, Mariupol and the Donbas region could influence political systems far beyond Ukraine and far into the future. Indeed, other autocratic leaders, like China’s, are watching Russia carefully. They see its economy being weakened by Western sanctions, thousands of its young technologists fleeing to escape a government denying them access to the internet and credible news and its inept army seemingly unable to gather, share and funnel accurate information to the top. Those leaders have to be asking themselves: “Holy cow — am I that vulnerable? Am I presiding over a similar house of cards?” Everyone is watching. In World War I and World War II, no one had a smartphone or access to social networks through which to observe and participate in the war in nonkinetic ways. Indeed, a large chunk of the world’s population was still colonized and did not have the full freedom to express independent views, even if they had the technology. Many of those residing outside the war zones were also extremely poor subsistence farmers who were not so heavily affected by those first two world wars. There weren’t the giant connected globalized and urbanized lower and middle classes of today’s wired world. Now, anyone with a smartphone can view what is happening in Ukraine — live and in color — and express opinions globally through social media. In our post-colonial world, governments from virtually every country around the globe can vote to condemn or excuse one side or another in Ukraine through the U.N. General Assembly. While estimates vary, it appears that between three billion and four billion people on the planet — almost half — have a smartphone today, and although internet censorship remains a real problem, particularly in China, there are just so many more people able to peer deeply into so many more places. And that’s not all. Anyone with a smartphone and a credit card can aid strangers in Ukraine, through Airbnb, by just reserving a night at their home and not using it. Teenagers anywhere can create apps on Twitter to track Russian oligarchs and their yachts. And the encrypted instant messaging app Telegram — which was invented by two Russian-born techie brothers as a tool to communicate outside the Kremlin’s earshot — “has emerged as the go-to place for unfiltered live war updates for both Ukrainian refugees and increasingly isolated Russians alike,” NPR reported. And it’s run out of Dubai! Meanwhile, Ukraine’s government has been able to tap a whole new source of funding — raising more than $70 million worth of cryptocurrency from individuals around the world after appealing on social media for donations. And the Tesla billionaire Elon Musk activated his SpaceX company’s satellite broadband service in Ukraine to provide high-speed internet after a Ukrainian official tweeted at him for help from Russian efforts to disconnect Ukraine from the world. Commercial U.S.-based satellite companies, like Maxar Technologies, have enabled anyone to view from space hundreds of desperate people lining up for food outside a supermarket in Mariupol — even though the Russians have the town surrounded on the ground and have banned any journalists from entering. Then there are the cyberwarriors who can jump into the fight from anywhere — and have. CNBC reported that “a popular Twitter account named ‘Anonymous’ declared that the shadowy activist group was waging a ‘cyber war’ against Russia.” The account, which has more than 7.9 million global followers — almost eight times as many as Russia’s whole army (including some 500,000 new Anonymous followers since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) — “has claimed responsibility for disabling prominent Russian government, news and corporate websites and leaking data from entities such as Roskomnadzor, the federal agency responsible for censoring Russian media.” Such nongovernmental, super-empowered, global players and platforms were not present in World War I or II. But just as so many more people can affect this war, so, too, can more be affected by it. Russia and Ukraine are key suppliers of wheat and fertilizer to the agricultural supply chains that now feed the world and that this war has disrupted. A war between just two countries in Europe has spiked the price of food for Brazilians, Indians and Africans. And because Russia is one of the world’s biggest exporters of natural gas, crude oil and the diesel fuel used by farmers in their tractors, the sanctions on Russia’s energy infrastructure are curbing its exports, causing gasoline pump prices to rise from Minneapolis to Mexico to Mumbai, and forcing farmers as far away as Argentina to ration their diesel-powered tractor usage or cut fossil-fuel-rich fertilizer usage, jeopardizing Argentina’s agriculture exports and adding further to soaring world food prices. There’s another unexpected financial globalization angle on this war that you really need to keep your eye on: Putin saved up over $600 billion in gold, foreign government bonds and foreign currency, earned from all of Russia’s energy and mineral exports, precisely so he would have a cushion if he were sanctioned by the West. But Putin apparently forgot that in today’s wired world, as is standard practice, his government had deposited most of it in the banks of Western countries and China. According to the Atlantic Council GeoEconomics Center, the top six nations where Russian central bank foreign currency assets are stowed by percentage are: China, 17.7 percent; France, 15.6 percent; Japan, 12.8 percent; Germany, 12.2 percent; U.S., 8.5 percent; and Britain, 5.8 percent. Also, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have 6.4 percent. Each of these countries, except China, has now frozen the Russian reserves it is holding — so around $330 billion is inaccessible to Putin, according to the Atlantic Council’s tracker. But not only can the Russian state not touch those reserves to prop up its crumbling economy, there will be a huge global push to tap this money to pay reparations to rebuild the Ukrainian homes, apartment buildings, roads and government structures the Russian Army destroyed in Putin’s war of choice. Message to Putin: “Thanks for banking with us. It will be legally difficult to seize your savings for reparations, but you’d better get your lawyers ready.” For all these reasons, all of those leaders around the world who have drifted toward some version or another of Putin-inspired authoritarian capitalism or kleptocracy have to be worried, though they will not be easily dislodged no matter what happens in Russia. These regimes have become adept at using new surveillance technologies to control political opponents and information flows and to manipulate their politics and state financial resources to keep themselves ensconced in power. We are talking about Turkey, Myanmar, China, North Korea, Peru, Brazil, the Philippines, Hungary and several Arab states. Putin was surely hoping that a second Trump term might transform America into a version of this kind of strongman kleptocracy and tip the whole global balance his way. Then came this war. To be sure, Ukraine’s democracy is frail and the country has had its own serious issues with oligarchs and corruption. Kyiv’s burning aspiration, though, was not to join NATO but to join the European Union, and it was in the process of cleaning itself up to do just that. That’s what really triggered this war. Putin was never going to let a Slavic Ukraine become a successful free-market democracy in the E.U. next door to his stagnating Slavic Russian kleptocracy. The contrast would have been intolerable for him, and that is why he is trying to erase Ukraine. But Putin, it turns out, had no clue what world he was living in, no clue about the frailties of his own system, no clue how much the whole free, democratic world could and would join the fight against him in Ukraine, and no clue, most of all, about how many people would be watching.

2022-04-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/un-security-council-russia-ukraine.html,Zelensky to Speak at U.N. Security Council Meeting on Russia,"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is set to give one of his most high-profile speeches since the war began when he addresses the United Nations Security Council by video-link on Tuesday. With three permanent members of the Security Council — Britain, France and the United States — firmly in his corner, Mr. Zelensky was expected to make the case that Russian forces have committed war crimes, as evidence emerges of civilian killings in the suburbs of Kyiv. But Russia and its ally China are also permanent members of the council, holding veto power over any measures it might take. Ten nonpermanent members also have a say: Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Norway and the United Arab Emirates. Here’s what you need to know ahead of the meeting: The 15-nation Security Council is the most powerful U.N. body. Its responsibility is to protect and maintain international peace, and it has the power to enforce decisions that member states are obligated to follow under the U.N. Charter. Once a threat to peace is brought before the council, the first step is to push for a resolution by “peaceful means,” which includes investigations, mediation or appointing a special envoy. If the threat is not resolved, economic sanctions, the severance of diplomatic relations, travel bans, collective military action and arms embargoes are among the last measures the Council can enforce. The Council can also dispatch peacekeeping forces. It is unlikely the council will agree on any measures against Russia, as Russia is almost certain to veto any resolution on Ukraine as a permanent council member. But Mr. Zelensky is likely to demand that allies supply his county with more weapons and further isolate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The meeting will be a prominent venue for the nations aligned with Ukraine to make impassioned pleas and for Russia to issue sharp denials of atrocities. In February, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations vetoed a Security Council resolution written by the United States and its allies that condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, used his speech to criticize the United States for invading Iraq in 2003. China, an increasingly important Russian ally, has avoided any criticism of Russia since the war started and has painted Russia as a long-suffering victim of the West. In the council vote in February, it abstained, while calling on Western nations to listen to Russia’s concerns. Among the 10 rotating members, Brazil and Gabon also have close ties to Russia. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil flew to Moscow right before the invasion, and has taken a position of neutrality on the war. Gabon, one of Africa’s largest oil producers, has ties with Russia dating back to the Soviet Union. Ireland and Norway are likely to join other Western democracies in backing Ukraine. Ghana has deep ties with the United States and will also likely support the Western position. India has tried to maintain relations with Russia while not antagonizing the United States, and its position in the conflict has been harder to discern. In February, India invoked its decades-old ties with Russia when it voted to abstain from the Security Council resolution. The United Arab Emirates, a U.S. ally in the Middle East, also abstained in February’s vote.",22
2022-04-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/world/europe/poland-ukrainian-refugees.html,The Powerful Force Guiding Poland’s Welcome to Ukrainians: Fear of Putin,"When The Interpreter first launched, our editors used to joke that the purpose of this column was to offer ‘smart answers to dumb questions.’ That never became an official tagline. But I actually still stand by the basic concept: Often, the best way to decide what to write about is to look for questions that seem kind of obvious, but whose widely accepted answers don’t tell the whole story. It can feel a little silly to ask those questions — after all, it seems like there’s already an obvious answer! — but it often turns out that if I look a little deeper, something interesting and informative can be found lurking beyond the conventional wisdom. That’s the approach that led to this week’s column, which began with a question from a Times editor: Why is Poland willing to be so extraordinarily generous to Ukrainian refugees, who are arriving in huge numbers and putting a significant strain on the country’s resources, even though Poland’s right-wing government has been extremely hostile to far smaller groups of refugees in the past? The obvious answer, of course, is that it’s about race and religion. And that answer is not wrong: Identity does matter here. Past refugee arrivals have tended to be Middle Eastern Muslims, and Poland’s right-wing politicians have spent years whipping up hostility against them by claiming that Muslim immigrants would threaten Polish identity and culture. Ukrainians, who tend to be white and Christian, don’t fit the profile that those politicians have taught the public to fear. But prejudice and racial identity aren’t the whole story here. And focusing on them alone risks obscuring an even more powerful force at play — one with implications for other refugee crises around the world. The more significant factor in Poland’s welcoming attitude toward refugees, experts say, is that helping them feels like helping Ukraine’s struggle against Putin. And for many in Poland, that feels like self-defense. “The decisive factor, I think, is perception of a common threat that is coming from Russia,” said Olena Yermakova, a Ph.D. student at Jagiellonian University in Poland who is a researcher with the Fatigue Project on Eastern and Central European politics. “I have Polish friends saying that they feel if not for NATO, if not for us being lucky with Yeltsin and Walesa in the 90s, this would have been us. And it might still be us. So the perceived threat is shared, which is, I think, why people feel so strongly about it, and why there is so much solidarity that’s going on.” “Everything is defined by stories and familiar frames that people can relate to,” she said. “And the narrative now about Ukrainians is that they are freedom fighters against Russia, which is very much a category that Poles can relate to.” A similar pattern is playing out across Europe, said Lamis Abdelaaty, a political scientist at Syracuse University who studies political responses to refugees. “Various European countries have provided military assistance to Ukraine, but they’ve also drawn the line at sending troops or imposing a no-fly zone,” she said. “Given this set of limitations, welcoming Ukrainian refugees allows European countries to really signal which side of the conflict that they’re on.” And hosting refugees can actually have an effect on the conflict they are fleeing. “Members of the diaspora can support the fight back home, by sending money or sending supplies,” she said. “And welcoming refugees can basically signal that individuals are voting with their feet. It can discredit the government that’s forcing them to flee.” But history suggests that this kind of support can be fragile and temporary. If Ukrainians’ period of need exceeds their period of foreign-policy relevance, they may be left vulnerable. “If these countries wind up hosting large numbers of Ukrainian refugees for a lengthy period of time, we don’t know whether their welcome could cool,” Dr. Abdelaaty said. “We’ve certainly seen a similar dynamic in Turkey with Syrian refugees, where Turkey was initially very welcoming of Syrians, and then gradually realized that they were going to be there for the long haul and tempered its response,” she said. A similar pattern played out in the United States around Cuban refugees, said Stephanie R. Schwartz, a political scientist at the University of Southern California who studies forced migration. “During heightened anti-Communist eras of the Cold War, we see the U.S. was really welcoming to Cuban refugees because these were people coming from a ‘rival’ government, and we wanted to frame Castro and his regime as being horrible,” she said. “But by the time that Clinton is in office, that specter is falling away, and the Berlin Wall has fallen. The U.S. changes our tune on Cuba as well, and becomes much less welcoming.” That may become a problem for Ukrainians in the future. But it is already a problem for refugees fleeing other countries whose persecution feels less politically relevant. They are met with a far less welcoming response in Poland and other European countries than Ukrainians are — even though many may actually have stronger claims to protection under international refugee law. The question for the long term, then, is which response will become the standard: the welcome and support that has greeted Ukrainians, or the hostility toward refugees from elsewhere. “The very welcoming response to Ukrainians is wonderful to observe,” Dr. Abdelaaty said. “My hope is that this sort of response will be carried over to other refugee groups who are fleeing very similar situations and who are equally worthy of our compassion and our assistance.” “Hopefully, this moment will really lead people to critically reflect on why it is that they think some people are worthy of protection, and others are not.” How am I doing?

2022-04-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/world/europe/boston-marathon-russia-belarus.html,The Boston Marathon Has Barred Runners from Russia and Belarus,"Runners from Russia and Belarus will not be allowed to compete in the Boston Marathon on Monday, another example of the countries’ deepening isolation over the invasion of Ukraine. “Like so many around the world, we are horrified and outraged by what we have seen and learned from the reporting in Ukraine,” Tom Grilk, chief of the Boston Athletic Association, which runs the marathon, said in a statement. “We believe that running is a global sport, and as such, we must do what we can to show our support to the people of Ukraine.” Citizens of Russia and Belarus who are residents of other countries will still be allowed to take part. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the cooperation of Belarus, has led to both Russia and Belarus being barred from a growing list of international cultural and sporting events, in addition to the economic and diplomatic penalties they have faced. Russia has not been allowed to send an official, national team to recent Olympic Games, following revelations of systematic doping, but the penalty was primarily semantic; the Russian team competed under different names. The 2022 Winter Games in Beijing concluded shortly before the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. The International Olympic Committee then recommended that athletes from Russia and Belarus be barred from future events. FIFA, soccer’s international governing body, effectively blocked Russia from qualifying for this year’s men’s World Cup. Other sports bodies have taken similar action. The Boston Athletic Association’s ban applied to shorter 2022 races it organizes, but by far the most famous is the marathon, one of the most prestigious in the world. It is scheduled for April 18, returning to its traditional timing on Patriots’ Day, a holiday observed by several states to commemorate the start of the American Revolution. Because of the Covid pandemic, the 2020 race was canceled and the 2021 event was postponed until this past October. The association did not say how many Russian or Belarusian entrants there were in this year’s race, but those countries are not distance running powerhouses. In the last Boston Marathon before the pandemic, in 2019, out of more than 30,000 entrants, only 56 were from Russia and three from Belarus.",29
2022-04-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/world/europe/ukraine-eurovision.html,Ukraine’s Eurovision Team Set to Tour to Help War Effort,"Ukraine’s contender for the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest, the wildly popular, over-the-top annual European event that is a swirl of flamboyance and nationalism, is set to give its first international performance Thursday evening in the lead-up to the main event in May. The six members of the band Kalush Orchestra, a group that mixes rap and traditional Ukrainian music, were given special permission to leave the country despite a martial law that bars men of military age from departing, according to the country’s public broadcaster. “We want to show the world community Ukrainian music, our spirit and how unbreakable we are. We really need support in this difficult time,” the band said, according to the broadcaster Suspline, which runs the contest to pick Ukraine’s representative. Even though contest rules expressly bar political speech, gestures or lyrics, Russia’s war in Ukraine is very much becoming a factor in the shindig that last year was viewed by 183 million people worldwide. In February, a day after Russia sent its troops into Ukraine, the European Broadcasting Union barred Russia from this year’s competition, saying it would sully an event designed to promote European unity and cultural exchange. Ukraine’s initial top pick for the contest, Alina Pash, withdrew from the competition before the war in mid-February, after a controversy over a 2015 trip she made to Russian-occupied Crimea. Kalush Orchestra performed their Eurovision entry, “Stefania,” Saturday at a town square in Lviv in western Ukraine for the first time since the war. The band’s frontman has said in interviews that he has been volunteering in war relief efforts, and one of his bandmates has served in a territorial defense unit. The group arrived in Israel this week to perform at a pre-Eurovision concert in Tel Aviv. They separately announced plans for a promotional tour ahead of the main Eurovision event to raise funds for Ukraine. Oddsmakers are predicting that Ukraine will win the final in Turin, Italy, which is decided by votes from the public and a jury. Ukraine last won with the singer Jamala’s 2016 song “1944,” which references Soviet abuses in Crimea under Stalin, just two years after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia annexed Crimea. In the 2009 contest, Georgia’s entry was a disco number titled “We Don’t Wanna Put In.” Organizers rejected that song as being overtly political for its less-than-subtle reference to Mr. Putin after Russia’s war with Georgia the previous year.",29
2022-04-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/opinion/globalization-global-culture-war.html,Opinion | Globalization Is Over. The Global Culture Wars Have Begun.,"I’m from a fortunate generation. I can remember a time — about a quarter-century ago — when the world seemed to be coming together. The great Cold War contest between communism and capitalism appeared to be over. Democracy was still spreading. Nations were becoming more economically interdependent. The internet seemed ready to foster worldwide communications. It seemed as if there would be a global convergence around a set of universal values — freedom, equality, personal dignity, pluralism, human rights. We called this process of convergence globalization. It was, first of all, an economic and a technological process — about growing trade and investment between nations and the spread of technologies that put, say, Wikipedia instantly at our fingertips. But globalization was also a political, social and moral process. In the 1990s, the British sociologist Anthony Giddens argued that globalization is “a shift in our very life circumstances. It is the way we now live.” It involved “the intensification of worldwide social relations.” Globalization was about the integration of worldviews, products, ideas and culture. This fit in with an academic theory that had been floating around called Modernization Theory. The idea was that as nations developed, they would become more like us in the West — the ones who had already modernized. In the wider public conversation, it was sometimes assumed that nations all around the world would admire the success of the Western democracies and seek to imitate us. It was sometimes assumed that as people “modernized,” they would become more bourgeois, consumerist, peaceful — just like us. It was sometimes assumed that as societies modernized, they’d become more secular, just as in Europe and parts of the United States. They’d be more driven by the desire to make money than to conquer others. They’d be more driven by the desire to settle down into suburban homes than by the fanatical ideologies or the sort of hunger for prestige and conquest that had doomed humanity to centuries of war. This was an optimistic vision of how history would evolve, a vision of progress and convergence. Unfortunately, this vision does not describe the world we live in today. The world is not converging anymore; it’s diverging. The process of globalization has slowed and, in some cases, even kicked into reverse. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine highlights these trends. While Ukraine’s brave fight against authoritarian aggression is an inspiration in the West, much of the world remains unmoved, even sympathetic to Vladimir Putin. The Economist reports that between 2008 and 2019, world trade, relative to global G.D.P., fell by about five percentage points. There has been a slew of new tariffs and other barriers to trade. Immigration flows have slowed. Global flows of long-term investment fell by half between 2016 and 2019. The causes of this deglobalization are broad and deep. The 2008 financial crisis delegitimized global capitalism for many people. China has apparently demonstrated that mercantilism can be an effective economic strategy. All manner of antiglobalization movements have arisen: those of the Brexiteers, xenophobic nationalists, Trumpian populists, the antiglobalist left. There’s just a lot more global conflict than there was in that brief holiday from history in the ’90s. Trade, travel and even communication across political blocs have become more morally, politically and economically fraught. Hundreds of companies have withdrawn from Russia as the West partly decouples from Putin’s war machine. Many Western consumers don’t want trade with China because of accusations of forced labor and genocide. Many Western C.E.O.s are rethinking their operations in China as the regime gets more hostile to the West and as supply chains are threatened by political uncertainty. In 2014 the United States barred the Chinese tech company Huawei from bidding on government contracts. Joe Biden has strengthened “Buy American” rules so that the U.S. government buys more stuff domestically. The world economy seems to be gradually decoupling into, for starters, a Western zone and a Chinese zone. Foreign direct investment flows between China and America were nearly $30 billion per year five years ago. Now they are down to $5 billion. As John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge wrote in a superb essay for Bloomberg, “geopolitics is definitively moving against globalization — toward a world dominated by two or three great trading blocs.” This broader context, and especially the invasion of Ukraine, “is burying most of the basic assumptions that have underlain business thinking about the world for the past 40 years.” Sure, globalization as flows of trade will continue. But globalization as the driving logic of world affairs — that seems to be over. Economic rivalries have now merged with political, moral and other rivalries into one global contest for dominance. Globalization has been replaced by something that looks a lot like global culture war. Looking back, we probably put too much emphasis on the power of material forces like economics and technology to drive human events and bring us all together. This is not the first time this has happened. In the early 20th century, Norman Angell wrote a now notorious book called “The Great Illusion” that argued that the industrialized nations of his time were too economically interdependent to go to war with one another. Instead, two world wars followed. The fact is that human behavior is often driven by forces much deeper than economic and political self-interest, at least as Western rationalists typically understand these things. It’s these deeper motivations that are driving events right now — and they are sending history off into wildly unpredictable directions. First, human beings are powerfully driven by what are known as the thymotic desires. These are the needs to be seen, respected, appreciated. If you give people the impression that they are unseen, disrespected and unappreciated, they will become enraged, resentful and vengeful. They will perceive diminishment as injustice and respond with aggressive indignation. Global politics over the past few decades functioned as a massive social inequality machine. In country after country, groups of highly educated urban elites have arisen to dominate media, universities, culture and often political power. Great swaths of people feel looked down upon and ignored. In country after country, populist leaders have arisen to exploit these resentments: Donald Trump in the United States, Narendra Modi in India, Marine Le Pen in France. Meanwhile, authoritarians like Putin and Xi Jinping practice this politics of resentment on a global scale. They treat the collective West as the global elites and declare their open revolt against it. Putin tells humiliation stories — what the West supposedly did to Russia in the 1990s. He promises a return to Russian exceptionalism and Russian glory. Russia will reclaim its starring role in world history. China’s leaders talk about the “century of humiliation.” They complain about the way the arrogant Westerners try to impose their values on everybody else. Though China may eventually become the world’s largest economy, Xi still talks about China as a developing nation. Second, most people have a strong loyalty to their place and to their nation. But over the past few decades many people have felt that their places have been left behind and that their national honor has been threatened. In the heyday of globalization, multilateral organizations and global corporations seemed to be eclipsing nation-states. In country after country, highly nationalistic movements have arisen to insist on national sovereignty and to restore national pride: Modi in India, Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, Trump in the United States, Boris Johnson in Britain. To hell with cosmopolitanism and global convergence, they say. We’re going to make our own country great again in our own way. Many globalists completely underestimated the power of nationalism to drive history. Third, people are driven by moral longings — by their attachment to their own cultural values, by their desire to fiercely defend their values when they seem to be under assault. For the past few decades, globalization has seemed to many people to be exactly this kind of assault. After the Cold War, Western values came to dominate the world — through our movies, music, political conversation, social media. One theory of globalization was that the world culture would converge, basically around these liberal values. The problem is that Western values are not the world’s values. In fact, we in the West are complete cultural outliers. In his book “The WEIRDest People in the World,” Joseph Henrich amasses hundreds of pages of data to show just how unusual Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic values are. He writes: “We WEIRD people are highly individualistic, self-obsessed, control-oriented, nonconformist and analytical. We focus on ourselves — our attributes, accomplishments and aspirations — over our relationships and social roles.” It’s completely possible to enjoy listening to Billie Eilish or Megan Thee Stallion and still find Western values foreign and maybe repellent. Many people around the world look at our ideas about gender roles and find them foreign or repellent. They look at (at our best) our fervent defense of L.G.B.T.Q. rights and find them off-putting. The idea that it’s up to each person to choose one’s own identity and values — that seems ridiculous to many. The idea that the purpose of education is to inculcate critical thinking skills so students can liberate themselves from the ideas they received from their parents and communities — that seems foolish to many. With 44 percent of American high school students reporting persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, our culture isn’t exactly the best advertisement for Western values right now. Despite the assumptions of globalization, world culture does not seem to be converging and in some cases seems to be diverging. The economists Fernando Ferreira and Joel Waldfogel studied popular music charts in 22 countries between 1960 and 2007. They found that people are biased toward the music of their own country and that this bias has increased since the late 1990s. People don’t want to blend into a homogeneous global culture; they want to preserve their own kind. Every few years the World Values Survey questions people from around the globe about their moral and cultural beliefs. Every few years, some of these survey results are synthesized into a map that shows how the different cultural zones stand in relation to one another. In 1996 the Protestant Europe cultural zone and the English-Speaking zone were clumped in with the other global zones. Western values were different from the values found in say, Latin America or the Confucian zone, but they were contiguous. But the 2020 map looks different. The Protestant Europe and English-Speaking zones have drifted away from the rest of the world cultures and now jut out like some extraneous cultural peninsula. In a summary of the surveys’ findings and insights, the World Values Survey Association noted that on issues like marriage, family, gender and sexual orientation, “there has been a growing divergence between the prevailing values in low-income countries and high-income countries.” We in the West have long been outliers; now our distance from the rest of the world is growing vast. Finally, people are powerfully driven by a desire for order. Nothing is worse than chaos and anarchy. These cultural changes, and the often simultaneous breakdown of effective governance, can feel like social chaos, like anarchy, leading people to seek order at all costs. We in the democratic nations of the world are lucky enough to live in societies that have rules-based orders, in which individual rights are protected and in which we get to choose our own leaders. In more and more parts of the world, though, people do not have access to this kind of order. Just as there are signs that the world is economically and culturally diverging, there are signs it is politically diverging. In its “Freedom in the World 2022” report, Freedom House notes that the world has experienced 16 consecutive years of democratic decline. It reported last year: “The countries experiencing deterioration outnumbered those with improvements by the largest margin recorded since the negative trend began in 2006. The long democratic recession is deepening.” This is not what we thought would happen in the golden age of globalization. In that heyday, democracies appeared stable, and authoritarian regimes appeared to be headed to the ash heap of history. Today, many democracies appear less stable than they did and many authoritarian regimes appear more stable. American democracy, for example, has slid toward polarization and dysfunction. Meanwhile, China has shown that highly centralized nations can be just as technologically advanced as the West. Modern authoritarian nations now have technologies that allow them to exercise pervasive control of their citizens in ways that were unimaginable decades ago. Autocratic regimes are now serious economic rivals to the West. They account for 60 percent of patent applications. In 2020, the governments and businesses in these countries invested $9 trillion in things like machinery, equipment and infrastructure, while democratic nations invested $12 trillion. If things are going well, authoritarian governments can enjoy surprising popular support. What I’m describing is a divergence on an array of fronts. As scholars Heather Berry, Mauro F. Guillén and Arun S. Hendi reported in a study of international convergence, “Over the last half century, nation-states in the global system have not evolved significantly closer (or more similar) to one another along a number of dimensions.” We in the West subscribe to a series of universal values about freedom, democracy and personal dignity. The problem is that these universal values are not universally accepted and seem to be getting less so. Next, I’m describing a world in which divergence turns into conflict, especially as great powers compete for resources and dominance. China and Russia clearly want to establish regional zones that they dominate. Some of this is the kind of conflict that historically exists between opposing political systems, similar to what we saw during the Cold War. This is the global struggle between the forces of authoritarianism and the forces of democratization. Illiberal regimes are building closer alliances with one another. They are investing more in one another’s economies. At the other end, democratic governments are building closer alliances with one another. The walls are going up. Korea was the first major battleground of the Cold War. Ukraine could be the first battleground in what turns out to be a long struggle between diametrically opposed political systems. But something bigger is happening today that is different from the great power struggles of the past, that is different from the Cold War. This is not just a political or an economic conflict. It’s a conflict about politics, economics, culture, status, psychology, morality and religion all at once. More specifically, it’s a rejection of Western ways of doing things by hundreds of millions of people along a wide array of fronts. To define this conflict most generously, I’d say it’s the difference between the West’s emphasis on personal dignity and much of the rest of the world’s emphasis on communal cohesion. But that’s not all that’s going on here. What’s important is the way these longstanding and normal cultural differences are being whipped up by autocrats who want to expand their power and sow chaos in the democratic world. Authoritarian rulers now routinely weaponize cultural differences, religious tensions and status resentments to mobilize supporters, attract allies and expand their own power. This is cultural difference transmogrified by status resentment into culture war. Some people have revived Samuel Huntington’s clash of civilizations theory to capture what’s going on. Huntington was right that ideas, psychology and values drive history as much as material interests. But these divides don’t break down on the neat civilizational lines that Huntington described. In fact, what haunts me most is that this rejection of Western liberalism, individualism, pluralism, gender equality and all the rest is not only happening between nations but also within nations. The status resentment against Western cultural, economic and political elites that flows from the mouths of illiberal leaders like Putin and Modi and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil sounds quite a lot like the status resentment that flows from the mouths of the Trumpian right, from the French right, from the Italian and Hungarian right. There’s a lot of complexity here — the Trumpians obviously have no love for China — but sometimes when I look at world affairs I see a giant, global maximalist version of America’s familiar contest between Reds and Blues. In America we’ve divided along regional, educational, religious, cultural, generational and urban/rural lines, and now the world is fragmenting in ways that often seem to mimic our own. The paths various populists prefer may differ, and their nationalistic passions often conflict, but what they’re revolting against is often the same thing. How do you win a global culture war in which differing views on secularism and gay rights parades are intertwined with nuclear weapons, global trade flows, status resentments, toxic masculinity and authoritarian power grabs? That’s the bind we find ourselves in today. I look back over the past few decades of social thinking with understanding. I was too young to really experience the tension of the Cold War, but it must have been brutal. I understand why so many people, when the Soviet Union fell, grabbed onto a vision of the future that promised an end to existential conflict. I look at the current situation with humility. The critiques that so many people are making about the West, and about American culture — for being too individualistic, too materialistic, too condescending — these critiques are not wrong. We have a lot of work to do if we are going to be socially strong enough to stand up to the challenges that are coming over the next several years, if we are going to persuade people in all those swing countries across Africa, Latin America and the rest of the world that they should throw their lot in with the democracies and not with the authoritarians — that our way of life is the better way of life. And I look at the current situation with confidence. Ultimately, people want to stand out and fit in. They want to feel that their lives have dignity, that they are respected for who they are. They also want to feel membership in moral communities. Right now, many people feel disrespected by the West. They are casting their lot with authoritarian leaders who speak to their resentments and their national pride. But those leaders don’t actually recognize them. For those authoritarians — from Trump to Putin — their followers are just instruments in their own search for self-aggrandizement. At the end of the day, only democracy and liberalism are based on respect for the dignity of each person. At the end of the day, only these systems and our worldviews offer the highest fulfillment for the drives and desires I’ve tried to describe here. I’ve lost confidence in our ability to predict where history is headed and in the idea that as nations “modernize” they develop along some predictable line. I guess it’s time to open our minds up to the possibility that the future may be very different from anything we expected. The Chinese seem very confident that our coalition against Putin will fall apart. Western consumers won’t be able to tolerate the economic sacrifice. Our alliances will fragment. The Chinese also seem convinced that they will bury our decadent systems before too long. These are not possibilities that can be dismissed out of hand. But I have faith in the ideas and the moral systems that we have inherited. What we call “the West” is not an ethnic designation or an elitist country club. The heroes of Ukraine are showing that at its best, it is a moral accomplishment, and unlike its rivals, it aspires to extend dignity, human rights and self-determination to all. That’s worth reforming and working on and defending and sharing in the decades ahead. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-04-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/world/europe/pink-floyd-ukraine.html,Pink Floyd Says It Will Release New Track to Support Ukraine,"Pink Floyd, the 1970s psychedelic rock band, is releasing its first new track in almost three decades on Friday to raise money for the people of Ukraine, the band said on Thursday. The recording, “Hey Hey Rise Up,” is a reworking of a protest song from World War I and features the Ukrainian rock star Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the band Boombox. Mr. Khlyvnyuk was on tour in the United States when the war started and returned to Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, to enlist in his country’s army. The vocals on the Pink Floyd track come from a viral video the Ukrainian singer posted three days into the war of himself clad in combat gear, carrying a rifle and singing a Ukrainian protest anthem in Kyiv’s Sofiyskaya Square. The anthem, “The Red Viburnum in the Meadow,” was written during World War I and has been sung at Ukrainian solidarity rallies around the world since Russia’s invasion began. Pink Floyd gives it a soaring rock treatment, with David Gilmour providing an anguished guitar solo and Nick Mason’s steady drums driving it forward. Guy Pratt plays bass, and Nitin Sawhney adds keyboard. Roger Waters, who left the group in 1985, was not involved. The anthem’s last line, “Hey, hey, rise up and rejoice,” was the inspiration for the track’s title. Though an initial statement said proceeds from its sale would go to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, a spokesperson for the band said on Friday that a specific charity had not yet been designated. Mr. Gilmour said Mr. Khlyvnyuk had given his blessing for the song from the hospital where he is recovering from a mortar shrapnel injury. Mr. Gilmour described coming to know Mr. Khlyvnyuk in 2015, when Boombox backed him at a show in support of a persecuted Belarusian theater group. Both Pink Floyd and Mr. Gilmour, who has Ukrainian family members, pulled their music from digital providers in Russia and Belarus in March and said they stood with the world in “strongly condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” The move was one of several solidarity efforts from the music industry in recent weeks. The Grammy Awards last week featured remarks from President Volodymyr Zelensky and performances from the Ukrainian singer Mika Newton and the poet Lyuba Yakimchuk, who recently fled the country. In March, a benefit concert featuring stars including Ed Sheeran and Camila Cabello reportedly raised $17.6 million.",29
2022-04-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/opinion/letters/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court.html,Opinion | ‘It Lifts My Heart’: Praise for Jackson’s Confirmation to the Court,"To the Editor: Re “Jackson Confirmed to Supreme Court as Backers Hail a Landmark Moment” (front page, April 8): In times that have been fraught with extraordinary worries about Covid and fears of democracy’s demise, we have some really good news: the confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court by a vote of 53 to 47 in the Senate. The arc of history is bending in the right direction, and we have something sublime to celebrate, a Black woman on the court. It lifts my heart and gives me reason to hope for our future. Thank you, President Biden, for bringing us to this moment. Ellen Silverman PopperQueens To the Editor: The Senate confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court could have a lasting impact for decades to come. Judge Jackson has a demonstrated history of bringing together people with different viewpoints, which will be critical as a Supreme Court justice. Judge Jackson’s diverse life experiences, including being a public defender and someone who was a public high school graduate (unlike most of the other current justices), will bring different perspectives to the Supreme Court. The highest court of the land should reflect all that our nation has to offer. It made a big step forward in that regard with the confirmation of Judge Jackson. Steven M. ClaytonOcean, N.J. To the Editor: Let’s not get carried away with encomiums for Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney because they did what was minimally required by simple human decency in confirming the eminently qualified Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Is there any doubt whatsoever that these three supposed nonconformists would have fallen in line with the rest of the G.O.P. to deny President Biden’s choice, no matter who it might have been, had the retiring justice been Clarence Thomas or Samuel Alito? They knew they had nothing to lose by breaking ranks with their party, because the ideological makeup of the court was not in question with Judge Jackson’s appointment. A “bipartisan” vote? Hardly. The Republican Party these days exists to stymie and destroy every single effort by Democrats to accomplish anything of value for the majority of the public. All one needs to do is to look at the rest of the voting record of these three senators to recognize they are really MINOs: Mavericks in Name Only. Bryan L. TuckerBoston To the Editor: Congratulations to Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for being the first Black woman to be confirmed to the nation’s highest court. As significant as this is, her status as the first former public defender on the Supreme Court is just as noteworthy. The right to counsel is one of the bedrocks of our democracy, and the confirmation of someone who has served in the most basic part of our legal system is a moment to celebrate. We cannot feel secure that our legal system is fair unless all of us, from the indigent to the wealthiest, have strong legal representation at every level of our judicial system. Edwin AndrewsMalden, Mass. To the Editor: Re “Fossil Fuels Must Be Cut Faster, Panel Warns” (front page, April 5): We have received another in a string of warnings from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change telling us that climate change is real and an imminent threat to our planet and our society. There still is time to adjust, but major actions are required immediately. This is factually undeniable. You write that according to the report the biggest obstacles are “political, not technological.” “Organized disinformation campaigns by climate change deniers” are causing a slowdown of action, as “politicians tend to avoid difficult decisions if the benefits are not felt beyond the current election cycle.” We must educate society using facts and pointing out where greed and fear are preventing action. We must counter the disinformation in real time. Vote in climate protectors and not climate deniers. Make sure your candidates, regardless of party, acknowledge that climate change is real. They need to understand that, if elected, they must be part of the solution, enacting good legislation immediately. The clock is ticking and the planet is still warming. Jonathan LightLaguna Niguel, Calif. To the Editor: Re “Biden’s Climate Agenda Sputters as High Oil Prices Prompt Calls to Drill More” (news article, April 3): You report that Republicans seek “to portray the Democrats as ‘climate elites’ who are out of touch with most Americans.” But a recent survey by Yale University says a majority of Americans want Congress to take action to address climate change. If Republicans don’t wake up to this, their presence in Washington is in danger. Hopefully voters will reject those legislators who stand in the way of meaningful climate policy. Murray ZichlinskyLong Beach, Calif. To the Editor: When I look at the photographs of Mariupol, Ukraine, I am stunned that soldiers fire rockets into a city and destroy a habitat just because a person higher in rank says to do so. Do these soldiers ever see what destruction they have caused? Is a soldier that numb, that insensitive, that automatic? Can those people sleep without any sense of guilt? I am a veteran, but never took part in a conflict. So I do not know. Maarten PenninkCharlotte, N.C.",1
2022-04-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/opinion/russian-gas-germany-acid-rain.html,"Opinion | Wonking Out: Russian Gas, Acid Rain and Industrial Scaremongers","In yesterday’s column I highlighted Germany’s infuriating unwillingness to wean itself from Russian gas, something that would be costly but not devastating to the nation’s economy. Part of my point was the hypocrisy: Germany was willing to demand almost inconceivable pain from southern European countries that, the Germans claimed, had borrowed irresponsibly — but is unwilling to accept far smaller penalties for its own feckless policy of relying on Russian energy, despite decades of warnings about the risk this policy created. The other part of my point, however, was the foolishness of German politicians in attacking economists — including German economists — who say that the costs of a gas embargo would be tolerable, and believing the dire claims of industrialists instead. As I suggested, there’s a strong parallel here with the history of environmental protection. Industry always claims that proposed regulations will have a devastating economic impact. These predictions have never, to my knowledge, been remotely right. So the lesson should be clear: Never trust policy advice from big businesses that are talking their own book. In today’s newsletter I want to expand on that point, first with a discussion of the history of America’s acid rain policy, then with some broader considerations. Background: In 1990, more than half of America’s electricity was generated by coal-burning power plants (a number that was down to 19 percent as of 2020). These plants released sulfur dioxide, which combined with atmospheric water to produce sulfuric acid — something you really don’t want raining down on your farms, forests and people. So the 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act introduced a system to reduce, though not eliminate, acid rain: Power plants were allocated rights to emit limited amounts of S02, but also allowed to sell emission rights they weren’t using to other plants that were having a harder time cutting their sulfur emissions. This cap and trade system greatly reduced the damage from acid rain. Here’s a map of pollution before the new system went into effect: And here’s what it looked like more recently: But what were the financial costs? Industrial groups warned of disaster. For example, the Business Roundtable predicted that the new rules would cost $104 billion a year. Since the total value of electricity production in the early 1990s was around $200 billion a year, this should have led to something like a 50 percent rise in electricity prices. In reality, the real price of electricity — measured here in 2021 dollars — fell steadily as the acid rain program went into effect: In fact, the costs of compliance with the new rules were far lower than even advocates of the program had expected. The big lesson here is that you can’t trust industries to provide a reliable, or even honest, assessment of the economic impact of policies that might hurt their bottom line. This runs counter to the instincts of many people, including politicians. As I said, Germany’s leaders seem to have decided to believe industrialists who say they can’t live without Russian gas and have lashed out at economists who disagree. And in a way I can understand this attitude: Surely executives who actually run companies, who deal every day with business problems, know more about economic reality than nerdy guys in think tanks. Right? But this presumption has been wrong time and again. I think for two reasons. First, industrialists who weigh in on policy issues that affect them have a huge incentive to talk their own book — to throw out numbers that are meant to scare the public into leaving them alone, rather than to provide realistic assessments. Oh, and for anyone saying that fine upstanding business leaders wouldn’t do something like that, remember Dieselgate — the massive fraud perpetrated by German automakers to make their cars seem far less polluting than they were. Second, executives within an industry do indeed know a lot about how things work in their business right now. There’s much less reason to believe that they have a good sense of how things might be done differently — of the adaptations and innovations they might be able to make in the face of a drastically changed situation. It’s like what happens in financial crises: Wall Street types are infinitely better than academics at guessing what will happen day to day, but when things fall apart, economists familiar with economic history tend to do better than those immersed in normal trading. The lessons here go well beyond the immediate scandal of Germany’s timid response to Russian atrocities. The same considerations apply to policies that are even more important: actions to limit climate change, which looks more than ever like an existential threat. Business leaders and the politicians who listen to them always claim that the economic costs of adequate action would be unsupportable. Don’t believe them.",4
2022-04-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/opinion/ukraine-russia-liberalism-religion.html,Opinion | Why Liberalism Needs Nationalism and Religion,"The idea that Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine would be a restorative tonic for Western liberalism, touted hopefully in the first few weeks of war, has taken sharp blows in recent days. First came the election in Hungary, where Viktor Orban’s conservative populist government won a sweeping popular majority, despite — or, more likely, because of — Orban’s relatively dovish approach to the struggle in Ukraine. Then came the presidential-election polling out of France, where Marine Le Pen is suddenly climbing in second-round polls, threatening Emmanuel Macron with a shocking upset. Le Pen will probably still lose, not least because her past friendliness to Putin will get more attention between this weekend’s first-round vote and the runoff, assuming she wins through. But there is no sign as yet that the war has prompted a vast revulsion against nationalism or populism, a stampede back to the liberal establishment. Another possibility, however, is that the Ukraine war could help the liberal establishment in the long run, by encouraging an internal reassessment of what liberalism itself should seek to be. For example, a writer who seemed overly hopeful about the liberal-revival scenario in the first days of the war, Francis Fukuyama, has now written a searching essay for Foreign Affairs on why “liberalism needs the nation” arguing that the heroic resistance of the Ukrainians should teach liberals a lesson about the virtues of national identity. “With their bravery,” he writes, the Ukrainians “have made clear that citizens are willing to die for liberal ideals, but only when those ideals are embedded in a country they can call their own.” The war has thus been a partial rebuke to the fantasy of a pure cosmopolitanism, of a liberalism that transcends borders, languages and specific histories. And it’s offered a case study in how the nation-state, its loves and loyalties, can unite a disparate population around a common cause in a way that no supranational institution has ever been able to achieve. The challenge, though, is that the “sense of national purpose” Fukuyama is praising in Ukraine conspicuously depends on an external enemy, a wolf at the door, and you cannot simply will such an enemy into being. (Nor should you wish to!) Whereas most of the peacetime sources of national solidarity he cites, from food and sports to literary traditions, are somewhat thinner things. And one of the potentially thicker forces, a sense of religious unity within a liberal order, Fukuyama rules out: In a pluralist society, “the idea of restoring a shared moral tradition defined by religious belief is a nonstarter,” leading only to sectarianism and violence if applied. But that might be too simplistic. Certainly you cannot impose strict religious uniformity upon a pluralist democracy. But the liberal order in America, at least, long relied for solidarity and purpose on a softer religious consensus, a flexible religious center, based on Protestant Christianity and then expanding to a more ecumenical but still biblically rooted vision. From the 19th century through the civil rights era, this shared worldview supplied not just a generic unity but a constant moral touchstone for would-be reformers, a metaphysical horizon for the entire American project. Here Fukuyama’s essay might be usefully supplemented by my colleague Ezra Klein’s recent meditation on how Western liberalism appears when seen through the eyes of its enemies — meaning not just Putinism, with its spurious Christian justifications for aggressive war, but certain radical-right philosophers who have rejected liberalism and Christianity together, seeing the latter as the original source of liberalism’s egalitarianism, its attention to the poor and marginalized, and its restless quest for universal dignity (all of which they reject and despise). To push Klein’s idea a little further, you might say that since the 1960s, when the old Protestant consensus cracked up, the American system has been in search of a form of religion that can ground its liberalism in something like that way. That search has been unsuccessful. The religious right proved too conservative and parochial (and scandal-plagued) for a diverse and liberalizing country, and it cracked up with George W. Bush’s presidency. The liberal Christianity of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, while in certain ways better suited to hold the religious center, lacks internal vitality and is easily subsumed into a mixture of pantheism and gnosticism, with its moral vision supplied by a progressive activism that’s intolerant in its own distinctive way. These failures have left us with a spiritual competition between an ascendant wokeness and a resentful Christian nationalism, which isn’t likely to supply unity or solidarity to anyone. But notably, throughout these culture wars, liberalism’s inner party, its intellectual elite, has retained a conception of itself as resolutely secular, persistently imagining a perfected, post-religious liberal order that can establish solidarity and purpose without any of the old American appeals to Providence or nature’s God. It will be a sign that liberalism is ready to confront its present challenges, all the unhappiness of its citizens and children, when that illusion is finally and irrevocably put away.

2022-04-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/world/europe/putin-ukraine-russia.html,Putin’s War in Ukraine Shatters an Illusion in Russia,"To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. The last time I was in Russia, the summer of 2015, I came face to face with a contradiction. What if a place was unfree, but also happy? How long could it stay that way? Moscow had blossomed into a beautiful, European city, full of meticulously planted parks, bike lanes and parking spaces. Income for the average Russian had risen significantly over the course of the previous decade. At the same time, its political system was drifting ever closer to authoritarianism. Fifteen years earlier, Boris Yeltsin had left power in shame, apologizing on national television “for having failed to justify the hopes of the people who believed that we would be able to make a leap from the gloomy and stagnant totalitarian past to a bright, prosperous and civilized future at just one go.” By the summer of 2015, his successor, President Vladimir V. Putin, had seemingly made Russia bright and prosperous. The political system he built was increasingly restrictive, but many had learned to live with it. Many Russian liberals had gone to work for nonprofits and local governments, throwing themselves into community building — making their cities better places to live. A protest movement in 2011 and 2012 had failed, and people were looking for other ways to shape their country. Big politics were hopeless, the thinking went, but one could make a real difference in small acts. There was another side to this bargain: Mr. Putin was seemingly constrained, as well. Political action may have been forbidden, but there was tolerance when it came to other things, for example religion, culture and many forms of expression. His own calculus for the system to run smoothly meant he had to make some room for society. I lived in Russia for nine years, and began covering it for The New York Times in 2000, the year Mr. Putin was first elected. I spent lots of time telling people — in public writing and in my private life — that Russia might sometimes look bad, but that it had a lot of wonderful qualities, too. But in the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, I have felt like I am watching someone I love lose their mind. Many of the Russian liberals who had turned to “small acts” are feeling a sense of shock and horror, too, said Alexandra Arkhipova, a Russian anthropologist. “I see lots of posts and conversations saying these small deeds, it was a big mistake,” she said. “People have a metaphor. They say, ‘We were trying to make some cosmetic changes to our faces, when the cancer was growing and growing in our stomachs.’” I began to wonder whether Russia was always going to end up here, and we just failed to see it. So I called Yevgeniya Albats, a Russian journalist who had warned of the dangers of a K.G.B. resurgence as early as the 1990s. Ms. Albats kept staring into the glare of the idea that at certain points in history, everything is at stake in political thought and action. She had long argued that any bargain with Mr. Putin was an illusion. She said 2008 was a turning point, the moment Mr. Putin divorced the West, even invaded another country, and the West barely noticed. “For Putin, it was a clear sign,” she said by telephone last month, “that he can do whatever he wants. And that’s exactly what he started doing. He behaved extremely rationally. He just realized that you don’t care.” She was referring to Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia, which came shortly after President George W. Bush began to talk about NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine. I covered that war, and spent the night with a Russian unit in the Georgian town of Gori and remember how invigorated the soldiers seemed, laughing, joking. The Soviet defeat in the Cold War had left a bitter sense of humiliation and loss. The invasion seemed to have renewed them. “When Putin came, everything changed,” one officer told me. “We got some of our old strength back. People started to respect us again.” Ms. Albats sounded tired but determined. The day we talked, she had traveled to a Russian penal colony to be present for the sentencing of her friend Aleksei A. Navalny, Russia’s popular opposition leader, who used his allotted time to give a speech against the war. “We now understand that when Putin decided to go into war in Ukraine, he had to get rid of Navalny,” she said, because he is the only one with the courage to resist. Indeed, Mr. Navalny never accepted the turn away from direct confrontation and was building a nationwide opposition movement, leading people into the streets. He rejected the bargain and was willing to go to prison to defy it. Ms. Arkhipova pointed out that his mantra, that the fight was not of good against evil but of good against neutral, was a direct challenge to the political passivity that Mr. Putin was demanding. Many people I interviewed said the poisoning of Mr. Navalny in 2020 and the jailing of him in early 2021, after years of freedom, marked the end of the social contract and the beginning of Mr. Putin’s war. Like Al Qaeda’s killing of Ahmed Shah Massoud on the eve of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Putin had to clear the field of opponents. Greg Yudin, a professor of political philosophy at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences, argues it was the political opposition’s success, which began to accelerate in 2018 and 2019, that tipped Mr. Putin toward war. Professor Yudin said it was inconceivable to Mr. Putin that there could be people inside Russia who wanted the best for their country, yet were against him. So he looked for traitors and nursed an obsession with the idea that the West was after him. “It’s a feature of this kind of regime,” Professor Yudin said. “It recodes internal dissent into external threats.” As for my 2015 question — how long can a place be unfree and also happy — perhaps we have lived into the answer. Many liberals have left. Many of those who have not left face fines or even jail. In the weeks after the invasion, the police detained more than 15,000 people nationwide, according to OVD-Info, a human rights group, substantially higher than in the protests in 2012, when about 5,000 people were detained over 12 months, said Ms. Arkhipova, who studied that movement. Ms. Albats has stayed and is angry at Russian liberals who have not. The message, she said, is that “Russian liberals, they don’t have any tolerance for any problems.” She added, “They just run away.” At the same time, she said, it’s an extremely hard choice. “Choosing between jail and not jail, I’d rather choose not jail,” Ms. Albats said, adding that she already faces thousands of dollars in fines just for reporting about the war. Mr. Yudin said the choice was hard because the crackdown was complete, and because political opposition was now being pulverized. “The best comparison is Germany in 1939,” he said. “What kind of democratic movement would you expect there? This is the same. People are basically right now trying to save their lives.” Not everyone, of course. Lev Gudkov, a sociologist at Levada Center, a research group that tracks Russian public opinion, told me that about two-thirds of people nationwide approve of Mr. Putin’s actions in Ukraine. “It is a less-educated, older part of the population, mainly living in rural areas or in small and medium-sized cities, where the population is poorer and more dependent on power,” he said, referring to those who rely on public funds like pensions and state jobs. “They also receive their whole construction of reality exclusively from television.” He points out that “if you look at 20 years of our research since Putin came to power, then the peaks of support for Putin and his popularity have always coincided with military campaigns.” One such campaign was the war in Chechnya, a particularly brutal subduing of a population that in 1999 was Mr. Putin’s signature act before being elected president the first time. We are starting to see some of the features of that war in Ukraine: bodies with hands bound, mass graves, tales of torture. In Chechnya, the result was the systematic elimination of anyone connected to the fight against Russia. It is too soon to say whether that was the intent in Bucha. Now the bargain is broken, the illusion has shattered. And the country has been pitched into a new phase. But what is it? Mr. Yudin argues that Russia is moving out of authoritarianism — where political passivity and civic disengagement are key features — into totalitarianism, which relies on mass mobilization, terror and homogeneity of beliefs. He believes Mr. Putin is on the brink, but may hesitate to make the shift. “In a totalitarian system, you have to release free energy to start terror,” he said. Mr. Putin, he said, “is a control freak, used to micromanagement.” However, if the Russian state starts to fail, either through a collapse of Russia’s economy or a complete military defeat in Ukraine, “unleashing terror will be the only way for him to save himself.” Which is why the current situation is so dangerous, for Ukraine and for people in Russia opposed Mr. Putin. “Putin is so convinced that he cannot afford to lose, that he will escalate,” Professor Yudin said. “He has staked everything on it.” Audio produced by Jack D’Isidoro.",4
2022-04-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/world/europe/chanel-russian-influencers-ukraine.html,Why Russian Influencers Are Cutting Up Their Chanel Bags,"When Marina Ermoshkina, a Russian TV presenter, learned that employees at a Chanel store in Dubai had refused to sell a high-end bag to a Russian customer, after asking her to sign papers attesting that she would not wear the bag in Russia, she reacted in shock. Ms. Ermoshkina, 28, bought a pair of gardening scissors, took a video of herself as she cut her Chanel bag in half and posted it to Instagram. “This is Russophobia,” she said in a phone call from Moscow. “This is the purest form of discrimination.” Hundreds of thousands of people saw her video, which was also broadcast on Russian television. Soon afterward, Victoria Bonya, a Russian social media influencer with 9.3 million Instagram followers, followed suit, taking a pair of scissors to a Chanel bag that sells for thousands of dollars. “If Chanel house does not respect the clients, why do we have to respect Chanel house?” she said as she butchered her bag from the iconic French brand on video. Chanel, like many international companies, suspended operations in Russia in response to President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. In addition to temporarily closing stores and suspending deliveries in Russia, Chanel also began asking customers in its global stores to attest that the items they were purchasing would not be used in Russia. In a statement, the company said that it was attempting to comply with European Union and Swiss sanctions that prohibit the “sale, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly, of luxury goods to any natural or legal person, entity or body in Russia or for use in Russia.” The prohibition, the company said, applies to luxury goods whose value exceeds 300 euros per item (about $326), which applies to most of Chanel’s products. This angered Ms. Ermoshkina, who said that while withdrawing from Russia was the company’s choice, its policy against customers bringing items into the country is discriminatory and humiliating. “If all the women are the same, why does Chanel discriminate against women for their nationality?” she said. Chanel declined to comment on the reactions of the Russian celebrities, but in the statement, it apologized “for any misunderstanding this may have caused, as welcoming all our clients, regardless of where they come from, is a priority for Chanel.” The company acknowledged that “this process of walking through the law has caused disappointment to some of our clients.” Ms. Ermoshkina said she was glad Chanel apologized, but its response did not fully satisfy her. She has put up for sale all her other Chanel belongings and said she intends to donate the profits to an association that she said helps the people of Donbas, the region of eastern Ukraine that is home to many Russian-speaking people. Other influencers have joined her in refusing to wear Chanel clothes and accessories. Some have reposted her words: “Not a single bag, not a single thing is worth my love for my motherland.” Among them is the Russian D.J. Katya Guseva, who had always dreamed of owning a Chanel bag, like the Hollywood celebrities she admired. But she recently told her 500,000 Instagram followers that she no longer needed that bag. In a WhatsApp message, she wrote: “Without Chanel we will continue to live perfectly.” Valeriya Safronova contributed reporting.",29
2022-04-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/world/europe/biden-narendra-modi-russia.html,Biden Meets With India’s Prime Minister Over Ukraine,"President Biden emphasized growing defense cooperation with India in a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday — a line U.S. officials have increasingly touted in the hopes of convincing New Delhi to come off the fence over Russia’s war on Ukraine. India has long been reliant on Russia for military hardware, an important factor in the deep historic ties between the two countries. And so despite global condemnations of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Mr. Modi’s administration has tried to remain neutral — refraining from criticizing Russia, while calling for negotiations and engaging Ukraine with humanitarian assistance. While American officials have been understanding of the complexity of India’s balancing act, seeing New Delhi as an important ally in the face of an assertive China, they have at times expressed frustration that India’s stance is offering President Putin some cover. Some U.S. officials have warned of consequences if India expands trade with Russia, especially any increase in purchasing oil, as the West tries to tighten sanctions. India imports only about one percent of its oil needs from Russia. Many Indian officials have spoken of a double standard, with Europe continuing to import oil from Russia while India’s imports come under increased scrutiny. President Biden echoed sentiments that other U.S. officials have expressed in recent weeks in attempts to reassure India that its source of military hardware would not run dry were it to take a firmer stance against Russia. “We share a strong and growing major defense partnership,” President Biden said in his opening remarks, before the defense and foreign ministers of both countries sat for extended dialogue. “The United States and India will continue our close consultations on how to manage the destabilizing effects of this Russian war.” India’s defense purchases from the United States have increased over the past decade to about $20 billion. But analysts have said expanding the ties to the point where India’s dependency on Russian military hardware would wane will be slow as it would require overcoming deeply rooted hesitancy in the relationship between the United States and India that dates back decades. In his remarks, Prime Minister Modi continued India’s delicate line on Ukraine — expressing concern about the suffering caused by the war but refraining from calling out Russia as the aggressor. “Our talks today are taking place at a time when the situation in Ukraine is very worrying,” Mr. Modi said. “During this entire process I spoke several times to the presidents of both Ukraine and Russia. I not only appealed for peace, but also suggested there be direct talks between President Putin and the president of Ukraine.”",22
2022-04-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/opinion/ukraine-war-realist-strategy.html,Opinion | Putin’s War in Ukraine Is a Watershed. Time for America to Get Real.,"During his recent speech in Warsaw, President Biden said that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” only to clarify a few days later that he was merely expressing outrage, not announcing a new U.S. policy aimed at toppling Russia’s leader. The episode, interpreted by many as a dangerous gaffe, underscored the tension in U.S. foreign policy between idealism and realism. Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine should provoke moral outrage in all of us, and, at least in principle, it warrants his removal from office. But Mr. Putin could well remain the leader of a major power into the next decade, and Washington will need to deal with him. This friction between lofty goals and realpolitik is nothing new. The United States has since the founding era been an idealist power operating in a realist world — and has on balance succeeded in bending the arc of history toward justice. But geopolitical exigency at times takes precedence over ideals, with America playing power politics when it needs to. During the Cold War, Washington promoted stability by tolerating a Soviet sphere of influence and cozying up to unsavory regimes willing to fight Communism. In contrast, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, America operated under conditions of geopolitical slack; great-power rivalry was muted, enabling Washington to put front and center its effort to promote democracy and expand a liberal, rules-based international order. What, then, is the path forward? The war in Ukraine now confronts the United States with the need to tilt back toward the practice of realpolitik. Washington’s commitment to keeping NATO’s doors open to Ukraine was a laudable and principled stand against an autocratic Russia. Yet America’s idealist cause has run headlong into Russian tanks; Washington’s effort to do right by Ukraine has culminated in Russia’s ruthless effort to put the country back under Moscow’s sway. Mr. Putin has just sent history into reverse. The United States should seek to foil and punish Moscow’s aggression, but Washington also needs to be pragmatic to navigate a world that, even if more unruly, is also irreversibly interdependent. The Gap Between Means and Ends Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exposed a gap between America’s ideological aspirations and geopolitical realities that has been widening since the 1990s. During the heady decade after the end of the Cold War, Washington was confident that the triumph of American power and purpose cleared the way for the spread of democracy. A primary instrument for doing so was the enlargement of NATO. But from early on, the American foreign policy establishment allowed principle to obscure the geopolitical downsides of NATO enlargement. Yes, NATO membership should be open to all countries that qualify, and all nations should be able to exercise their sovereign right to choose their alignments as they see fit. But geography and geopolitics still matter; major powers, regardless of their ideological bent, don’t like it when other major powers stray into their neighborhoods. It’s true that Moscow’s dismay at the prospect of Ukraine’s membership in NATO most likely is fed in part by nostalgia for the geopolitical heft of the Soviet days, Mr. Putin’s paranoia about a “color revolution” arising in Russia, and mystical delusions about unbreakable civilizational links between Russia and Ukraine. But it is also true that the West erred in dismissing Russia’s legitimate security concerns about NATO setting up shop on the other side of its 1,000-mile-plus border with Ukraine. All major powers desire strategic breathing room — which is precisely why Russia has objected to NATO’s eastern expansion since the end of the Cold War. NATO may be a defensive alliance, but it brings to bear aggregate military power that Russia understandably does not want parked near its territory. Indeed, Moscow’s objections to NATO membership for Ukraine are very much in line with America’s own statecraft, which has long sought to keep other major powers away from its borders. The United States spent much of the 19th century ushering Britain, France, Russia and Spain out of the Western Hemisphere. Thereafter, Washington regularly turned to military intervention to hold sway in the Americas. The exercise of hemispheric hegemony continued during the Cold War, with the United States determined to box the Soviet Union and its ideological sympathizers out of Latin America. When Moscow deployed missiles to Cuba in 1962, the United States issued an ultimatum that brought the superpowers to the brink of war. After Russia recently hinted that it might again deploy its military to Latin America, the State Department spokesman, Ned Price, responded, “If we do see any movement in that direction, we will respond swiftly and decisively.” Given its own track record, Washington should have given greater credence to Moscow’s objections to bringing Ukraine into NATO. NATO’s open door policy has meanwhile encouraged countries in Europe’s east to lean too far over their strategic skis. While the allure of joining the alliance has encouraged aspirants to carry out the democratic reforms needed to qualify for entry, the open door has also prompted prospective members to engage in excessively risky behavior. Not long after NATO in 2008 pledged that Georgia and Ukraine “will become members of NATO,” Georgia’s president, Mikheil Saakashvili, launched an offensive against pro-Russian separatists in South Ossetia with whom the country had been sporadically fighting for years. Russia promptly carved up Georgia, grabbing control of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Mr. Saakashvili thought the West had his back, but he miscalculated and overreached. In similar fashion, NATO encouraged Ukraine to beat a path toward the alliance. The 2014 Maidan Revolution toppled a pro-Moscow regime and put Ukraine on a westward course, resulting in Russia’s intervention in Crimea and Donbas. NATO’s open door then beckoned, prompting Ukrainians in 2019 to enshrine their NATO aspirations in the Constitution. Now Russia has again invaded the country to block its westward path. Given its unenviable proximity to Russia, Ukraine would have been better off playing it safe, quietly building a stable democracy while sticking with the neutral status that it embraced when it exited the Soviet Union. Indeed, Ukraine’s potential return to neutrality figures prominently in the talks between Kyiv and Moscow to end the war. NATO has wisely avoided direct involvement in the fighting in Ukraine in order to avert war with Russia. But NATO’s unwillingness to protect Ukraine has exposed a troubling disconnect between the organization’s stated goal of making the country a member and its judgment that defending Ukraine is not worth the cost. In effect, the United States and its allies, even as they impose severe sanctions on Russia and send arms to Ukraine, are revealing that they do not deem the defense of the country to be a vital interest. But if that is the case, then why have NATO members wanted to extend to Ukraine a security guarantee that would obligate them to go to war in its defense? NATO should extend security guarantees to countries that are of intrinsic strategic importance to the United States and its allies, but it should not make countries strategically important by extending them security guarantees. In a world that is rapidly reverting to the Hobbesian logic of power politics, when adversaries may regularly test U.S. commitments, NATO cannot afford to be profligate in handing out such guarantees. Strategic prudence requires distinguishing vital interests from lesser ones and conducting statecraft accordingly. Beginning the World Over Again Americans have long understood the purpose of their power to be not only security but also the spread of liberty at home and abroad. As Thomas Paine wrote in 1776, “We have it in our power to begin the world over again.” Paine was surely engaging in hyperbole. But successive generations of Americans have taken the nation’s exceptionalist calling to heart, with quite impressive results. Through the power of its example as well as its many exertions abroad — including World War I, World War II and the Cold War — the United States has succeeded in expanding the footprint of liberal democracy. But the ideological aspirations of the United States have at times fueled overreach, producing outcomes at odds with the nation’s idealist ambitions. The founding generation was determined to build an extended republic that would stretch to the Pacific Coast. The exalted banner of Manifest Destiny provided ideological justification for the nation’s westward expansion — but also moral cover for trampling on Native Americans and launching a war of choice against Mexico that led to U.S. annexation of roughly half of Mexico’s territory. President William McKinley in 1898 embarked on a war to expel colonial Spain from Cuba, insisting that Americans had to act “in the cause of humanity.” Yet victory in the Spanish-American War turned the United States itself into an imperial power as it asserted control over Spanish possessions in the Caribbean and Pacific, including the Philippines. The resulting Filipino insurgency led to the deaths of some 4,000 U.S. troops and more than 200,000 Filipino fighters and civilians. As he prepared the country for entry into World War I, President Woodrow Wilson declared before Congress that “the world must be made safe for democracy.” After U.S. forces helped bring the war to a close, he played a leading role in negotiations over the League of Nations, a global body that was to preserve peace through collective action, dispute resolution and disarmament. But such idealist ambitions proved too much even for Americans. The Senate shot down U.S. membership in the League; Wilson’s ideological overreach cleared the way for the stubborn isolationism of the interwar era. “The Iraqi people are deserving and capable of human liberty,” President George W. Bush proclaimed just before launching the invasion of Iraq in 2003. But the war resulted in far more bloodshed and chaos than liberty. Likewise, two decades of exhaustive U.S. efforts to bring stability and democracy to Afghanistan fell far short, with the American withdrawal last summer giving way to Taliban rule and a humanitarian nightmare. Across these historical episodes, noble ambitions became divorced from strategic realities, yielding dreadful results. Getting Real NATO meant well in opening its doors to Ukraine, yet good intentions have again stumbled on geopolitical realities. To be sure, Mr. Putin had the opportunity to settle his objections to Ukraine’s membership in NATO at the negotiating table. Last June, President Biden admitted that whether Ukraine joins the alliance “remains to be seen”; more recently, President Emmanuel Macron of France floated the idea of “Finlandization” for Ukraine — effective neutrality — and proposals for a formal moratorium on further enlargement circulated. Mr. Putin could have picked up these leads, but he instead opted for war — and now owns the resulting death and destruction. Russia’s relationship with the West is fast heading toward militarized rivalry. In light of the tight strategic partnership that has emerged between Moscow and Beijing — and China’s own geopolitical ambitions — the next Cold War may well pit the West against a Sino-Russian bloc stretching from the Western Pacific to Eastern Europe. The return of a two-bloc world that plays by the rules of realpolitik means that Washington will need to dial back its efforts to expand the liberal order, instead returning to a strategy of patient containment aimed at preserving geopolitical stability and avoiding great-power war. A new strategic conservatism will require avoiding the further extension of defense commitments into geographic areas that Russia and China consider their rimlands. Instead, the United States should seek stable balances of power in the European and Asia-Pacific theaters. Washington will need to strengthen its forward presence in both theaters, requiring higher and smarter military spending and the strict avoidance of demanding wars of choice and nation-building adventures in the Middle East or other peripheral regions. At the same time, taming an interdependent world will require working across ideological lines. Washington should ease off on the promotion of democracy and human rights abroad and the Biden administration should refrain from its tendency to articulate a geopolitical vision that too neatly divides the world into democracies and autocracies. Strategic and economic expedience will at times push the United States to partner with repressive regimes; moderating oil prices, for example, may require collaboration with Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Even though the United States will continue teaming up with its traditional democratic allies in Europe and Asia, many of the world’s democracies will avoid taking sides in a new era of East-West rivalry. Indeed, Brazil, India, Israel, South Africa and other democracies have been sitting on the fence when it comes to responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia clearly poses the most immediate threat to geopolitical stability in Eurasia, but China, because of its emergence as a true competitor of the United States, still poses the greater geopolitical challenge in the longer term. Now that Russia and China are regularly teaming up, they could together constitute an opposing bloc far more formidable than its Soviet forebear. Accordingly, the United States should exploit opportunities to put distance between Moscow and Beijing, following the lead of the quintessential realists Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, who in the 1970s weakened the Communist bloc by driving a wedge between China and the Soviet Union. The United States should play both sides. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine marks a fundamental breach with the Atlantic democracies, yet the West cannot afford to completely turn its back on Russia; too much is at stake. As during the Cold War, Washington will need a hybrid strategy of containment and engagement. Russia should remain in the penalty box for now, with the United States pushing back against the Kremlin’s territorial expansionism and other aggressive behavior by reinforcing NATO’s eastern flank and maintaining harsh economic sanctions. But Washington should also remain on the lookout for opportunities to engage with Moscow. Its invasion of Ukraine has just made Russia an economic and strategic dependent of China; Mr. Putin will not relish being Xi Jinping’s sidekick. The United States should exploit the Kremlin’s discomfort with becoming China’s junior partner by signaling that Russia has a Western option. Assuming an eventual peace settlement in Ukraine that permits the scaling back of sanctions, the Western democracies should remain open to cautious and selective cooperation with Moscow. Areas of potential collaboration include furthering nuclear and conventional arms control, sharing best practices and technologies on alternatives to fossil fuels, and jointly developing rules of the road to govern military and economic activity in the Arctic. Russia needs China more than China needs Russia, so Washington should also seek to pull Beijing away from Moscow. Beijing’s ambiguous response to the invasion of Ukraine suggests at least a measure of discomfort with the economic and geopolitical disruption that has been produced by Russian recklessness. Yet Beijing continues to benefit from Russian energy and strategic cooperation and from the fact that Mr. Putin is forcing the United States to focus on Europe, thereby stalling the U.S. “pivot to Asia.” Nonetheless, Washington should keep an eye out for opportunities to work with Beijing in areas of common interest — trade, climate change, North Korea, digital governance, public health — to improve relations, tackle global problems and potentially weaken the bond between China and Russia. As during the Cold War, a world of rival blocs could mean economic as well as geopolitical division. The severe impact of the sanctions imposed on Russia underscores the dark side of globalization, potentially driving home to both the United States and China that economic interdependence entails quite considerable risk. China could distance itself from global markets and financial systems, while Washington could seek to further decouple the United States from Chinese investment, technology, goods and supply chains. The world may be entering a prolonged and costly era of deglobalization. The United States will always be an idealist country struggling to navigate a realist world. That’s as it should be; the globe is a better place for it. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a geopolitical watershed: A more realist world is back, requiring that America’s idealist ambitions yield more regularly to inescapable strategic realities.

2022-04-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/opinion/germany-russia-ukraine-trade-gas.html,"Opinion | Putin, Ukraine and the Illusion That Trade Brings Peace","On April 12, 1861, rebel artillery opened fire on Fort Sumter, beginning the U.S. Civil War. The war eventually became a catastrophe for the South, which lost more than a fifth of its young men. But why did the secessionists believe they could pull it off? One reason was they believed themselves to be in possession of a powerful economic weapon. The economy of Britain, the world’s leading power at the time, was deeply dependent on Southern cotton, and they thought a cutoff of that supply would force Britain to intervene on the side of the Confederacy. Indeed, the Civil War initially created a “cotton famine” that threw thousands of Britons out of work. In the end, of course, Britain stayed neutral — in part because British workers saw the Civil War as a moral crusade against slavery and rallied to the Union cause despite their suffering. Why recount this old history? Because it has obvious relevance to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It seems fairly clear that Vladimir Putin saw the reliance of Europe, and Germany in particular, on Russian natural gas the same way slave owners saw Britain’s reliance on King Cotton: a form of economic dependence that would coerce these nations into enabling his military ambitions. And he wasn’t entirely wrong. Last week I castigated Germany for its unwillingness to make economic sacrifices for the sake of Ukraine’s freedom. But let’s not forget that Germany’s response to Ukraine’s pleas for military aid on the eve of war was also pathetic. Britain and the United States rushed to provide lethal weapons, including hundreds of the anti-tank missiles that were so crucial in repelling Russia’s attack on Kyiv. Germany offered and dragged its feet on delivering … 5,000 helmets. And it’s not hard to imagine that if, say, Donald Trump were still president here, Putin’s bet that international trade would be a force for coercion, not peace, would have been vindicated. If you think I’m trying to help shame Germany into becoming a better defender of democracy, you’re right. But I’m also trying to make a broader point about the relationship between globalization and war, which isn’t as simple as many people have assumed. There has been a longstanding belief among Western elites that commerce is good for peace, and vice versa. America’s long push for trade liberalization, which began even before World War II, was always in part a political project: Cordell Hull, Franklin Roosevelt’s secretary of state, firmly believed that lower tariffs and increased international trade would help lay the foundations for peace. The European Union, too, was both an economic and a political project. Its origins lie in the European Coal and Steel Community, established in 1952 with the explicit goal of making French and German industry so interdependent that there could never be another European war. And the roots of Germany’s current vulnerability go back to the 1960s, when the West German government began pursuing Ostpolitik — “eastern policy” — seeking to normalize relations, including economic relations, with the Soviet Union, in the hope that growing integration with the West would strengthen civil society and move the East toward democracy. Russian gas began flowing to Germany in 1973. So does trade promote peace and freedom? Surely it does in some cases. In other cases, however, authoritarian rulers more concerned with power than with prosperity may see economic integration with other nations as a license for bad behavior, assuming that democracies with a strong financial stake in their regimes will turn a blind eye to their abuses of power. I’m not talking just about Russia. The European Union has stood by for years while Viktor Orban of Hungary has systematically dismantled liberal democracy. How much of this weakness can be explained by the large Hungarian investments that European, and especially German, companies have made while pursuing cost-cutting outsourcing? And then there’s the really big question: China. Does Xi Jinping see China’s close integration with the world economy as a reason to avoid adventurous policies — such as invading Taiwan — or as a reason to expect a weak-kneed Western response? Nobody knows. Now, I’m not suggesting a return to protectionism. I am suggesting that national-security concerns about trade — real concerns, not farcical versions like Trump’s invocation of national security to impose tariffs on Canadian aluminum — need to be taken more seriously than I, among others, used to believe. More immediately, however, law-abiding nations need to show that they won’t be deterred from defending freedom. Autocrats may believe that financial exposure to their authoritarian regimes will make democracies afraid to stand up for their values. We need to prove them wrong. And what that means in practice is both that Europe must move quickly to cut off imports of Russian oil and gas and that the West needs to supply Ukraine with the weapons it needs, not just to hold Putin at bay, but to win a clear-cut victory.

2022-04-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/opinion/words-expressions-idioms.html,"Opinion | When You Hear the F-Word, Try Picking Up More Than One Meaning","People occasionally complain to me that so many today seem to lean on profanity rather than utilizing the other lexical resources at their disposal. “Why do they have to keep using that word over and over? What is that?” I was asked by someone of a certain age, for example, when I spoke at a gathering of academics last week. We all can guess which word he meant — it starts with f — but I don’t hear it the way he does. It’s partly because we sometimes miss the richness of meaning in our profanity and partly because we tend to miss the richness of how we use the rest of our vocabulary. Our default sense of a word involves a single meaning: Even when a word such as “candle,” typically used as a noun, is used as a verb, it still means holding a candle or a light up to better see something. But so very many words are used in a wide range of meanings, and while idioms are part of that range, even they are only the beginning. The morning before the event I spoke at, for example, I watched the new Blu-ray restoration of the first “A Star Is Born” film, from 1937. (Film fans should get a look; this is one of the major early Technicolor films, and it now looks splendid.) In one scene, Norman (played beautifully by Fredric March, whose purported membership in the Ku Klux Klan I took issue with last fall) playfully replies to ribbing from Esther (Janet Gaynor) with: “And don’t throw that up to me now.” I had never heard that expression but easily found it in an older book, and its meaning is evident. To use it back then meant that one knew not only the basic meaning of the word “throw” but also its use in this expression, which is so abstractly connected to the action of hurling or tossing that it qualifies as a separate piece of mental data. The expression is, put differently, an idiom — a different “word” in itself, under ways that many linguists analyze how language is stored and produced in the brain. But there are intermediate cases between basic meaning and bona fide idiom. When we say that someone threw up, is that an idiom? Part of the essence of an idiom is that you wouldn’t immediately know its meaning out of context — “chewing the fat,” “being stood up,” “throw that up to me,” etc. In contrast, the relationship of “throw up” to throwing is, upon a bit of reflection, rather obvious; it’s why people also say “hurl” or “upchuck” to mean the same thing. If people are learning English, do we consider their recognition that this is how we routinely refer to that action as having grasped one of our idioms? Not really. “Throw up,” in this sense, is a word that happens to have two parts that we write separately. What we think of as one word with one meaning can in use actually be many, many more words, and not just in the sense of stark and obvious homonyms such as “spring” as a season and “spring” as a coil. This is beautifully illustrated with my favorite example: “pick up.” Its basic meaning is to lift something. But we also pick up our kids from school. Someone might pick someone up at a bar. You pick up a disease, or someone says you’ve picked up the habit of overusing certain salty words. In all those cases, we see a relationship with the “lift” meaning. Few would say that when we talk of picking up our kids, we are tossing in an idiom. Rather, these uses of “pick up” are something more mundane than idioms; they are words of their own. That these are separate words is especially clear when the relationship with lifting gets more abstract: A car picks up speed; a cocktail picks up your spirits; we pick up a sound from far off; we pick up where we left off. Yes, “pick” and “up” are words in their own right, but in this case a combination of the two is the source of what are actually many more words, and this is the case with countless others. Think a bit about the different things “make up” can mean, for example. Yet no one would be accused of overusing the words “pick” or “make,” much less the word “up.” The key is how we use them. And this brings us back to the profanity issue. When we perceive a word as used a lot or too much, it’s often being used to mean multiple things. The casual usage of “like” divides into about four different usages, some having drifted pretty dramatically from its stock definition. The N-word that ends with “er” and the N-word that ends with “a” are, for all intents and purposes (idiom alert!), different words now, and the latter is also developing into, of all things, new pronouns. What we might hear as a mere matter of yet another F-bomb is actually a vocabular sapling sprouting apace, with branches growing in different directions. As I put it in “Nine Nasty Words” (with wording a notch too zesty to print here), the F-word can convey destruction, deception, dismissal, dauntingness and down-to-earthness. Russian speakers seem to get this more readily about profanity than English speakers. There is a tradition among Russians of cherishing its richness; for example, a Russian I am especially fond of has given me dense, sober volumes chronicling and exploring their profanity. Hence, what some bemoan as too much profanity is, to me, the equivalent of the glories of what Russians call mat, or dirty language. As the writer Edward Topol wrote in “Dermo!: The Real Russian Tolstoy Never Used,” a nonnative speaker who learns “even one-third of this lexicon can be sure of being the most popular and honored foreigner at any Russian gathering.” Linguists are sometimes thought to be permissive about usage matters, but we recognize how fertile English’s assortment of four-letter words — our mat — and even our unsung words like “pick up” and “make up” are. Think further of “turn out,” including the Black English usage of it I mentioned recently, and this is why the linguist hears a lexical smorgasbord in normal people expressing themselves.

2022-04-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/world/europe/barentsburg-norway-ukraine-war-russia.html,Tensions Over the Ukraine War Deepen the Chill Near the North Pole,"BARENTSBURG, Norway — At first glance, Sergey Gushchin, 50, is perhaps not a man one would assume to be the Russian consul general at the world’s northernmost diplomatic mission: ponytail, bluejeans, bass player in a punk band. Yet on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago located between mainland Norway and the North Pole, it has long been a point of pride to distinguish people from governments. Russians, Ukrainians and Norwegians have lived side by side for decades in this isolated and extreme wilderness known mostly for polar bears and a rapidly warming climate, not for divisive politics. There is a saying in the high Arctic that if your snowmobile breaks down, no one asks for your nationality before helping to repair it. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has echoed at the top of the world, threatening longstanding personal and professional relationships, cultural interactions and even friendly sports rivalries. The Svalbard tourist board has called for a boycott of Russian state-owned businesses in the coal mining settlement of Barentsburg. Mr. Gushchin, until now considered an inclusive, moderating figure, has surprised and angered many with comments concerning the Russian invasion and an accusation that Norwegian news media provide mostly “fake news.” Timofey Rogozhin, the former top Russian tourist official in Barentsburg, who left his job last year, now spends considerable time on Telegram, countering Russian propaganda about the invasion. Calling himself a dissident, he describes atrocities committed in Ukrainian towns as “not mistakes but crimes.” “Svalbard is a place where people from all different countries have managed to get along peacefully,” said Elizabeth Bourne, an American who is director of the Spitsbergen Artists Center in Longyearbyen, the primarily Norwegian transportation, commerce, research and university hub of Svalbard. “This situation is in danger of putting an end to that. I think that would be a tragedy.” Longyearbyen is about 30 miles northeast of Barentsburg and is inhabited by roughly 2,500 residents from 50 nations. Cultural exchanges involving singing and dancing, and sports exchanges involving games like chess and basketball have been ongoing between Barentsburg and Longyearbyen since the Soviet era. Their longevity is made more remarkable by the lack of a road between the towns. Travel must be done by snowmobile, boat or helicopter. “Maybe people of Longyearbyen wouldn’t like to see me, but they still like to see people of Barentsburg,” Mr. Gushchin said. A 1920 treaty gave Norway sovereignty over Svalbard. But other nations that signed the treaty, including the Soviet Union/Russia, have been granted equal rights to conduct such commercial activities as mining, scientific research and tourism. The Russian consulate in Barentsburg overlooks the Green Fjord and a kind of outdoor museum of the Soviet past: a bust of Lenin, a Cyrillic sign proclaiming “Communism is our goal,” refurbished Stalinist apartment blocks and smokestacks that belch sulfurous coal at the local power plant. Once, more than 1,000 people lived here. Now there are only about 370, two-thirds of them Ukrainian, Mr. Gushchin said. Most miners are from the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which has close ties to Russia. It is the area where fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists began in 2014. Others from the region work in tourism and other service jobs. A number of Russians and Ukrainians approached by a New York Times reporter on Wednesday refused to discuss politics. But Natalia Maksimishina, a Russian tour guide, criticized Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, referring to possible war crimes committed by Russian forces and saying, “I hope to see him next in The Hague.” Barentsburg is essentially operated by Trust Arktikugol, a Russian state-run mining enterprise. The boycott called for by the Svalbard tourist board recommends that money not be spent in the town’s hotel, Red Bear pub and brewery, restaurants or souvenir shop. Barentsburg seemed mostly empty on Wednesday, except for clots of tourists arriving on a small ship. Before the pandemic, tourism brought in more money than coal, Mr. Gushchin said. Now, he added, Trust Arktikugol loses “big money” weekly. Many tourists who do visit bring their own food and leave quickly, he said. Critics of the boycott say it hurts the Russian government less than local people in Barentsburg, most of them Ukrainian. Credit cards issued by Russian banks don’t work in the Norwegian financial system amid international sanctions. Flights are difficult to schedule. In a light moment during an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Gushchin lamented that his band’s solo guitarist had moved away. “When you have only a bass player and a drummer, it resembles more like punk, not rock,” he said. In a more serious moment, Mr. Gushchin put logs on a fire in the consulate’s reception area, but did not attempt to thaw the sudden chill between him and many on Svalbard. He stood by debunked remarks he made in English in early April to Nettavisen, a Norwegian online newspaper. He told the outlet that buildings in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol had been destroyed not by Russian projectiles but by a Ukrainian battalion with Nazi sympathies. And that a pregnant woman photographed outside of a besieged hospital was not a patient. Asked by Nettavisen whether he felt obliged to make such remarks in his official capacity, Mr. Gushchin said they also reflected his opinion. Otherwise, he said, he would have to resign his post immediately. On Wednesday, Mr. Gushchin said, “I saw that it really touched feelings of many Norwegians, but I told them what I think.” His remarks to Nettavisen were jarring to many, who found them sharply contrasting with Mr. Gushchin’s position as a subdeacon in the Russian Orthodox Church. Last August, he helped perform the liturgy at Svalbard Church in Longyearbyen, a parish of the Church of Norway. Siv Limstrand, the Lutheran pastor at Svalbard Church, said she had previously considered Mr. Gushchin to be “very friendly, easygoing, nonformal, extending communication and cooperation.” “People get disappointed, but he is a state official,” Ms. Limstrand said. “We can’t really expect something different from him. But a little more diplomacy, I think, could have been within reach.” Having arrived in Barentsburg in November 2018, Mr. Gushchin awaits his successor, saying he and his wife are eager to return to Moscow to see their 22-year-old daughter and his 82-year-old mother. Perhaps, many who know him on Svalbard say privately, that is why he dares not contradict Mr. Putin. Clearly, Mr. Gushchin is sensitive to optics. On Wednesday, he declined to be photographed standing beside a taxidermied polar bear in the consulate, saying it would convey a misleading symbol of Russian aggression. He also said he would not attend a planned cultural exchange in Longyearbyen on May 21 so as “not to provoke anybody.” “There are a lot of Russian and Ukrainian compatriots and also Norwegians who won’t be very happy if I take part,” Mr. Gushchin said. When he took the posting on Svalbard, Mr. Gushchin said, he considered it a “dream” job, one that has been “a big adventure.” But he also said he is ready to return to Russia. With a sigh, then a laugh, he said he hoped the invasion of Ukraine did not become “something more ugly and global.” If World War III breaks out “and we’re stuck here,” he said with gallows humor, “it will be difficult to go home.”",29
2022-04-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/us/politics/biden-ukraine-domestic-agenda.html,The War in Ukraine Is Upending Biden’s Agenda at Home,"WASHINGTON — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has scrambled the global foreign policy landscape. But it has also upended President Biden’s domestic agenda back home, diverting the attention of the White House and contributing to rising prices that have become a top concern of Americans just months before congressional elections. Three months after Mr. Biden vowed in a sprawling, two-hour news conference to continue fighting for college tuition, child care, early education, prescription drugs and the environment, the president’s domestic agenda has drastically shriveled. The fighting in Ukraine has disrupted global oil markets, sending gas prices and inflation in the United States soaring and — for the moment — pushing aside longer-term issues that Mr. Biden had long hoped would become the centerpiece of his legacy. Mr. Biden, who spent months in congressional negotiations last year, now spends more of his time responding to the global crisis caused by Russia. Last month, he flew to Europe for four days of emergency meetings with allies. The president is expected to attend two more European summits in May and June. Asked about the administration’s legislative goals in an interview this week, Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, said the targets for the next several months included a bill to support American innovation and the semiconductor industry, and funding requests to battle the coronavirus and continue sending weapons to Ukraine. “We’ve got a bunch of agenda items like that,” Mr. Klain said on a podcast hosted by Chuck Todd of NBC News, conceding, “The calendar has only so many months left in this year.” Mr. Klain and others in the West Wing insist the president has not given up on larger ambitions. White House officials quietly continue to talk with lawmakers about some parts of what they used to call the president’s “Build Back Better” social policy agenda, which they still hope to pass with just a bare majority in the Senate using a legislative maneuver called reconciliation. “The president also continues to work with a wide range of lawmakers,” Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement, “on a reconciliation plan that would cut the costs of prescription drugs, energy and child care while lowering the deficit even more and fighting inflation for the long haul, as well as a landmark bill to strengthen our competitiveness with regard to China.” But Mr. Biden — who no longer uses the phrase “Build Back Better” because members of his own party distanced themselves from it when the legislation bogged down in bickering — has done little in recent weeks to revive parts of the $2.2 trillion bill that he fought for last year. On Thursday, during a visit to a historically black college in North Carolina, Mr. Biden ended a speech with a hopeful riff in which he said politicians in the United States had come together in unison to invest in middle-class families, colleges and clean technologies. “Let’s keep building a better America because that’s who we are,” Mr. Biden said, almost pleadingly. “And we can do this.” But polling suggests the sentiment is at odds with the reality of the country Mr. Biden governs and the Washington establishment he presides over, where politics have become more divisive, the country is less unified about the right direction, and the world is distracted by Russia’s brutal attempt to take over a neighbor. A poll by Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service on civility in America released in February found the country deeply divided, with most people concerned about the rising cost of goods. In a Monmouth University poll last month, voters used the words “divided,” “mess” and “chaos” to describe the American political system. Mr. Biden’s aides frequently lean on the cliché that they can “walk and chew gum at the same time” to suggest that the president and his team can pursue his domestic agenda while navigating the crisis in Ukraine. They point in particular to Mr. Biden’s $5.8 trillion budget, which he released at the end of March. But while he proposed an increase in domestic spending of close to 7 percent, the president’s plan puts far less emphasis on the kind of big, ambitious social programs that have stalled amid opposition from moderate Democrats and almost all Republicans. The annual budget was in some ways the clearest indication of how far the president has pulled back in the midst of the Russian invasion, rising inflation and political stalemate in Washington. It included a nod to Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, whose opposition to the social policy plan helped tank its chances at the end of last year. The budget called for reducing the nation’s budget deficit by $1 trillion over the next decade, something Mr. Manchin has repeatedly said is necessary for the country’s economic health. In the interview this week, Mr. Klain hinted that the administration was still trying to persuade Mr. Manchin to sign on to some version of some pieces of the broader legislation. The Democratic caucus holds 50 seats in the evenly divided Senate and can approve the legislation over unified Republican opposition only with Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote, meaning that failing to convince even one Democratic lawmaker — like Mr. Manchin — prevents it from passing. “We have to come back and figure out what formula works with the 50 to get it passed in the Senate,” Mr. Klain said. “And you know, we’re not there, that’s for sure.” But even if the president makes progress on that legislation, it is not the only part of his domestic agenda that remains incomplete. As a candidate, Mr. Biden vowed to find a new bipartisan willingness in Congress to confront longstanding challenges like overhauls to the nation’s immigration system, policing and sentencing, and a new sense of equity in how the government spends money. The immigration bill he sent to Congress on his first day in office is going nowhere, blocked by opposition from Republicans and squabbling among his allies. Efforts to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would have made it easier to prosecute police officers, died in Congress last year. And efforts to make good on sweeping climate change legislation have sputtered. Courts have stymied the president on some initiatives. Early last year, Mr. Biden signed economic stimulus legislation that included $4 billion for Black and other “socially disadvantaged” farmers who were discriminated against for years by banks and the federal government. But the money remains frozen because of lawsuits. In the face of those failures, Mr. Biden has said he will increase the use of executive actions that do not require congressional approval. Officials say the president is close to signing an executive order on changes to policing that was delayed by a surge in violent crime across the country. Mr. Biden has also stressed the steps he has taken to address inflation, including releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and efforts to encourage competition in industries like meatpacking. In his remarks on Thursday in North Carolina, Mr. Biden called on Congress to act quickly on the semiconductor legislation, a sprawling bipartisan effort that would invest billions of dollars with the goal of helping the United States compete against China and other countries. The House and Senate passed competing versions of the bill and must reconcile the changes before sending it to Mr. Biden’s desk. Mr. Biden said the legislation would bring down the cost of goods, noting for the audience that it would provide $90 billion for research and development, manufacturing and education in science, technology, engineering and math. “All those elements of the supply chain,” he said, “we need to produce end products right here in America.”",1
2022-04-16,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/world/europe/moskva-sinking-vadym-krasnooky.html,Moskva’s Sinking Inspires One of Ukraine’s Most Popular Rockers,"The sinking of the Russian warship Moskva is being celebrated by Ukrainians as an iconic victory, including in a new song by one of the country’s most popular rock musicians. Vadym Krasnooky, the lead singer of Mad Heads, on Saturday debuted an acoustic version of “Cruiser Moskva” at a news conference. He said he wrote the song after the sinking of the Moskva, the pride of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which the Pentagon confirmed Friday was struck by two Ukrainian Neptune missiles. Mad Heads, which has played rock, hillbilly and psychobilly music since its founding 25 years ago, had stopped performing when Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Mr. Krasnooky appeared solo with an acoustic guitar in Lviv to perform the new song, which includes the refrain: “Oh the ship, oh the ship, Moskva burn! Burn! Burn in hell forever.” “We have to find a way to channel all this hate,” he told The New York Times. The song’s lyrics reference an incident from the beginning of the war, when a border guard on a rocky outpost of Ukraine reportedly responded to Russian calls for surrender with an expletive telling the ship what it could do. A Ukrainian official has claimed the Moskva was the ship involved in that incident. “The ship became transformed into a symbol of our enemy,” Mr. Krasnooky said.",29
2022-04-18,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/opinion/letters/elon-musk-twitter.html,Opinion | Elon Musk’s Bid to Take Over Twitter,"To the Editor: Re “After Toying With Twitter, Musk Now Wants It All” (front page, April 15): What a disaster it would be for Elon Musk to acquire Twitter and open it up to disinformation and lies from Donald Trump and other right-wing activists. Misinformation, unconstrained by any need to be accurate or honest, is psychologically seductive, and countering it by fact-checking is often ineffective. That is why the right wing is in full support of Mr. Musk, cynically claiming that it’s a “free speech” issue. Twitter would likely return to broadcasting anti-democratic misinformation about elections, with devastating consequences. In the face of intense voter suppression, gerrymandering and partisan attacks on election boards and secretaries of state, America’s grasp on democracy is already very shaky. The country just barely survived a coup attempt on Jan 6. A return to a complete free-for-all on Twitter is a frightening prospect. Gary M. StewartLaguna Beach, Calif. To the Editor: In a stunning move, Elon Musk has taken action into his own hands by offering to take over Twitter for more than $40 billion. The world’s richest person, in a letter to Twitter’s board chairman, stated his primary goal: to transform Twitter, the de facto town square, “to be the platform for free speech around the globe.” It should be a given that all social media platforms, including Twitter, should adhere to free speech principles, but sadly that is not the case. In addition, social media should make life better. Its hallmarks should be open communication, respectful dialogue and the good-faith, free exchange of ideas and information. It should be part of the solution, not the problem. Again, this is not the case. Social media today has become a source of hostility, lack of civility, distrust, propaganda, alienation, misinformation and cancellation. Mr. Musk’s efforts should be applauded and celebrated. Just as his other endeavors have revolutionized industry, I am confident that he’ll do the same for the social media sector. A meaningful and fundamental transformation of Twitter is required. A mere change in management, financial structure or algorithms will not suffice. Can it be done? Yes. It’s not a mission to Mars. But what Elon Musk is suggesting can be a giant leap forward for our society. Dan RubinoNew YorkThe writer is the founder and executive chairman of ImpactWayv, a media and technology company created to disrupt and transform business and philanthropy. To the Editor: Elon Musk’s offer to buy Twitter is understandably creating much consternation, particularly among those who worry about concentrating too much power over public media in one person’s hands. I wonder if there might be a way to revise the F.C.C.’s media cross-ownership rules, which were designed to avoid a single corporate entity from owning multiple types of media companies, to somehow reduce Twitter’s power over the global messaging landscape. These rules were conceived long before the advent of social media, so they could not have foreseen platforms like Twitter and Facebook that consolidate audiences at a global level and concentrate messaging power in such dramatic fashion. Maybe it’s time for the F.C.C. to dust off the cross-ownership rules and figure out how to make them relevant to our current media landscape. Tom ShortSan Rafael, Calif. To the Editor: The United States has been understandably reluctant to undertake military actions, such as a no-fly zone over Ukraine, that would entail initiating attacks on Russian forces. But the barbarism of Vladimir Putin’s invasion requires that we do far more to enable the Ukrainians themselves to repel the aggressors. Let us move powerful allied military forces — including those from the U.S., Canada and Britain — into several of the large blocks of territory that Russia has not yet penetrated or from which it has been repulsed. At the very least, let us establish large, well-defined defensive perimeters around Kyiv and Odesa, and across a wide swath of Ukraine’s western border. Any direct confrontations between the allied and Russian forces would have to be at Mr. Putin’s initiative — as a result of Russian attacks — and he should be as reluctant as President Biden has been to take such risks. But the presence of allied forces would free more Ukrainian forces to confront the Russians on the active fronts, and it would guarantee safer corridors by which military and humanitarian equipment could reach the beleaguered nation. Mr. Putin is on a “holy” cause: to restore the sway of the czarist and Soviet empires. Further inconveniences targeting the oligarchs he has created and the masses he dominates will not deter his efforts to establish his “heroic” place in history as the 21st-century heir to the czars and the commissars. Only a solid military defeat can shatter that evil dream. Peter EcksteinAnn Arbor, Mich.The writer is the retired research director of the Michigan A.F.L.-C.I.O. To the Editor: Re “Still Feeling the Bern,” by Maureen Dowd (column, Sunday Review, April 17): Bernie Sanders never had my vote, but he had — and still has — my admiration. It’s not because of what he thinks, although I’m in favor of some of that, but why he thinks it. Bernie Sanders is that rare politician who clearly, truly believes in and cares about what he says. It’s awful that sincerity of that kind should be remarkable. But it is. More and more politicians today say whatever they think will get them elected, whether it’s expressing devotion to Donald Trump or dissing vaccinations. If only these people had some kind of Oscar they could strive for. We could probably even count on them not to slap anybody. Betty RollinNew YorkThe writer is a journalist and the author of “First, You Cry” and “Last Wish.” To the Editor: Re “For-Profit College Preyed on Black and Female Students, Suit Says” (news article, April 12): The class-action lawsuit against Walden University that claims the for-profit college overcharged Black women more than $28.5 million for costs and credits is a welcome challenge to an industry that preys on people of color. But education is far from the only sector where racial and gender discrimination is systemic. It’s well established that the U.S. economy was built from the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow, where the exploitation and occupational segregation of people of color led to a two-track economy, progressing at vastly different speeds. “Reverse redlining,” for example, is on the rise in housing, as minority neighborhoods are targeted with higher prices or unfair lending practices. Black homeownership has declined more drastically than for any other ethnic or racial group in the U.S. We need strengthened civil rights laws and enforcement, and more lawsuits like the class-action suit against Walden, to bring those who profit off economic discrimination to justice, and make them pay.

2022-04-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/middleeast/ukraine-memes-russia-fundraising.html,How Memes Are Driving Ukraine’s Fundraising Efforts,"LVIV, Ukraine — Christian Borys was at home in Toronto in February trying to find a way to help Ukrainians threatened by war when he decided to print some stickers from an internet meme: the Virgin Mary hoisting an antitank missile. Mr. Borys, who had worked for the e-commerce platform Shopify before turning to journalism, said he created a website in half an hour, hoping to raise money to send to a charity for Ukrainian orphans. That night, he made 88 Canadian dollars in sales. By the time he added T-shirts at the end of February, the threat of war had turned into a full-scale invasion, and he said sales grew to 170,000 Canadian dollars a day — most coming from the United States. “The internet speaks in memes and it just became this crazy, viral sensation,” he said. “I think it’s because people were looking for a symbol of support, a way to support Ukraine, because they saw the whole injustice of everything.” Images such as Ukrainian tractors towing away a disabled Russian tank and helicopter, although unverified, have not only helped fight Russian disinformation, but also helped support Ukrainian charities and even the Ukrainian military. The merchandise sales they have generated in the United States and elsewhere are surprising given that many people buying the T-shirts, stickers, coffee mugs and chocolate bars would never have thought about the Eastern European country before the conflict. Mr. Borys’s site, Saint Javelin, has raised so far almost $1.5 million to assist the Ukrainian charity Help Us Help, which has branched into multiple services, and to provide protective equipment for journalists covering the war, he said. “I think it’s unprecedented,” said Peter Dickinson, editor of the UkraineAlert service at the Atlantic Council, speaking about the internet-generated support. “We’ve got to bear in mind that this is a technological thing as well, that we’re at the point where the tools are in place.” When Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, the invasion received far less attention in the West. This time, President Biden’s warning in mid-February that Russia was days away from invading Ukraine brought thousands of journalists rushing in, and the news dominated the headlines. “Russia had been very successful in the past about putting out all sorts of information about Ukraine because nobody really knew much about Ukraine,” Mr. Dickinson said. “It was like a blank slate.” That quickly changed starting in February when Ukraine was seen as the clear underdog against a much more powerful invader. Crowdfunding efforts sprung up — raising millions of dollars for the Ukrainian military, including through cryptocurrency — when European allies at first would not send more arms to the country to avoid inflaming the fighting. Now the overwhelming public image of Ukraine, boosted by memes and merchandise, is of a plucky country that, against all odds, is turning the tide of war. “This is about the spirit of our fight and our struggle,” said Taras Maselko, marketing director for the clothing company Aviatsiya Halychyny, which sells T-shirts under a category called “Fight Like Ukrainians.” Mr. Maselko said 20 percent of the orders came from outside Ukraine. “You know if you are wearing a T-shirt, if you are reading something on social media, it brings you to the reality of what is going on in Ukraine,” he said. The clothing brand’s biggest seller is a T-shirt with the now-famous, vulgar response that Ukrainian border guards on Snake Island, an outpost in the Black Sea, gave to a Russian warship that had ordered him and his unit to surrender. The response is a rallying call, with all its vulgarity, put up on billboards in Ukraine and chanted by children and their parents at protests outside the country. This week, Ukraine’s postal service unveiled a stamp depicting a Ukrainian navy special forces operator with his middle finger raised at the warship. It plans to launch a website to sell the stamps, coffee cups and other merchandise. The Russian warship, called the Moskva, sank on Thursday after Ukraine fired Neptune missiles at it, according to U.S. officials. The Russian government denied that it was attacked and said that it was disabled when a fire broke out. The head of the Ukrainian post office called the stamp “a symbol of courage and indomitable spirit of the Ukrainian people in the fight against Russia.” The post office is printing one million stamps and selling them at face value, the equivalent of less than $1 each, its director, Igor Smelyansky, said in an interview. He said some people reselling the stamps for much more had pledged to donate the proceeds to the Ukrainian army. But Mr. Smelyansky, who is Ukrainian American, said the opportunity to demoralize Russia was priceless. “As the postal service we are always happy when the addressee gets the message,” he said. Humor amid adversity runs deep in Ukrainian culture. Before being elected president three years ago, President Volodymyr Zelensky was a comedian. A famous Russian painting depicts the Zaporozhian Cossacks, in what is now Ukraine, laughing uproariously as they draft a profanity-laced letter to the 17th-century sultan of the Ottoman Empire who demanded that they submit to him. In the current wartime, shops in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv sell chocolate bars with images of Mr. Zelensky. Another has the president’s adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, depicted as a television sitcom character saying, “Everything will be fine.” Aviatsiya Halychyny, the clothing company, continues to produce the T-shirts in Lviv. Profits from the T-shirt line are being sent to the Ukrainian Air Force, with about $70,000 raised so far, according to Mr. Maselko. Three weeks ago, Mr. Borys, a Canadian of Ukrainian Polish origin, turned Saint Javelin from an all-volunteer effort to a full-time staff of four to keep up with demand. His website has branched out from the Virgin Mary to other saints: Saint Carl Gustaf wears a gas mask, while “Saint Olha, the Warrior Queen of Kyiv” wears a crown and hoists a bazooka over her camouflaged shoulders. “People on Instagram demand we make things basically,” Mr. Borys said. “We get messages from people in Spain who say, ‘Hey, we just shipped the C-90,’ a shoulder-fired rocket propelled grenade launcher,” he said. “And they’ll say, ‘Hey we want a saint for Spain’ or a saint specific to that type of system.” The Virgin Mary, dressed in blue and gold robes and holding a Javelin, is an image adapted from a painting by the American artist Chris Shaw. Mr. Shaw based that painting on an earlier work in 2012 with the Madonna holding a Kalashnikov rifle. Mr. Borys acknowledges that some people may find the image blasphemous. “People definitely get offended but the vast, vast majority of people see what it actually stands for,” he said. “Religious symbolism has been used in war for hundreds of years. To say it’s blasphemous is not understanding the reality of war and how people look for symbols of support.”",29
2022-04-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/opinion/why-we-admire-zelensky.html,Opinion | Why We Admire Zelensky,"Why do we admire Volodymyr Zelensky? The question almost answers itself. We admire him because, in the face of unequal odds, Ukraine’s president stands his ground. Because he proves the truth of the adage that one man with courage makes a majority. Because he shows that honor and love of country are virtues we forsake at our peril. Because he grasps the power of personal example and physical presence. Because he knows how words can inspire deeds — give shape and purpose to them — so that the deeds may, in turn, vindicate the meaning of words. We admire Zelensky because he reminds us of how rare these traits have become among our own politicians. Zelensky was an actor who used his celebrity to become a statesman. Western politics is overrun by people who playact as statesmen so that they may ultimately become celebrities. Zelensky has made a point of telling Ukrainians the hard truth that the war is likely to get worse — and of telling off supposed well-wishers that their words are hollow and their support wanting. Our leaders mainly specialize in telling people what they want to hear. We admire Zelensky because of who and what he faces. Vladimir Putin represents neither a nation nor a cause, only a totalitarian ethos. The Russian dictator stands for the idea that truth exists to serve power, not the other way around, and that politics is in the business of manufacturing propaganda for those who will swallow it and imposing terror on those who will not. Ultimately, the aim of this idea isn’t the mere acquisition of power or territory. It’s the eradication of conscience. We admire Zelensky because he has restored the idea of the free world to its proper place. The free world isn’t a cultural expression, as in “the West”; or a security concept, as in NATO; or an economic description, as in “the developed world.” Membership in the free world belongs to any country that subscribes to the notion that the power of the state exists first and foremost to protect the rights of the individual. And the responsibility of the free world is to aid and champion any of its members menaced by invasion and tyranny. As it goes for Ukraine, so, eventually, it will go for the rest of us. We admire Zelensky because he embodies two great Jewish archetypes: David in the face of Goliath and Moses in the face of Pharoah. He is the canny underdog who, with skill and wits, makes up for what he lacks in fearsomeness and brawn. And he is the prophet who revolts against the diminishment and entrapment of his people — and determines to lead them through trials toward a political culture based on self-determination, freedom and ethics. We admire Zelensky because he fights. Fighting is not supposed to be a virtue in civilized societies that value dialogue, diplomacy and compromise. But the world isn’t always civilized: There are things for which civilized persons and nations must be prepared to fight if they aren’t to perish. Zelensky and the Ukrainian people have reminded the rest of the free world that a liberal and democratic inheritance that is taken for granted by its citizens runs the risk of being taken at will by its enemies. We admire Zelensky because he rouses the better angels of our nature. His leadership has made Joe Biden a better president, Germany a better country, NATO a better alliance. He has shaken much of the United States out of the isolationist stupor into which it was gradually falling. He has forced Europe’s political and mercantile classes to stop looking away from Russia’s descent into fascism. He reminds free societies that there can still be a vital center in politics, at least when it comes to things that matter. We admire Zelensky because he maintains a sense of human proportion befitting a democratically elected leader. Note the contrast between his public encounters with journalists, cabinet members, foreign leaders and ordinary citizens, and the Stalinist antics of the Putin court. In the ostentatious trappings of Russian power we see the smallness of the man wielding it: the paranoia and insecurity of a despot who knows he may someday have to sell his kingdom for a horse. We admire Zelensky because he models what a man should be: impressive without being imposing; confident without being cocksure; intelligent without pretending to be infallible; sincere rather than cynical; courageous not because he is fearless but because he advances with a clear conscience. American boys in particular, raised on preposterous notions of what manhood entails, should be steered toward his example. We admire Zelensky because he holds out the hope that our own troubled democracies may yet elect leaders who can inspire, ennoble, even save us. Perhaps we can do so when the hour isn’t quite as late as it is now for the people of Ukraine and their indomitable leader. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-04-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/opinion/china-russia-putin.html,Opinion | China and Russia Are Giving Authoritarianism a Bad Name,"The last decade looked like a good one for authoritarian regimes and a challenging one for democratic ones. Cybertools, drones, facial recognition technology and social networks seemed to make efficient authoritarians even more efficient and democracies increasingly ungovernable. The West lost self-confidence — and both Russian and Chinese leaders rubbed it in, putting out the word that these chaotic democratic systems were a spent force. And then a totally unexpected thing happened: Russia and China each overreached. Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and, to his surprise, invited an indirect war with NATO and the West. China insisted that it was smart enough to have its own local solution to a pandemic, leaving millions of Chinese underprotected or unprotected and, in effect, inviting a war with one of Mother Nature’s most contagious viruses — the Omicron mutation of SARS-CoV-2. It’s now led China to lock down all of Shanghai and parts of 44 other cities — some 370 million people. In short, both Moscow and Beijing find themselves suddenly contending with much more powerful and relentless forces and systems than they ever anticipated. And the battles are exposing — to the whole world and to their own people — the weaknesses of their own systems. So much so that the world now has to worry about instability in both countries. Be afraid. Russia is a key supplier of wheat, fertilizer, oil and natural gas for the world. And China is the origin of, or a crucial link in, thousands of global manufacturing supply chains. If Russia is locked out and China is locked down for a prolonged period, every corner of the planet will be affected. And that is no longer a remote possibility. Let’s start with Putin. He lulled himself into thinking that because his army had smashed a bunch of ragtag military opponents in Syria, Georgia, Crimea and Chechnya, it could quickly devour a country of 44 million people — Ukraine — that over the last decade had been moving to join the West and was tacitly being armed and trained by NATO. It’s been a military and economic debacle for Russia so far. But just as important, it has exposed precisely how much Putin’s “system” is built on both lying upward — everyone telling superiors what they want to hear, all the way up to Putin — and drilling downward, tapping Russia’s natural resources, enriching a few Russians, rather than unleashing the country’s human resources and empowering the many. Putin’s Russia is basically built on oil, lies and corruption, and that is not a resilient system. You could see it right from the eve of the war when Putin conducted a nationally televised meeting of his top national security advisers, and none other than Sergei Naryshkin, chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, appeared confused over which lie Putin wanted to be told. Putin said the eastern Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk should be allowed to become independent states, and then he polled these advisers for confirmation. But Naryshkin seemed to think Putin wanted to be told that the two provinces should be annexed to Russia. As Naryshkin stammered over the wrong answer, Putin, without a hint of irony, twice snapped at him to “speak directly” — as if that were possible anymore in Putin’s Russia. Only after Naryshkin gave Putin the lie he obviously wanted to be told did Putin snarl, “You can sit down now.” How many Russian military officers watching that humiliation were ready to tell Putin the truth about Ukraine once the war started going badly? When the Russian military was up against foes in Georgia, Syria, Crimea and Chechnya, Russia could just indiscriminately bomb its way out of any problem. But now that Putin’s military has found itself in a war with Ukraine’s highly motivated army and its homegrown weapons industry, backed with some of NATO’s best precision weapons and training, the rot has really started to show. Russia’s tank and logistic forces were mauled into multiple junkyards of burning hulks in western Ukraine. And it is impossible to exaggerate how incompetent the Russian Navy had to be to allow the command warship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva missile cruiser, to be so badly damaged, reportedly by two Ukrainian-made anti-ship cruise missiles, called Neptunes, that the Moskva sank into the sea off Ukraine last week — the biggest loss of a naval ship in battle in 40 years. For the Russian flagship in charge of coordinating all of the air defenses for the flotilla, and itself carrying 64 S-300F Rif air defense missiles, to be taken out by enemy anti-ship missiles had to have been the result of a cascade of systems failures in detection and response to an attack. Moreover, Neptune missiles are not necessarily “ship killers.” They were more likely designed to be “mission killers” — to disable the radar and electronics of sophisticated destroyers like the Moskva — not specifically sink them. So I pity the commander who had to tell Putin that Russia’s meanest, monstrous warship in the Black Sea, rumored to have been his favorite, had been sunk by a Ukrainian missile fired in war for the first time. China is a much more serious country than Russia: It is not built on oil, lies and corruption (though it has plenty of the latter), but on the hard work and manufacturing talents of its people, directed by a top-down, iron-fisted but eager-to-learn-from-abroad Chinese Communist Party. At least, eager in the past to learn, but less so lately. China’s economic success, and the sense of pride it has generated, seems to have lulled its leadership into thinking it could basically go it alone against a pandemic. By producing its own vaccines, rather than importing better ones from the West, and by repurposing its highly efficient system of authoritarian surveillance and control to curb travel, do mass testing and quarantine any individuals or neighborhoods where Covid-19 appeared, China bet on a “zero Covid” policy. If it could get through the pandemic with fewer deaths and a more open economy, it would be another signal to the world — a big signal — that Chinese communism was superior to American democracy. But Beijing, while scoffing at the West, became shockingly negligent about vaccinating its own elderly. That did not matter as much when China was able to stem the spread of earlier variants of the coronavirus with tight population controls. But now it matters, because China’s Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines appear not nearly as effective against Omicron as the mRNA vaccines made in the West, although they still are effective at reducing hospitalization and death. In China today, more than 130 million people “aged 60 and above are either unvaccinated or have received fewer than three doses,” putting them “in greater danger of developing severe Covid symptoms or dying if they contract the virus,” The Financial Times recently reported, citing a University of Hong Kong study. This has led Beijing to opt for that total lockdown of Shanghai, which has been so poorly managed that residents have reportedly had to scramble for food. Dr. David L. Katz, a U.S. public health and preventive medicine expert who wrote one of the most prescient early guest essays in this newspaper about managing Covid at the onset, explained to me that the problem with having the kind of draconian lockdown policy that China maintained is that you are guaranteeing that your population develops little native immunity from having acquired and survived the virus. So, Katz said, if the virus mutates globally, as it did with Omicron, and you have “a less than effective vaccine, virtually no natural immunity in the population, and millions of elderly unvaccinated, you’re in a bad place and there is no easy way out.” You can’t fool around with or propagandize away Mother Nature; she’s merciless. The moral of this story? High-coercion authoritarian systems are low-information systems — so they often drive blind more than they realize. And even when the truth filters up, or reality in the form of a more powerful foe or Mother Nature slams them in the face so hard it can’t be ignored, their leaders find it hard to change course because their claims to the right to be presidents-for-life rest on their claims to infallibility. And that is why Russia and China are both now struggling. I am worried sick about our own democratic system. But as long as we can still vote out incompetent leaders and maintain information ecosystems that will expose systemic lying and defy censorship, we can adapt in an age of rapid change — and that is the single most important competitive advantage a country can have today.

2022-04-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/world/europe/biden-ukraine-aid.html,Biden Announces $800 Million in Military Aid and Questions Russia’s Hold of Mariupol,"President Biden announced another $800 million in military aid to Ukraine on Thursday, saying it sent an “unmistakable message” to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin: “He will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine.” The latest package brings the U.S. support to the Ukrainians to over $2 billion since the war’s start eight weeks ago. But as Ukraine’s demand increases for more sophisticated arms — everything from helicopters to more advanced antiaircraft systems — American officials are growing cagier about exactly what is being shipped. Mr. Biden made clear that the details of some of the weaponry were being kept secret, presumably because of escalating Russian threats to intercept and destroy it. Modifying Theodore Roosevelt’s famous line, he said the United States would “speak softly and carry a large Javelin,” a reference to the antitank weapon that has been remarkably effective against Russian armor. Mr. Biden made the announcement, appropriately, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, and did his best to put his spin on Russia’s recent advances in the south and east, including its siege of Mariupol, the Ukrainian port that for nearly two months has suffered an unrelenting assault from Russian forces. While reports from the ground suggest that the city is under Russian control except for a steel plant where some Ukrainian forces are still holding out, Mr. Biden said “there is no evidence yet” the city has completely fallen. In fact, there is little hope that Ukrainian forces can hold on to any part of Mariupol, and defenders of the steel plant have acknowledged that they are essentially out of supplies to withstand a blockade. President Volodymyr Zelensky this week sought an exchange to ensure the safe passage for the civilians and troops trapped there. Mr. Biden also announced an accelerated program to allow 100,000 Ukrainian refugees into the United States and $500 million in direct economic aid to the Ukrainian government, making official a pledge made several weeks ago. While the White House has announced a series of packages to Ukraine, it is now running out of funds for more — unless Congress acts. In his capacity as president, Mr. Biden can authorize the transfer of military equipment from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency, and Congress earlier this year approved $3 billion in new funding to explicitly encourage Mr. Biden to do so as part of a $13.6 billion proposal approved in March. The package also included funds to shore up sanction enforcement and humanitarian aid, in addition to the defense funds. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said earlier this month that he planned to pursue a bipartisan international aid package, which would include both money for the global vaccination effort and additional funds for Ukraine. The administration will have to outline a request in order to jump-start talks on Capitol Hill, and a spokesman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi said they expected to receive the request next week, when Congress returns from a two-week recess. “The speaker hopes to bring the request to the floor as soon as possible with strong bipartisan support,” the spokesman, Drew Hammill, said. Republican aides, who had pushed to increase the military funds in the initial package, said a stand-alone aid package for Ukraine would not meet resistance in their conference. But it is unclear how a broader package like the one outlined by Mr. Schumer would pass the Senate, given that Republicans have resisted the additional pandemic aid Democrats have sought.

2022-04-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/opinion/letters/joe-biden-criticism.html,Opinion | Bashing Joe Biden? ‘Give the Guy a Break!’,"To the Editor: Re “It Could Be a Biden Blood Bath in the Midterms,” by Charles M. Blow (column, April 18): Most of those giving President Biden low marks in polls are the same ones who voted for Donald Trump twice and believe he won in 2020. President Biden got us out of Afghanistan, has turned the corner on Covid, signed the American Rescue Plan and infrastructure bill, appointed the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, united the West against Vladimir Putin, and has had to deal with intractable forces like Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema, the “Squad,” Republicans and right-wing media along the way. Mr. Biden, who is facing more challenges than anyone since Franklin D. Roosevelt, is doing a good job! Give the guy a break and let him run the country! John E. ColbertArroyo Seco, N.M. To the Editor: Charles Blow suggests that President Biden’s low approval rating is due to his being a poor messenger. It’s really discouraging that many Americans want a showman, a reality TV star or a celebrity to lead them. Mr. Biden is generally known as a decent man and has actually done a lot to rescue this country from the decadence of the last four years with Donald Trump. Americans need a president like Mr. Biden to tell the truth and focus on what we need, like voting rights reform, gun control and lowering of drug prices. Why then do Americans appear to be drawn to celebrities, like the two who are running for office in Pennsylvania and Ohio, Dr. Oz and J.D. Vance, author of “Hillbilly Elegy”? The Democratic Party needs to reverse this trend and get the real message out to the public about how much better our country has become under Mr. Biden’s administration. Anne M. JohnstonNew Providence, N.J. To the Editor: The Democrats need a “writers’ room” to hone their message, to make it more memorable and targeted, and, most important, to get the message out in a timely fashion — refined every day. Look at what Volodymyr Zelensky has done on a daily basis. The entire world admires his leadership, and the Ukrainian people could not be more united behind him. Much of that is because his message is renewed daily and is carefully crafted, both by Mr. Zelensky himself and a cadre of writers, including ones from his past life as an entertainer. True, Mr. Zelensky’s opponent presents an existential threat to his country and his people, but the threat the Republicans present to our democracy is scarcely less significant. The Republicans have blatantly advertised the platform of regression they plan to implement if returned to power. The Democrats must begin getting a unified and memorable message out daily to stave that off. Tom WelschBozeman, Mont. To the Editor: While Charles Blow makes an attempt to be objective, he brings me back to a question: “When will all the ‘Biden bashing’ stop?” President Biden inherited an unusually large plate of problems and crises. And yet media commentators continue to hold Mr. Biden personally accountable for not fixing all the problems immediately and perfectly. President Biden is a patriot and a good man. Needlessly undermining him opens the door wider for Donald Trump to return. Is that what we want? T.R. BeallWarren, R.I. To the Editor: Re “Ban by Wimbledon Cracks United Front in Tennis” (Sports, April 21), about the decision to bar players from Russia and Belarus: Are athletes, not performing under the flag of their country, to be barred from competition by reason of their place of residence? What sin have they committed? Are we to treat these men and women as a mere extension of their nation’s failings? Arguing that the No. 2 male tennis player in the world or the No. 4 female player is not permitted to perform because it might be considered a point of pride for their homeland should they prove victorious? Wimbledon may be a most prestigious event, but don’t pretend it is more than that. Let the players play. And don’t make it a condition that they swear an oath against Vladimir Putin. Don’t treat a tennis match as a battle of good vs. evil, of right against wrong. Don’t make these athletes symbols. They don’t deserve our denunciation. They should be permitted the right to win or lose on the court. Not off it. Robert S. NussbaumFort Lee, N.J. To the Editor: In the wake of Wimbledon’s decision to bar players from Russia and Belarus from this year’s tournament, the International Olympic Committee should follow suit and bar athletes from those countries from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Doing so would send a clear message that Russia’s and Belarus’s military actions disqualify those two countries from sharing the world stage in sports, and would also give fair notice to those athletes who are otherwise planning to train for the Olympics. Wendy LivingstonMountain Lakes, N.J. To the Editor: Re “Quandary Over Tips: How Much Is Enough?” (Food, April 20): Tipping is a fundamentally regressive, dishonest and exploitative practice. Tipping an individual for personalized service is gracious.

2022-04-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/opinion/russian-artists-culture-boycotts.html,Opinion | The Profound Irony of Canceling Everything Russian,"Within days of the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, the canceling and boycotting of Russian cultural events in Europe and North America began. Cultural organizations broke ties with Russian performers and artists. Two of the world’s most revered Russian musical artists — the conductor Valery Gergiev and the soprano Anna Netrebko — had their performances in multiple countries canceled. The repercussions have reached artists and works with no direct connection to President Vladimir Putin or his agenda, like the 20-year-old Russian pianist Alexander Malofeev, who had openly denounced the invasion, whose debut concert tour in Canada was called off. The Polish National Opera even canceled performances of Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov.” The list goes on. In the heat of this moment — as the depraved brutality of the unprovoked Russian invasion becomes more and more apparent — these high-profile retaliations against anyone and anything Russian may be understandable, but they are far from reasonable. Russian art, music, painting and film do not “belong” to the Russian state. In fact, there is no one “Russian culture” — there are many. It is profoundly ironic that those who react to the war in Ukraine by aggressively or indiscriminately canceling or restricting artists and artistic works simply for being Russian are reflecting the same kind of nationalist thinking driving the Russian invasion in the first place. Mr. Putin legitimates his war as an attempt to “save” Russians in Ukraine and reunite them with the Russian Federation. For him, there can be only one Russian culture and it can have only one homeland. Yet most Russians in Ukraine have no desire for Mr. Putin’s “salvation” — and a great many have taken up arms to resist it. They have a different homeland. Now that is a demonstration of a distinct Russian culture. In Mr. Putin’s view, the only place Russian identity and culture — like Russian people — are safe is under the Russian state — any territory in which Russians reside must therefore belong to the Russian Federation, and any Russian who rejects the “protection” of the Russian state is a national traitor. Ms. Netrebko herself is now being denounced as a traitor in the Russian Federation after making attempts to distance herself from Mr. Putin. Yet a spirit of resistance pulses through the work of many artists throughout the global diaspora who are creating art, music, film, literature and dance and who have been fleeing the Russian Federation at an increasing pace since the invasion and occupation of Crimea in 2014. They include the poet and publisher Dmitry Kuzmin, who begins one of his poems: Recent data from a sociological survey:88 percent of the population of my country — are fascists. Mr. Kuzmin resettled in Latvia in 2015 in order to write Russian poetry at a safe distance from Mr. Putin and his state. His Russian culture is certainly not Mr. Putin’s. It is both more peaceful and humane. The idea of discrete national cultures, conducted in distinct languages and associated with states and their “proper territories” — French culture in France, German culture in Germany — is associated with the rising tide of ethnic nationalist ideology of the 19th century. Even then, this idea didn’t correspond to reality. The forces of migration — as well as the more destructive means of war, conquest and colonialism — have insured the mingling of people, languages and cultures throughout history. Borders between territories associated with one or another language or ethnic group have shifted over and over again, and so have the cultures they created. This is also true in terms of simple geography. The Russian diaspora includes large communities of people of Russian heritage in several countries across the globe — millions of them in Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan; in the Baltic States, especially in Estonia and Latvia; in Israel, the United States, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Australia; and, of course, in Ukraine. Movements like the voluntary migration of over one million Russian-speaking Jews from the former Soviet Union to Israel in the 1990s, for instance, and refugee crises like the current displacement of more than five million people from Ukraine, continue to blur these borders. Russian speakers in Israel create their own Russian culture. As do Russian speakers in the Baltic States, and in Ukraine. Russia’s literary history is replete with examples of authors who have written powerful works of protest, at a far remove from “Russian national culture.” Osip Mandelstam, a Russian poet of Jewish origins who defined his own brand of poetry, Acmeism, as a “yearning for world culture,” died in the Soviet penal camp system in 1938 as a result of an epigram caricaturing Stalin and his cruelty. He is only one of many. Today, the poet Shamshad Abdullaev, an ethnic Uzbek from the city of Fergana in Uzbekistan, writes experimental poetry in Russian, rising out of Central Asian landscapes, but inspired by European avant-garde traditions, like this passage from his poem, “End of the Week: A Walk With a Friend”: So we came out on the pockmarked square — so broadthe path traversed is clear, but the rough curveof the clay-walled street with its sour-green moss coverand the dirty windblast that overtakes usfrom the blind alley, as always, from behind,have silenced the epic scrim, like Paris,seen by Rousseau for the first timein its greasy, squawking grayness. Abdullaev has won poetry prizes and fellowships in Russia, Germany, Italy, the United States and elsewhere. His work addresses audiences across the world. Both intensely local and emphatically global, his writing in Russian bears no relation to the Russian state or the territories it seeks to claim. Or consider this passage from a poem written last month by Boris Khersonsky, a Jewish poet from Odesa who writes mainly in Russian. This poem, whose title I’ve translated as “As in a Game of Battleship, Their Victory Is on Paper,” was posted on Facebook: You’ve shed our blood. Smeared yourself with blood.You’d do better to keep count of your own brood.Freely tossing men, like logs, in the conflagration.You won’t wash the blood stains from your mad generation. Khersonsky, of course, might best be described as a Ukrainian poet. Yet his poetry forms part of a distinctive Russian culture. That is the crux of the matter. That the world should be amplifying Ukrainian art and culture is clear. This is of the highest priority. Yet support for Ukrainian culture does not entail canceling Russian culture. To adopt such a stance is to support a world of pernicious national antagonisms and closed borders. That is precisely the world that Mr. Putin seeks to create with his war. We, along with right-minded Russians, should be working to resist the reactive canceling of Russian artists and performances, rather than playing along. Kevin M. F.

Ms. Le Pen, a longtime sympathizer of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, said in her concession speech, “The ideas we stand for are reaching new heights,” Le Monde reported. As chilling as that sounds, she’s correct, and the world should pay closer attention. But for now, those in the West who embrace free thinking, democracy and even just a scintilla of globalism can breathe a very brief sigh of relief. Cody LyonBrooklyn To the Editor: My dear French friends, you may have won a battle by re-electing Emmanuel Macron, but you are losing the war.

Peter MailleLa Grande, Ore. To the Editor: Has anyone noticed that Marine Le Pen, the loser, has actually accepted the results of the election and conceded? What a novel idea! And Vive la France! Irene Bernstein-PechmèzeQueens To the Editor: I recall an earlier election when another Le Pen made it to the second round. In 2002, Marine’s father, Jean-Marie, was crushed 82 percent to 18 percent by the conservative Jacques Chirac. Leftist voters did their republican duty, voting against those who would put an end to democracy itself. The French do not like Emmanuel Macron. But they remember fascism. Perhaps if Americans had such memories, they would better defend the democracy that they are losing, bit by bit, every day. Bob NelsonYuma, Ariz.

Ellen SchafferPalm Coast, Fla. To the Editor: “When Parents Are Lost to Covid, Grandparents Step In,” by Paula Span (news article, April 14), not only recognizes the role that grandparents are playing in the wake of Covid, it also acknowledges that “extended family has always been the first line of defense in the wake of such tragedies.” For my book on the history of American grandmothers, many of the 75 women I interviewed told about a 1950s grandmother who stepped up — took the grandchildren into her home or went to live in the grandchild’s home — when things fell apart because of parents’ death, divorce or illness. None of the grandmothers had anticipated this refilling of their empty nests, all of them struggled with the responsibility, and all of their granddaughters-turned-grandmothers now look back with awe at what their grandmothers did for them. One notable change from then to now: Grandfathers in the 1950s were not active in their care the way older men are today, another example of how feminism has improved family life. Engagement with grandchildren is not just a delightful extra in family life, it is also a serious form of insurance. Should a tragedy mean that grandchildren must live with grandparents, that painful transition is eased if the elders and the kids have experience with one another aside from holidays and have built trust over time. No grandparent wants the custodial job, but every grandparent should consider time with grandchildren as an investment in their security.

At one point, over Zoom, my sister told me that it was as if I had flown to the moon and never returned. The plane home in January was completely full of anxious expats and earnest American grandparents eager to see newly minted Aussie grandbabies. All the arrival hugs were tighter and longer than they had ever been. The smiles were wider and the welcomes longer — even from the custom officials! And maybe the accents were even broader! And … yes … if I could have bottled the dawn laughter from the troop of cheeky kookaburras camped outside my Brisbane window just days before I returned to the U.S., I would have. Patricia RyanWest Lafayette, Ind. To the Editor: The state-sponsored disinformation spread to the Russian people is an old game. In the 1930s my father traveled to Russia. As was required, he had an Intourist guide with him at all times. As they became more friendly, she started to ask him about life in the U.S. “You live in New York,” she said. “Tell me about the skyscrapers that fall down.” He could not convince her that such things were not happening. She told him that all Russians knew about the frequently falling skyscrapers and was disappointed that he couldn’t be more candid with her about it. The acceptance of such nonsense appears to be embedded by a long history, though the current pernicious version is surprising in an era of greater access to outside information.

Smith, the chief executive of FedEx and a former Marine himself, Mr. Richardson’s group could not have arrived at a more tense moment. Even as they quietly met with members of the Russian government, President Vladimir V. Putin announced the beginning of his invasion of Ukraine and bombs began falling. Publicly, relations between the United States and Russia were crumbling. But the secret visit by Mr. Richardson, a former ambassador to the United Nations who has spent years working to secure hostage releases through his nonprofit organization, was part of months of quiet but intense diplomacy that ended with the simultaneous release on Wednesday of Mr. Reed and Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot sentenced to a lengthy prison term in the United States on cocaine trafficking charges. President Biden announced Mr. Reed’s freedom in a statement, calling it “good news” even as he alluded to the release of Mr. Yaroshenko, saying the negotiation “required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly.” “Trevor, a former U.S. Marine, is free from Russian detention,” Mr. Biden said. “I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence. And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom.” American officials said the unexpected burst of diplomacy in the middle of the most heated fighting in Europe in decades came about after Mr. Biden; Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken; Roger D. Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs; and other top diplomats raised Mr. Reed’s case repeatedly. In a briefing for reporters, the officials said that negotiations about Mr. Reed’s fate were kept completely separate from the administration’s efforts to punish Mr. Putin. The officials also said that the administration remained focused on two other Americans detained in Russia: Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges, and Brittney Griner, an American basketball player taken into custody on drug charges in February. Mr. Richardson and his team had briefed members of the White House’s National Security Council about their trip after they returned to the United States, according to a person familiar with the discussions. They told the American officials that a swap for Mr. Reed appeared doable. Mr. Richardson said on CNN on Wednesday that he believed Mr. Biden was moved by the humanitarian need to secure Mr. Reed’s release. Family members said he was suffering from active tuberculosis while in detention in Russia. But Mr. Biden’s decision to approve the prisoner swap also came after weeks of intense public pressure from Mr. Reed’s parents, who initially criticized the president for refusing to meet with them about their son’s case. Mr. Biden called them on the phone in early March after the couple stood on the side of the road in Texas and waved as the presidential motorcade drove by on the way to an event about veterans. Three weeks later, in late March, Mr. Biden invited the couple into the White House for a brief conversation after they protested outside the building. That public pressure gained momentum as the war in Ukraine intensified, raising concerns that the deteriorating relationship between the United States and Russia would make a breakthrough less likely. In fact, American officials and Mr. Richardson said the fighting in Ukraine did not appear to hamper Russia’s willingness to discuss the swap. Mr. Reed was initially detained by Russian authorities in August 2019. His family had increasingly expressed concern about his health while he was in detention, and footage aired on Wednesday by Russian state-run television showed what appeared to be a gaunt Mr. Reed being escorted to a Russian plane at Moscow’s Vnukovo airport. Mr. Reed’s father, Joey Reed, told CNN that his son had been flown to Turkey, where the exchange took place. A native of Texas, Mr. Reed traveled to Russia in May 2019 to visit his Russian girlfriend, whom he had met on a dating website, and to take language lessons. One week before his planned return to the United States, he went to a party at a park outside Moscow, where he drank extensive amounts of vodka. Mr. Reed then got agitated, prompting his girlfriend and friends to call the police. Officers who arrived at the scene decided to take him to a police station, where he was interviewed by Russian security agents. Shortly after, he was accused of assaulting and endangering the lives of the two police officers who had driven him there. After spending more than 11 months in a Russian jail, Mr. Reed was sentenced to nine years in prison, the first time that such a severe punishment had been applied for that type of crime, his lawyers said. During one hearing, Mr. Reed said the case against him was political and linked his troubles in Russia to his military affiliation. While in a penal colony in the Russian republic of Mordovia, Mr. Reed was subjected to degrading treatment, including time in a solitary cell, his family has said. His health rapidly deteriorated, his family said, and he was not allowed to call home or to receive books or letters, prompting him to begin a hunger strike in November. Mr. Reed’s family said in a statement on Wednesday that they would now concentrate on “the myriad of health issues brought on by the squalid conditions he was subjected to in his Russian gulag.” The agreement involving Mr. Reed was the result of “lengthy negotiations,” according to Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry. Mr. Yaroshenko, 53, is a Russian pilot who worked occasional jobs in Africa. In 2010, he was detained and charged in connection with a foiled plot to fly cocaine to Liberia and Ghana from South America. American authorities said he had participated in the plot with the knowledge that some of the drugs would wind up in the United States. Mr. Yaroshenko, who had never before set foot in the United States, was deported to the country to stand trial in 2011 and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Lawyers and families have accused Russia of arresting Mr. Reed and Mr. Whelan, the other former U.S. Marine, specifically for the purpose of exchanging them for Russians held in American prisons. Russia has been seeking the release of a number of its citizens in the United States, including Viktor Bout, who was convicted by an American court of arms dealing and sentenced in 2012 to 25 years in prison, and Roman Seleznev, a Russian hacker who was arrested in the Maldives and later convicted in the United States for running a vast credit card and identity theft operation. While Mr. Bout was a notorious criminal and Moscow has been protective of hackers as long as they do not target the Kremlin’s own interests, Mr. Yaroshenko was a low-profile figure before his arrest. His case, however, has been cited by Russian politicians and pro-Kremlin news media outlets as a prime example of the brazen use of extraterritorial powers by the United States. Mr. Yaroshenko’s family has said he was ill-treated when he was imprisoned in Connecticut. The prisoner swap renewed optimism for the release of Ms. Griner, 31, the W.N.B.A. player who has been held in Russia on drug charges that could carry a sentence of up to 10 years if she is convicted. Ms. Griner’s family and those working for her release have remained mostly silent about her case, following advice from those who have dealt with other cases of high-profile American athletes who have been detained overseas.

2022-04-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/us/politics/ukraine-lend-lease-arms.html,Congress Clears Bill to Allow Lending Arms to Ukraine,"WASHINGTON — The House on Thursday overwhelmingly passed legislation that would allow President Biden to use a World War II-era law to quickly supply weapons to Ukraine on loan, sending the measure to Mr. Biden’s desk hours after he urged Congress to approve tens of billions of dollars’ worth of additional emergency aid for Kyiv. The 417-to-10 vote to invoke an extraordinary, eight-decade-old law created to battle Hitler reflected a growing bipartisan sense of urgency in Congress to bolster the Ukrainian military as it digs in for an ugly and protracted artillery war in the south and east of the country. The Senate passed the legislation unanimously this month. “Passage of that act enabled Great Britain and Winston Churchill to keep fighting and to survive the fascist Nazi bombardment until the United States could enter the war,” said Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland. “President Zelensky has said that Ukraine needs weapons to sustain themselves, and President Biden has answered that call.” The legislation invokes the Lend-Lease Act of 1941, originally proposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to help arm British forces battling Germany. The legislation allowed the president to lease or lend military equipment to any foreign government “whose defense the president deems vital to the defense of the United States.” Roosevelt initially faced skepticism from isolationist members of Congress who worried the bill would plunge the United States more directly into the conflict, and he worked feverishly to win public support for the measure. “And so our country is going to be what our people have proclaimed it must be — the arsenal of democracy,” Roosevelt said after signing the bill into law. By the end of the war, the United States had extended nearly $50 billion in Lend-Lease aid to Allied nations, according to the Library of Congress. Members of Mr. Biden’s administration have offered little in the way of hints as to how aggressively they might seek to use the law. John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, demurred on Wednesday when asked about the administration’s view of the measure, saying he would not “get ahead of pending legislation.” Still, it could become an important tool for the White House as the United States looks to marshal long-term military support for Ukraine, even as the streams of Western weapons flowing into the country — including heavy-duty equipment such as howitzers and armed drones — increase. It would allow the United States to deliver arms to Ukraine more speedily by doing away with a variety of procedural hurdles. And it would essentially allow the Biden administration to gift vast tranches of arms to Kyiv, at a time when Mr. Biden has said he has nearly exhausted the emergency military funding Congress approved in March. “How we address a threat against one democracy’s sovereignty sends a message about how we’ll act on others, and adversaries like China are watching,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and one of the bill’s original sponsors. “If we believe America supports freedom and democracy, we must provide Ukraine with the weapons necessary to protect its citizens.” Mr. Biden on Thursday asked Congress for $33 billion in additional defense, economic and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine. The funding, more than twice the size of the $13.6 billion package Congress passed last month, is projected to last for at least five months, according to an administration official who detailed the package on the condition of anonymity before its official release. Roughly half of that figure is expected to fund new military assistance. Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.",1
2022-05-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/opinion/russia-brain-drain.html,Opinion | Putin’s Failure to Hold On to the Educated Could Be the World’s Gain,"Since Russia’s war on Ukraine began, press reports have focused on the exodus from Russia of antiwar scientists, engineers and information technology experts. But the vast majority of the Russian people are staying put and rallying behind President Vladimir Putin. According to Levada, Russia’s most respected independent pollster, the share of all Russians who said they would like to relocate outside Russia fell in late March to 10 percent, from an average of 19 percent in three earlier polls since 2019. Even among people with higher education, the percentage who would like to relocate was the same, 10 percent, according to a spreadsheet that Levada sent me. (Some people may have been afraid to tell the pollsters of their dissatisfaction, given Putin’s crackdown on dissent, but I’m betting the numbers are directionally right.) Why does this matter? Because Putin may be betting that as long as a strong majority of Russians support him, he can afford to lose the malcontents. He may even be glad that some are going. The autocrat is not erecting barriers to keep the intelligentsia from leaving, although he has offered tax breaks, subsidized mortgages and postponement of conscription into the armed forces to keep tech workers at home. He may live to regret his nonchalance. “There is no doubt that there is long-lasting damage. The whole wave of recent emigration is the most productive slice of the Russian society,” said Konstantin Sonin, an economist with the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy who moved from Russia. “Putin has a very specific worldview” that opposes globalization, Sonin told me. Putin believes “that an autarkic, centralized economy is sort of a strong economy. When Russia is cut from the international trade, when people are leaving, it seems to him that this is going in the right direction, the acceptable direction.” If Russia achieves political stability by ridding itself of smart people who oppose Putin’s rule, Sonin said, “the stability will be achieved at a very low level of production and consumption.” Russia has suffered from brain drain for at least a century, in part because it produces top-notch university graduates but usually hasn’t had an economy capable of putting their skills to good use. The United States and other countries have long benefited from immigrants from what was the Russian Empire, including some from what are now independent nations. In the United States that includes such giants as Igor Sikorsky, a pioneer in helicopters; Simon Kuznets, a Nobel laureate in economics; composers and authors such as Irving Berlin, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Vladimir Nabokov; and businesspeople such as the Wonskolaser brothers, better known by their Americanized name, the Warner brothers. Around 2010 the brain drain started to ease because the Russian economy was performing well. Some Russians even went home. But the invasion of Ukraine has once again yanked the plug out of the drain hole. Most of the exiles today are going to nearby countries, including Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and the Baltic nations. The United States has been tougher to get into because visas are scarce. In March the Department of Homeland Security granted Ukrainians temporary protected status for 18 months, enabling them to stay and work in the United States without a visa — but it has not done so for Russians. In a shift, however, the Biden administration asked Congress last week to suspend for four years the requirement that Russian scientists applying for H1-B visas have a sponsoring employer. The measure would apply only to Russian citizens with master’s or doctoral degrees in science or engineering fields such as artificial intelligence, nuclear engineering and quantum physics. They would have to undergo security vetting. That’s a smart move. Western nations are making a mistake if they don’t hold the door open to Russian scientists because of opposition to Putin, said Alexandra Vacroux, who is executive director of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard. “If they’re leaving, they’re the best and the brightest and the bravest,” she said. “It’s important not to brand all the Russians as the baddies in the world.” Mara Kuvaldina, a Russian with a doctorate in experimental cognitive psychology who works at Columbia University Medical Center, has protested against Putin and said she fears going home to St. Petersburg to visit her mother. She participates in a network of scholars in the cognitive sciences who help fellow academics fleeing Russia, Ukraine and Belarus find jobs in the West. One goal is to help the scholars “integrate into a new social environment abroad and give them opportunity to get back to normal life,” Kuvaldina wrote in an email. John Holdren, who was Barack Obama’s science adviser for all eight years of his presidency, told me he worked with the State Department to “reduce obstacles on our side to people with very valuable skills from many countries.” He said some of those efforts were rolled back by the Trump administration. “It’s an important part of U.S. science policy to be welcoming,” Holdren said. For Putin to drive away some of his nation’s greatest minds is lunatic. But as someone once said, never interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake. –2.1 percent This decrease is the median estimate of the change in industrial production in Brazil in the 12 months through March, according to a survey of forecasters by FactSet. The median forecast for economic growth for all of 2022 is 0.7 percent.

2022-05-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/opinion/european-union-macron-ukraine.html,Opinion | Europe Is in Danger. It Always Is.,"BRUSSELS — In July 2020, along with European officials and experts, I was asked to take part in a policy game. Convened by a German think tank, we were asked to play out what would happen if either Matteo Salvini or Marine Le Pen, the far-right leaders in Italy and France, came to power. We spent a few hours frenziedly debating how the European Union would respond to each occurrence. Of one thing we were sure: It would be a disaster. Neither scenario, of course, materialized. In Italy, Mario Draghi is prime minister and Mr. Salvini is sliding in the polls. In France, President Emmanuel Macron defeated Ms. Le Pen to win re-election. On the same day, Slovenia’s right-wing prime minister, an admirer of Donald Trump, lost too. It was a good few hours for Europe. That’s about as long as it lasted. In Brussels and other European capitals, relief turned quickly to angst. The French parliamentary elections in June, in which Mr. Macron could lose his majority and be forced into awkward compromises with the far right or the radical left, are the new worry. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, after securing re-election in early April, remains a disruptive presence on the scene. And Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds on. Such anxiety is common in Europe. Many people seem to think that the European Union, which in different forms has provided Europeans with prosperity and peace since the 1950s, is always on the cusp of ruin. The past decade — encompassing a debt crisis, a refugee crisis, Brexit, the rise of the far right and, not least, the pandemic — has set off regular cries about the coming end of the union. And yet, despite everything, it endures. In a world of war and calamity, it needs to pull together even more. The European Union’s solidity is perhaps its greatest asset. But it can’t rely on institutional stability alone. Europe is a dangerous place again. As a former prime minister of Sweden, Carl Bildt, once said, the union used to be surrounded by friends, but now it is surrounded by fire. Some neighbors are actively trying to undermine the union and destroy all that Europe stands for — with the war in Ukraine the latest terrifying example. In the face of such peril, which threatens to return the continent to barbarism, the case for binding together more tightly is all the more compelling. Fortunately, Europeans have gotten to know one another better in recent times. During the debt crisis a decade ago, people across the continent watched heated debates in Greece’s Parliament. The fate of the country, bound to painful economic reforms, resonated far beyond its borders. Europeans likewise take great interest in Poland and Hungary curbing the independence of their judiciaries and press, and want the rule of law to be respected in member states. Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine, and China’s growing economic and political coercion, have brought Europeans together even more. They realize they cannot weather these storms alone: Feeling their way of life is on the line, their reflex is to stick together. They may still not be very happy with the European Union — the way it works, the kinds of compromises it relies on — but they are certainly happier in it. Such common feeling is of a piece with the union’s structure. The European Union has a federal, statelike construction that should be strong enough to defend common European interests in the face of geopolitical adversity. It has an executive (the Commission), a Parliament representing citizens, a senate representing states (the Council), an independent court of justice, a central bank and even a common border guard. This sturdy federal architecture is the bedrock of Europe’s stability. In practice, however, it’s not like the federal structures in America or Germany. In Brussels, the de facto capital of the union, member states make most of the decisions. When European heads of state and government meet, they do so as national leaders. They are elected to act in the interests not of Europe but of their own nations. Whatever the issue at hand, they sit down, put their national concerns on the table and start bargaining. In the end, each will find some of its demands in the eventual compromise. The system certainly has its advantages. It more or less guarantees national ownership of European decision-making; every member recognizes its fingerprints on the final agreement. This sense of ownership helps to explain why the union has survived so many crises in recent years: Member states have invested in it, depend on it and, crucially, want it to survive. But the downside to this approach is that by seeking consensus on almost every issue, Europe becomes as strong only as its weakest link. Leaders regularly make half-baked decisions because some countries refuse to go further, with results that do not always meet Europe’s real needs. Examples are legion. Hungary, for instance, has blocked several foreign policy statements against Russia or China that all other member states agreed on. Poland, for its part, has single-handedly diluted Europe’s climate goals. And before the presidential elections in France, the government there delayed a decision on a European oil embargo against Russia, fearing the resulting rise of energy prices could favor Ms. Le Pen in her campaign against Mr. Macron. Often, Europe is the plaything of member states seeking to promote their own narrow interests. Mr. Macron, however “pro-European,” is no exception. That’s why elections often cause such headaches. Democracy, to be sure, is Europe’s strength. It is the union’s core value, its beating heart. But democracy is also Europe’s weakness. That’s because the union is not really European: Instead, it involves 27 separate national democracies. If one of them produces a Eurosceptic government, it can endanger the entire European project, which depends on unanimity. The union is effectively held hostage every time elections are held somewhere — hardly a sustainable way to do things. The French election, Mr. Macron said, was “a referendum on Europe.” The problem with Europe is exactly that: Every election is a referendum about Europe, in every corner of the continent. It would be strange if a state election in Montana or Mississippi risked undoing the Republic or derailing its foreign policy. In Europe, this is normal practice. That’s partly why, despite its success as a global economic powerhouse and a beacon of stability, Europe often lacks confidence and looks vulnerable in the mildest headwind. Yet this paradox needn’t be permanent. In a world defined by instability, great power competition and rising prices, Europe must look after itself — and it has the means to do so. A phased embargo on Russian oil, likely to be finalized this week, is just a start. In the wake of the war in Ukraine, collective provision of defense and security is also a must, as is an energy union. What’s more, some kind of fiscal union — augmenting the current monetary union — might also be necessary, to coordinate the serious investments needed to shore up Europe’s resilience. Recognizing the need for bolstered unity, a group of European intellectuals last week even called for a United States of Europe. I’m not sure the union will ever come to that. But it would be nice if at the policy game in Berlin this year, instead of fretting over worst-case scenarios, we could perhaps let ourselves imagine a bolder, stronger European Union. If we could all allow Europe to stand a little more on its own feet, it would make a world of difference.

2022-05-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/world/europe/israel-russian-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov.html,Israel Condemns Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov’s Comments as Antisemitic,"JERUSALEM — The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, condemned on Monday a recent claim by the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, that Jews were “the biggest antisemites.” The Israeli Foreign Ministry also summoned the Russian ambassador to Israel to explain Mr. Lavrov’s remarks, while the Israeli foreign minister, Yair Lapid, demanded an apology. The backlash followed an interview Mr. Lavrov gave on Sunday to an Italian television journalist who asked him why Russia claimed to be “denazifying” Ukraine when the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was Jewish. Mr. Lavrov replied that he thought Hitler himself had Jewish roots, a claim dismissed by historians, and added, “For a long time now we’ve been hearing the wise Jewish people say that the biggest antisemites are the Jews themselves.” Mr. Bennett said that he viewed Mr. Lavrov’s remarks with the “utmost severity,” saying that the comments were “untrue and their intentions are wrong.” Mr. Bennett added, “The goal of such lies is to accuse the Jews themselves of the most awful crimes in history, which were perpetrated against them, and thereby absolve Israel’s enemies of responsibility.” Separately, Mr. Lapid said that Mr. Lavrov’s comments were “both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error.” “Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust,” he added. “The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.” The Israeli government’s response is among the fiercest criticism it has leveled at the Russian government since the invasion of Ukraine. Israel has been engaged in a tricky balancing act: supporting Ukraine while trying to avoid a showdown with Russia, which has a large military presence in Syria, Israel’s neighbor. Israel coordinates with Russia when striking Iranian, Syrian or Lebanese military or militia targets on Syrian soil, and does not want to unduly rock its relationship with Moscow. Israel is also concerned about possible fallout for Russian Jews. In general, Israeli officials are very sensitive about how the Holocaust is invoked by politicians abroad. Mr. Zelensky himself was criticized in Israel when, during a virtual address in March to the country’s Parliament, he compared the suffering of Ukrainians to that of Jews during the Holocaust.",8
2022-05-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/09/world/europe/biden-lend-lease-act-ukraine.html,"Biden Signs Lend-Lease Act, Speeding Up Weapons Shipments to Ukraine","WASHINGTON — President Biden on Monday signed an updated version of the Lend-Lease Act that supplied Britain and eventually other allies during World War II, summoning the spirit of the last century’s epic battle for democracy as he paved the way for further arms shipments to Ukrainians fighting to repel Russian invaders. “Every day, Ukrainians fight for their lives,” Mr. Biden said as he approved the legislation in the Oval Office. “The cost of the fight is not cheap but caving to aggression is even more costly.” The original Lend-Lease Act was enacted in March 1941 when the United States was still officially neutral during World War II, as a way for President Franklin D. Roosevelt to send weaponry and other supplies to Britain as it faced Nazi Germany essentially on its own. Among the other allies it later helped was the Soviet Union. Now, Moscow will be on the other side of the arms channel as the modern-day version, called the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, will direct weapons and equipment not to Russian soldiers but to those fighting them. The law will waive time-consuming requirements on the provision of arms to Ukraine, speeding up shipments considered critical to its defense against Russian forces. The legislation passed unanimously in the Senate and with just 10 Republicans voting no in the House. Mr. Biden was joined for the low-key ceremony by Vice President Kamala Harris, Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat from Maryland, and Representatives Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, and Victoria Spartz, a Republican from Indiana who was born in Ukraine. Mr. Biden signed the law on the same day that Russia celebrated Victory Day, the 77th anniversary of the allied defeat of Nazi Germany, a victory facilitated in part by the original Lend-Lease Act. “This day’s supposed to be about celebrating peace and unity in Europe and the defeat of Nazis in World War II,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said at a briefing afterward. “And instead, Putin is perverting history, changing history, or attempting to change it, I should say, to justify his unprovoked and unjustified war.”",1
2022-05-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/10/opinion/can-we-still-be-optimistic-about-america.html,Opinion | Can We Still Be Optimistic About America?,"This is a season — an age, really — of American pessimism. The pessimism comes in many flavors. There is progressive pessimism: The country is tilting toward MAGA-hatted fascism or a new version of “The Handmaid’s Tale.” There is conservative pessimism: The institutions, from primary schools to the Pentagon, are all being captured by wokeness. There is Afropessimism: Black people have always been excluded by systemic, ineradicable racism. There is the pessimism of the white middle and working classes: The country and the values they’ve known for generations are being hijacked by smug, self-dealing elites who view them with contempt. There is also the pessimism of the middle: We are losing the institutional capacity, cultural norms and moral courage needed to strike pragmatic compromises at almost every level of society. Zero-sum is now our default setting. These various kinds of pessimism may reach contradictory conclusions, but they are based on undeniable realities. In 2012, there were roughly 41,000 overdose deaths in the United States. Last year, the number topped 100,000. In 2012, there were 4.7 murders for every 100,000 people. Last year, the rate hit an estimated 6.9, a 47 percent increase. A decade ago, you rarely heard of carjackings. Now, they are through the roof. Shoplifting? Ditto. The nation’s mental health was in steep decline before the pandemic, with a 60 percent increase of major depressive episodes among adolescents between 2007 and 2019. Everything we know about the effects of lockdowns and school closures suggests it’s gotten much worse. Economics tells a similar story. “Twenty-first-century America has somehow managed to produce markedly more wealth for its wealthholders even as it provided markedly less work for its workers,” observed Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute in a landmark 2017 Commentary essay. It’s in part from the loss of meaningful work — and the consequent evaporation of pride, purpose and dignity in labor — that we get the startling increase in death rates among white middle-aged Americans, often to suicide or substance abuse. The list goes on, but you get the point. Even without the daily reminders of Carter-era inflation, this feels like another era of Carter-style malaise, complete with an unpopular president who tends to inspire more sympathy than he does confidence. So why am I still an optimist when it comes to America? Because while we are bent, our adversaries are brittle. As we find ways to bend, they can only remain static or shatter. This week brought two powerful reminders of the point. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin gave his customary May 9 Victory Day speech, in which he enlisted nostalgia for a partly mythical past to promote lies about a wholly mythical present, all for the sake of a war that is going badly for him. Putin is belatedly discovering that the powers to humiliate, subvert and destroy are weaker forces than the powers to attract, inspire and build — powers free nations possess almost as a birthright. The Kremlin might yet be able to bludgeon its way to something it can call victory. But its reward will mainly be the very rubble it has created. The rest of Ukraine will find ways to flourish, ideally as a member of NATO and the European Union. Meanwhile, in Shanghai, more than 25 million people remain under strict lockdown, a real-world dystopia in which hovering drones warn residents through loudspeakers to “control your soul’s desire for freedom.” Does anyone still think that China’s handling of the pandemic — its deceits, its mediocre vaccines, a zero-Covid policy that manifestly failed and now this cruel lockdown that has brought hunger and medicine shortages to its richest city — is a model to the rest of the world? For all its undeniable progress over 45 years, China remains a Potemkin regime obsessed with fostering aggrandizing illusions: about domestic harmony (aided by a vast system of surveillance and prison camps); about technological innovation (aided by unprecedented theft of intellectual property); about unstoppable economic growth (aided by manufactured statistics). The illusions may win status for Beijing. But they come with a heavy price: the systematic denial of truth, even to the regime itself. Rulers who come to believe their own propaganda will inevitably miscalculate, often catastrophically. Look again at Putin, who really believed he had a competent military. Which brings me back to the United States. Just as dictatorships advertise their strengths but hide their weaknesses — both to others and to themselves — democracies do the opposite: We obsess over our weaknesses even as we forget our formidable strengths. It is the source of our pessimism. But it is also, paradoxically, our deepest strength: In refusing to look away from our flaws, we not only acknowledge them but also begin fixing them. We rethink. We adapt. In bending, we find new ways to grow. We have a demonstrated record of defanging right-wing demagogues, debunking left-wing ideologues, promoting racial justice, reversing crime waves, revitalizing the political center and reinvigorating the American ideal. Our problems may be hard, but they are neither insoluble nor new. Those without our freedoms will not be so fortunate. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Under pressure to present a united front as President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces carry out a campaign of atrocities across Ukraine, lawmakers in both political parties who have previously railed against skyrocketing military budgets and entanglements in intractable conflicts abroad have gone largely silent about what is fast becoming a major military effort drawing on American resources. The House on Tuesday night passed a $40 billion military and humanitarian aid package for Ukraine in an overwhelming 368 to 57 vote, weeks after lawmakers overwhelmingly approved $13.6 billion in emergency aid for the war effort. That total — roughly $53 billion over two months — goes beyond what President Biden requested and is poised to amount to the largest foreign aid package to move through Congress in at least two decades. It also comes at a time when the two parties have been unable to reach agreement to invest in domestic programs. They include the extension of a tax credit that pulled millions of American children out of poverty and even a pandemic response package to control the spread of the coronavirus, as Republicans and some Democrats raise concerns that such spending could exacerbate inflation and increase the federal deficit. But stunned by the grisly images from Ukraine and leery of turning their backs on a country whose suffering has been on vivid display for the world, many lawmakers have put aside their skepticism and quietly agreed to the sprawling tranches of aid, keeping to themselves their concerns about the war and questions about the Biden administration’s strategy for American involvement. And as Mr. Biden’s requests to Congress for money to fund the war effort have spiraled upward, leaders in both parties have largely refrained from questioning them. Instead, the packages have swelled to accommodate the two parties’ competing priorities, with Republicans adding money for military assistance and Democrats insisting that be matched by an equal addition for humanitarian aid. They have been backed by pleas of urgency from both Ukrainian leaders and the Biden administration, which warned Congress this week that more aid would be needed before May 19 to continue providing military support. On Tuesday, hours before the House was to vote, Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, met separately with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, where the measure is now headed, to personally call for swift passage of the package. “Her people are dying. They’re running out of supplies and ammunition. They need our help quickly,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, describing Ms. Markarova’s message as: “Thank you for all our help, but please speed it up.” The result has been that, at least for now, Congress is quickly and nearly unanimously embracing historic tranches of foreign aid with little public debate about the Biden administration’s strategy, whether the volume of military assistance could escalate the conflict, or whether domestic priorities are being pushed aside to accommodate the huge expenditures overseas. “Time is of the essence — and we cannot afford to wait,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California wrote to lawmakers in a letter on Tuesday ahead of the vote. “With this aid package, America sends a resounding message to the world of our unwavering determination to stand with the courageous people of Ukraine until victory is won.” The package would provide $6 billion for weaponry, intelligence support, training and other defense assistance to Ukrainian forces, as well as $8.7 billion to replenish American equipment sent to the country. It would allocate $3.9 billion for European Command operations, including intelligence support and hardship pay for troops in the region. It would allow Mr. Biden to authorize the speedy transfer of up to $11 billion of American equipment, weapons and defense supplies. The legislation also would set aside $13.9 billion for the State Department, with the bulk going toward the Economic Support Fund to help Ukraine’s government continue to function. Another $4.4 billion would go to emergency food assistance in Ukraine and around the world, as the war disrupts the country’s food supply and distribution. The measure would devote $900 million to assistance for Ukrainian refugees, including housing, English language, trauma and support services. While nearly 60 Republicans opposed the bill, only a handful of spoke up to outline their concerns with the legislation, arguing that the United States could not afford to spend so much abroad at a time when they argue the basic needs of American citizens are not being met. Only Republicans opposed the measure, citing its size and the rushed timeline. The loudest voices in both parties were those declaring their full-throated support, arguing that failing to halt Mr. Putin’s campaign now would lead to a more costly conflict later. “I think we’d all agree the most important thing going on in the world right now is the war in Ukraine,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, recounting a recent phone call with Mr. Biden in which he said he had advised the president that the package should “move by itself and quickly.” “He called back in about 15 minutes and agreed that we need to do this — Ukraine only, and quickly,” Mr. McConnell added. “I think we’re on the path to getting that done.” Some lonely voices on Capitol Hill — mostly hard-right Republicans — emerged on Tuesday to express misgivings. They were buoyed by Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of former President Donald J. Trump, and a handful of conservative advocacy groups that mobilized in opposition to the bill. Representative Warren Davidson, Republican of Ohio and a former Army officer, said in an interview that he was concerned that in quickly approving the legislation without sufficient debate, Congress was essentially paving the way for Mr. Biden to shift the nation’s role in the world “from fighting everyone’s war to funding everyone’s war.” “Was it urgent to get some aid to them early on? Absolutely,” Mr. Davidson said of Ukrainian forces. But, he added, in earlier times of war, lawmakers had approved bills with sweeping, long-lasting ramifications, citing the Patriot Act and the 2001 law authorizing war against Al Qaeda that has since been stretched to permit open-ended combat against Islamist militant groups across the world. “When you rush these things and don’t put the proper framework around them, bad things happen,” he said. In the early weeks of the war in Ukraine, skeptical lawmakers in both parties were more open about their apprehension about the role of the United States in the conflict. More than 40 lawmakers on the right and left signed a letter in February warning Mr. Biden that he would need to receive authorization from Congress before involving American forces in the war. Some progressive lawmakers fretted openly about the possible unforeseen consequences of shipping thousands of weapons to fighters in Ukraine, while a handful of conservatives argued that the war was simply not an issue for the United States to become involved in. But as Mr. Putin’s campaign became increasingly barbaric and the Biden administration began to send more support to Ukraine, including quietly providing Ukrainian forces with crucial intelligence, those voices grew quieter. Congressional leaders in both parties have also moved quickly to tamp down on those voices. “This is a large package, but the need is great, and time is of the essence,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said. “We have a moral obligation to stand with our friends in Ukraine. The fight they are in is a struggle between democracy and authoritarianism itself. We dare not relent swift action to help our friends in need.” Each time Mr. Biden has requested Congress pass emergency aid, congressional leaders have significantly increased both the military and humanitarian funding. The legislation the House approved on Tuesday, for example, more than doubled the arms-transfer authority requested by Mr. Biden, effectively enabling him to dip into American stockpiles to send the Ukrainians more than twice as many weapons without coming back to Congress. Each time, they have been urged to action by top Ukrainian officials who have proved masterful at rallying support for their cause. Lawmakers were moved to tears by President Volodymyr Zelensky’s emotional address to Congress in March. Liberal Democrats have pointedly noted that the aid packages for Ukraine appeared to have a far easier path to the president’s desk than their domestic priorities. A $22.5 billion emergency coronavirus package has shrunk to less than half its size because of Republican demands that it be paid for with existing funds, and is mired in an election-year dispute over immigration. “Our national defense is about helping the Ukrainians as they fight against an illegal and immoral Russian invasion,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. “But our national defense is also about strengthening our families and our own domestic economy.” “The disconnect around here really frustrates me,” she added. But when Ms. Pelosi visited the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and Poland to survey the wreckage wrought by Russian forces, liberals noted that she was accompanied by two powerful and outspoken antiwar progressives, Representatives Barbara Lee of California and Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, signaling the breadth of the American consensus behind Ukraine’s war effort. “We should always have a debate, but the problem is that Ukraine is in the middle of a very intense war right now,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who has often led the charge against increased military spending. “I think every day counts, and I think we have to respond as strongly and vigorously as we can.” John Ismay and Luke Broadwater contributed reporting.",1
2022-05-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/world/europe/putin-russia-corruption.html,"To Keep Putin and His Oligarchs Afloat, It Takes a System","A single arrest in a Tuscan port is rarely international news. But the Italian police’s decision to seize Scheherezade last Friday in Marina de Carrara was different. For one thing, Scheherezade is not a person, but a 459-foot luxury superyacht. And for another, American officials say her true owner, through a haze of intermediaries, is likely to be President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Police seizures of massive luxury yachts in European ports have become the most visible symbol of the West’s effort to crack down on Putin and his inner circle in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But they are also particularly visible evidence of the Russian ruling class’s corruption. The Scheherezade has gold-plated bathroom fixtures, helicopter landing pads, and a dance floor that converts into a swimming pool — the latter of which conjures the unexpected question of whether Putin is a fan of the classic film “It’s a Wonderful Life.” All of which, needless to say, would be far beyond the scope of a government salary. And so the glitzy boat is a usefully concrete reminder of what Russia experts have said for years: that it is impossible to understand Putin’s regime without understanding the corruption that has by turns created, fueled, shaped, constrained it. And that may, one day, prove to be its undoing. Mapping the details of that corruption would be the work of a lifetime. But two simple insights can help you grasp the big picture. The first is true of systemic corruption wherever it occurs: It is not primarily a problem of individual immorality, but of a collective action trap. And the second is true of Russia: It got stuck in that trap as a result of its flawed, and ultimately incomplete, transition to democracy in the 1990s. We tend to think of corruption as a failure of morality, when a greedy person decides to benefit by steering public resources toward private gain. But while that’s not exactly untrue, it misses the most important thing: namely, that corruption is a group activity. You need bribe-payers and bribe-takers, resource-diverters and resource-resellers, look-the-other-wayers and demand-a-share-of-the-takers. When that kind of corrupt network behavior becomes widespread, it creates its own parallel system of rewards — and punishments. “What is different with systemic corruption is that it’s the expected behavior,” said Anna Persson, a political scientist at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, who studies corruption. “These expectations make it very difficult for all individuals, actually, to stand against corruption, because it’s very costly in all different ways to resist that kind of system.” Those who refuse to participate in the parallel economy of favors and bribes get passed over for promotion, cut off from benefits, and frozen out of power. Meanwhile, those who are skilled at corruption rise through the ranks, gaining more authority, more resources to distribute to cronies, and more ability to punish anyone who poses a threat to them. The result is a system where power and wealth accrue to those willing to play the corruption game, and those who are not get left behind. Corruption “serves as a regressive tax, it’s like Robin Hood in reverse,” Persson told me. “All the resources are moved to the top of the system, to the great cost of the majority of the population.” The most obvious evidence of that corrupt dynamic in Russia is in the luxury properties and megayachts belonging to senior officials and their close associates. But the harm runs deeper, reaching into ordinary people’s lives and depriving them not just of the government services and goods that get diverted into private pockets, but often of their basic rights. Ivan Golunov, one of Russia’s best-known investigative journalists, spent years reporting tenaciously on corruption in Moscow’s city government, uncovering evidence of crony deals, missing money and failed public services. In 2019, he was arrested on trumped-up drug charges, beaten and jailed. After an unprecedented outcry in the Russian media and abroad, he was released and charges were dropped. But the message was obvious: Those who try to break the culture of corruption risk losing their safety, freedom, or even lives. But why did corruption in Russia get that bad? The answer, and maybe a counterintuitive one, is in democratization. Or rather, not quite enough of it, said Kelly McMann, a political scientist at Case Western Reserve University who studies corruption and is one of the managers of V-Dem, a long-running study about the nature and strength of democracy worldwide. There was corruption in the Soviet Union. But after its dissolution in 1991, the sudden explosive growth of freedom of expression and freedom of association in Russia and the other former Soviet countries and satellites brought new opportunities, not just for political and economic development, but for crime and corruption. “Freedoms of expression and association don’t only have to be used for good things, they can be used for illegal activities, too,” McMann said. “When people can more easily get together and talk, that enables them to actually plan corrupt activity.” That wouldn’t have been so bad if democratization had also brought in checks on executive power, an independent judiciary to investigate and prosecute crimes. “In order to have capitalism have functioning markets, you also need to build institutions. You need banks that can provide credit, you need a strong legal system that will protect property.” McMann said. Estonia followed that path. After the Soviet Union fell, Estonia’s new, democratically elected parliament strengthened the judiciary and introduced new checks on executive power. There, corruption fell. But in Russia, the government heeded Western advisers’ urging to get the state out of the economy as much as possible in order to let free markets flourish. Institutions and constraints fell by the wayside. In that vacuum, the parallel structures of corruption flourished, crowding honest politicians out of government and honest businesses out of the market. By the late 1990s, official corruption had flourished at every level of the government. In 1999, as President Boris Yeltsin’s presidency began to weaken, elites pressured him to leave office on their terms. If Yeltsin would anoint their handpicked successor, they would ensure that he and his family did not face prosecution for misappropriation of government funds. He agreed. In August 1999, Yeltsin presented that successor: a young former K.G.B. agent from St. Petersburg named Vladimir Putin. How am I doing? I’d love your feedback on this newsletter.

2022-05-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/world/europe/rand-paul-ukraine-aid.html,Rand Paul Delays $40 Billion in Aid for Ukraine,"Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky on Thursday single-handedly delayed a bipartisan effort to quickly send $40 billion in aid to Ukraine, which Congress had tried to fast-track amid the escalating brutality of Russia’s war. The Senate needed unanimous consent to waive procedural hurdles and approve the humanitarian and military aid package, which the House passed 368-to-57 on Tuesday. Mr. Paul, a Republican and a libertarian who generally opposes U.S. spending on foreign aid, objected, halting what had been an extraordinary effort to rapidly shepherd the largest foreign aid package through Congress in at least two decades. Mr. Paul had sought to alter the bill to include a provision requiring that an inspector general monitor the spending, and was not satisfied with a counteroffer from party leaders to have a separate vote on that proposal. In his objection on the Senate floor, Mr. Paul cited concerns about inflation and rising energy and gas prices. “My oath of office is to the U.S. Constitution, not to any foreign nation,” he said, adding, “We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the U.S. economy.” The Senate is still expected to approve the aid package, but Mr. Paul’s objection will delay a vote until at least next week. Any changes to the legislation would require a second vote in the House and potentially invite other lawmakers to force their own changes, delaying agreement on the legislation. Speaking on the Senate floor, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said lawmakers in both parties had concerns with the proposal. “If every member held every bill in exchange for every last little demand, it would mean total and permanent paralysis for this chamber,” he warned. Mr. Schumer pointedly added: “When you have a proposal to change a bill, you have to convince members to support it. The junior senator from Kentucky has not done that.” With Russia’s campaign growing more violent as the war drags into an 11th week, some Democratic and Republican lawmakers have set aside their skepticism over entangling the United States — at least financially — in a foreign war. The $40 billion package would allow President Biden to authorize the transfer of up to $11 billion of American weapons, equipment and military supplies, as well as send billions of dollars to support the Ukrainian government and refugees from the country. Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, and Lloyd J. Austin III, the defense secretary, warned Congress this week in a letter that the package needed to become law before May 19 “to provide uninterrupted critical military support to our Ukrainian partners.”",1
2022-05-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/13/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia-detention-extended.html,"Russian Court Extends Brittney Griner’s Pretrial Detention, Her Lawyer Says","A court in Russia on Friday extended the pretrial detention of the W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner until June 18, her lawyer said. Ms. Griner, one of the most decorated athletes in women’s basketball, has been in Russian custody since mid-February on drug charges that can carry up to 10 years in prison. The charge is based on allegations that she had vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage when she was stopped at the Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow in February. Ms. Griner appeared in court in the town of Khimki near Moscow for a procedural hearing on Friday, according to her lawyer, Aleksandr Boikov. “She is OK,” Mr. Boikov said in an interview, adding that the court denied his appeal to have Ms. Griner transferred to house arrest. He said he expects the trial to begin in about two months. While Ms. Griner was arrested one week before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian authorities did not reveal her detention until days after the war began, raising fears she could be used as a bargaining chip in the overall crisis. The U.S. State Department has said it had determined Ms. Griner was “wrongfully detained,” signaling its intention to get more actively involved in the situation. At the end of April, Russia released Trevor R. Reed, an ailing former American Marine who had been sentenced to nine years in prison for assault, in a prisoner swap with the United States. That raised hopes that Ms. Griner might also be released. It is typical of Russian courts to extend detention until trial, which then can take weeks to complete. Mr. Reed’s release, for instance, happened after he was convicted and had spent years in a Russian prison. Ms. Griner’s team and family have been relatively quiet about her situation. A two-time Olympic gold medalist, Ms. Griner is one of several American players who compete for international teams in the off-season period to supplement their W.N.B.A. paychecks. She has played for the UMMC team in Yekaterinburg, Russia, since 2014.",7
2022-05-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/world/russian-gymnast-z-medal.html,Russian Gymnast Who Wore Pro-War ‘Z’ Symbol on Podium Is Given One-Year Ban,"A Russian gymnast was stripped of a medal this week and banned for a year by the sport’s governing body for wearing a “Z,” which has become a symbol for showing support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, at a World Cup event in March. Ivan Kuliak, 20, placed third in parallel bars at the Apparatus World Cup in Doha, Qatar, about a week after Russia’s invasion. He stunned officials and observers by standing on the podium — next to a Ukrainian gymnast who won gold — with a “Z” taped squarely on the middle of his chest. When the Ukrainian winner, 18-year-old Illia Kovtun, stepped up to the podium, he shook hands with the silver medalist on his right and did not acknowledge Mr. Kuliak on his left. He later told a gymnastics magazine that he hadn’t initially seen Mr. Kuliak’s symbol but maintained his composure because his family and coach “raised me to be responsible for my people.” The next day, the International Gymnastics Federation, known as F.I.G., denounced Mr. Kuliak’s behavior as “shocking” and moved to open disciplinary proceedings. The decision, which Mr. Kuliak has the right to appeal, came down on Tuesday and ruled that he violated F.I.G.’s codes of ethics and conduct. He was banned for a year and ordered to return his bronze medal and prize money of roughly $500. He was also ordered to pay about $2,000 toward the cost of the proceedings. The body dropped related charges against the head of the Russian gymnastics delegation, Valentina Rodionenko, and Mr. Kuliak’s coach, Igor Kalabushkin, and will compensate them for the proceedings’ costs. The podium incident took place just two days before the F.I.G.’s wider ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes went into effect. Mr. Kuliak’s ban will be extended by six months if it expires while the wider ban is still in effect, F.I.G. said. Mr. Kuliak and Russian sports officials have pushed back on the backlash surrounding his display of the “Z,” which has been prominently painted on Russian tanks in Ukraine and is now widely used by the Russian public as a pro-war symbol. “If there was a second chance and I would again have to choose whether to go out with the letter ‘Z’ on my chest or not, I would do exactly the same,” Mr. Kuliak told RT, a Russian state-owned outlet, in March. He argued that Ukrainian athletes at the competition had themselves displayed nationalism and that he “didn’t wish anything bad on anyone.” On Wednesday, Dmitry Svishchev, the chairman of Russia’s parliamentary committee on sports, described the ban as “complete lawlessness.” Neither he nor “the whole civilized world,” Mr. Svishchev claimed to another state outlet, saw “any offensive, discriminatory, nationalist signs” in Mr. Kuliak’s behavior.",29
2022-05-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/us/politics/ukraine-aid.html,Senate Expected to Pass $40 Billion Aid Package for Ukraine,"The Senate is set on Thursday to give final approval to a $40 billion emergency military and humanitarian aid package for Ukraine, as the United States deepens its support for an increasingly costly and protracted fight against a Russian invasion. The measure is the largest foreign aid package passed by Congress in at least two decades, and its enactment would bring the American investment in the war to roughly $54 billion in just over two months. The Senate was expected to approve it overwhelmingly, in the latest reflection of the remarkable bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for a massive investment in Ukraine’s war effort, which propelled the spending package through the House last week. President Biden was expected to quickly sign it into law. His administration and Ukrainian leaders have pressed hard for its swift enactment, warning that they would run out of aid by Thursday if Congress failed to act. The measure’s relatively smooth path through Congress has demonstrated how the searing images of suffering in Ukraine, coupled with fears about Russian aggression spreading beyond the country’s borders, have — at least for now — overcome resistance from both parties to American involvement in war abroad. Fewer than a dozen Republicans opposed bringing up the bill in a test vote on Monday; several who did cited concerns about sending billions of dollars abroad for a conflict whose endpoint is unknown at a time when the United States is struggling with economic challenges, including inflation. Leaders in both parties sought to ensure that skepticism about the scope of the package did not derail its passage. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, led a delegation of senators in his party in a surprise visit to Ukraine last weekend and pledged bipartisan support for the country’s fight against Russia. “I think it’s important for the United States to help, important for the free world to help, important for the Ukrainians to win and hopefully, not many members of my party will choose to politicize this issue,” Mr. McConnell said during a press call on Sunday, speaking from Stockholm. The legislation is substantially larger than Mr. Biden’s $33 billion request, which came only weeks after Congress had cleared a $13.6 billion aid package for Ukraine, roughly equally divided between military and humanitarian aid. The bill on track to pass on Thursday has a similar split. It would allow Mr. Biden to authorize the speedy transfer of up to $11 billion of American weapons, equipment and defense supplies to Ukraine, and allocate about $9 billion to replenish that stockpile. Transfers thus far have included relatively expensive weapons like the 5,500 Javelin anti-tank guided missiles and 1,400 Stinger antiaircraft missiles given to Kyiv, as well as less-costly munitions like the 184,000 155-millimeter shells provided to Ukraine for a protracted artillery battle in Donbas. The package also includes $8.8 billion for a dedicated fund intended to help Ukraine’s government continue to function, and $4.4 billion for international disaster assistance, part of an effort to stem the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. Another $900 million would go to assistance for Ukrainian refugees, including providing trauma and support services, English language training, and housing. John Ismay contributed reporting.",1
2022-05-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/us/politics/senate-passes-ukraine-aid.html,The Senate Approves $40 Billion in New Aid to Ukraine,"WASHINGTON — The Senate overwhelmingly approved on Thursday a $40 billion emergency military and humanitarian aid package for Ukraine, moving quickly and with little debate to deepen the United States’ support for an increasingly costly and protracted fight against a brutal Russian invasion. The measure, paired with an initial emergency infusion of aid to Kyiv that was approved in March, amounts to the largest package of foreign aid passed by Congress in at least two decades, bringing to roughly $54 billion the total American investment in the war in just over two months. The lopsided vote, with just 11 senators in opposition — all Republicans — reflected the remarkable bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for a massive investment in Ukraine’s war effort, which propelled the bill through the House last week. And the speed with which it moved through Congress, where the leaders of both parties raised few questions about how much money was being spent or what it would be used for, was striking, given the gridlock that has prevented domestic initiatives large and small from winning approval in recent years. A bill to provide billions for pandemic-response efforts in the United States is stalled, for instance, and Republicans opposed another this week to provide $28 million to address the nationwide shortage of baby formula. President Biden was expected to quickly sign the Ukraine aid package into law. His administration and Ukrainian leaders have pressed hard for its swift enactment, warning that they would run out of American aid by Thursday if Congress failed to act. “I applaud the Congress for sending a clear bipartisan message to the world that the people of the United States stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. Shortly after the vote, he announced that he would send another package of artillery, radars, and other equipment to Ukraine. The momentum behind the bill showed how the searing images of suffering in Ukraine, coupled with fears about Russian aggression spreading beyond the country’s borders, had — at least for now — overcome resistance from both parties to American involvement in war abroad, even as isolationist voices off Capitol Hill have steadily grown louder in their skepticism. “We Americans — all of us, Democrat and Republican — cannot afford to stick our heads in the sand while Vladimir Putin continues his vicious belligerence against the Ukrainian people,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the majority leader. When the House passed the spending package last week, a flurry of lobbying against the bill, led by archconservative media figures and activists, helped drive 57 Republicans to oppose it. Determined to project strong bipartisan support for Kyiv, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, worked for days leading up to the vote to tamp down on the anti-interventionist strain in his party, arguing both privately and publicly to his colleagues that the United States needed to aid a young democracy standing between Russian aggression and the Western world. The pinnacle of that effort came over the weekend, when Mr. McConnell traveled to Kyiv, Ukraine, Stockholm and Helsinki, Finland, in what he said was partly a bid to push back on former President Donald J. Trump’s hostility toward NATO and the aid legislation itself. When Mr. Trump announced his opposition to the $40 billion package, Mr. McConnell said, he worried that he “could lose a lot more than 11” Republican votes. The trip was designed “to convey to the Europeans that skepticism about NATO itself, expressed by the previous president, was not the view of Republicans in the Senate,” Mr. McConnell said in an interview. “And I also was trying to minimize the vote against the package in my own party.” “We have a sort of an isolationist wing,” he continued. “And I think some of the Trump supporters have sort of linked up with the isolationists — a lot of talk out in the primaries about this sort of thing. I felt this would help diminish the number of votes against the package. I think that worked out well.” Most of the Republicans regarded as presidential prospects in 2024 — Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Tim Scott of South Carolina, and Marco Rubio of Florida — backed the legislation even in the face of opposition from right-wing organizations. In a 24-minute speech on the Senate floor, announcing his vote on Wednesday night, Mr. Cruz said he had carefully listened to a litany of arguments against the aid bill, including that it was too expensive and bloated with provisions unrelated to military aid, and that it was not in America’s security interest to counter Russia’s campaign when there were so many domestic problems at home. But he had come to the conclusion, he said, that the assistance was worth supporting. “There’s no doubt $40 billion is a large number, and although much of that spending is important — in fact, some of it is acutely needed in the military conflict — I would have preferred a significantly smaller and more focused bill,” Mr. Cruz said. “But our Ukrainian allies right now are winning significant victories with the weapons and training that we provided them already, and it is in our national interest for them to keep doing so.” In the end, fewer than a dozen Republicans, including Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who is also regarded as a presidential contender, voted no. They cited concerns about sending billions of dollars abroad as the United States struggles with economic challenges of its own. “Spending $40 billion on Ukraine aid — more than three times what all of Europe has spent combined — is not in America’s interests,” Mr. Hawley wrote on Twitter. “It neglects priorities at home (the border), allows Europe to freeload, short changes critical interests abroad and comes w/ no meaningful oversight.” “That’s not isolationism,” he added. “That’s nationalism. It’s about prioritizing American security and American interests.” Opponents of the legislation said they expected rising domestic discontent with the size of the aid packages to grow as the conflict deepened. Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, told senators earlier this week that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is digging in for a long campaign and was counting on the United States’ resolve to support Ukraine flagging. The dissenting votes in the House and Senate “set the table for what is going to be a very heated debate” in the fall, said Jessica Anderson, the executive director of Heritage Action, which lobbied against the bill. The legislation that passed on Thursday is substantially larger than the initial tranche of aid Mr. Biden had requested, a request that came only weeks after Congress had cleared a $13.6 billion aid package for Ukraine, roughly equally divided between military and humanitarian aid. The bill had a similar split. It would allow Mr. Biden to authorize the speedy transfer of up to $11 billion of American weapons, equipment and defense supplies to Ukraine, and allocate about $9 billion to replenish that stockpile.

2022-05-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/world/europe/russia-azov-mariupol-trials.html,How Russia Uses Show Trials to Punish Putin’s Enemies,"The Kremlin has long orchestrated Russia’s court system as an instrument for oppression and propaganda, using a veneer of legality to silence critics and to impose its version of events. Last December, for example, Russia’s Supreme Court liquidated the country’s most prominent human rights group, Memorial, ruling that its work chronicling Stalin-era brutality had distorted the Soviet Union’s historical image. Months earlier, a Moscow court had condemned the political and anti-corruption organizations founded by Aleksei A. Navalny as “extremist,” eventually sentencing the opposition leader to nine years in prison. In 2020, Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, received a 16-year sentence on espionage charges in a case widely seen as Russia grabbing a hostage. “Sham Trial!” Mr. Whelan, who remains incarcerated, wrote on a piece of paper that he held up in court. The common thread in all these cases, analysts and opposition figures say, is that the verdict was stage-managed to deliver to President Vladimir V. Putin a coveted goal, like diminishing an opponent or buttressing a propaganda point. Now, with more than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers from the besieged steel plant in Mariupol in Russian custody, the prospect of so-called show trials has emerged again. The fighters have been leaving the plant this week after maintaining the last line of defense in Mariupol, at a Soviet-era steel facility. The Ukrainian government said it had negotiated a deal for the fighters’ exchange, but Moscow has not confirmed this. At the same time, some Russian officials have pushed to label one group of the soldiers — members of the Azov battalion — as terrorists, and to try them on war crimes charges. The Russian position has raised the prospect that it is laying the groundwork for high-profile trials of the fighters that would advance its narrative of the war. “Every single case which Putin or his allies would like to manipulate will be manipulated,” said Ilya Novikov, a former Moscow lawyer who relocated to Kyiv three years ago. “You should not start by asking what are the charges, you should start by asking what is the outcome.” Mr. Novikov served as the defense attorney for various Ukrainians accused in high-profile cases, including a 2018 episode in which Russia seized 24 Ukrainian sailors. Russia’s Ministry of Defense has suggested that the Azov battalion constituted the core of the force in the steel plant and put the initial number of those surrendering at about 800. The unit’s roots in the far right provided a sheen of credibility to Russia’s claim that it was fighting Nazis, the rationale it cites for invading its neighbor. It is not clear yet whether Russia will proceed with trials, but Moscow has sent ominous signals. The Russian Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing for next Thursday to decide whether to classify the Azov Brigade as a terrorist organization, a request made by the Prosecutor General; analysts say the outcome is almost a foregone conclusion. The Investigative Committee, Russia’s approximate equivalent to the F.B.I., said it would interrogate the fighters to look into possible crimes against civilians. Members of the Duma, or Parliament, proposed barring Azov members from being exchanged for Russian prisoners. The Foreign Ministry spokesman also suggested that some of those captured had committed war crimes. A Russian soldier in Ukraine has already pleaded guilty to war crimes charges for shooting a civilian, so Moscow could try to show that Ukrainian soldiers have committed equal atrocities, Mr. Novikov said. “It is like a mirror reaction,” he said. “You have a trial, but we will have a more effective trial, with many more people accused.” Mr. Putin suggested such trials in his Feb. 24 speech announcing the invasion. “We will seek to demilitarize and de-nazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetuated bloody crimes against civilians,” he said. Even if the Kremlin has not issued a directive, that speech was enough for the bureaucracy to swing into action and produce more trials, said Ivan Pavlov, a prominent human rights lawyer for defendants who are targeted by the security services. He fled the country last year after they started to pursue him, he said. “Russian courts no longer have anything to do with the legal bodies of a democratic state,” said Mr. Pavlov. “They are not guided by the law, but only by political needs, political purposes.” Show trials are part of the regular judicial process held in regular courtrooms in front of a judge with prosecutors and defense attorneys arguing their sides of the case. Despite all the official trappings, however, the outcome is almost never unexpected. Putting members of the Azov Brigade on trial would serve multiple political purposes. Mr. Putin could claim to have taken down some of the “Nazi’’ oppressors whom he has falsely portrayed as leading Ukraine. “We might guess that he is seeking a show trial in order to first demonstrate that these so-called Nazis whom he invaded Ukraine to fight against are real,” Mr. Novikov said. The trials would also highlight the capture of Mariupol, which Moscow could portray as a significant achievement in a war with few of them. Plus, Moscow wants to diminish the Azov fighters, a group that has come to represent fortitude and valor to Ukrainians after holding out in the steel plant for weeks. “Russia wants to say that they are not heroes, that they are terrorists and other things,” said Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker who was sentenced to 20 years in a Russian prison for opposing the 2014 annexation of his native Crimea. Mr. Sentsov, 45, a political activist, faced terrorism charges, accused of trying to set on fire the door to the ruling party headquarters in Crimea and of plotting to blow up a Lenin statue. No evidence was presented in court. He spent about five years in prison. “It was theater, everyone played their roles,” said Mr. Sentsov, who called in from Sloviansk, in Donbas, where he is fighting the Russians. His second feature film, “Rhino,” is debuting on Netflix on Monday. In 2019, Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange 35 prisoners, including Mr. Sentsov and all the sailors seized the year before, who never went on trial. The Russians hinged that exchange on the release of Volodymyr Tsemakh, Mr. Novikov said. Mr. Tsemakh was considered a potential key witness to an investigation into whether Russian-backed separatists shot down a Malaysian civilian airliner over Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. Mr. Whelan, who holds British, Canadian and Irish citizenship as well as American, was arrested in a Moscow hotel in December 2018. A Russian whom he knew handed him a thumb drive containing what Mr. Whelan thought were souvenir pictures, but Russian officials said it contained classified military information. It was widely assumed that the Russians nabbed Mr. Whelan to trade him for some high-profile Russian prisoner in the United States, but no such exchange has emerged. Another American, Brittney Griner, among the most decorated athletes in women’s basketball, has been in custody since February on drug charges, accused of having traces of hash oil in her luggage at a Moscow airport. She faces up to 10 years in prison. Mr. Putin inaugurated show trials soon after his tenure as president began in 2000. In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an oil tycoon and among Russia’s richest businessmen, made his opposition to Mr. Putin public by challenging him about corruption in high places during a nationally televised Kremlin meeting. Months later he was arrested on tax evasion and fraud charges and imprisoned for 10 years before moving abroad after Mr. Putin pardoned him. Some of the most notorious trials in Russian history were held at the end of the 1930s, used by Stalin to eliminate dozens of the Bolshevik old guard, who confessed to trumped up charges under torture and were executed. That coincided with hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens being sent to labor camps.",7
2022-05-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/opinion/russia-putin-war.html,Opinion | Putin Rules Russia Like an Asylum,"“Since the 16th century,” wrote the dissident Russian journalist Valeria Novodvorskaya, “we have existed according to the laws of manic depressive psychosis.” Published two years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ms. Novodvorskaya’s article captured a particularly chaotic, deranged period of Russian history. But it also makes a long-term argument about Russian society. Since the time of Ivan the Terrible, Ms. Novodvorskaya argued, Russia has suffered from manic depressive psychosis — “flaying” the weak government and “kissing the whip” of the fierce autocrat. The result was a country “hanging between fascism and communism,” and citizens unable to live like normal people. The use of psychiatric metaphors was no idle choice. In 1969, Ms. Novodvorskaya, then a 19-year-old student, was detained for distributing anti-Soviet leaflets and sentenced to two years in a psychiatric hospital. She knew firsthand the horrors of the K.G.B.’s system of punitive psychiatry for dissidents. For her, it distilled the logic of Russia’s rulers, czarist or Soviet. The aim was to produce a lobotomized mass, alternating between passion and passivity — and never in danger of threatening the system. Over the past two decades, Vladimir Putin has revived the system of punitive psychiatry, both literally and figuratively. Like the chief doctor of a Soviet penal psychiatric institution, Mr. Putin uses any means at his disposal to retain control and stamp out dissent. In his ward is a mostly poor, depressed society of 144 million people, divided by 11 time zones and four climate zones. In a state of anesthetized apathy and drugged-up distemper, the bulk of Russian society has quietly acceded to Mr. Putin’s rule — and to his brutal war in Ukraine. For Mr. Putin, the people in his ward are his property: He can do whatever he wants with them. From time to time, he feeds them — never generously — to ensure his approval ratings remain high. He has a habit of offering handouts, especially in the run-up to elections. One-off targeted financial gifts and benefit payments are a favorite tactic. The aim, of course, is not the material betterment of Russians. It’s to shore up support for the regime and ensure that turnout, in Russia’s strange pseudo-elections, remains tolerably high. Many of the people in Mr. Putin’s ward do not live; they survive. Though reliable statistics are hard to come by, an independent economist, Natalia Zubarevich, estimated that in 2019, 15 percent of Russians were living in poverty, while another 49 percent were close to dropping into that category. Two years of the pandemic have only made things worse. Last summer, 40 percent of Russians, according to the independent Levada Center, were unable to feed themselves adequately while 52 percent couldn’t afford the necessary clothes and shoes. In this dire condition, people understandably tend to think first and foremost about their stomachs. For many of them, politics is like the weather, an unchangeable and often incomprehensible fact of life. All opportunities for them to comprehend why they live this way have been completely blocked by state propaganda — and the politicians who could help them understand are either dead or in prison. Independent information, available online from a dwindling number of sources, is impossible to find without an unaffordable outlay of time, energy and know-how. Much of Russia’s middle class is in the same ward. A vulnerable minority are from the private sector, but a majority is dependent on the state — they are doctors, teachers, civil servants, police officers, state company workers. Because they live a little better than the lower classes, they thank Mr. Putin for their somewhat better situation. They don’t want change and they don’t know why they would need change: Few of them have been abroad and seen how other people live. On state television, they’re told that Europe is rotten and that its people are on the bread line. Nowhere is better than Russia. These are the unfortunate people in Mr. Putin’s asylum. Their unspoken motto is: “Keep your head down, or else things will get worse.” They largely do not worry that Russia is waging war with Ukraine on their behalf and that the Russian army has been killing civilians in a neighboring country every day for almost three months. As far as they’re concerned, there is a special operation going on somewhere far away, conducted by a state on which they critically depend. There’s no need to look any closer, and little opportunity to do so. A psychiatric institution isn’t just full of patients. There are attendants, too. In Mr. Putin’s Russia, these roles are performed by government, defense and law enforcement officials, propaganda workers and wealthy businesspeople, all carefully controlled by security officials. Members of this cohort, sifted and filtered by the Kremlin, consider themselves the masters of the country and the country itself as their property. They have no ideology other than the servile worship of their superiors for their own gain. Mr. Putin orders them to keep people in fear, to incite hatred, to stifle freedom of thought — and each of them contributes to that mission. Thanks to them, the state penetrates every corner. Across society, they build imitations of Mr. Putin’s regime — in local government, the charity sector, even volunteer associations — just to prevent anyone from starting something not subservient to the state. Mr. Putin forgives these people corruption, torture, you name it, as long as they successfully guard the ward. They all work in different ways, but together they sap citizens’ willpower and strengthen their obedience. As they say in Russia, half the country is in jail, and half the country are the guards. Of course, life is more complicated than any metaphor, especially in Russia’s atomized society. There are many people in Russia who are neither the patients nor the attendants in Mr. Putin’s penal asylum — as shown by the wide cross-section of society that immediately opposed the war. Scientists, students, charity workers, architects and even famous entertainers took to the streets and signed petitions. When this show of resistance was met with repression, many of the independent-minded left Russia altogether. But the metaphor captures a fundamental truth about Russia today: Mr. Putin wields power not through consent but by coercion. Genuine enthusiasm for the president’s war, for example, seems to be missing. Otherwise he would not have called it a “special operation,” closed down the few remaining independent media outlets immediately after the war began, blocked social networks, introduced new draconian laws and persecuted people for the most trivial of antiwar gestures. Mr. Putin also surely knows that he’s been sitting in the Kremlin too long and is losing some of his hold on the country. In February 2021, for example, 41 percent of respondents to a poll said they wanted the president to leave office after 2024 — an impressive result given the danger of speaking out. But Mr. Putin is not going to leave. He knows that no matter how great a historical figure he may have painted himself as, after his departure he will have to pay for his sins. In just two years he will face another decorative election, for which he rewrote the Constitution. In Ukraine, he wanted a quick victory so that no one would even think of replacing him with someone else. His plan was to redirect the accumulated public frustration and aggression away from himself and toward his “enemies” — Ukraine and the West. That way he could validate his right to remain on the throne as a great leader who had changed the world order. But thanks to Ukraine’s stiff opposition, his bloodthirsty plan did not work. It’s clear Mr. Putin plans to prolong his murderous war, in the hope of outlasting his opponents. The future is impossible to predict. But what can be said unequivocally is that Russian society, after so many years of Mr. Putin’s punitive psychiatry, will need a very long rehabilitation.

2022-05-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/politics/russia-china-bombers-biden.html,Russia and China Held Military Exercise in East Asia as Biden Visited,"WASHINGTON — China and Russia on Tuesday held their first joint military exercise since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, sending bombers over the seas in northeast Asia in an apparent show of force as President Biden was visiting the region, according to American, South Korean and Japanese officials. The U.S. government was tracking the military exercise as Mr. Biden met in Tokyo with the leaders of Australia, Japan and India, nations in the so-called Quad coalition that was formed in part to counter Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific region. The military activity was a significant sign that the partnership between China and Russia has not weakened even as the three-month-old war in Ukraine has resulted in thousands of civilian deaths. The bombers flew over the Sea of Japan early Tuesday and continued south toward the East China Sea and the Philippine Sea, a senior American official said in an interview soon after the start of the exercise, speaking on the condition of anonymity. South Korea issued a statement hours later confirming the exercise, saying that two Chinese military aircraft and four Russian warplanes had entered its air defense identification zone off the country’s east coast, without intruding into its airspace. Joint exercises involving strategic bombers are complex and are typically planned well in advance. The American official also said U.S. agencies had evidence that Chinese naval vessels most likely took part in the joint exercise. The South Korean military dispatched fighter jets before the Chinese and Russian bombers entered the zone and “and took tactical measures to guard against emergencies,” it said in a statement. The Japanese military said it also sent fighter jets to warn the bombers and conduct surveillance when the Chinese and Russian warplanes flew in the vicinity of Japan’s airspace. They did not intrude into Japan’s territory, it said. “We regard the military exercise conducted in the midst of the summit meeting between Japan, the United States, Australia and India as intending to show a demonstration of force against Japan, which hosted the meeting,” Nobuo Kishi, Japan’s defense minister, told reporters. “Also, the fact that this activity was held in the midst of the Quad summit meeting is deemed more provocative than other drills in the past.” “When the international community is responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China is acting together with the aggressor, Russia,” he added. “We cannot help but be concerned about this and cannot overlook it.” The Chinese defense ministry confirmed the exercise on an official social media account soon after South Korea and Japan released their statements. Japan, South Korea and Australia have supported the United States and the European Union in their opposition to Russia’s invasion and are coordinating with those nations on sanctions against Russia. South Korea has announced it is decreasing its purchases of Russian oil. India, which has a decades-long strategic relationship with Russia and relies on Moscow for military equipment, has taken a neutral stand, and it has increased its purchases of Russian oil. On Tuesday morning, at the start of the meetings among the Quad nation leaders, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan stressed the need to avoid potential conflicts in Asia when he spoke about the war in Ukraine while standing next to the other leaders. “A grave incident which has fundamentally shaken the rule-of-law-based international order we value has happened since we met last September,” he said. “Russian invasion into Ukraine squarely challenges the principles which are enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We should never, ever allow a similar incident to happen in the Indo-Pacific.” Beijing has sided with Moscow by giving it diplomatic and rhetorical support throughout the war. It has consistently denounced the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and repeated the assertions of President Vladimir V. Putin that the alliance’s enlargement is a threat to global stability and provoked him to invade Ukraine. It has also repeated Russian disinformation using official platforms, including a conspiracy theory about the Pentagon financing biological weapons labs in Ukraine. Mr. Putin has tried to strengthen Russia’s ties with China as a like-minded nation standing in opposition to Western dominance. On Feb. 4, as Mr. Putin visited Beijing for the Winter Olympics and met with President Xi Jinping for the 38th time as national leaders, their governments issued a 5,000-word statement that declared the two nations had a “no limits” partnership. Senior U.S. officials and a European official later said in interviews that a Western intelligence report had indicated that senior Chinese officials asked their Russian counterparts in early February to hold off on invading Ukraine until after the Olympics ended. The day after the closing ceremony, Mr. Putin declared that Ukraine should not be a sovereign state and ordered more units of the Russian military to cross into the embattled Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The full-scale invasion began three days later. In mid-March, U.S. officials said Russia had asked China for military and economic aid after the invasion of Ukraine. Russian ground forces have fared poorly in battles and skirmishes against the Ukrainian military, and Mr. Putin has decided to withdraw units from around Kyiv and other major cities and concentrate on taking the entire Donbas region. American officials say they have not detected any military or economic aid sent from China to Russia for the war. China has also not stepped in to help Russia evade sanctions or blunt the impact of the penalties, U.S. officials say. Chinese and Russian officials have been strengthening their military ties in recent years, and the two nations have been growing closer in part because of the highly personal bond between Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin. Both men are autocrats who harbor hostility toward the United States and aim to weaken American power. China has been buying more advanced weapons from Russia, and the two nations have done a growing number of joint military exercises recently. Last October, the two countries held joint naval drills off the Russian Far East. This January, the two joined with Iran for the same type of exercises in the northern Indian Ocean. The United States has been monitoring the rapid modernization of the People’s Liberation Army of China and its various forces. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has provoked greater anxiety among some U.S. and European officials over the possibility that Beijing might decide to invade Taiwan. U.S. officials have been pushing Taiwan to order American-made weapons that they say would give Taiwan a fighting chance against a typical seaborne invasion. On Monday, Mr. Biden said the United States would defend Taiwan militarily if China attacked the self-governing democratic island. U.S. officials said later that Mr. Biden was not changing a longstanding policy of “strategic ambiguity” on Taiwan and China in any way. That decades-old unwritten policy says the United States will remain silent on whether it would send military forces to defend Taiwan against China, even though the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 obligates the U.S. government to provide weapons of a defensive nature to Taiwan. The South Korean military said it first detected two Chinese H-6 bombers entering South Korea’s air defense identification zone off the southwestern coast of the Korean Peninsula at 7:56 a.m. Tuesday. They then joined four Russian planes, including two fighter jets and two Tu-95 bombers, off the east coast of the peninsula, it said. The six planes entered the South Korean zone there between 9:58 a.m. and 10:15 a.m. but did not enter South Korea’s territorial airspace, the officials said. The joint Chinese and Russian exercise continued into Tuesday afternoon, when the South Korean military spotted a group of four Chinese military aircraft and two Russian warplanes patrolling together between South Korea’s southern island of Jeju and Japan’s southern Kyushu island before they split up. In his opening remarks at the Tuesday meetings, Mr. Biden spoke of how he had once told Mr. Xi that the United States was committed to maintaining a dominant presence across Asia and the surrounding oceans. “I was once asked by the leader of China why I kept talking about being an Indo-Pacific power,” he said. “And I said, ‘Because we are. We share the Pacific — one entire side of our country.’ And we have been deeply involved with all of you for a long time.” Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, and Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo.",22
2022-05-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/us/politics/china-policy-biden.html,"U.S. Aims to Constrain China by Shaping Its Environment, Blinken Says","WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Thursday that despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China remains the greatest challenger to the United States and its allies, and that the Biden administration aims to “shape the strategic environment” around the Asian superpower to limit its increasingly aggressive actions. “China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do it,” Mr. Blinken said in a speech laying out the administration’s strategy on China. “Beijing’s vision would move us away from the universal values that have sustained so much of the world’s progress over the past 75 years.” The speech was the first public overview of President Biden’s approach to China, and it is based on a much longer classified strategy that was largely completed last fall. U.S. officials say that decades of direct economic and diplomatic engagement to compel the Chinese Communist Party to abide by American-led rules, agreements and institutions have largely failed, and Mr. Blinken asserted that the goal now should be to form coalitions with other nations to limit the party’s global power and curb its aggressions. “We can’t rely on Beijing to change its trajectory,” he said. “So we will shape the strategic environment around Beijing to advance our vision for an open and inclusive international system.” China’s open alignment with Russia before and during Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine have further clarified for American and European officials the difficulties of engaging with Beijing. On Feb. 4, almost three weeks before the invasion, President Vladimir V. Putin met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing as their two governments issued a 5,000-word statement announcing a “no limits” partnership that aims to oppose the international diplomatic and economic systems overseen by the United States and its allies. Since the war began, the Chinese government has given Russia diplomatic support by reiterating Mr. Putin’s criticisms of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and spreading disinformation and conspiracy theories that undermine the United States and Ukraine. “Beijing’s defense of President Putin’s war to erase Ukraine’s sovereignty and secure a sphere of influence in Europe should raise alarm bells for all of us who call the Indo-Pacific region home,” Mr. Blinken said to an audience at George Washington University. Mr. Blinken emphasized that the United States does not seek to overthrow the Communist Party or subvert China’s political system and that the two nations — nuclear powers with entwined economies — could work together on some issues. However, Chinese officials will almost certainly regard major parts of the speech as the outlines of an effort at containment of China, similar to previous American policy toward the Soviet Union. In private conversations, Chinese officials have expressed concern about the emphasis on regional alliances under Mr. Biden and their potential to hem in China. Mr. Blinken pointed to the creation last year of a security pact, called AUKUS, among Australia, Britain and the United States. The work on coalition building is the opposite of the approach of President Donald J. Trump, who denounced U.S. partners and alliances as part of his “America First” foreign policy. Mr. Blinken’s speech revolved around the slogan for the Biden strategy: “Invest, Align and Compete.” The partnerships fall under the “align” part. “Invest” refers to pouring resources into the United States — administration officials point to the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year as an example. And “compete” refers to the rivalry with China, a framing the Trump administration also promoted. Both administrations emphasized the same core problems in U.S.-China relations: The integration of China’s economy with those of the United States and its allies gives Beijing enormous strategic leverage. And the wealth that China has amassed from trade helps it chip away at American dominance of the global economy and technology as well as military power in the Asia-Pacific region. “Beijing wants to put itself at the center of global innovation and manufacturing, increase other countries’ technological dependence, and then use that dependence to impose its foreign policy preferences,” Mr. Blinken said. “And Beijing is going to great lengths to win this contest — for example, taking advantage of the openness of our economies to spy, to hack, to steal technology and know-how to advance its military innovation and entrench its surveillance state.” Mr. Blinken also said that to meet the challenges Beijing posed, he was creating a “China House” team to coordinate policy across the State Department and work with Congress. Liu Pengyu, a spokesman at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said after the speech that “competition does exist in some areas such as trade, but it should not be used to define the overall picture of China-U.S. relations.” “It is never China’s goal to surpass or replace the U.S. or engage in zero-sum competition with it,” he added. Mr. Blinken also noted the human rights abuses, repression of ethnic minorities and quashing of free speech and assembly by the Communist Party in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. In recent years, those issues have galvanized greater animus toward China among Democratic and Republican politicians and policymakers. “We’ll continue to raise these issues and call for change,” he said. But Mr. Blinken sought to defuse any misunderstandings over Taiwan, the biggest single flashpoint in U.S.-China relations. He reiterated longstanding U.S. policy on Taiwan, despite remarks by Mr. Biden in Tokyo on Monday that the United States has a “commitment” to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if China attacks the self-governing democratic island. The U.S. government for decades has maintained a policy of “strategic ambiguity” on Taiwan — leaving unsaid whether it would use force to protect the island from China — and has opposed Taiwan independence. Mr. Blinken said it was China’s recent actions toward Taiwan — trying to sever the island’s diplomatic and international ties and sending fighter jets over the area — that are “deeply destabilizing.” “While our policy has not changed, what has changed is Beijing’s growing coercion,” he said. Yawei Liu, a political scientist at Emory University and director of the China Research Center in Atlanta, said Mr. Blinken’s words would not reassure Beijing. “I don’t think this is going to satisfy the China side,” he said in a Twitter Spaces conversation after the speech. But Mr. Blinken stressed that despite the rising concerns, the United States was not seeking a new Cold War and would not try to isolate China, the world’s second-largest economy. Mr. Blinken credited China’s growth to the talent and hard work of the Chinese people, as well as the stability of the agreements on global trade and diplomacy created and shaped by the United States in what Washington calls the rules-based international order. “Arguably no country on earth has benefited more from that than China,” he said. “But rather than using its power to reinforce and revitalize the laws, agreements, principles and institutions that enabled its success, so other countries can benefit from them too, Beijing is undermining it.” After China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, which the United States supported, leaders in Beijing carried out far-reaching changes to the nation’s planned economy to open up further to outside trade and investment, helping to transform China from one of the world’s poorest countries into its biggest factory hub, and lifting hundreds of millions of people into the global middle class. But China stopped far short of becoming the free-market democracy that many in the West had hoped, and over the past decade, under Mr. Xi, the Communist Party and Chinese state have exerted an even heavier hand over the private market and individual freedoms. Both Democrats and Republicans now see Chinese trade practices, including the government’s creation of heavily subsidized national champions and its acceptance of intellectual property theft, as one of the biggest factors undercutting American industry. “For too long, Chinese companies have enjoyed far greater access to our markets than our companies have in China,” Mr. Blinken said.” This lack of reciprocity is unacceptable and it’s unsustainable.” The administration introduced a core initiative to shape the economic environment around China — the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework — during Mr. Biden’s visit to Tokyo this week. The United States and 13 Asia-Pacific nations will try to negotiate new industry standards. But skeptics have said Washington’s ability to shape trade in the Asia-Pacific region may be limited because the framework is not a traditional trade agreement that offers countries reductions in tariffs and more access to the lucrative American market — a move that would be politically unpopular in the United States. Mr. Blinken did not highlight Chinese government influence operations and espionage in the United States, which had been a focal point of the Trump administration’s messaging about China. He said he welcomed Chinese exchange students, and that many of them stay — “They help drive innovation here at home, and that benefits all of us.” “We can stay vigilant about our national security without closing our doors,” he said. “Racism and hate have no place in a nation built by generations of immigrants to fulfill the promise of opportunity for all.”",22
2022-05-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/opinion/china-us-russia-strategy.html,Opinion | China Is Not the Biggest Threat to the World Order. It’s Russia.,"In a speech on Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken revealed the long-awaited outlines of the Biden administration’s official posture toward China. Rather than Vladimir Putin’s Russia, Mr. Blinken said, it is China that represents the most potent and determined threat to the American-championed world order. Only China, he continued, has “both the intent to reshape the international order” and the power to do so, he said. The United States will seek to rally coalitions of other nations to meet Beijing’s challenge. The writing had been on the wall. Just days earlier, President Biden pledged to defend Taiwan if China moved to seize the democratically ruled island, he met with regional allies, and his administration proposed a new plan to counter China’s growing economic clout in Asia. But the intensifying fixation on China’s potential to disrupt the world order shrinks space for cooperation with Beijing and distracts from the real threat in the world: Russia. Under Mr. Putin, Russia demolished the Chechen capital, Grozny, in 2000; invaded Georgia in 2008; annexed Crimea in 2014; and used its air force in 2015 and 2016 against opponents of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Putin’s regime has used cyberattacks, brutalized or assassinated domestic opponents and passed laws that impose draconian prison sentences on anyone questioning the state. He launched a brutal invasion of Ukraine and has hinted at possibly using nuclear weapons. He has not just declared his intent to redraw international borders and resurrect the ghost of the former Soviet Union; he has acted on it. Thwarting further Russian misbehavior through trade embargoes, preventing resupply of the country’s military and establishing an international phalanx against Mr. Putin requires global cooperation. That includes China. We need to be cleareyed about China, of course. It is without doubt a more powerful potential adversary than Russia on every metric — military, economic and ideological. The Communist Party, under the firm control of Xi Jinping, pursues a form of state-sponsored capitalism that disadvantages foreign companies in the China market and builds up powerful national champions. The primacy of the party trumps rule of law, and free-speech and political rights are harshly suppressed. China’s appalling treatment of its Uyghur minority and suppression of basic rights in Hong Kong have been rightly condemned. China also spends more on its military than any country besides the United States, which is intended to counter American military pre-eminence in East Asia. Rising nationalism is expressed in the belief that Taiwan must be reunified with mainland China and that the South China Sea is a Chinese lake. But these issues don’t necessarily make China a threat to American prosperity and security, not unless you believe in every antagonistic word coming from Chinese officials, every war plan devised by its military, and the inevitability of “the Thucydides trap” — the notion that emerging powers will tend toward conflict with established ones. Neither does it follow that any country which does not adhere to liberal democratic norms is a budding threat to the United States. The United States has never based its entire foreign policy on human rights, nor should it; that would be a recipe for endless intervention and conflict globally. And grounding policy on what might happen is an equally slippery slope. The Communist Party views the United States as an adversary. But it has been willing to engage diplomatically, has repeatedly championed the inviolability of state borders and is not averse to self-interested compromise over issues like trade and climate change. Its rhetoric over Taiwan has been little more than saber-rattling and appears restrained compared to how the United States has historically treated Latin America. Advocates of a new Cold War with China will surely roll their eyes at these assertions. They will say that China has wriggled out of trade commitments, repeatedly violated agreements on climate, used espionage to steal intellectual property, and is building a military designed to inflict harm on the United States and its allies. But it is logical for an emerging great power like China to make plans for its defense, including potential conflict with the United States. It’s also worth remembering that China is deeply intertwined with the U.S. and global economy. It holds more than a trillion dollars’ worth of American debt in the form of U.S. Treasury securities, benefits from the cumulative effect of U.S. investment in China and needs access to foreign markets. All of these realities shape its behavior just as much as the possibility of a future confrontation with the United States. Russia, by contrast, is constrained only by how far Mr. Putin is willing to go. Rather than cast China as our next great enemy, American security would be better served by the realization that Russia’s behavior only highlights the ways that China and the United States remain bound to each other despite their tensions. We should nurture rather than endanger these ties, which are crucial for both countries to remain prosperous, stable and secure. We should also not allow our dislike of China’s domestic system to be the basis of how we engage a country whose centrality to the global system is second only to ours. It’s rarely wise to take on two adversaries at once. Mr. Biden should find new ways to work with China, rather than trying to coerce it to be different. He should take bold steps to tone down the rhetoric, such as lifting Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods in return for Beijing’s reduced support for Putin. Otherwise, he will miss an opportunity to be a savvy, strategic president rather than one who fights with China at every turn.

2022-05-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/opinion/letters/whites-replacement-theory.html,Opinion | White People Fearful of Being ‘Replaced’,"To the Editor: We are approaching the demographic point where white people will be a minority in the U.S. That demographic trend will have enormous political and economic consequences. It will be hard to stack the deck in your favor when you are outvoted. There is a significant subset of white Americans who cannot accept the prospect of reduced status. This does not mean that they will be disadvantaged. It means that they will no longer enjoy the unfair advantage of white privilege. These people are increasingly panicking and relying on antisocial activities such as voter suppression, sedition and violence. It will only get worse for the foreseeable future. Make no mistake — they will try to do whatever it takes to stave off their inevitable reduced political status. And let’s be honest. These people draw their support exclusively from the Republican Party and its enablers in the media and right-wing organizations. Forewarned is forearmed. Orin HollanderJamison, Pa. To the Editor: Re “Buffalo Was Not Random Violence” (editorial, May 17): You write, “The Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a leading purveyor of replacement theory rhetoric, has promoted the idea that elites are seeking to replace white Americans on more than 400 episodes of his program, according to an analysis by The New York Times.” Although Tucker Carlson, Fox News and other right-wing media outlets are purveyors of hate, let’s go beyond blaming the messenger. Without corporate advertisers, they couldn’t survive. Several prominent corporations that advertise on Fox were asked if they would continue advertising, and they refused to answer. When will corporations stand up to hateful speech? I challenge all decent Fox News advertisers to do the right thing and cancel their contracts unless Fox stops spewing hate. Until Fox News and Tucker Carlson are hit in their pocketbooks, nothing will change. Kenneth OlshanskyGlen Allen, Va. To the Editor: I would encourage Tucker Carlson at Fox News to invite a dozen or so chiefs from what remain of our Native American tribes to discuss what they think about the “great replacement” in America. Robert C. VogtAnn Arbor, Mich. To the Editor: Re “Weaponizing America Against Itself,” by Bret Stephens (column, May 18): Mr. Stephens continues to be the most reasonable conservative around. I love his choice of changing “replacement” to “renewal.” I would even add revitalization. It’s too bad that most Republicans don’t feel that way. Many whites feel inordinately entitled and feel threatened by nonwhites. Republican leaders need to step up to the task of calling out their constituents and colleagues on “replacement theory.” Call it what it is: racism, antisemitism, prejudice, ignorance. Linda SlezakHampton Bays, N.Y. To the Editor: On a recent newscast a talking head made this profound statement, “The one thing America makes best is more Americans.” In New York City that is a fact that stares us in the face every day. No matter where folks come from, their kids inevitably become American. They wear the same clothes, listen to the same music, buy the same goods and acquire the same values as every other American kid. This is something the anti-immigrant crowd is blind to. They fear that immigrants will somehow overwhelm the country when, in fact, the opposite is true — it is America that claims them for herself. Stuart MathNew York To the Editor: The proof that liberal elites do not want to replace whites with nonwhites is that progressives are pro-choice on abortion. The abortion rates for Black women are several times higher than for whites. Minorities are far more likely to vote for Democrats. For decades, abortions have disproportionately deprived the Democratic Party of millions of potential Black voters. If liberal elites really wanted to advance the “great replacement theory” and replace white voters with Black ones, they would have never been pro-choice. Frank RichterClawson, Mich. To the Editor: Re “McConnell Cites Ukraine Aid as Evidence of a Shifting G.O.P.” (news article, May 21): You report that Senator Mitch McConnell is trying, by his support of Ukraine, to show the world that Trumpism hasn’t taken over the Republican Party. His support is, of course, welcome. But after four years in which he silently watched Trumpism take over the party and enabled Donald Trump and his right-wing acolytes as they corrupted the government, including the judiciary, and made hatred and lies the currency of our political discourse, and after he refused to convict an obviously guilty president, it is hard to believe that some great awakening has taken place in Senator McConnell’s philosophy. John T. DillonWest Caldwell, N.J. To the Editor: Let’s give Mitch McConnell credit for holding together the bipartisan coalition to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression. He is a master politician, as L.B.J. was, when it comes to Congress and is perhaps our best hope for returning the Republican Party to its former self working to restore bipartisan democratic values. He knows what an insurrection is, and I hope he will work to restore the law of the land and prosecute those responsible. America is at the brink, and we need to all come together.

2022-06-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/02/us/politics/biden-saudi-arabia.html,"Biden to Travel to Saudi Arabia, Ending Its ‘Pariah’ Status","WASHINGTON — President Biden, who as a candidate vowed to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” in response to the assassination of a prominent dissident, has decided to travel to Riyadh this month to rebuild relations with the oil-rich kingdom at a time when he is seeking to lower gas prices at home and isolate Russia abroad. While the timing was still being discussed, Mr. Biden planned to add the visit to a previously scheduled trip to Europe and Israel, administration officials said, asking for anonymity because the trip had not been formally announced. During his stop in Riyadh, the president will meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was deemed responsible for the dismemberment of the dissident, the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr. Biden will also meet with the leaders of other Arab nations, including Egypt, Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. The visit represents the triumph of realpolitik over moral outrage, according to foreign policy experts. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Biden has found it necessary to court other energy producers to replace oil from Moscow and stabilize world markets. The group of oil-producing nations called OPEC Plus, led by Saudi Arabia, announced on Thursday that it would increase production modestly in July and August. American officials expect the group to do more in the fall, but it may not be enough to bring down prices at the pump before November’s congressional elections. The Biden administration had already been stepping up cooperation with Saudi Arabia on a variety of issues even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled world energy markets, particularly in seeking an end to the eight-year-old Saudi-led war in neighboring Yemen. A two-month-old truce was extended on Thursday, and Mr. Biden praised Saudi leaders for their role. “Saudi Arabia demonstrated courageous leadership by taking initiatives early on to endorse and implement terms of the U.N.-led truce,” he said in a statement. The diplomacy and the president’s trip signify an effort to repair the rupture in relations stemming from the 2018 death of Mr. Khashoggi. American intelligence concluded that Prince Mohammed, the de facto leader of the kingdom, ordered the hit team that killed and dismembered Mr. Khashoggi at a consulate in Istanbul. While President Donald J. Trump remained close with the Saudis, Mr. Biden promised to take a different tack if elected to the White House. He said that he would make the Saudis “pay the price, and make them in fact the pariah that they are,” while saying that there was “very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia.” After taking office, Mr. Biden released the intelligence report on Mr. Khashoggi’s murder as a statement of accountability and imposed sanctions on some of those involved in the killing. But he took no action against Prince Mohammed, drawing a limit to how far he was willing to break with Riyadh. The administration argues that it ended the Trump team’s policy of blank checks for Riyadh but was not willing to end America’s nearly eight-decade-old friendship with Saudi Arabia, which has been an important ally on a variety of fronts. “Saudi Arabia is a critical partner to us in dealing with extremism in the region, in dealing with the challenges posed by Iran, and also I hope in continuing the process of building relationships between Israel and its neighbors both near and further away through the continuation, the expansion of the Abraham Accords,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Wednesday at an event marking the 100th anniversary of Foreign Affairs magazine. He said human rights are still important but “we are addressing the totality of our interests in that relationship.” The Abraham Accords, sealed under the auspices of Mr. Trump, established normal diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. But Saudi Arabia remains the elusive target, one that would go a long way toward validating Israel’s status in the region if it were to formally recognize the Jewish state. Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud, the Saudi foreign minister, sounded optimistic recently about eventually joining the accords but maintained that progress had to be made first on resolving Israel’s long-running conflict with the Palestinians. “We always envisioned that there will be full normalization with Israel, and I’ve said before that a full normalization between us and Israel, between the region and Israel, will bring immense benefits,” he said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We won’t be able to reap those benefits unless we address the issue of Palestine.” Mr. Biden was already prepared to end the isolation of Prince Mohammed as far back as October when he expected to encounter the Saudi leader at a meeting of the Group of 20 leaders and most likely would have shaken hands. But the prince did not attend. The newly planned stop in Riyadh, previously reported by David Ignatius, a columnist for The Post, produced quick criticism from human rights groups. They denounced any diplomatic rehabilitation of Prince Mohammed. “Right now, Biden is buffeted by intersecting crises, and certain human rights priorities are suffering as a result,” said Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive of PEN America, a group that defends free expression around the world. “The harder it gets to put human rights above politics, the more consequential it is for the world to witness a leader willing to do so.” An advocacy group called 9/11 Families United, representing relatives of victims from the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, sent the president a letter on Thursday urging him to press Saudi leaders on ties with the hijackers. Mr. Biden last year ordered the declassification of documents from the Sept. 11 investigation into Saudi involvement. “No reset of our nation’s relationship with Saudi Arabia can or should be possible without proper reconciliation for the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001,” the group said in the letter. The two countries have been trading envoys in recent months. Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, was in Saudi Arabia last week to discuss the presidential visit and other issues. Khalid bin Salman, the deputy defense minister and a brother of the crown prince, visited Washington last month and met with Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser. While Mr. Biden was already moving to recalibrate relations with Saudi Arabia, the imperative became more pronounced with Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Russia and Saudi Arabia are close to tied as the world’s second-largest oil producers, meaning that as Biden administration officials sought to cut off one, they concluded they could not afford to be at odds with the other. The administration was pleased that Saudi Arabia joined an American-backed United Nations resolution condemning Russia in March and that more recently Riyadh sent a message pressing Moscow to release food exports blockaded at the Ukrainian port of Odesa. The Saudis remain embittered by the Biden presidency, however. In addition to releasing the Khashoggi report and the Sept. 11 documents, the Biden administration removed the terrorism designation of Yemen’s Houthi rebels, reversing a Trump-era policy valued by the Saudis. Riyadh has also bristled at Mr. Biden’s focus on accelerating the shift away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, a process that would undermine its business model. And looming in the background has been the administration’s push to revive the Iran nuclear deal, which the Saudis fear could empower their regional nemesis. In an interview last month with Arab News, a Saudi news outlet, Prince Turki al-Faisal, a senior member of the royal family and son of a former king, laid out a number of the kingdom’s grievances against their most important ally, saying that the Saudis felt “let down” by the United States. In addition to the Houthi terrorist designation and Mr. Biden’s failure to meet so far with Prince Mohammed, he cited the removal of American missile batteries from the kingdom at a time when it was being targeted by missiles from Yemen. “It is not just one thing,” Prince Turki said. “I think it’s the general tone of the atmosphere.” The increased oil production announced by Saudi Arabia and the other energy states on Thursday may not have a major impact on the price at the pump at home. But administration officials anticipate further increases in production come September, enough to have market impact. Some experts are skeptical. Bruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution scholar and the author of “Kings and Presidents,” about Saudi-American relations, said the president’s visit may bolster the tenuous truce in Yemen, which by itself would be an important priority. “That could help save thousands of lives, especially children in Yemen,” he said. “But the American people are looking at gas prices, not Yemen. The Saudis are unlikely to do anything significant on the price front, nor is it clear that they could do enough to really reduce prices. Biden appears likely to not deliver what voters want — low gas prices at the pump.” Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Ben Hubbard from Amman, Jordan.",8
2022-06-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/world/europe/ukraine-russia-rename-streets.html,Ukrainian Officials Move to Rechristen Landmarks With Russian Names,"Far from Ukraine’s embattled eastern front, a new struggle is being waged — not from the trenches, but over leafy side streets and broad avenues. That is where the enemy goes by the name Pavlov. Or Tchaikovsky. Or Catherine the Great. Across Ukraine, officials are starting projects to, as they say, “decolonize” their cities. Streets and subway stops whose names evoke the history of the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union are under scrutiny by a population eager to rid itself of traces of the nation that invaded in late February. “We are defending our country, also on the cultural front lines,” said Andriy Moskalenko, the deputy mayor of Lviv and the head of a committee that has reviewed the names of each of the city’s more than 1,000 streets. “And we don’t want to have anything in common with the killers.” Ukraine is far from the first country to undertake such a historical accounting — the United States has wrestled for decades with the renaming of Civil War-era monuments. Nor is it even the first time Ukraine has undertaken such an effort: After the fall of the Soviet Union, it was one of many Eastern European countries that renamed streets and removed statues commemorating an era of Communist rule that became synonymous with totalitarianism. This time, the decision to erase Russian names is not just a symbol of defiance toward the invasion and Soviet history, said Vasyl Kmet, a historian at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. It is also about reasserting a Ukrainian identity that many feel has been repressed under centuries of domination by its more powerful neighbor, he said. “The concept of decolonization is a little broader,” Mr. Kmet said. “Russian politics today is built on the propaganda of the so-called Russky mir — the Russian-speaking world. This is about creating a powerful alternative, a modern Ukrainian national discourse.” The western city of Lviv is one of many areas undertaking “decolonization” campaigns. So, too, is the northwestern city of Lutsk, which plans to rename over 100 streets. In the southern port city of Odesa, whose inhabitants are mostly Russian-speaking, politicians are debating whether to remove a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in 1794. In Kyiv, the capital, the City Council is looking into renaming the Leo Tolstoy subway stop after Vasyl Stus, a Ukrainian poet and dissident. The “Minsk” stop — named after the capital of Belarus, which has stood by Moscow during the invasion — may soon be rechristened as “Warsaw,” honoring Poland’s support for Ukraine. And it’s not only Russian names that are under scrutiny. The Lviv committee also plans to delete street names in tribute to some Ukrainians. One is named after the writer Petro Kozlaniuk, who collaborated with Soviet security agencies, including the K.G.B. Removing the names of some cultural icons — which the Lviv committee said it did after consulting with academics from the relevant fields — has proved more divisive. The history of figures like Pyotr Tchaikovsky can be tricky: The classical composer’s family roots were in modern-day Ukraine, and some musicologists say his works were inspired by Ukrainian folk music. A few miles from Lviv, Viktor Melnychuk owns a sign-making factory gearing up to make new plaques and posts for renamed streets. Although he acknowledges that he has a business interest in each change, he is ambivalent about some of the new names. “Maybe we should keep some classic writers or poets if they are from other periods. I’m not sure,” he said. “We can’t reject everything completely. There was some good there.” But he planned to stand by the committee’s decisions. And its ruling was unanimous: Tchaikovsky would go. “When we rename a street, it doesn’t mean we are saying: ‘This person didn’t make this invention, or was not important,’” said Mr. Moskalenko, the deputy mayor of Lviv. “It means this person’s work has been used as a tool of colonization.” Mr. Kmet, the historian, saw an opportunity to honor the contributions of some Ukrainians whose contributions have been lost to history. He is hoping to name one street in Lviv after an obscure librarian, Fedir Maksymenko, who he said secretly safeguarded Ukrainian culture and books during the Soviet era. “I and Ukrainian culture owe a lot to him,” he said. “We must work very hard today to preserve what he saved.”",29
2022-06-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/09/opinion/russia-america-culture-putin.html,Opinion | Russia and America Are Parting Ways,"The war in Ukraine is a never-ending catastrophe. Russian forces, concentrated in the east, continue to inflict terrible damage on Ukrainian soldiers and civilians alike. Countless lives have been lost and upended. Once again, the world must confront the possibility of nuclear war and grapple with a compounding refugee and cost of living crisis. This isn’t the “end of history” that we hoped for. Less violently, another transformation is taking place: After three decades of exchange, interaction and engagement, the door between Russia and America is slamming shut. Practically every day another American company — including the most symbolic of them all, McDonald’s, whose golden arches heralded a new era 30 years ago — pulls out of Russia. Diplomats have been expelled, concerts canceled, products withdrawn, personal visits called off. In the shuttered consulates, nobody is issuing visas, and even if they were, American airspace is now closed to Russian aircraft. The only substantive interaction left seems to be the issuing of sanctions and counter-sanctions. For a Russian American like me, whose life has been forged in the interstices between the two cultures, it’s a bewildering, sorrowful turn of events. Measures to curtail the Kremlin’s capacity of aggression are, to be clear, politically and morally necessary. But the collateral damage is a severing of ties that is bound to revive harmful stereotypes and close down the space for cross-cultural pollination. More profoundly, the current parting of ways marks the definitive end of a period when Russia’s integration with the West, however vexed, appeared possible — and the antagonism between ideological superpowers was a thing of the past. That’s certainly how it felt on a warm March day in 1989 in Krasnodar, the provincial southern town near the Black Sea where I grew up. My school was hosting a group of seniors from a high school in New Hampshire: I was about to turn 17, and until that day America existed in my mind only as an abstract concept. It was the villain of a New Year’s holiday show, the object of Nikita Khrushchev’s quest “To catch up and overtake America” and home to the “Star Wars” program — just one, we were told, of the imperialists’ many designs to take down the Soviet Union. Only those boys and girls in jeans and sweatshirts who appeared in our schoolyard didn’t look like imperialists, or appear to be threatening at all. They looked like better-dressed versions of us: shy, well-meaning and fascinated. Just a few hours ago, during our military training class, we had been assembling Kalashnikov guns to be used on enemy agents. And here they were, standing in front of us. We stared at each other. Then someone smiled, someone said hello. In a matter of minutes, the wariness between us was gone. “I’m reading ‘Crime and Punishment’ for spring break,’” a tall guy with a silver earring told me. “Raskolnikov is cool!” Over the next five days of mutual discovery, we learned that the Americans were also afraid of nuclear war, only in their version, it would be waged by us. That when transcribed, the lyrics of “Ice Ice Baby” didn’t make much sense. That “pot” had a meaning other than a kitchen item, as explained by the Raskolnikov fan. And that when a boy tells a girl that she’s “special,” that’s, well, special. Together we roamed the streets, snapping photos next to Lenin statues — or rather, as the Americans put it, we “hung out.” Before a tearful goodbye, we traded addresses and promised to be friends for life. I’ve kept a green notebook filled with the names of American towns, along with a love letter, a dried carnation and a stack of black and white photographs, tokens of the magic of 1989: the Berlin Wall dismantled, the Iron Curtain coming down, the scary “us” and “them” disappearing into the finally free air. Chanting “Goodbye America, where I have never been,” a popular anthem, we were bidding farewell to America the enemy, America the myth — and anticipating the discovery of the real thing. Words like “borders” and “ideology” were no longer relevant. America and Russia seemed to be united by a common yearning for peace. The years that followed generated immense good will between our nations. As a Russian in America, I met countless people who built it: a Californian doctor who helped set up children’s heart surgery centers across post-Soviet Russia; a Bay Area filmmaker who organized the first Jewish film festival in Moscow; a Seattle captain who set up joint maritime ventures with fishermen in Russia’s far east. Russian college graduates, meanwhile, flocked to America, giving their brains and talents to everything from Hollywood films to DNA sequencing. There were a lot of marriages. A popular Russian all-female band captured the spirit in the 1990s when they implored, to electric balalaika chords, a hypothetical “American Boy” to come and whisk them away. That happened to be my route. Having married into a family of former dissidents sheltered by America, I too was a testament to the flow of people and ideas. Money flowed also. My first paid job in America back in 1998, for example, was translating for the second annual U.S.-Russian Investment Symposium, hosted by Harvard University and featuring an all-star lineup of international bankers vying for the attention of the Russian guests, among them the tycoon Boris Berezovsky and the mayor of Moscow at the time, Yuri Luzhkov. Yet somewhere along the way, the good will slowed. After expressing enthusiasm for Russia’s first post-Soviet president, Boris Yeltsin, America’s leaders found his K.G.B.-fashioned successor, Vladimir Putin, less to their taste. Mr. Putin made it clear that he didn’t care. “American hegemon,” a phrase from my Soviet childhood, began popping up in Russia’s pro-Kremlin media. In the West, Russians were no longer viewed as liberated hostages of a totalitarian regime, reformed villains from James Bond movies or emissaries of the great culture of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, but rather as all-cash buyers of luxurious properties in Manhattan and Miami. The enchantment between the countries and their citizens dimmed, yet shared interests and social bonds held. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a turning point. True, Mr. Putin had previously given vent to his aggression in Georgia and, devastatingly, in Chechnya, but it was his claiming of Ukrainian territory that gave the West its wake-up call. The sanctions that followed hit the Russian economy hard. They also supplied the Kremlin with ample means to stoke anti-American sentiment. Blaming America for the country’s troubles was a familiar, almost nostalgic narrative for Russians, more than half of whom were born in the Soviet Union. The simple tune — “NATO expansion,” “Western aggression,” “enemy at the gate”— played on repeat, keying Russians to believe that America aimed for their motherland’s destruction. The propaganda worked: By 2018, America was once more regarded as Russia’s No. 1 enemy, with Ukraine, its “puppet,” coming second. In America, things weren’t nearly as bad. But Donald Trump’s arrival on the global political stage complicated the already strained Russian-American relationship. Mr. Trump cozied up to the openly authoritarian Mr. Putin, strengthening anti-Russian sentiment that had been rising since the Kremlin’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and rarely distinguished between Mr. Putin and the country he ruled. Economic and cultural ties began to wilt as it got harder to secure visas and funding. Still, student exchanges happened, films were screened and family visits paid, if at longer intervals. The Russian missiles that struck Ukrainian cities on Feb. 24 extinguished that flickering light. America now provides billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to be used against Russia, while Russia’s stated aim is to put an end to America’s “unfettered” global domination. The two countries, once allies in the war against Nazi Germany, are effectively fighting a proxy war. As I watch videos of Russian parents egging on their children to destroy iPhones or read about threats against a venerable Seattle bakery known for its Russian-style baked goods, I’m gripped, above all, by sadness. Our post-totalitarian dream of a peaceful, friendly future is over. Apart from wreaking physical horror, Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine is erasing countless intangibles, among them the collective good will of the West toward Russia. In my children’s future, I see no cultural miracles akin to the one that I experienced back in 1989. This is a loss for both countries, and Russia’s will be greater if Mr. Putin continues doubling down on carnage and isolation. That future isn’t set in stone. After all, the perestroika years, when the Soviet Union embarked on wholesale reforms in the name of openness, showed that Russia is capable of change. For now, though, each explosion in Ukraine also strikes at what was good in the relationship between America and Russia. In Mr. Putin’s land, “Goodbye America,” once a tongue-in-cheek song suffused with hope, has become a darkly self-fulfilling prophecy.

2022-06-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/11/us/politics/russia-biden-sanctions.html,Biden Races to Expand Coalition Against Russia but Meets Resistance,"WASHINGTON — Even before the start of the war in Ukraine, an international alliance to rally the world against a Russian invasion came together so quickly that President Biden later marveled at the “purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.” Now, with the conflict in its fourth month, U.S. officials are facing the disappointing reality that the powerful coalition of nations — stretching from North America across Europe and into East Asia — may not be enough to break the looming stalemate in Ukraine. With growing urgency, the Biden administration is trying to coax or cajole countries perceived by Washington as neutral in the conflict — including India, Brazil, Israel and the Gulf Arab states — to join the campaign of economic sanctions, military support and diplomatic pressure to further isolate Russia and bring a decisive end to the war. So far, few if any of them have been willing, despite their partnerships with the United States on other major security matters. Mr. Biden is making an extraordinary diplomatic and political gamble this summer in planning to visit Saudi Arabia, which he had called a “pariah.” And on Thursday, he met with President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles. Mr. Bolsonaro visited Moscow the week before Russia invaded Ukraine and declared “solidarity” with President Vladimir V. Putin. In Los Angeles, Mr. Bolsonaro pre-empted any push by Mr. Biden on Russia, saying that while Brazil remained open to helping end the war, “given our reliance on certain foreign players, we have to be cautious.” “I have a country to manage,” he said. U.S. officials acknowledge the difficulties in trying to convince countries that they can balance their own interests with the American and European drive to isolate Russia. “One of the biggest problems that we are facing today is the fence-sitter problem,” Samantha Power, the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said on Tuesday after giving a speech about the administration’s efforts to reinforce free speech, fair elections and other democratic systems against authoritarian leaders worldwide. She said she was hopeful that Russian atrocities committed in Ukraine would persuade neutral states to join the coalition against Moscow, “given our collective interest in rules of the road that all of us would wish to see observed, and none of us would wish to see used against our citizens.” Russia and its partners, notably China, have denounced the U.S. government’s efforts to expand the coalition, which in addition to European nations also includes Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. “In the modern world, it is impossible to isolate a country, especially such a huge one as Russia,” Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Thursday, according to state media. In Beijing, Zhao Lijian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said on Monday that the United States “forced countries to take sides in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and wantonly threatened to impose unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction.” He added: “Isn’t this coercive diplomacy?” Russia’s currency, the ruble, cratered shortly after Mr. Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in February. But it has since bounced back as Russia continues earning hard currency from exporting energy and other goods to many nations, including China, India, Brazil, Venezuela and Thailand. For some countries, the decision of whether to align with the United States can have life-or-death consequences. Washington has warned drought-stricken African nations not to buy grain that Russia stole from Ukraine at a time when food prices are rising and possibly millions of people are starving. “Key strategic middle powers such as India, Brazil and South Africa are consequently treading a very sharp line in an attempt to preserve their strategic autonomy and cannot be expected to simply sidle up to the U.S.,” said Michael John Williams, a professor of international relations at Syracuse University and a former adviser to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. “Washington believes this war will be won in the West,” Mr. Williams said, “but the Kremlin believes it will be won in the East and the Global South.” In a vote in March on a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s aggressions against Ukraine, 35 countries abstained, mostly from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. That alarmed American officials and their allies, who nonetheless noted that 141 of 193 states censured Russia. Only five states — including Russia — voted against the measure. Brazil voted to condemn Russia, and Mr. Bolsonaro has pressed for negotiations to end the war. But his country continues to import fertilizer from Russia and Belarus, an ally of Moscow. India and South Africa both abstained from the U.N. vote. India has a decades-long strategic partnership with Russia and relies on it for oil, fertilizer and military equipment. The Biden administration has had little luck getting India to join its coalition. Indian officials say their Russian imports are modest. During a visit to Washington in April, India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, dismissed questions on the subject, saying that “probably our total purchases for the month would be less than what Europe does in an afternoon.” “So you might want to think about that,” he said. But Europe is now slashing its energy imports, in a partial embargo of Russian oil, while India is reportedly in talks with Moscow to further increase its already growing purchases of crude oil. South Africa’s ties to Russia go back to the Cold War, when the Soviet Union supported the anti-apartheid movement that transformed the nation’s internal power dynamics. Trade between the two countries is modest, but South Africa, like many other nations, has long been suspicious of Western colonialism and the United States as an unrivaled superpower. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa has accused NATO of provoking Russia into war and has called for renewed diplomatic talks. In a phone call in April, Mr. Biden urged him to accept “a clear, unified international response to Russian aggression in Ukraine,” according to a White House statement. A month later, Mr. Ramaphosa lamented the impact that the conflict was having on “bystander” countries that he said “are also going to suffer from the sanctions that have been imposed against Russia.” Brazil, India and South Africa — along with Russia and China — are members of a group of nations that account for one-third of the global economy. At an online meeting of the group’s foreign ministers last month, Moscow offered to set up oil and gas refineries with its fellow partners. The group also discussed expanding its membership to other countries. Other nations that abstained from the United Nations vote, including Uganda, Pakistan and Vietnam, have accused the U.S.-led coalition against Russia of shutting down any chance of peace talks with its military support of Ukraine. U.S. and European officials maintain that the weapons and intelligence it has provided serves only to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia’s military. The growing urgency in the Biden administration is embodied in the president’s plans to visit Saudi Arabia, despite his earlier denunciations of its murderous actions and potential war crimes. Mr. Biden’s effort, which is already being criticized by leading Democrats, is partly aimed at getting Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help on the margins with Ukraine. One goal is to have those nations coordinate a substantial increase in oil production to help bring down global prices while the United States, Europe and others boycott Russian oil. U.S. officials have been disappointed by the proclaimed neutrality of the two Gulf Arab nations, which buy American weapons and lobby Washington for policies against Iran, their main rival. Israel, which also buys American weapons and is the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, has expressed solidarity with Ukraine. At the same time, however, it has resisted supporting some sanctions and direct criticism of Russia. Until Mr. Biden offered to meet with him in Los Angeles, Mr. Bolsonaro had signaled he would not go to the summit of most of the hemisphere’s heads of state. It took a direct appeal by former Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, a special adviser to the summit, to convince Brazil to attend. Valentina Sader, a Brazil expert at the Atlantic Council, said the Biden administration was expected to continue talking to Mr. Bolsonaro about Brazil’s ties with Russia and China. But, she said, it was unlikely that Mr. Bolsonaro would edge away from Mr. Putin. “Brazil is taking its own interests into account,” Ms. Sader said. American officials have come to the same conclusion about China, which is Russia’s most powerful strategic partner. They say China has clearly chosen to stand with Russia — as evidenced by the constant reiteration by Chinese officials of Mr. Putin’s criticisms of the United States and NATO and their spreading of disinformation and conspiracy theories that undermine the United States and Ukraine. On Feb. 4, three weeks before Russia began its full-scale invasion, Mr. Putin and President Xi Jinping of China met in Beijing while the two governments declared a “no limits” partnership. In late May, China and Russia held their first joint military exercise since the war in Ukraine began — flying strategic bombers over the seas of northeast Asia while Mr. Biden was visiting Japan. But China has also held back from giving economic or military aid to Russia, despite requests from Moscow, U.S. officials say. Mr. Biden warned Mr. Xi in a video call in March that there would be “consequences” if China gave material aid to Russia, and Chinese officials and business executives fear that their companies could be hit with sanctions if the firms give Russia substantial support. “Secondary sanctions do bite, and China doesn’t want this to affect their companies,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who was recently based in Moscow. “Many Russian sources tell me they talk to the Chinese and are not hearing anything back.” Michael Crowley contributed reporting.",22
2022-06-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia-detainment.html,Moscow Court Orders Brittney Griner Held in Jail for Another 18 Days,"A Russian court on Tuesday extended the pretrial detention of the W.N.B.A. basketball star Brittney Griner on drug smuggling charges until July 2, pushing her jail stint past the four month mark, according to the official state news agency TASS. The Khimki Court of the Moscow region granted the 18-day extension at the request of investigators, the agency quoted the court’s press service as saying. It is typical of Russian courts to extend detention repeatedly until trial. Ms. Griner’s lawyer, Aleksandr Boikov, could not immediately be reached for comment. The American basketball star was arrested four months ago after Russian officials said they found vape cartridges bearing traces of hash oil in her luggage while she was passing through Sheremetyevo Airport, Moscow’s main international airport. The charge carries a jail sentence of up to 10 years. Ms. Griner was arrested on Feb. 17, one week before Russia invaded Ukraine, but officials did not reveal that she had been detained until days after the war began, raising fears that she might be used as a bargaining chip in the overall crisis. There has been some speculation that once convicted, Ms. Griner might be part of a prisoner exchange with the United States. A two-time Olympic gold medalist, Ms. Griner plays for the Phoenix Mercury, and U.S. officials met with the team on Monday to discuss efforts to secure her release. In May, the State Department said it determined that Ms. Griner had been “wrongfully detained.” When she was taken into custody, Ms. Griner was returning to Russia to play for UMMC Ekaterinburg, a professional women’s basketball team. Many W.N.B.A. players supplement their incomes in the league’s off-season by playing internationally.",7
2022-06-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/world/europe/putin-xi-china-russia.html,"In Call With Putin, China’s Xi Offers Closer Cooperation with Russia","China’s president, Xi Jinping, offered to deepen cooperation with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, in a phone call on Wednesday, signaling that Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine had not dented Mr. Xi’s basic commitment to their partnership. The two leaders’ call appeared to be their first since late February, soon after Russia launched its full assault on Ukraine. In the months since, the Chinese government has sought to preserve ties with Moscow while maintaining that it was trying to be an impartial broker for peace in Ukraine. But the summary of the conversation between Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry left little doubt that — whatever his misgivings about the invasion of Ukraine — Mr. Xi remains committed to close ties with Russia, which help to offset rising antagonism with the United States and its allies. “Throughout this year, Chinese-Russian relations have maintained a healthy momentum of development in the face of global turbulence and change,” Mr. Xi told Mr. Putin, according to the Chinese summary. “China is willing to promote the steady advancement of practical bilateral cooperation,” Mr. Xi said. “China is willing to continue maintaining mutual support on major issues of mutual concern involving sovereignty, security and other core interests, building closer bilateral strategic cooperation.” Keeping with China’s official practice since Russia launched its attack, Mr. Xi did not refer to “war” or “invasion” regarding Ukraine, and instead referred only obliquely to the “Ukraine issue.” He told Mr. Putin that China would make its own judgments on that issue, and urged all sides to reach “an appropriate resolution of the Ukrainian crisis.” Chinese leaders have courted their Russian counterparts for decades, and Mr. Xi redoubled those efforts. When he hosted Mr. Putin in early February, the two leaders declared their commitment to a friendship with “no limits,” even while Washington and European governments were warning that Russia appeared to be readying to attack Ukraine. Last week, China and Russia opened a bridge linking Heihe, a border city in northeast China, to the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk. Chinese officials and state-run media have blamed Washington and NATO for creating the conditions for war in Ukraine, arguing that Russia was goaded by NATO’s post-Cold War expansion in Central and Eastern Europe. The official Chinese summary of Mr. Xi’s call with Mr. Putin did not mention that issue. A NATO summit at the end of this month is poised to approve a new “strategic concept” that will upgrade vigilance against Russia and also mention potential challenges to the alliance from China for the first time.",22
2022-06-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/opinion/proper-speech.html,Opinion | Sometimes ‘Proper’ Speech Isn’t Correct Speech,"My eldest daughter is in elementary school, and I recently started noticing that she was regularly enunciating “going to” and “want to,” no longer saying “gonna” or “wanna,” as many people do in casual speech. I’d say that most of us, on the fly, are more likely to ask, “What time is it gonna be?” than “What time is it going to be?” So, I decided to gently ask her about this, and she said her teachers had told her that “gonna” and “wanna” are not in the dictionary and one should instead say “going to” and “want to.” I’m gonna diverge from this guidance. First, though, I should note that her teachers are excellent. A week barely goes by that I don’t see, on the school’s website, or hear, directly from my daughter, about something they’ve done that shows them to be sterling instructors. They’ve also very recently gone through having to manage teaching small people under pandemic conditions, and I heartily salute them for grappling with that at a level I’m sure I would never have reached if put in their shoes. From my vantage point as a college teacher, their job seems harder than mine. Yet I still think the “gonna”/“wanna” issue merits unpacking. To start, “gonna” and “wanna” are in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, with the part of speech for both given as a “pronunciation spelling.” Another way to describe these words is as contractions. They’re not the kind where an apostrophe welds two words together, such as “needn’t” and “shan’t,” but the general notion of combining two words into one is the same. Perhaps there’s a prescribed pedagogical practice to instruct children to speak without those contractions. Or a philosophical sense that to speak properly is to enunciate the phrase “going to” instead of saying “gonna.” But if it’s anything like that notion, it is unsuitably broad. Possibly my daughter heard the teachers as referring to all speech when they meant something more specific. But overall, the nut here is how foggily we tend to process that being human entails using a language in two ways — formal and informal — that have differences in vocabulary and grammar. Linguistics as a science includes a subfield called sociolinguistics, and being trained in it includes the understanding that people speak differently in different contexts. Making that point initially struck me as hammering on something rather obvious. However, I’ve realized that it can be hard for people to quite get past an idea that written language, in its permanence and formality, is the real thing, while casual speech can be seen as a mere approximation, full of messy floutings of rules. It makes sense to tell students to avoid contractions such as “gonna” and “wanna” in formal language, since there’s a long tradition in English of doing so and traditions die hard. But there’s also a tradition of using contractions that, similarly, dies hard. Contractions are a natural consequence of uttering words close together repeatedly over eons of time. Contractions are eternal: As I noted in my book “Nine Nasty Words,” in Middle English, before “gonna” and “wanna” existed, “I do not have” was “Ic ne haebbe,” and the way it often came out was “Ic nabbe,” as if today we said, “I nave.” “I don’t want” was “Ic ne wille,” sometimes shortened to “Ic nille,” later begetting the term “willy-nilly.” Contractions are cross-linguistically normal: There’s a Ukrainian folk song titled “Ty Zh Mene Pidmanula,” where the word-for-word is “you but me deceived” but really translates as “but you deceived me.” In the song, the “ty zh” is pronounced as a single word, “tyzh,” typical of colloquial Ukrainian. (Thank you, sweetie.) Contractions don’t impede clarity: The word “don’t” in the preceding phrase is clearly a combination of “do” and “not.” Everyone reading this understands that. Avoiding contractions in formal language is more a stylistic rule than a necessary one. Why, then, shouldn’t we let contractions play in casual speech, which we engage in much more, using language intuitively, comfortable in the persuasiveness of our informality? Indeed, I hear the school’s teachers speaking casually from time to time, and I can attest that they routinely say “gonna” and “wanna” — as they should! I suggested to my daughter that she reconsider following this particular advice given by her teachers, at least when she isn’t around them. But I also recognize that the fact that she learned the lesson so well may be evidence of just how effective her teachers are. Before she and I talked about it, I hadn’t heard a “gonna” or “wanna” from her in months. Perhaps being the child of a persnickety dad who crosses his ankles when he sits in an armchair had something to do with her receptivity to the idea? We may never know, but I’m worried that other kids might sense it as an affectation, a kind of precocious fuddy-duddyism. I want her to speak well, of course, but to be able to do that both formally and informally. And in a way, speaking casually but without contractions is a way of not speaking well. I think of a scene from the latest season of HBO’s wonderful “Barry.” In the fifth episode, a character insists on taking over a grim task in a pressure-packed situation and says, with increasing urgency, “And I’m gonna do it … I’m doing it. Do you hear me? I’m gonna do it!” It would have been tone-deaf if this character had used “going to” rather than “gonna” and said, “And I’m going to do it … “I’m going to do it!” In casual speech, what’s “proper” in such an instance is “gonna.” After we talked about this issue, my daughter wryly said to me and her sister, “My dad is teaching me not to speak well!” Ah, the plight of the linguist parent. I have no doubt that she’ll grow up able to speak “well,” but part of speaking well is being able to speak right. I wanna make sure she can. Have feedback?

2022-06-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/world/europe/ukraine-eu-membership-corruption.html,Internal challenges like corruption pose challenges in Ukraine’s bid to join the E.U.,"KYIV, Ukraine — A majority of Ukrainians and the country’s political elite have for years favored joining the European Union and yet the country has stumbled on most major governance overhauls needed to do so. Many Ukrainians, in making their case, point out that they are the only Europeans who have fought and died for the cause of aligning with the union, noting that Russia’s military interventions began in 2014 in response to street protests demanding a free-trade agreement with Europe. But whatever the sympathy for Ukraine in Europe, nobody is waiving the rules for joining, which include cracking down on corruption. For the country, a pluralistic democracy with sharp-elbowed politics and, until the war at least, an oversized role for the business elites known as oligarchs, meeting the requirements will be a tough row to hoe. Interlinked and deeply ingrained problems of political and business influence on the courts are a central obstacle. Politicians who are also businessmen pull strings to appoint judges, who in turn rule in their favor in commercial disputes. As recently as two years ago, the prime minister in President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government at the time resigned in part to protest how a politically connected businessman was able to profit from the electrical utility serving Kyiv, the capital. Mr. Zelensky has denied granting the businessman, Ihor Kolomoisky, any special favors. The European Commission has made Ukraine’s candidate status conditional on seven main overhauls in the country’s judicial system and government. Ukraine will have to guarantee an independent judiciary, weed out high-level corruption, adopt laws on the media, limit the influence of oligarchs and improve legislation on money laundering and protecting minorities, the commission said. In some ways, the war appears to have eased these tasks. The status of the oligarchs has plummeted, as some fled and others lost assets and revenue in the fighting, while for the foreseeable future the economy will rely more on foreign aid than oligarchic-controlled commodity exports. The security services, once in part controlled behind the scenes by business titans, solidified their positions defending the country as a whole, not business interests. In other ways, the war created new obstacles for Ukraine’s European aspirations, beyond the obvious threat of the country being conquered by Russia. Under martial law, opposition television stations were excluded from a national cable system. If the war and martial law persist for months or years, it is unlikely regularly scheduled elections will be held. “The government deserves only applause” for winning Ukraine’s long-sought acceptance as a candidate for E.U. membership, Volodymyr Ariyev, a member of Parliament in the opposition European Solidarity party, said in an interview. “But we need to maintain our development in a democratic way, or we could lose our candidate status.” Oleksandr Chubko contributed reporting from Kyiv.",4
2022-06-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/opinion/letters/mike-pence-jan-6.html,Opinion | We Should Thank Mike Pence for His Courage on Jan. 6,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Pressured Pence and Incited a Mob Against Him” (front page, June 17): Again and again in Thursday’s Jan. 6 committee hearing, we saw video and heard testimony about Donald Trump saying Mike Pence should have the courage to overturn the election. Let us talk about courage. The most prominent actor who lacked courage in this most dangerous drama was Donald Trump. While Mike Pence was 40 feet from a mob that called for his murder, a mob incited by Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump himself was sitting in the safety of the White House watching what was happening on TV. He was the pathetic “wimp” who had promised to join the crowd at the Capitol and instead went back home and watched the violence from the safety of the White House. Mr. Pence refused to leave the Capitol, instead staying to fulfill his duty to the Constitution, to the law and to us. Let us talk about courage and what it meant on that day, and thank Mike Pence for what he did. Shirley StuartBerkeley, Calif. To the Editor: J. Michael Luttig, a former federal judge and adviser to Mike Pence, in testimony before the Jan. 6 committee stated the absolute peril that the former President Donald Trump and his supporters pose to American democracy in 2024. One of two scenarios is likely to follow in the wake of the hearings: Attorney General Merrick Garland decides to prosecute the former president and co-conspirators, or (if acquitted or never charged) Donald Trump is free to pursue the presidency in 2024, an attempt that is likely to fail in a free and fair election. Both of these scenarios may result in widespread violent insurrection. Without a centrist coalition, an unlikely possibility in our politically polarized nation, we must find another way, one that avoids political violence and preserves the rule of law. The resolution of this fraught situation may lie in a conditional presidential pardon of Donald Trump, a pardon that would stipulate that the former president acknowledge the commission of federal crimes and disqualify him from any federal elective office. While nauseating to contemplate, a pardon might be the only way to avoid civil war and the overthrow of American democracy. Eric RadackSanta Fe, N.M. To the Editor: Re “Five Blunt Truths About the War in Ukraine,” by Bret Stephens (column, June 15): Mr. Stephens’s column challenging the Biden administration to do even more to help the Ukrainian government (beyond currently providing advanced howitzers, rocket launchers and munitions) brings to mind the question of what former President Donald Trump would have done if still in office. Does anyone believe that Mr. Trump would have lifted a finger to help President Volodymyr Zelensky? Who could rationally think that he would have rallied NATO and the European Union to unify in opposition to his friend Vladimir Putin? And isn’t it clear that Beijing would have learned an important lesson from Mr. Trump’s inaction as Ukraine was crushed? Don’t compare President Biden to the perfect. Compare him to the alternative. James A. SteinbergRhinebeck, N.Y. To the Editor: Germany cannot let its historic trauma from Nazism lead to paralysis when faced with the instant fascist threat from Russia. Rather, Germany must make itself the byword for antifascist action in support of Ukraine, at its darkest hour. The whole world is watching. Ted GallagherNew York To the Editor: Re “Air Travelers Into U.S. Won’t Need Covid Test” (news article, June 11): I am sure many travelers “breathed a sigh of relief” that the mandate to provide a negative Covid result before boarding an international flight back to the U.S. has been lifted. However, there will also be a great number of travelers who will feel too unsafe and uncomfortable to get in a plane cabin for hours with scores of passengers, some of whom could transmit the virus. Many will give up international travel, concerned about contracting Covid. Airplane passengers cannot even rely on vaccines since they do not help as much with the Omicron variant. Lifting the test mandate is a foolish, imprudent recipe for disaster. Giovanna Di BernardoNew York To the Editor: Re “Internships That Aid All But Interns” (Your Money, Business, June 11): Ron Lieber correctly identifies the endless cycle that keeps unpaid internships very much alive: Those who can afford them take them, and get a crucial first step in their careers. Mr. Lieber doesn’t focus on the arts world, where unpaid internships have long reigned, but if we look there, you can see a fascinating trend: Paid internships beget diversity throughout an organization. In 2020 I made a $5 million donation to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City that created a new class of interns, all paid. Since then, applications have gone through the roof — 200 percent — and the applicants and the colleges they come from are far more diverse. That means a more diverse work force in the future. But there’s more: Other arts institutions have followed suit. I call on other philanthropists and arts and business leaders to pay their interns and create this new paid path to the top for students of all backgrounds.

2022-06-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/world/europe/eurovision-uk-ukraine.html,Ukraine Is Ruled Out of Staging Eurovision in 2023.,"Kalush Orchestra, a Ukrainian rap act, gave a huge morale boost last month to its war-torn country by cruising to victory at the Eurovision Song Contest — the world’s most watched and glitziest song contest. That win, with the song “Stefania,” meant that Ukraine also won the right to stage the next contest, scheduled for May 2023. But Eurovision’s organizers announced on Friday that would not be possible. The organizers, the European Broadcasting Union, said in a news release that it had concluded “with deep regret” that Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine meant that Ukraine could not provide “the security and operational guarantees” needed to host the event, which sees musicians representing countries from across Europe compete against each other for points. The European Broadcasting Union said it would instead start discussions with the BBC about hosting the event in Britain because Britain’s Sam Ryder came second in last month’s contest. The BBC confirmed in an emailed statement that it would enter those discussions. “Clearly,” it said, “these aren’t a set of circumstances that anyone would want.” The decision has not gone down well in Ukraine. Oleh Psiuk, Kalush Orchestra’s frontman, said he would “demand” the decision be changed, in a letter posted to Facebook. The letter was also signed by Ukraine’s culture minister and the country’s two other Eurovision winners: Jamala, who won in 2016 with “1944,” a song that was widely interpreted at the time as a comment on Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea; and Ruslana, who won in 2004 with “Wild Dances.” Ukraine’s public broadcaster, UA: PBC, said in a news release that it was “disappointed” with the decision. Mykola Chernotytskyi, head of its managing board, said, “a large number of people in Ukraine have thrown all their efforts to fulfill the conditions for holding Eurovision in our country.” That included offering three potential locations for the event some far from current fighting: Lviv, in western Ukraine; the Zakarpattia region which borders Hungary and Slovakia; and the capital, Kyiv. “We ask our partners to hold further negotiations,” Chernotytskyi said. In its news release, the European Broadcasting Union insisted Kalush Orchestra would feature in the contest wherever it was staged. “It is our full intention that Ukraine’s win will be reflected in next year’s shows,” it said, adding, “This will be a priority for us in our discussions with the eventual hosts.” Ukraine has held the twice event before, most recently in 2017.",29
2022-06-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/us/politics/brittney-griner-letter-biden.html,Brittney Griner’s Supporters Call on Biden to Strike a Deal to Free Her,"Dozens of organizations representing people of color, women and L.G.B.T.Q. voters called on President Biden on Wednesday to strike a deal for the release of Brittney Griner, the W.N.B.A. star who has been detained in Russia since February. In a letter sent to Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the groups said Ms. Griner “continues to endure inhumane treatment, deprived of contact with her family.” The letter said the United States “has acknowledged that Brittney is essentially a political pawn in classifying her as wrongfully detained.” And while the signatories cited “deep appreciation” for the administration’s efforts to free Ms. Griner, “we now urge you to make a deal to get Brittney back home to America immediately and safely.” The Phoenix Mercury basketball player was detained in Russia on Feb. 17 on accusations that she had hashish oil in her luggage. At first, Ms. Griner’s camp was worried that publicity could make the situation worse because of tensions between Russia and the United States, including the war in Ukraine. But the group’s approach has changed since the State Department said on May 3 that it had determined Ms. Griner had been “wrongfully detained.” That meant the United States could expend greater efforts toward bringing her home despite the legal action against her in Russia. In recent weeks, players with the W.N.B.A., working with Ms. Griner’s wife, Cherelle, and others, have tried to draw attention to her case. The latest effort, the letter from groups including the National Organization for Women, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Urban League and the National Action Network, was coordinated by Ms. Griner’s agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, who worked with the Democratic strategist Karen Finney and others. The groups, which represent a coalition of constituencies that helped to elect Mr. Biden, are speaking out amid growing frustrations over the pace of the effort to bring Ms. Griner home. “To my understanding, they have not started negotiating her release, and so this letter is very powerful because it’s much-needed support to highlight the fact that we are at the phase where you guys should be making a deal,” Cherelle Griner said. “I wish I could say I have a clear understanding of it,” she said of the White House strategy. “They do a lot of talking in code with me.” The administration, she said, is “debating whether they should start negotiating,” when it has already been determined that her wife was wrongfully detained. “Instead, they’re debating and they’re wasting time from my wife’s life.” White House officials, commenting after this article was published online, said, “President Biden has been clear about the need to see all U.S. nationals who are held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad released, including Brittney Griner. The U.S. government continues to work aggressively — using every available means — to bring her home.” Administration officials have said Mr. Biden’s team is in regular contact with the Griner family and that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke with Cherelle Griner in May. The special envoy for hostage affairs is also in touch with Ms. Griner’s team. Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico and the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, also has been working to try to free Ms. Griner and another American in Russia, the former Marine Paul Whelan, who has been detained since 2018. Still, Cherelle Griner said she was uncertain about how much the White House was prioritizing the case. She told The Associated Press that she was supposed to speak to her wife by phone for the first time in roughly four months over the weekend, but a logistical problem at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow upended the plans. According to The A.P., the embassy was supposed to facilitate the call between the two women. But when Brittney Griner called the embassy to get patched through to her wife in the United States, there was no answer. Brittney Griner’s lawyers said she tried calling the line 11 times while her wife waited in vain for the call, The A.P. reported. “I was distraught. I was hurt. I was done, fed up,” Cherelle Griner told The A.P.",7
2022-06-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/23/world/europe/eurovision-ukraine-2023.html,Eurovision Defends Not Allowing Ukraine to Host 2023 Contest,"It was a rare moment of euphoria amid war: In May a Ukrainian hip-hop band won the Eurovision Song Contest, the cultural phenomenon that helped launch Abba and Celine Dion and was watched this year by about 160 million people. But joy quickly turned to disappointment when the contest’s organizers announced that Ukraine was not secure enough to host the 2023 competition, an honor that usually goes to the previous year’s winner. On Thursday, the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the contest, tried to tame the backlash, saying in a statement their primary concern was “safety and security” of the participants, which include performers from across Europe, 10,000 staff and crew members, and a huge legion of devoted fans expected to travel to the event, many of them young people. But outrage at the refusal to allow Ukraine to host next year’s event has been palpable and shows little sign of abating. Oleh Psiuk, the lead singer of Kalush Orchestra, which won this year’s contest, signed an open letter demanding that the decision be changed. And Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, expressed anger, saying that Ukraine had rightfully won the contest, had offered safety assurances and was being denied an honor that would burnish support for the country on the global stage. “Hosting Eurovision 2023 in Ukraine is a strong signal to the whole world that it supports Ukraine now,” he said. The organizers, however, have refused to back down from their decision, stressing that they are abiding by their own rules, which state that the location of the contest can be moved in the event of a catastrophe like a war. Allowing Ukraine to host the event, they added, would breach the requirement that the security and welfare of those in attendance be guaranteed. The projection of Ukrainian culture on the international stage has taken on added resonance at a time when the country is under siege and President Vladimir V. Putin has claimed that Ukraine and Russia “are one people.” Ukrainian politicians, artists and musicians say it is more imperative than ever to expose the country’s cultural uniqueness in international events like the wildly popular song competition.

2022-06-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/opinion/lgbt-pride-ukraine-war.html,"Opinion | In Ukraine and New York, Pride Must Get Political","Last Saturday, toward the end of the Riga-Kyiv Pride March for Freedom in Latvia, I saw a burly man in a unicorn head lean out of a second-floor window and wave grandly at the parade below. His yellow and blue shirt had “Kyiv” emblazoned across it. March participants had been leading the 5,000-strong crowd in the chant “Make love, not war,” artfully linking the right to love, everywhere, with the right to self-determination and peace in Ukraine. In response to the queer Minotaur in Ukraine’s colors, the marchers erupted into cries of “Slava Ukraini,” or “Glory to Ukraine.” There can, of course, be no Pride marches in Ukraine this year. Instead, Kyiv Pride, which has been organizing marches in the Ukrainian capital since 2012, has been invited to participate in a series of joint events across Eastern Europe, such as last week’s in Riga. The largest of these will happen on Saturday in Warsaw, where 80,000 people are expected to attend; many will be Ukrainian refugees in Poland. Kyiv Pride’s 2022 manifesto calls on everyone — from governments to people on the street — “to imprint on their memory the geographical line of border between Ukraine on the one side and Russia and Belarus on the other, because it is not just a separation line between the states but also a boundary between the territory of freedom and a zone of oppression.” In Riga several marchers made signs bearing a line written by the poet Emma Lazarus: “Until we are all free, none of us are free.” In this part of the world, what with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the official homophobia of Poland’s and Hungary’s right-wing governments, such sentiment is not metaphorical. But too often, in other places where Pride has become pro forma, we forget that it holds such significance. This year, in every country, we must remember that Pride’s power comes from its politics of struggle. This weekend, New Yorkers will march down a Fifth Avenue festooned with rainbow flags, in the United States’ biggest and loudest Pride event. In the past few years, these Pride events — in New York and elsewhere in the Western world — have become formulaic. Those who remember the way the movement began as protest complain, with clockwork predictability, that Pride has become little more than an excuse for a party or a branding opportunity for corporations, one that wraps the month of June in feel-good rainbow colors rather than powering genuine, year-round transformation. But American Pride celebrants have taken to the streets in a country where, this year, more than 300 anti-L.G.B.T.Q. bills have been introduced in state legislatures. Given this climate, Pride cannot be just a gay party or a corporate branding opportunity. It must once more find its role as an emblematic struggle against the gathering of illiberal forces — from the United States’ Donald Trump to Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Hungary’s Viktor Orban — who would shut down personal autonomy, ostensibly in the name of traditional values or faith, in order to reassert patriarchal control over a population that, increasingly, makes its own decisions. In Poland, the country’s ruling Law and Justice party won the 2020 presidential election, in part by threatening that what was called a “rainbow plague” worse than the “red plague” of communism by the archbishop of Krakow would engulf the country if pro-E.U. liberals were to govern. About 100 municipalities have declared themselves L.G.B.T.-free zones. But tens of thousands of people have attended recent Warsaw equality marches, likely in direct response to Law and Justice’s politics of hate. “Here beats the heart of a smiling, open Poland,” Warsaw’s mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, told the crowd last year. Trzaskowski, who supports L.G.B.T.Q. rights, narrowly lost the presidential election in 2020. “The parade is a celebration of the L.G.B.T.+ community,” he said, “but it is also a celebration of all who are tolerant, all who are smiling, all who look to the future, all who want Warsaw to be for everyone.” Trzaskowski will no doubt say something similar on Saturday, extending the metaphor eastward. The Russian invasion of Ukraine threatens the pluralism that has been growing, if slowly, in Eastern Europe since the fall of Communism. In March, the Russian Orthodox Church’s Patriarch Kirill, a Putin ally, said explicitly that one of the objectives of the Ukraine invasion was to save ethnic Russians from the horrors of Gay Pride parades. Pride in Ukraine had, in fact, come a long way. The first Kyiv Pride, in 2012, had to be canceled because authorities said they could not guarantee the safety of marchers. The following year, about 100 people marched, protected by police from a much larger number of counterprotesters. But last year, 7,000 people marched peacefully through the Ukrainian capital, led and protected by the police. The country’s hate crimes law would likely have been expanded this year to protect L.G.B.T.Q. people, too. This, of course, has been postponed indefinitely. While I was in Riga, I met Lenny Emson, a Ukrainian activist who is directing this year’s Kyiv Pride and has been involved with the organization since its founding. The organization now functions largely as a service-provision organization to help queer Ukrainians who have been displaced by the war. Many enlisted Ukrainian troops have come out on social media over the past few months; these stories reveal the way that the war’s outcome and L.G.B.T.Q. rights are intertwined in Ukraine. Emson noted that while this new visibility could have a positive effect on the way queer Ukrainians were perceived by their compatriots, ultraright-wing homophobes were also joining up and becoming heroes. “Things are in the balance,” Emson said. After Kyiv Pride began a campaign this month featuring an exhibition of 12 L.G.B.T.Q. Ukrainians contributing to the war effort, Emson added, a right-wing social media effort countered that Putin was invading Ukraine “because of the gays.” If Ukraine joins the European Union, this will have a significant effect on L.G.B.T.Q. rights in the country: New members would be party to the E.U. Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantees equality on the basis of sexual orientation. But there was a strong risk, Emson said, that an E.U.-affiliated Ukraine could go the route of Poland or Hungary — where, even as they receive E.U. subsidies, right-wing leaders campaign against what they call L.G.B.T.Q. ideology as a way of maintaining church support and defining a nationalist agenda against the perceived onslaught of Western Europe. The playbook for this strategy was invented in the West, specifically in the United States, by the generation of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. laws touched off by Anita Bryant’s Save Our Children campaign in the 1970s. In the gathering culture wars, Republican political operatives used homophobia to mobilize voters, in the name of traditional values and individual freedom, against what they saw as a secular liberal hegemony. Such moral panic is being rekindled in the United States — most prominently in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed “Don’t Say Gay” legislation — after being used over the past decade in Eastern Europe, most prominently by Putin. In 2013, Putin’s government enacted anti-“gay propaganda” legislation that bans “the promotion of nontraditional sexual relations” (read: homosexuality) to minors. This was specifically done to cement his relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church, as a way of mobilizing support against the growing opposition in the cities to his rule-for-life strategy. Since then, Putin has used such politics primarily to promote a “wholesome” and traditional Russia — one in which heterosexuals increase the Russian population through procreation — against what he paints as a decadent and dying West, symbolized by homosexuals and trans folk. It is that decadent West that he has said he is fighting in Ukraine. Putin’s wartime repression of his own people includes renewed assaults on Russia’s L.G.B.T.Q. movement. Organizations have been shut down after their staff members were declared foreign agents, and many of the country’s leading L.G.B.T.Q. activists have fled. This month, legislation was submitted in the Duma to strengthen the anti-gay law so that the “promotion” of “unnatural lifestyles” would be forbidden not just to minors but to everyone. If the measure passes, it will essentially make public expression of homosexuality or transness illegal. Pride is about visibility, and visibility has a double edge. The Harvey Milk maxim that is at the root of Pride politics — “Gay brothers and sisters, you must come out!” — has been proved, time and again, as the best corrective to the canards that queer people are dangerous or possessed by demons or are foreign agents. But what if it’s forbidden or simply too dangerous to come out? There are, for example, very few Pride events in Africa outside my home country, South Africa. In much the way Eastern European nationalists use the American culture wars playbook to assert their cultural sovereignty against the West, some African nationalists use the sodomy laws inherited from Britain, a former colonizer, to insist that homosexuality is un-African. And yet, last Sunday, another Pride celebration took place, this one held by L.G.B.T.Q. asylum seekers awaiting confirmation of their refugee status in the vast Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. Many of the celebrants have fled their home countries because of a fear of persecution on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, but the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees processes them in a country where homosexuality remains illegal and holds them in camps filled with other refugees who hold the same homophobic or transphobic attitudes prevalent in the environments they fled. Augustine Kayemba, an asylum seeker who leads the L.G.B.T.Q. community at Kakuma, told me that over 600 people from seven countries attended Pride but that many just passed quickly by his gathering, afraid to linger, for fear of reprisal. “There is not a day that goes by without some news of violence due to hate,” he said. Kayemba told me that last Sunday night, after the Pride celebration, one of his housemates, Oscar Katamba, was severely beaten with pipes by assailants who called him a Kiswahili slur for “homosexual”; he suffered a head wound requiring 10 stitches. Kayemba offered two reasons for holding Pride in such a hostile environment: to establish community within the camp and to use the event “to tell the wider world about our predicament.” In a letter he wrote to supporters, with photographs of the event, Kayemba said, “Despite all the misery, we try to find some time to kill the stress when celebrating official L.G.B.T.I.Q. days and festivals.” For Kayemba, Pride is the “official” day not just of a movement but also of a set of values that represents the kind of freedom he can only dream of while waiting at Kakuma. I have written about the disillusionment of L.G.B.T.Q. refugees when they arrive in “liberated” rainbowy Vancouver or Amsterdam or Cape Town: Their poverty or dark skin or Muslim faith makes it hard for them to integrate into L.G.B.T.Q.-friendly Western society the way they had imagined. Even in these places, then, Pride must reconnect with its political roots. The party, of course, is also important: It is a way of claiming the street. Even at Stonewall in 1969, there was a performative element to the protest. The engagement in Pride by corporations is important, too. In countries like India and Mexico, the diversity and inclusion policies of multinational corporations have created space not just for their employees but also in society more broadly as they or their products become emblems of a cosmopolitan modernity that embraces pluralism and diversity. But when such branding dominates, Pride becomes just a branding exercise. Against this, we need to hold to heart this year’s Kyiv Pride manifesto, to understand how, wherever and however we are participating in Pride events, we are working to expand the “territory of freedom” against that “zone of oppression.” We need to remember that even if it carries little risk for those of us on the streets of New York or Amsterdam, it is a matter of life and death for so many others. In Riga, at a rally after the march, Lenny Emson spoke about Roman Tkachenko, a member of Kyiv’s L.G.B.T.Q. community who was killed in battle last month near Kharkiv. Tkachenko was a 21-year-old university graduate passionate about mosaic restoration and eco-activism. “We often say we march for those who are not able to march themselves,” Emson said — because of fear or discrimination or danger. “But these days we are also marching for those who cannot, and will never be able to, because they are no longer on this earth.” Mark Gevisser (@markgevisser) is a South African author and journalist.

2022-06-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia-trial-date.html,Brittney Griner’s Trial in Russia Will Begin on Friday,"A Russian court said the trial for the U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner will begin on Friday and she will remain in custody until it ends, her lawyer, Aleksandr Boikov, said on Monday. Ms. Griner appeared in the Khimki city court near Moscow for a preliminary hearing. She did not speak following her court appearance, according to a video from outside the courtroom that was posted by the official state news agency TASS. The W.N.B.A. star, who had played for a Russian team during the off-season, was detained in a Moscow airport on Feb. 17, ensnaring a U.S. citizen’s fate in the confrontation between Russia and the West over Ukraine. Russian officials said they had found vape cartridges bearing traces of hash oil in Ms. Griner’s luggage when she passed through a security checkpoint. The drug charges levied against her carry a sentence of up to 10 years in a penal colony. Mr. Boikov said that he expected the trial to take up to two months, depending on the court’s workload. He also said Ms. Griner was well and has no complaints about her treatment in the pretrial detention center. “It is hot in Moscow, so she feels that too, especially while being transported to the court,” Mr. Boikov said in a phone interview. Ms. Griner, a seven-time W.N.B.A. All-Star center for the Phoenix Mercury and a key figure in two champion Olympic teams, was detained a week before the invasion of Ukraine, but Russian officials did not reveal her arrest until after the war begun. Word of her arrest came when Russia-U.S. relations were hitting one low point after another, and her detention raised fears that she could become a bargaining chip, perhaps to be exchanged for high-profile Russians in U.S. custody. In recent years, U.S. officials have accused Russia of detaining and sentencing American citizens on trumped-up charges. Last week, dozens of organizations representing people of color, women and L.G.B.T.Q. voters called on President Biden to strike a deal for her release. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said in an interview with MSNBC this month that Ms. Griner was not being held hostage and was being held accountable for violating Russian law.",7
2022-06-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/30/opinion/letters/abortion-politics-voting.html,"Opinion | Abortion on the Ballot: ‘Remember, You Are Alone in the Voting Booth’","To the Editor: I am a 41-year-old white, upper-class, single, childless professional, a Midwestern Republican and a practicing Catholic woman. I am disgusted by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. This does not match my conservative values of smaller government and fiscal conservatism. Practically, why is it a government matter to ensure the completion of truly unwanted and/or dangerous pregnancies? Personally, I have seen the toll of abortion on friends and relatives. Reasons I’ve seen for having one include date rape, accidental pregnancies, irresponsible lack of birth control and unviable pregnancies. No one took the decision lightly or evaded the psychological impact of the actual event. Women across their lifetimes deal with everyone else’s interest in and opinion of their bodies. We also deal with managing access to our bodies in ways I do not think most men can understand. Men who want to put part of their bodies inside ours. Doctors who probe inside. Lives that grow inside and can cause serious injury and death in the process. It’s a lot to manage. I suggest we leave each person to their own management, in a truly Republican way. Emily SmithSt. Louis To the Editor: When my son was born, I had an overpowering feeling of love. I couldn’t imagine loving anyone more than I loved him. Giving birth and having a child are what I cherish most about my life. Every child deserves to be wanted and be the recipient of that powerful love. I am a pro-choice Democrat. I am also pro-life. And by pro-life I don’t mean the pro-fetus, anti-abortion view of the conservative, religious right. To me pro-life means ensuring that women have prenatal care and adequate family leave, and affordable child care. Pro-life means good nutrition, parental jobs that pay a living wage, safe, affordable housing, excellent public education and health care for everyone. It is time for Democrats and all who love children to claim the mantle of “pro-life” as ours and to recognize that anti-abortionists care only about the delivery of a fetus no matter how it was conceived and whether is it born alive or dead. We must restore women’s bodily autonomy and right to choose when and how to have a child. Nancy H. HenselLaguna Woods, Calif. To the Editor: Those Americans celebrating our nation’s reactionary lurch back to the dark days of government control over women’s bodies are, no doubt, deeply grateful to the millions of self-described progressive and/or Democratic Party-aligned voters who in 2016 opted not to cast a vote at all rather than to vote for Hillary Clinton. Without the help of those anti-Clinton members of the electorate, it’s highly unlikely the radical right could have fulfilled its dream of creating a top court controlled by overtly activist justices who now, one decision at a time, are ensuring that the politics of white privilege and patriarchal thinking reign supreme. It’s a stark reminder that polls indicating that a majority of voters continue to favor a woman’s right to choose are meaningless if lots of those same voters choose not to vote. Andy ParkerPortland, Ore. To the Editor: At this tragic time for women’s rights, I remember a letter to the editor, in this very paper, that was written 30 years ago. We were at the crux of a significant presidential election, in which several Supreme Court seats were potentially at stake. The writer of that letter took the liberty of doctoring a quote from Julia Child, who was a known ardent supporter of Planned Parenthood. On one of her cooking shows, Julia accidentally flipped food out of the pan and onto the floor. As she picked it up from the floor and tossed it back into the pan, she looked into the camera and said, “Always remember: If you’re alone in the kitchen and you drop the lamb, you can always just pick it up. Who’s going to know?” The writer of that letter reminded women, “Remember, you are alone in the voting booth.” As we fight to get our rights back, I hope that women, regardless of their political party, will remember that advice this November. Katrina SabaOakland, Calif. To the Editor: Re “Justices Revive G.O.P.-Drawn Map in Louisiana” (news article, June 29): The Supreme Court’s reinstatement of the highly partisan gerrymandered voting map by the Louisiana Legislature simply highlights the politicization of the six conservative justices and the court’s continued decline of legitimacy in the public eye. The trial court found that the Republican-drawn map diluted Black voters’ rights and required the Louisiana Legislature to redraw the map for the coming November election. The six justices arbitrarily blocked the trial court’s order without giving any reason. Although overshadowed by the abortion, gun permit and church-state cases, this result-oriented order simply reinforces the public’s skepticism of the court’s partisan bent. So much for the Republicans’ historic denunciation of “activist judges.” Ken GoldmanBeverly Hills, Calif.The writer is a lawyer. To the Editor: According to the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, the conflict in Ukraine appears likely to last for some time. In recent days, though, leading voices in Europe, those who want Russia pushed back and punished as well as those who want the war to end quickly, have expressed serious interest in talks. Negotiation may be more promising if the focus shifts from a final resolution of the protracted conflict to an interim plan with these initial objectives: (a) to cease the fighting and (b) to consider occupied territory “neutral,” and under a protectorate, until a complete resolution can be determined. Implementing these steps will take some doing, but each, in some form, is essential to limit human suffering, physical damage and economic loss as well as to establish and support a forum for negotiations, one in which “the interests” of the nations, rather than their “positions,” frame the discussions. This approach allows neither side to claim a victory. They can, however, commit to work for a peaceful Europe, as essential for Ukraine and Russia as for the stability, and prosperity, of the world. Linda StamatoSanford M. JaffeMorristown, N.J.The writers are co-directors of the Center for Negotiation and Conflict Resolution at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, Rutgers University. To the Editor: The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has methodically laid out a compelling, fact-based argument as to what happened that day, and why. I am still awaiting the same from those who believe that the 2020 election was “stolen.” What is their case? Where are their facts? Instead of a disciplined, marshaled argument, I hear only shrieks, shouts and hyperbole. I am reminded of President Lincoln’s observation in the midst of a similar hysteria: “Passion has helped us; but can do so no more. It will in future be our enemy. Reason, cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason, must furnish all the materials for our future support and defence.” As a nation, this must be our watchword moving forward. Philip TaftHopewell, N.J. To the Editor: Many of us are frustrated that the institutions we look to for guiding our democracy are not working: a Supreme Court that interprets law as written hundreds of years ago; a Senate and a House often mired in gridlock; an executive branch that has suffered a near coup from partisans chanting false information about election fraud. Clearly something is not working, and we the people need to be the adults in the room to provide guidance. Perhaps it’s time for a new constitutional convention to update the contract between the people and our government so it works for all of us again. Richard M. SchubertPortland, Ore.",1
2022-07-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/world/europe/brittney-griner-trial-photos-russia.html,Pictures of Brittney Griner in Custody Offer Few Clues to Her Well-Being,"Photos of the W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner being led through a courthouse outside Moscow were released this week before her trial on drug charges that is set to begin on Friday, giving the Western world a rare glimpse of her after four months of being detained in Russia. In some of the photos, a handcuffed Ms. Griner appears worried. She wears a gray T-shirt and round eyeglasses. The wrists of her long arms are cuffed together and then cuffed to a guard’s arm. Some fans described the photos as “heartbreaking.” Only a few images of Ms. Griner have been released since her arrest in an airport near Moscow on Feb. 17, a week before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and they have been scrutinized for clues about her mental and physical health. She was detained as she passed through security after officials said they had found vape cartridges with traces of hashish oil in her luggage. If convicted, she faces a sentence of up to 10 years at a penal colony. Her detention and trial has been widely seen in the West as retribution for American support for Ukraine in the war with Russia. Her wife, Cherelle Griner, has only been able to communicate with Brittney Griner through letters. After four months of the pair’s not being able to speak to each other, Russian officials approved a phone call between them for June 18, but the two were unable to connect because the phone line at the U.S. Embassy in Russia was not staffed. “She’s telling me she’s OK,” Ms. Griner’s wife said in a recent radio interview with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Cherelle Griner said Brittney Griner had vowed, “I won’t let them break me.” But Brittney Griner is struggling, her wife said. “She’s a human, she’s there terrified, she’s there alone,” Cherelle Griner said. “It’s not just that she can’t speak to her loved ones. She can’t speak to anyone because she doesn’t speak the language. It’s inhumane on all types of levels.” The photographs of Ms. Griner released on Monday were accompanied by a video in which Ms. Griner, flanked by four police officers and a dog, walks down a hall and then up a flight of stairs. Though handcuffed, she towers above her Russian guards and moves with confidence. At one point she purses her lips together and shakes her head from side to side, as if in disbelief. The images released Monday were the first to appear since May 13, when an Associated Press photographer took a picture of Ms. Griner leaving a courtroom in Khimki, Russia. She wore an orange sweatshirt with an Air Jordan logo on the sleeve. The hood was pulled over her bowed head so that her face was not visible. She was handcuffed and chained to a guard behind her. Two more guards surround her. That photo prompted questions in the United States about Ms. Griner’s physical and emotional well-being.",7
2022-07-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/world/europe/brittney-griner-prison-russia.html,A Look Inside the Lockup Where Brittney Griner Has Been Held,"The detention facility just outside Moscow where Brittney Griner, the American basketball star, has been held is a former orphanage rebuilt a decade ago to house women jailed before trial and, separately, women serving their prison sentences. Its artificially lit, gray painted halls and grim tall walls befit its bureaucratic name: Correctional Colony No. 1, or IK-1. Thousands of Russian women have passed through it, along with at least one other well-known foreigner: Naama Issachar, the Israeli-American arrested in April 2019 when the Russian police said they had found a third of an ounce of marijuana in her luggage as she was connecting at a Moscow airport. Ms. Issachar was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison on drug possession and smuggling charges before President Vladimir V. Putin pardoned her, 10 months after she was first arrested, as she became a political pawn in the complex relationship between Russia and Israel. In jail, Ms. Issachar told her mother: “The clouds in Moscow are pretty.” It was all she could see of the outside world. Now it is Ms. Griner, also held on drug charges, who is a pawn — American officials call her a hostage of the Kremlin — but the geopolitics at stake, amid the war in Ukraine and Mr. Putin’s showdown with the West, are far more fraught. In a telephone interview from Israel, Ms. Issachar’s mother, Yaffa Issachar, said that her daughter had cried when she heard about Ms. Griner’s case, telling her: “I know what she’s going through now.” The mother said that Ms. Issachar had been treated relatively well by her cellmates, but that she feared that Ms. Griner, as a gay woman, could be treated worse because of Russia’s conservative attitudes and restrictive laws surrounding homosexuality. Yaffa Issachar said her daughter had been moved through three Russian detention facilities, including three months in the one where Ms. Griner is expected to stay through the duration of her trial, which started on Friday. It is in the village of Novoye Grishino, a 50-mile drive from central Moscow. The Russian authorities have not disclosed Ms. Griner’s whereabouts. The New York Times was able to identify the prison from a photograph published online by a visitor, and the location was confirmed by a person familiar with the case. Ms. Griner has been held in the pretrial detention center of the facility, which also includes a larger penal colony for women serving out their sentences, with its own sewing factory and Russian Orthodox church. Video footage of the prison available online shows tall, gray walls, old prison bars and a rusty monument to Lenin in the courtyard. Ms. Issachar, who was allowed to visit her daughter twice a month, also remembers the Lenin monument — along with the din of barking prison dogs that, she said, were being trained in the yard. For Ms. Griner, every day in the facility looks pretty much the same, said Yekaterina Kalugina, a journalist and member of a public prison monitoring group who has visited Ms. Griner in the prison. The inmates wake up, have breakfast in their cell — usually some basic food — and then go for a walk in the prison’s courtyard, which is covered by a net. The rest of the day is filled with reading books — Ms. Griner has been reading Dostoyevsky in translation, for instance — and watching television, though all of the channels are in Russian, Ms. Kalugina said. The cell has a separate private washroom, she said, something of a novelty for Russian prisons. Inmates can order food online and use a refrigerator in the cell for groceries. They are allowed to take a shower only twice a week. Ms. Issachar said it would take as long as four hours to complete the paperwork to enter the prison, with all of the food she was bringing in painstakingly inspected — down to the tea bags, which had to be cut open, their contents emptied into a plastic bag. She could see her daughter only through glass, and talk to her only through a telephone. She said that her daughter had been allowed weekly visits by a rabbi, who would pass letters between them; under prison regulations, the rabbi was allowed to be in the same room as the inmate. The isolation for her daughter was severe, Ms. Ishaffar said. “Mommy, the fall started,” she recalled her daughter telling her at one point. “I see the leaves coming down.” Ms. Ishaffar suggested that Ms. Griner’s family find a priest who could visit her. “There is somebody watching them,” she said, “but at least it’s a human she can talk to.” Isabel Kershner contributed reporting.",7
2022-07-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/world/europe/brittney-griner-trial-russia.html,"Brittney Griner, Women’s Basketball Star, Goes on Trial in Russia","Brittney Griner arrived in Russia in February to play basketball, one of the sport’s biggest stars. She arrived in a courtroom outside Moscow on Friday as something else entirely — a potential bargaining chip in Russia’s tense standoff with the West over the war in Ukraine, described by supporters as a hostage of the Kremlin. After more than four months languishing in a Russian prison, and speaking no Russian, Ms. Griner, 31, went on trial, accused of carrying into the country vape cartridges with traces — 0.7 grams, the prosecutor said — of cannabis oil. In a legal system that rarely finds defendants anything but guilty, she faces up to 10 years in a penal colony if convicted. Ms. Griner’s arrest on Feb. 17 — a week before the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — pulled her into the maw of geopolitics as President Vladimir V. Putin faced a determined Western effort to help Ukraine fight back. She has been touted in Russian state media as an asset who could be traded for a Russian arms dealer sitting in an American prison. Though Russia’s drug laws can carry harsh penalties, a foreigner caught with a small amount would usually face no more than a month in jail, a fine and deportation, but Mr. Putin’s government has a long history of using detention for international leverage, sometimes to obtain the release of a Russian held abroad. With little information to go on, Ms. Griner’s supporters worry about her physical and emotional health and how she is being treated — an openly gay, Black American in a culturally conservative country that has adopted anti-gay laws, has few Black people and sees the United States as its nemesis. They cite her linguistic isolation and the near-certainty that she is being held in conditions not designed to accommodate her 6-foot-9 frame. “She’s telling me she’s OK,” her wife, Cherelle, who has been able to communicate with her only through letters, said in a recent radio interview with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Cherelle Griner said Brittney Griner had vowed, “I won’t let them break me.” But Brittney Griner is struggling, her wife said. “She’s a human, she’s there terrified, she’s there alone,” Cherelle Griner said. “It’s not just that she can’t speak to her loved ones. She can’t speak to anyone because she doesn’t speak the language. It’s inhumane on all types of levels.” In a court in Khimki, outside of Moscow, on Friday, Ms. Griner cut an incongruous figure, as always towering above everyone else as she was led in, her long, tattooed arms cuffed together and cuffed to the arm of a guard. For the first day of her trial, she wore a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt and athletic shoes without laces. She sat in the defendant’s cage with a bottle of water and a bag of cookies, and told a reporter that detention was hard because of the language barrier and a lack of exercise, Reuters reported. The session, conducted in Russian with a few journalists and three U.S. embassy officials present, was quickly adjourned after some expected witnesses failed to show up. The trial is set to resume next Thursday. A prosecutor told the court that Ms. Griner was “aware enough” that transporting narcotics into Russia was forbidden, according to the state-owned Russian news agency Tass. Ms. Griner said that she understood the charges but would express her response to them later, the agency said. Cherelle Griner and others have questioned whether the Biden administration is doing enough to secure Brittney Griner’s release, a view the State Department seemed determined on Friday to dispel. Elizabeth Rood, the chargé d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, attended the trial and talked with reporters afterward. “I did have the opportunity to speak with Ms. Griner in the courtroom,” Ms. Rood said. “She is doing as well as can be expected in these difficult circumstances and asked me to convey that she is in good spirits and is keeping up the faith.” “The Russian Federation has wrongfully detained Ms. Griner,” she said, adding, “the U.S. government at the very highest levels is working very hard to bring Ms. Griner as well as all wrongfully detained U.S. citizens safely home.” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken tweeted, “We — and I personally — have no higher priority than bringing her and other wrongfully detained Americans” back home. In a news conference on Friday, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, denied that the case was politically motivated, or that the government was even involved. “Only the court can pass a verdict,” he said. But reports in Russian state media indicate that Moscow sees Ms. Griner as a valuable asset in its confrontation with the United States, which is leading Western efforts to help Ukraine resist the Russian invasion. Tass reported in May that officials were in talks to exchange Ms. Griner for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer who is serving a 25-year sentence in a U.S. federal prison for conspiring to sell weapons to people who said they planned to kill Americans. In April, the Biden administration secured the release of Trevor R. Reed, a former U.S. Marine held for two years in Russia on what his family said were bogus charges of assault, in a swap for a Russian pilot sentenced to a lengthy prison term in the United States on cocaine trafficking charges. American officials have not confirmed any talks about exchanging Ms. Griner. The Kremlin has pressed for years for the release of Mr. Bout, but U.S. officials are reluctant to take any steps that could be seen as risking the safety of Americans. Photos and videos have offered brief public glimpses of Ms. Griner arriving in court and leaving. Fans scrutinize the images, which some have described as heartbreaking, for clues to her well-being in the expressions behind her round glasses. Legal experts say Ms. Griner’s trial was all but certain to end in a conviction despite the clamor in the United States for her release. Her lawyer, Aleksandr Boikov, said this week that he expected the trial to last up to two months. She has been held in Correctional Colony No. 1, or IK-1, in the village of Novoye Grishino, a 50-mile drive from central Moscow — a former orphanage, converted a decade ago to hold women serving prison sentences or awaiting trial. Video footage of the prison available online shows tall, gray walls, old prison bars and a rusty monument to Lenin in the courtyard. The Russian authorities have not disclosed Ms. Griner’s whereabouts, but The New York Times was able to identify the prison from a photograph published online by a visitor, and the location was confirmed by a person familiar with the case. For Ms. Griner, every day there looks pretty much the same, said Yekaterina Kalugina, a journalist and member of a public prison monitoring group who has visited Ms. Griner in the prison. (She said that Ms. Griner’s prison mattress was too small for someone her size.) The inmates wake up, have breakfast in their cell — usually some basic food — and then go for a walk in the prison’s courtyard, which is covered by a net. The rest of the day is filled with reading books — Ms. Griner has been reading Dostoyevsky in translation, for instance — and watching television, though all of the channels are in Russian, Ms. Kalugina said. The cell has a separate private washroom, she said, something of a novelty for Russian prisons. They are allowed to shower only twice a week. Thousands of Russian women have passed through it, along with at least one other well-known foreigner: Naama Issachar, an Israeli-American arrested in April 2019 when the Russian police said they had found 9.5 grams — one-third of an ounce — of marijuana in her luggage as she was connecting at a Moscow airport. Ms. Issachar was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison on drug possession and smuggling charges, and Israeli officials and her family said the Kremlin had tied her fate to that of a Russian being held in Israel. No exchange was made — Israel extradited the Russian detainee to the United States to face computer crime charges — but Mr. Putin, who was cultivating ties to Israel, pardoned Ms. Issachar 10 months after she was arrested. In a telephone interview from Israel, her mother, Yaffa Issachar, said that her daughter had cried when she heard about Ms. Griner’s case, telling her: “I know what she’s going through now.” The mother said that Naama Issachar had been treated relatively well by her cellmates, but that she feared that Ms. Griner, as a gay woman, could be treated worse because of Russia’s conservative attitudes and discriminatory laws on homosexuality. Ms. Ishaffar suggested that Ms. Griner’s family find a priest who could visit her. “There is somebody watching them,” she said, “but at least it’s a human she can talk to.” Ms. Griner, who plays center for the Phoenix Mercury of the W.N.B.A., is a seven-time league All-Star, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and the first openly gay athlete signed to an endorsement contract by Nike. But female basketball players are paid a fraction of what their male counterparts make in the United States, so Ms. Griner, like many others, has also played during the W.N.B.A. off-season in overseas leagues where the contracts are far more lucrative. She played for two seasons in China, and since 2014 she has played in Russia, for UMMC Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains. On Feb. 17, she landed at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport, where her bags were searched. She never made it to the Urals.

2022-07-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/us/politics/brittney-griner-trial-russia.html,Russia Hints at Linking Griner’s Case to Fate of ‘Merchant of Death’,"WASHINGTON — She is an American professional basketball star, accused of carrying hashish oil in her luggage. He is a notorious Russian arms dealer known as the “Merchant of Death,” serving a 25-year federal prison sentence for conspiring to sell weapons to people who said they planned to kill Americans. And the Kremlin appears interested in linking their fates, in a potential deal with the Biden administration that would free both. The vast disparity between the cases of Brittney Griner and Viktor Bout highlights the extreme difficulty President Biden would face if he sought a prisoner exchange to free Ms. Griner, the detained W.N.B.A. player, from detention in Moscow. The Biden administration, reluctant to create an incentive for the arrest or abduction of Americans abroad, would be hard-pressed to justify the release of a villainous figure like Mr. Bout. At the same time, Mr. Biden is under pressure to free Ms. Griner, who was arrested at a Moscow-area airport in February and whom the State Department classified in May as “wrongfully detained.” That reflects concern that the Kremlin considers her leverage in the tense confrontation between the United States and Russia over Ukraine. Last week, dozens of groups representing people of color, women and L.G.B.T.Q. Americans sent a letter urging Mr. Biden to “make a deal to get Brittney back home to America immediately and safely.” Ms. Griner’s trial started on Friday and was adjourned until next Thursday. Mr. Bout, 55, a former Soviet military officer who made a fortune in global arms trafficking before he was caught in a federal sting operation, could be the price for any deal. Russian officials have pressed Mr. Bout’s case for years, and in recent weeks Russian media outlets have directly linked his case to Ms. Griner’s. Some, including the state-owned Tass news service, have even claimed that talks with Washington for a possible exchange are already underway, something that U.S. officials will not confirm. Mr. Bout’s New York-based lawyer, Steve Zissou, said in an interview that Russian officials are pressing to free Mr. Bout, who was convicted in 2011 of offering to sell weapons, including antiaircraft missiles, to federal agents posing as members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Mr. Zissou said that he met with Anatoly I. Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, in June in Washington and that Mr. Antonov told him the release of Mr. Bout was a very high priority for the Russian government. “It has been communicated to the American side very clearly that they’re going to have to get real on Viktor Bout if they expect any further prisoner exchanges,” Mr. Zissou said. “My sense of this is that no American is going home unless Viktor Bout is sent home with them.” U.S. officials have declined to substantiate that notion and won’t discuss any potential deal to free Ms. Griner. The State Department as a matter of practice dismisses questions about prisoner exchanges around the world, warning that they set a dangerous precedent. “Using wrongful detention as a bargaining chip represents a threat to the safety of everyone traveling, working and living abroad,” the department’s spokesman, Ned Price, recently said. Mr. Biden did agree to a prisoner exchange in April, in which Russia released Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine from Texas who had been held since 2019 on charges of assaulting two police officers. The United States in return freed Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot sentenced in 2011 to 20 years in prison for drug smuggling. But White House officials stressed that Mr. Reed’s failing health made his case exceptional. Many people have expressed support for Ms. Griner, a star athlete and basketball icon. Less obvious is the Russian government’s solidarity with an organized crime titan linked to terrorists and war criminals. In December, a government building in Moscow exhibited two dozen of Mr. Bout’s pencil sketches and other artwork produced from his cell in a federal penitentiary building near Marion, Ill. By the time of his arrest in 2008, Mr. Bout (pronounced “boot”) was so known that an arms-trafficking character played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 film “Lord of War” was based on his life. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Born in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, he attended a Russian military college and served as a Soviet air force officer. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Bout began making money ferrying cargo between continents. U.S. officials say he soon became one of the world’s top arms dealers, transporting weapons from the former Soviet military in Ilyushin transport planes, with a particularly lucrative business in war-torn African countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone. Mr. Bout denies that he knowingly trafficked arms. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the United States and European nations were sure that Mr. Bout’s weapons shipments were not only fueling death and misery but also violating United Nations arms embargoes. They were particularly alarmed by intelligence suggesting he may have done business with the Afghan Taliban and even Al Qaeda, charges he denies. Eventually, the United States lured Mr. Bout into a trap. In 2008, a pair of Drug Enforcement Administration agents posing as members of Colombia’s leftist FARC rebel group arranged a meeting in Bangkok with Mr. Bout to buy weapons including 30,000 AK-47 rifles, plastic explosives and surface-to-air missiles for use against Colombia’s government and the American military personnel supporting its campaign against the FARC. “Viktor Bout was ready to sell a weapons arsenal that would be the envy of some small countries,” Preet Bharara, then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said after his conviction. “He aimed to sell those weapons to terrorists for the purpose of killing Americans.” The FARC’s official status at the time as a foreign terrorist organization meant that Mr. Bout drew a mandatory federal minimum sentence of 25 years. One former U.S. official familiar with Mr. Bout’s situation said the Russian government’s interest in his freedom appeared to be personal and that he has ties to powerful people close to President Vladimir V. Putin. Another former American official pointed to a somewhat more principled reason: Mr. Bout was arrested in Thailand and extradited from there to New York. Russian officials have complained about what they call the growing “practice used by the U.S. of actually hunting down our citizens abroad and arresting them in other nations,” as Grigory Lukyantsev, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s commissioner for human rights, said in August, according to the Russian news outlet RT. The first former U.S. official said it was highly unlikely that, given the magnitude of his crimes, Mr. Bout would be freed in any deal for Ms. Griner — even if, as some have speculated, the trade were to include Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine imprisoned in Moscow since December 2018 on espionage charges. The former official said Russia had sought Mr. Bout’s release in even higher-profile cases in the past and had been firmly rejected. Both former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss their knowledge of Mr. Bout’s case publicly. Danielle Gilbert, an assistant professor of military and strategic studies at the U.S. Air Force Academy who specializes in hostage diplomacy, agreed that releasing Mr. Bout would be a difficult political proposition. But she did not rule out the idea. “It wouldn’t surprise me if they’re at least considering the possibility,” she said, noting that she does not speak for the U.S. government. Mr. Bout has at least one advocate for his release in the United States: Shira A. Scheindlin, the judge who presided over his case. In an interview, Ms. Scheindlin said that swapping Mr. Bout for Ms. Griner would be inappropriate, given the scale of his offense in relation to her alleged violation. But she said a deal that also included Mr. Whelan might even the scales. Mr. Bout has already served 11 years in prison, she noted, saying that “he was not a terrorist, in my opinion. He was a businessman.” Although she was required to impose his mandatory 25-year sentence, she added: “I thought it was too high at the time.” “So, having served as long as he has, I think the United States’ interest in punishing him has been satisfied,” she said, “and it would not be a bad equation to send him back if we get back these people who are important to us.” Even if the United States were open to such a deal, Mr. Zissou said it would not be imminent. He said he believed that Russia — which insists Ms. Griner faces legitimate charges and is not a political pawn — was determined to complete her trial before negotiating her release. “And that is likely to take a few months,” he said.",7

Mr. Kim, 41, the head of the regional military administration in the embattled southern city of Mykolaiv, has become the face of Ukraine’s resistance along the sweep of the Black Sea coast. His smile exudes a quiet confidence that says Russian missiles may hurt us, but they cannot dent the Ukrainian spirit. Four months ago, Mykolaiv was almost overrun as Russian forces surged out of annexed Crimea, taking the nearby city of Kherson. Mr. Kim responded, in daily video messages, with a phrase that became a watchword: “Good morning, we are from Ukraine!” “It was important to convey that the enemy was not as scary as it seemed, and to tell the world that we are here, that we exist,” Mr. Kim said. The message worked. Mr. Kim quickly attracted almost half a million Instagram followers. Mr. Kim attributes his calmness to his father, a man of Korean descent. Regular lessons in taekwondo instilled discipline. His decisions, and the confidence he has conveyed, have helped turn back Russian forces, hold them at bay and frustrate their desire to seize the entire Black Sea Coast.",29

Cherelle Griner said she would no longer heed the government’s requests to let U.S. officials “handle this behind the scenes,” adding that she was concerned after Brittney Griner wrote her in a letter that she was physically “weak.” “I will not be quiet anymore,” Cherelle Griner told “CBS Mornings.” “My wife is struggling and we have to help her.” Cherelle Griner said on Tuesday that the family had still not received a reply from the president to Brittney Griner’s handwritten letter, calling it “very disheartening.” Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that Mr. Biden had read the letter. In her letter to Mr. Biden, Brittney Griner urged the president to “do all you can to bring us home.” “As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey or any accomplishments, I’m terrified I might be here forever,” she said in an excerpt from the letter shared by her representatives. Brittney Griner, 31, was detained on Feb. 17 after she was accused of having hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. She was in Russia to play with UMMC Yekaterinburg, a professional women’s basketball team for which she had competed during several W.N.B.A. off-seasons. If she is convicted of the drug charges, Brittney Griner faces up to 10 years in a Russian penal colony. Her trial began Friday, and legal experts said that she was likely to be found guilty. Although Brittney Griner has not yet responded to the charges, the U.S. government classifies her as “wrongfully detained,” meaning that it believes the charges against her are falsified — perhaps intended to pressure Washington over its involvement in Ukraine. “The U.S. government continues to work aggressively — using every available means — to bring her home,” said Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, in a statement on Monday.",7
2022-07-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/07/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia.html,Brittney Griner Pleads Guilty to Drug Charges in Russian Court,"Brittney Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges in a Russian courtroom on Thursday, as the wrangling over the American basketball star’s fate shifted increasingly to the diplomatic arena — a daunting prospect for Ms. Griner’s supporters amid America’s rift with Moscow over the war in Ukraine. Appearing before a judge outside the Russian capital on the second day of her trial, Ms. Griner said she had unintentionally carried a banned substance into the country because she had packed in a hurry. The Russian authorities say they found vape cartridges with 0.7 grams of cannabis oil in her luggage when Ms. Griner arrived in February to play basketball, and she has been detained ever since, facing 10 years in prison in a penal colony. “I’d like to plead guilty, your honor. But there was no intent. I didn’t want to break the law,” Ms. Griner said in English, which was then translated into Russian, according to a Reuters reporter in the courtroom. Ms. Griner told the court she would say more on the next day of her trial, scheduled for July 14. She is charged with illegal drug possession and with smuggling a “significant amount.” By pleading guilty, Ms. Griner has potentially accelerated her case’s conclusion, clearing a path for either a deal with the United States or, perhaps, a request for clemency. With a guilty verdict an all but a foregone conclusion in a Russian legal system that heavily favors the prosecution, her best hope, experts say, is that the Biden administration secure her freedom by releasing a Russian held in the United States. The name of one prisoner in particular has emerged: Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence. But any such negotiation can take place only after the formalities of the Griner trial are over, Russian officials say. “It is clear that we have not completed the necessary judicial procedures,” a deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, told Russian news agencies on Thursday when asked about a potential exchange. “Until this happens, there are no nominal, formal or procedural grounds for any further steps.” American officials insist they are doing all they can to secure the release of Ms. Griner, 31, a seven-time W.N.B.A. All-Star, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and the first openly gay athlete signed to an endorsement contract by Nike. At Thursday’s hearing, the chargé d’affaires at the American Embassy in Moscow, Elizabeth Rood, handed Ms. Griner a letter from President Biden. “Ms. Griner was able to read that letter,” Ms. Rood told reporters outside the courtroom. “I would like again to emphasize the commitment of the U.S. government at the very highest level to bring home safely Ms. Griner and all U.S. citizens wrongfully detained.” But with tensions between the United States and Russia at their worst level in decades because of President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Biden has few options to secure her freedom. That was underscored by Mr. Ryabkov on Thursday as he made some of the most extensive comments by any Russian official about Ms. Griner’s case in the nearly five months she has spent in custody. “Hype and publicity, for all the love for this genre among modern politicians, only gets in the way in this particular instance,” Mr. Ryabkov said. “This does not just distract from the case, but creates interference in the truest sense of the word. That’s why silence is needed here.” He hinted, however, that Moscow was interested in negotiating over Ms. Griner’s fate, saying she would be helped by “a serious reading by the American side of the signals that they received from Russia, from Moscow, through specialized channels.” Mr. Ryabkov did not specify what those signals were, though Russian state media has suggested that the Kremlin might be interested in exchanging the American athlete for Mr. Bout, 55, a former Soviet military officer who made a fortune in global arms trafficking before he was caught in a federal sting operation. Without a deal, Ms. Griner could face years in prison. Arseny Levinson, a Russian lawyer who has been involved in cases similar to Ms. Griner’s, said her case was “absurd” because she clearly had not had criminal intent. But while her prosecution has political overtones, in many ways it is typical for Russia, where the law enforcement system often “imitates the fight against drug smuggling,” Mr. Levinson said. In most cases, Mr. Levinson said, Russian courts would give a suspended sentence to people charged with Ms. Griner’s crime. But her prospects may be grimmer, he said, because suspended sentences against noncitizens are harder to enforce. “As a rule, foreigners get much harsher sentences than Russians,” said Mr. Levinson, who works for a nonprofit group that helps suspects in drug-related crimes. A Russian official did note earlier this week that there was one avenue Ms. Griner might pursue. “No one is stopping Brittney Griner from making use of the appeal procedure and also from requesting clemency,” a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said. Hours after her guilty plea Thursday, it appeared her advisers might be laying the groundwork for just that. “Considering the nature of her case, the insignificant amount of the substance and B.G.’s personality and history of positive contributions to global and Russian sport, the defense hopes that the plea will be considered by the court as a mitigating factor and there will be no severe sentence,” her legal team said in a statement. Even if the United States and Russia agreed to an exchange to bring Ms. Griner home, such a deal could take years to materialize. Trevor R. Reed, an ailing former U.S. Marine held in Russia on what his family considered to be bogus assault charges, was freed in April in a prisoner swap more than two years after his arrest. Former Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former ambassador to the United Nations who has spent years working to secure hostage releases through his nonprofit organization, was involved in months of quiet but intense diplomacy to free Mr. Reed. Mr. Richardson is now working on Ms. Griner’s case, as well as that of a former Marine, Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia since 2018. Mickey Bergman, executive director of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, said in an email that Ms. Griner’s guilty plea was understandable. “We believe that any prisoner in a situation like this needs to do what they believe can help them survive the ordeal,” Mr. Bergman said in an email. “She is fighting for her life.” Ms. Rood, the American diplomat who attended Thursday’s court proceeding, said Ms. Griner had told her that “she’s eating well, she’s able to read books.” “Under the circumstances, she’s doing well,” Ms. Rood said. Ms. Griner’s lawyer, Aleksandr Boikov, said in a comment via a messaging app that his client told the court Thursday that she “was carrying substances prohibited in Russia unintentionally.” “She was packing in a hurry,” he said in a phone interview. “Cartridges appeared in her luggage because of carelessness.” After her trial began last week, Ms. Griner sent a handwritten letter to Mr. Biden asking him not to “forget about” her and other American detainees overseas. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke with Ms. Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, according to a statement released by the White House. During the call, the statement said, the president read a draft of a letter that he planned to send to Brittney Griner. He also said that his administration was pursuing “every avenue to bring Brittney home.” Cherelle Griner had publicly expressed frustration with Mr. Biden and his administration’s efforts to secure her wife’s release. In a statement Wednesday, Cherelle Griner said she was grateful to Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris “for the time they spent with me and for the commitment they expressed to getting B.G. home.” The United States government has classified Brittney Griner as “wrongfully detained” and said it would work to secure her release regardless of the outcome of the trial. Brittney Griner’s W.N.B.A. team, the Phoenix Mercury, held a rally to support her on Wednesday. “What and how I feel today is a deeper emotion than hurt,” Cherelle Griner said at the rally. “I’m frustrated. I’m frustrated that 140 days have passed since my wife has been able to speak to me, to our family, to our friends. I’m frustrated that my wife is not going to get justice. I know you all are frustrated too, that’s why you’re here.” Cherelle Griner asked for the people attending the rally, a few hundred fans according to The Associated Press, to help make sure the Biden administration knows “they have our support to do whatever is necessary” to bring her wife home. Brittney Griner’s communication with her family and friends in the United States has been limited to letters. Recently, one of her Mercury teammates, forward Brianna Turner, wrote to her, recalling memories of their time together. “One of my favorite moments wasn’t even on the court,” Ms. Turner said. “We went to Indiana and rented Lime scooters and we just rode all around downtown.” Ms. Turner also told her teammate that she would be an honorary All-Star this season. Because Ms. Griner has been detained since February, she has not played in the W.N.B.A. this season. “And B.G. has a great sense of humor — she told me that she probably would have the worst stat line, and she wouldn’t be in the game,” Ms. Turner said, laughing. Then she turned serious again: “We need to get her back home. She deserves to be back home. She needs to be back with her family and with her friends.”",7

Marc Fogel, a teacher who previously worked for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, was convicted of drug smuggling, according to his family and Russian news outlets. He was sentenced in June — by the same court that is handling Ms. Griner’s case — to 14 years in a high-security penal colony. Mr. Fogel, 60, worked at the Anglo-American School of Moscow and was arrested in August when customs officers at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow found marijuana in his luggage after he arrived from New York. The cannabis, according to a statement from the Russian Interior Ministry, had been packaged in a container carrying contact lenses, and cannabis oil was also found in e-cigarette cartridges. In a statement shared by Mr. Fogel’s wife, Jane, his family said that he had been carrying less than 20 grams of marijuana, which they said had been recommended to him by a doctor in the United States to help treat a long-term, debilitating spinal condition. Mr. Fogel pleaded guilty to charges of smuggling and illegally possessing, transporting and producing drugs, according to the family statement, which called the 14-year sentence “grossly disproportionate” compared with other Russian court cases involving similar quantities of marijuana. Russia’s Interior Ministry has said that Mr. Fogel and his wife had diplomatic status until May 2021, and that Mr. Fogel could have used that status to open a drug-smuggling route into Moscow. The statement from his family called those allegations “outrageous and blatantly false” and said that Mr. Fogel had “an exemplary track record as a teacher.” “It is clear that Marc is the victim of a politically motivated prosecution designed to stimulate anti-American xenophobia among the Russian population,” it added. Mr. Fogel has not had consular access since November, according to the family statement. It said he had since been diagnosed with anxiety and depression during his detention, and it accused the Russian authorities of ignoring repeated requests by Mr. Fogel for medical assistance. Although Mr. Fogel’s Russian lawyer had requested medical records from his detention facility, they were told that none exist, the statement said. Unlike in Ms. Griner’s case, the Biden administration has not publicly classified Mr. Fogel as “wrongfully detained,” a designation that would move his case under the supervision of the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. A spokesperson for the State Department said in an email that U.S. officials were aware of and monitoring the detention of an American citizen in Russia, but they declined to comment further, citing privacy concerns. Speaking outside the courtroom where Ms. Griner’s trial was taking place on Thursday, Elizabeth Rood, the chargé d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said the Biden administration was committed to bringing home “all U.S. citizens wrongfully detained.” Ms. Rood made no specific mention of Mr. Fogel, and U.S. officials have not commented publicly on his sentencing.",7
2022-07-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/10/world/europe/brittney-griner-wnba-all-star-game.html,Brittney Griner Is Honored by Fellow Players at W.N.B.A. All-Star Game,"CHICAGO — Brittney Griner’s fellow W.N.B.A. players honored her during the league’s All-Star Game in Chicago on Sunday, wearing jerseys bearing her name and number for the second half. Griner, who had played for the Phoenix Mercury since 2013, has been detained in Russia on drug charges since February. On Sunday, with Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, seated at courtside, the All-Stars lined up after halftime in matching No. 42 jerseys with “Griner” on the back. Several players hugged Cherelle Griner, who said during the ESPN broadcast that she was grateful they had not forgotten her wife. A’ja Wilson, a Las Vegas Aces forward who was one of the team captains, said wearing the jerseys was “a statement in itself.” “We are not going to stop until everyone understands how serious this really is,” she said. Griner, a seven-time All-Star who won a championship with the Mercury in 2014 and has two Olympic gold medals, was also named an honorary starter for the game by the league. Griner had been in Russia to play for UMMC Yekaterinburg, a professional team, when she was accused of having hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. Last week, she pleaded guilty to the drug charges, but she has not been convicted formally. She faces up to 10 years in a penal colony. The U.S. State Department has said that Griner was “wrongfully detained” and that it would work to secure her release. Dozens of W.N.B.A. players also compete for international teams, often earning significantly more overseas than they do in the W.N.B.A. But Griner’s detention has highlighted a potential danger of doing so. On Sunday, the W.N.B.A. commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, said at a news conference that Griner’s situation had affected players’ decisions about international play. Several players who usually compete in Russia have signed with teams in other countries for the coming off-season. “We’re not going to say you can’t go play overseas,” Engelbert said. W.N.B.A. players are free to play overseas, but can be fined for showing up late to training camp or the start of the season — a common occurrence because of the international schedule. Starting next year, players can be barred from league competition if they are not back for the beginning of the W.N.B.A. season. The league and teams also offer incentives to encourage players to stay in the United States, such as marketing deals and bonuses. Engelbert said the league planned to spend $1.5 million on player marketing deals this cycle, an increase of several hundred thousand dollars over the last cycle.",7
2022-07-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/world/brittney-griner-russia-detention-release.html,Brittney Griner and the Limits of American Power,"Brittney Griner is many things. A truly extraordinary basketball player. The embodiment of the promises made by feminism, generally, and Title IX, specifically, to a generation of American girls. A wealthy celebrity. An L.G.B.T. icon. And now, she is also a living symbol of the limits of American power, and of the American government’s finite ability to protect its citizens abroad. On Feb. 17, Griner was detained at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport. Russian authorities, claiming to have found vape cartridges in her luggage containing a small amount of hashish oil, arrested her on drug smuggling charges. Seven days later, on Feb. 24, Russia invaded Ukraine. The U.S. State Department considers Griner “wrongfully detained” and has made diplomatic efforts to secure her release. So far, the U.S. has not been successful. As outrage mounts over her continued detention, many in America have wondered publicly if officials could be doing more to secure Griner’s release. LeBron James, the argument goes, would have been freed long ago. The theory that somewhere in the White House there is a lever marked “pull in case of LeBron” — a sort of V.I.P. lane for exercising American power — is grounded in the optimistic belief that such power exists. In fact, experts say, the reality is simpler but more disturbing: Sometimes there is no LeBron lever. American power is limited, and although political will can channel it, it cannot create more of it. And so for Griner, and other Americans held overseas, the road home may be long, and slow. In many contexts, American citizenship is still a powerful form of protection overseas. “When you’re messing with Americans, you’re really testing the entirety of the U.S. might,” said Luke Hartig, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council, who now advises several organizations working to free U.S. citizens held overseas. “That can be things like the ability of the U.S. to use military power against you, sanctions against you, diplomatic tools against you.” But for countries hostile to the United States, such as Russia, Iran, or Syria — who are already under U.S. sanctions, engaged in direct or proxy conflicts, and locked in complex diplomatic negotiations — that calculus can be different. Taking American prisoners can be a form of leverage: a valuable asset that can be exchanged on the shadowy market of hostage diplomacy. That puts the United States in a bind. Negotiations can secure the release of Americans. But offering a quid pro quo for prisoners’ release can create an incentive for hostile states and other armed groups to detain even more Americans. In part for that reason, American officials often say publicly that the United States does not negotiate with terrorists. But while there are some hard limits — it is illegal to give cash payments to a designated terrorist organization, for example — other forms of exchange do go forward. For instance, in 2015 the U.S. released five senior Taliban officials from the American prison camp at Guantánamo Bay in order to secure the release of Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier kidnapped by the Taliban. The released prisoners became high-ranking officials in the Taliban government in exile. “We have this quite horrifying trend of Americans being arrested under the color and guise of law by the United States’ worst adversaries around the world,” said Danielle A. Gilbert, an assistant professor of Military & Strategic Studies at the U.S. Air Force Academy, who is literally writing the book on the dynamics of hostage taking in international politics. “And at the moment, the very thing that the United States government has to do to bring people home is the very thing that’s going to advertise for the rest of the world that this is a successful strategy, and they should keep doing it.” There is a myth etched deeply into American politics that showing sufficient resolve and political will is enough to accomplish foreign-policy goals, including securing hostage releases, without painful concessions or negotiations. It shows up, for instance, in claims that the Iran hostage crisis ended in 1981 because of Ronald Reagan’s perceived strength as a wielder of American power. (In fact, the release was negotiated by the Carter administration.) The myth suggests that safety is available to Americans, at home and abroad, if they simply elect a steadfast president. But the grim reality is that complicated geopolitical standoffs may not be possible to resolve quickly, or at all. Cases like Griner’s can take months or even years to resolve, Gilbert said. Trevor Reed, another American detained by Russia, was held for two years on what appear to be bogus charges of assault before the White House secured his release in a prisoner swap after he fell ill with tuberculosis. Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges, has been held in a Russian prison since 2018. His friends and family are calling for him to be included in any deal for Griner’s release. The longest-held American prisoner in Iran, Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman, has been detained since 2015. “It doesn’t cost the Russian or the Iranian government anything to keep holding on to the Americans for much longer,” Gilbert said. “They are just hoping that the pressure builds for the United States to give in to egregious demands.”",7
2022-07-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/world/asia/fake-indian-cricket-league-russia.html,Fake Indian Cricket League Swindles Russian Gamblers,"There were floodlights, high-definition cameras and umpires with walkie-talkies pinned to their shoulders. The cricket players wore colorful uniforms. The broadcast had the voices of recognized commentators, and the logo of the globally recognized television channel: the BBC. But this was no Indian Premier League, the lucrative cricket tournament that generates hundreds of millions of dollars every year. It was an elaborate fraud, turning a large farm in a small village in the western Indian state of Gujarat into an arena of sporting excitement. The target? Russians betting on the winning odds of an unfamiliar sport far from home. Police officials in Gujarat said over the weekend that they had broken up the scheme, which was run by four local men who had swindled thousands of dollars from Russian bettors for 14 days. The fake league was given a name close enough to the real one: The Indian Cricket Premier League. “It was all hoaxes,” said Achal Tyagi, a top police official overseeing the investigation. “We have arrested four people and also are investigating some Indians living in Russia, who are involved in the scam.” News of the audacious hoax ricocheted around social media in India and the wider cricket world, shocking fans of a sport that is known as a “gentleman’s game” and that has created fierce international rivalry, huge cricket stars and lucrative profits. About 24 “players” were involved in the hoax. The men on the field were, in fact, unemployed village boys and construction workers. The “broadcast” was streamed on YouTube, and the winners of the match decided in advance. The fake matches were played in the village of Molipur. Videos of the purported matches showed players wearing jerseys of the same colors worn by I.P.L. teams like the Chennai Super Kings and the Mumbai Indians. The cricket counterfeiters downloaded crowd-noise sound effects to enhance the online spectators’ experience. Investigators said the players told them that the men acting as umpires took instructions on walkie-talkies from organizers sitting at the edge of the ground with their laptops. In turn, they discreetly instructed players when to bowl a slow ball to a batsman or get out to help members of the gang earn more money from bets. Though the players realized the matches were fixed, investigators said, they continued the ruse for the equivalent of about $5 — an amount of money that, for jobless young men in rural India, was pretty good. They have not been charged. “They were given a uniform and promised 400 rupees for each match,” said Tinku Rathod, a farmhand in Molipur. “They were all happy.” Police officers said that through the messaging app Telegram, the organizers of the scheme accepted bets from many cities in Russia. An Indian man hundreds of miles away was hired to mimic the voice of a famous Indian cricket commentator, Harsha Bhogle, who often does commentary for the real premier league. The fake Mr. Bhogle was released. The Indian Premier League, created in 2007, is among the world’s most valuable sports properties. In India, it has turned the once-staid game into a commercial juggernaut, luring the world’s best players with million-dollar contracts. Last month, India’s governing body for cricket sold the television and digital broadcasting rights for a record $6.2 billion. But the league has also been embroiled in controversies with betting scandals, leading to the suspension of two teams for two years in 2013. The fake league began the hoax games about three weeks after the real league wrapped up its games in May, the authorities said. The league has not publicly addressed the hoax. Investigators were alerted to the scam by a local police officer, who had noticed suspicious matches being played during mornings and evenings with floodlights on. On Thursday, when officers from a special investigation team of the Gujarat police arrived on the fake grounds, they checked the phones of players and laptops of the organizers and found multiple Telegram channels. The officers soon realized that an elaborate betting scam run by four men sitting near the ground was unfolding, and that they were being handled by another Indian man working in Russia. Mr. Tyagi, the police officer, said that during questioning, one organizer who had returned to Molipur, his native village, after working in a pub in Moscow famous for betting, revealed that in Russia, a fellow Indian had suggested he start a fake league in his village to make money. “He was in constant touch with his partner in Russia,” Mr. Tyagi said. “These are new criminals with a technological bent of mind.” The four men have been charged with criminal conspiracy and gambling, officials told reporters. When the suspects were caught, the fake league matches were in the semifinals, with just one more to go before the finals. Then, after the ruse was revealed, the YouTube channel went dark.",29
2022-07-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/us/politics/biden-mbs-saudi-arabia.html,Biden Mideast Trip Fraught With Political Perils,"Follow the latest news on Biden’s trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia. JERUSALEM — President Biden is traveling to Israel on Wednesday for a four-day trip to the Middle East to try to slow down Iran’s nuclear program, speed up the flow of oil to American pumps, and reshape the relationship with Saudi Arabia without seeming to embrace a crown prince who stands accused of flagrant human rights abuses. All three efforts are fraught with political dangers for a president who knows the region well, but returns for the first time in six years with far less leverage than he would like to shape events. His 18-month long negotiation to restore the 2015 Iran nuclear deal has ground to a stop, stymying the diplomatic effort to force Tehran to ship out of the country most of the nuclear fuel it is now enriching to near-bomb-grade levels. And while no explicit deal is expected to be announced on raising Saudi oil production — out of concern that it might come across as unseemly, a reward for easing the crown prince’s return to the diplomatic fold — that is likely to come in a month or two, officials say. Administration officials know they will get harsh criticism from within their own party when the inevitable photos appear of the president meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, less than two years after Mr. Biden promised to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” on the international stage. That promise was prompted by the killing of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist, in 2018, in an complex plot that the C.I.A. says was directly approved by Prince Mohammed. Mr. Biden has often cast this era in history as a contest between democracy and autocracy, and barred Cuba and Venezuela from a recent summit of the Americas in Los Angeles for their repressive practices. But he has justified visiting Saudi Arabia as an exercise in realism. “My aim was to reorient — but not rupture — the relationship,” Mr. Biden wrote in an opinion piece in The Washington Post last weekend. Saudi “energy resources are vital for mitigating the impact on global supplies of Russia’s war in Ukraine,” he said, in his only acknowledgment of the reality that Prince Mohammed’s strategy — wait until the United States needed Saudi Arabia again — was paying off. There is also an element of superpower maneuvering to the trip. Mr. Biden made it clear when he came to office that he wanted to de-emphasize the American focus on the Middle East, and focus on China — a reflection of his belief that Washington wasted 20 years when it should have been focusing on a true peer competitor. But the trip is also partly about stemming China’s inroads into the region. Last week, Riyadh and Washington quietly signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on building a next-generation 5G cellular network in Saudi Arabia. That is designed to box out Huawei, China’s 5G champion. The politics of the war in Ukraine will also be in background. Mr. Biden’s aides made clear that they were annoyed in the spring when the Israeli government insisted on taking a largely neutral stance on the war, insisting that was the only way for its prime minister, Naftali Bennett, to keep an open line to President Vladimir V. Putin. On Monday, as Mr. Biden was preparing to leave, his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, revealed for the first time that intelligence agencies had concluded that Iran — Israel’s primary adversary — was planning to aid Russia in its battle against Ukraine. He said Iran was preparing to deliver to Russia hundreds of drones, or U.A.V.s, some capable of executing attacks. “Our information indicates that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with up to several hundred U.A.V.s, including weapons-capable U.A.V.s, on an expedited timeline,” Mr. Sullivan said as an almost throwaway line at the top of his remarks Monday afternoon. “Our information further indicates that Iran is preparing to train Russian forces to use these U.A.V.s with initial training sessions slated to begin as soon as early July,” he said. Mr. Sullivan cautioned that “it’s unclear whether Iran has delivered any of these U.A.V.s to Russia already,” but said “this is just one example of how Russia is looking to countries like Iran for capabilities that are also being used” in attacks on Saudi Arabia. Mr. Sullivan’s primary motive in revealing the Iranian operation was to warn Tehran and Moscow that the United States is watching. But with Mr. Biden’s visit expected to open with a demonstration of new Israeli capabilities to use laser weapons against drones and missiles, it appeared also intended to send a message to the Israeli government about more vigorously backing Ukraine. It also gives Mr. Biden and the caretaker prime minister who will serve as his host, Yair Lapid, a common point of agreement in how to confront Iran, amid continuing behind-the-scenes jostling over how to handle a crucial turn in Iran’s nuclear program. Israel vociferously objected to the 2015 nuclear agreement, and the prime minister at the time, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke to Congress about the need to block it. (Many of his intelligence and military chiefs disagreed, and later said they thought the agreement, which forced Iran to ship 97 percent of its fuel stockpiles out of the country, had bought them years.) When President Donald J. Trump pulled out of the accord in 2018, it touched off a new surge in the Iranian nuclear program. It has now produced a considerable amount of uranium at near-bomb-grade purity — something it never did prior to the 2015 accord — and Israel has stepped up its sabotage campaign, blowing up Iranian facilities. In response, Iran is speeding the development of new, underground facilities. Officially, Israel opposes a renewal of the agreement — though it appears to be a moot issue. The talks have been stalled for months, with Mr. Biden refusing a demand from Iran that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps be removed from Washington’s list of terrorist organizations. Robert Malley, the chief American negotiator, who the Iranians have refused to meet face to face, told NPR recently that “whether they are interested or not, they’re going to have to decide sooner or later, because at some point the deal will be a thing of the past.” It may already be beyond the point of resuscitating. In the early spring, Mr. Malley and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said there were just weeks, maybe a month or so, to reach a deal before Iran’s advances, and the knowledge gained as it installed advanced centrifuges to produce uranium in high volume, would make the 2015 agreement outdated. Now, four months later, Mr. Biden’s aides decline to explain how they let that deadline go by — and they still insist that reviving the deal is more valuable than abandoning it. Rafael Grossi, the director of the world’s nuclear inspector, said earlier this month in Australia that he believed the Iranian program had now gotten so advanced that others in the region would be tempted to copy it. Saudi Arabia has said it reserved the right to build any nuclear infrastructure that Iran builds. “We are now in a situation where Iran’s neighbors could start to fear the worst and plan accordingly,” Mr. Grossi said. “There are countries in the region today looking very carefully at what is happening with Iran, and tensions in the region are rising.” He added that political leaders had on occasion said “they would actively seek nuclear weapons if Iran were to pose a nuclear threat.” For public consumption, the White House has argued that Mr. Biden’s decision to go to Saudi Arabia was driven by a whole range of national security issues, not just oil. But oil is in fact the most urgent reason for the trip at a time of high gas prices. Sensitive to the appearance of sacrificing a principled stand on human rights for cheaper energy, the president does not plan to announce any oil deal during his stop in Jeddah. But the two sides have an understanding that Saudi Arabia will ramp up production once a current quota agreement expires in September, just in time for the fall midterm election campaign, according to current and former American officials. Martin Indyk, a former Middle East diplomat for Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, said that the exact amounts were still uncertain, but that Saudi Arabia is expected to increase production by about 750,000 barrels a day and the United Arab Emirates would follow suit with an additional 500,000 barrels a day, for a combined 1.25 million. How much that would push down prices at the pump in the United States is unclear, and it may not be quick enough or deep enough to change the public mood before November. “That will be the kind of deal that justifies the trip, but since they’re not going to be announcing it, it leaves the president in a situation where he has to justify it in other terms, and so therefore the focus on Israel and normalization and integrating defense,” Mr. Indyk said. “The president’s defensiveness on this is wrongheaded. He should embrace it.” Instead, Mr. Biden has tried to make the case that he is not visiting Saudi Arabia so much as meeting with multiple leaders from the region in the form of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a group of six states led by Saudi Arabia, as well as the leaders of three other Arab nations, Egypt, Iraq and Jordan. But White House officials are resigned to the fact that Mr. Biden will not be able to avoid Prince Mohammed altogether, and there will be that damaging photo — damaging, at least, for Mr. Biden. For the crown prince the picture will be invaluable as he seeks to rehabilitate his international image. Some analysts said that alone may be enough for the Saudis. “I think the odds the Saudis would try to embarrass the president in this trip are relatively low, because I think it would damage precisely the kinds of strategic things they’re trying to do,” said Jon B. Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “So I think their incentives for cooperation are high.”",8
2022-07-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/world/europe/brittney-griner-trial-russia.html,"Witnesses Testify in Brittney Griner Trial, Which Is Expected to Resume Friday","Witnesses for the defense praised Brittney Griner’s athletic prowess and character on Thursday in a courtroom outside Moscow, where the American basketball star — now one of the world’s most famous prisoners — is facing a possible 10-year sentence on drug charges. Maksim Ryabkov, the director of UMMC Yekaterinburg, the professional Russian team that Ms. Griner has played for, testified to her “outstanding abilities as a player and personal contribution to the strengthening the team’s spirit,” said Ms. Griner’s lawyer, Maria Blagovolina, a partner with the firm Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners. Ms. Griner’s trial resumed a week after she pleaded guilty to drug charges. The Russian authorities accused her of having a vape cartridge with hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow on Feb. 17, where she had traveled to play with UMMC Yekaterinburg during the W.N.B.A. off-season. In the Russian justice system, trials go on even when defendants plead guilty, but Ms. Griner’s lawyers have said they hoped her plea would make the court more lenient. The trial was expected to continue on Friday. The harshest outcome — a possible 10-year sentence in a penal colony — remains a possibility even after Ms. Griner’s lawyers contended that she packed the smoking cartridges by mistake. Despite pressure for the United States to make a deal to free her, possibly through a prisoner exchange, Russian officials have emphasized that no negotiations could occur until the proceedings are finished, and played down the possibility of any imminent resolution to Ms. Griner’s case. Asked about the possibility of a prisoner swap, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said on Thursday: “We never discuss issues of exchanges.” The Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria V. Zakharova, repeated that any negotiations around Ms. Griner ought to be done outside of the spotlight. She added that such talks could only bear fruit after a verdict had been brought in her case, and urged U.S. officials “to abandon futile attempts to put pressure on us,” the Interfax news agency reported. “The trial of Griner continues, and until it ends it is generally premature to discuss any options for her return home,” Ms. Zakharova said. Ms. Griner, 31, one of the W.N.B.A.’s brightest stars and a two-time Olympic gold medalist with the U.S. women’s basketball team, has become caught up in Washington’s increasingly acrimonious relationship with Moscow amid the war in Ukraine. With legal experts saying that a guilty verdict is all but a foregone conclusion in a justice system that heavily favors the prosecution, Ms. Griner’s chances at freedom could depend on whether U.S. officials can negotiate her release, or if she can obtain clemency after a verdict is reached. Her best hope, experts say, is that the Biden administration carries out an exchange by releasing a Russian jailed in the United States. Russian media outlets have linked her case to Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer known as the “Merchant of Death,” who is serving a 25-year federal sentence in Illinois for conspiring to sell weapons to people who said they planned to kill Americans. Amid criticism that Washington is not doing enough to secure her release, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken has vowed that the U.S. government will not back down until Ms. Griner and other “wrongfully detained Americans” are brought home. The case is also bound up in issues of race, gender and sexuality. Ms. Griner is Black and openly gay, and her many supporters have worried that her chances for a fair trial are even more remote in Russia, a country where gay people face routine discrimination. The American basketball superstar LeBron James recently appeared to criticize the U.S. government’s efforts to bring Ms. Griner home. “Now, how can she feel like America has her back?” Mr. James said in a trailer for an episode of his television show, “The Shop: Uninterrupted.” “I would be feeling like, ‘Do I even want to go back to America?’” After facing a backlash, he clarified in a tweet on Tuesday that he “wasn’t knocking our beautiful country.”",7
2022-07-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/world/middleeast/biden-israel-food-crisis-ukraine.html,"‘Putin’s War Must Be a Strategic Failure,’ Biden Says in Israel","JERUSALEM — President Biden restated his determination that Russia fail in its Ukraine ambitions, speaking on Thursday during a four-day visit to Israel and Saudi Arabia in which he and other leaders discussed the international response to the war and the global grain shortage it has exacerbated. “Putin’s assault on Ukraine is a challenge to the peace and stability everywhere in the world,” Mr. Biden said at a news conference in Jerusalem after meeting with Prime Minister Yair Lapid of Israel. “Putin’s war must be a strategic failure.” “The free world must sustain a resolve to help Ukraine defend its democracy,” Mr. Biden said, adding that “the United States will continue to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people who have been devastated and displaced by the Russian violence.” Ukraine policy has been a point of friction between Israel and the United States. Israel has been wary of being too critical of Russia, lest it provoke Moscow into causing problems for Israeli military strategy in the Middle East. And that caution has occasionally set off U.S. criticism. Israel has expressed repeated support for Ukraine, whose president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is Jewish. It has sent humanitarian aid, pledged to send protective equipment, set up a field hospital in western Ukraine and voted to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council. But it has not sent weapons or enforced formal sanctions on Russian oligarchs. Naftali Bennett, who was Israel’s prime minister for most of the time since the war began in late February, generally avoided direct criticism of Russia. He pointedly left condemnations of the Kremlin to his foreign minister, Yair Lapid, who succeeded him as prime minister this month. Israel has portrayed that delicate balancing act as an attempt to allow Israel to mediate between the two sides, to avoid exposing Jews in both Russia and Ukraine to antisemitic attacks, and to maintain its delicate relationship with the Russian military in Syria. For much of the past decade, the Israeli Air Force has struck military targets in Syria without interference, trying to stem the flow of arms that Iran sends to its proxies in Syria and Lebanon. But Russia also maintains a significant military presence in Syria, and Israel needs Moscow’s blessing to continue to operate there with ease.",8
2022-07-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/opinion/brittney-griner-russia.html,Opinion | Brittney Griner Is Trapped and Alone. Where’s Your Outrage?,"When unspeakable tragedies occur, people often call for unity. They’ll say, “We are Boston Strong” or “Je suis Charlie” or “We are [insert wherever or whomever the unthinkable has happened to].” It’s a laudable instinct to claim solidarity with those who have suffered, to imagine we truly understand the ways we are all connected, to proclaim that what affects one of us affects all of us. With the W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner wrongfully detained in Russia for more than four months because a small amount of hashish oil was allegedly found in her luggage, I’m wondering why we haven’t seen more of a groundswell of demands for her release. In the attention economy, Ms. Griner’s predicament seems as if it’s being somewhat ignored. The media is, at least, covering the story, and some rights groups and athletes have spoken up, but that isn’t enough. More public pressure for action is necessary. “We are B.G.” should be a viral rallying cry, but it isn’t — and why? Is it misogyny? Racism? Homophobia? The unholy trifecta? Ms. Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges, but explained she did not intentionally break Russian law. Now she faces up to 10 years in a penal colony. She is trapped and alone, her plight unimaginable. There are, in fact, reportedly more than 60 Americans who are wrongfully detained abroad, all wondering when or if they will be saved. They have families who are working tirelessly for their return. They all deserve our compassion and attention. Ms. Griner is receiving more attention than most, but that’s not saying much. I suppose I have a particular empathy for her because as a tall, tattooed, Black, queer woman, I understand that we are often invisible and overlooked despite standing out. Each time Ms. Griner is transported to court, a two-and a-half-hour journey each way, she is put in a cage too small to accommodate her large frame, according to Ms. Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner. She communicates with her family through letters. In the few images of Ms. Griner released since her detention, she looks ashen. No one should be treated this way, famous or not. But Ms. Griner is famous, a highly decorated basketball player­ — an eight-time W.N.B.A. All-Star. She won Olympic gold as part of the U.S. team in Rio in 2016 and in Tokyo in 2021. During the several years she played for UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia, she helped lead the team to EuroLeague titles. Although a Kremlin spokesman has denied that Brittney Griner’s imprisonment is politically motivated, President Vladimir Putin surely knows her value as a pawn. There has been talk that Moscow may be willing to trade Ms. Griner for a Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout, who’s serving a 25-year sentence in the United States. Given Ms. Griner’s relatively minor infraction, the political cost of making such an exchange for a man nicknamed the “Merchant of Death” is incredibly high. But the human cost of doing nothing would be even higher. The longer she remains a pawn, the more her humanity is erased. Recently, Ms. Griner wrote President Biden a letter in which she expressed her fear. “Please don’t forget about me and the other American detainees,” she wrote. She also said that she had a new understanding of freedom now that hers has been taken. After months of tireless advocacy, Cherelle Griner has finally spoken with Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, both of whom pledged to do everything possible to bring B.G. home. At 6-foot-9, the muscular and tattooed Ms. Griner cuts an imposing figure. But when I spoke with Cherelle Griner, she told me, “B.G. is just more than a basketball player. Right now people just see her as No. 42, the person that goes out there and is aggressive on the court.” Brittney, she went on, “is a person with feelings just like everybody else. And so she cares about her family, her friends. She’s very intentional with any and everything that she does with the people in her life. And for over 130 days, they’ve stripped her of that.” Cherelle’s words were a stark reminder of what’s at stake for Brittney, of how increasingly vulnerable she is. This infuriating situation also highlights the problems with the economies of women’s sports. W.N.B.A. players are paid a small fraction of what their N.B.A. counterparts earn. To supplement their income, many women play abroad during the American off season. During a post-game news conference, Coach Vanessa Nygaard of the Phoenix Mercury, Ms. Griner’s team, remarked that if Ms. Griner were LeBron James, she would already be home. The painful truth is that he would not be in this situation with the fame and remuneration that far eclipse what female players receive. At the W.N.B.A. All-Star game this month, players on both teams wore Ms. Griner’s number during the second half, reminding the audience of her detainment while honoring her. LeBron James and other N.B.A. players have used their platforms to bring attention to her situation, but too many others have stayed quiet. We should all be calling for action. Write your senators and representatives, encouraging them to lobby the Biden administration on Ms. Griner’s behalf. Demand action on social media. We must not forget about Ms. Griner’s detention, nor the other Americans in similar circumstances, amid the challenges many of us are facing in our own lives. We are B.G. We need to repeat that mantra until there is enough of a groundswell to bring her home. We are not free until all of us are free.

2022-07-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/world/brittney-griner-trial-russia.html,"Brittney Griner Had Doctor Note for Drug She Brought to Russia, Lawyers Say","Brittney Griner’s lawyers argued on Friday that the American basketball star had a doctor’s note recommending the drug that she mistakenly carried into Russia, where she has been detained for nearly five months amid Moscow’s escalating tensions with Washington over the war in Ukraine. As Ms. Griner’s trial on drug charges resumed at a courtroom outside Moscow, her defense team provided medical documents showing that she had a medical note recommending cannabis for chronic pain, according to Reuters. The Russian authorities accused Ms. Griner in February of having two vape cartridges with hashish oil — a cannabis derivative — in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. The 31-year-old Phoenix Mercury star and two-time Olympic gold medalist had traveled there to play with UMMC Yekaterinburg, a Russian team, during the W.N.B.A. off-season. She was charged with willfully smuggling the vape cartridges, violating Russian laws prohibiting the import of narcotics. Ms. Griner pleaded guilty last week, telling the judge she had “no intent” to break the law. In the Russian justice system, the trial process continues even after defendants plead guilty. Her lawyers have argued that she had packed in a hurry. At the hearing on Friday, they provided evidence including “a doctor’s appointment for the substance that, due to an oversight of B.G., remained among her belongings when crossing the border,” according to a statement from Maria Blagovolina, a partner in the law firm Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners. Ms. Griner has found herself caught in the growing acrimony between the Kremlin and the Biden administration, which has pledged to do everything it can to secure her freedom. Facing a possible 10-year sentence if convicted, in a justice system that heavily favors the prosecution, Ms. Griner has expressed fear that she may never be freed, and wrote in a recent letter to President Biden: “Please don’t forget about me.” Her case has galvanized support in the American sports world and beyond. As she sat behind bars in the courtroom on Friday, Ms. Griner, clad in a Nirvana T-shirt, held up a photo of W.N.B.A. players wearing her number during last week’s All-Star Game in Chicago. Her lawyers also submitted evidence including commendations from Russian and U.S. organizations. A day earlier, the director of UMMC Yekaterinburg, the team doctor and a fellow player testified in her defense, praising her athletic ability and character. Despite growing pressure for the United States to make a deal to free Ms. Griner, possibly through a prisoner exchange, Russian officials have played down the possibility of an imminent resolution, and insisted that no negotiations could occur until the legal proceedings are finished.",7
2022-07-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/17/us/politics/griner-wrongful-detentions.html,Brittney Griner’s Case Draws Attention to ‘Wrongful Detentions’,"WASHINGTON — Brittney Griner. Austin Tice. The Citgo 6. And now, potentially, three American military veterans who were captured by enemy forces after traveling to Ukraine to fight Russia. They are among nearly 50 Americans who the State Department believes are wrongfully detained by foreign governments. At least a dozen more Americans are being held as hostages — including by extremist groups — or on criminal charges that their families dispute. American citizens are increasingly attractive targets for U.S. adversaries — including China, Russia, Iran and Venezuela — looking to use them as political pawns in battles with the United States. Ms. Griner, a professional basketball player, is perhaps the most high-profile American to be snared by what the State Department has called dubious charges. She was detained in February at an airport near Moscow after authorities said they found hashish oil in her luggage. Her arrest came just days before Russian forces invaded Ukraine, which is being armed by the United States and its allies. This past week, Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, said the Biden administration would continue to work to make sure that Ms. Griner, Paul Whelan — another American held by Moscow — and “all unjustly detained Americans and hostages are home safely.” Here is a look at “wrongful detentions,” as they are known, and some of the struggles of Americans held overseas. Generally, an American who is held by a foreign government for the purposes of influencing U.S. policy or extracting political or economic concessions from Washington is considered “wrongfully detained.” In these cases, negotiations between the United States and the other government are key to securing the American’s freedom. The State Department does not release the precise number of Americans that it has determined are in that category. But a senior State Department official said there were 40 to 50 wrongfully detained Americans abroad. “Hostage” is a blanket term used to describe Americans who have been blocked from leaving a foreign country. Some are held by terrorist organizations or other groups with whom the State Department does not have diplomatic relations. In these cases, the F.B.I. and other intelligence or law enforcement agencies lead negotiations. According to the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, named for a journalist who was killed in Syria by the Islamic State in 2014, 64 Americans are wrongfully detained abroad or being held hostage. A wrongful detention can span a few days or weeks, or last years. One of the longest-detained Americans is Mr. Tice, a freelance journalist who was captured in Syria in 2012. U.S. officials believe he is being held by the Syrian government, which denies it. In a CBS News interview on Wednesday, Mr. Tice’s parents urged the Biden administration to meet with Syrian government officials even though diplomatic relations between the two countries have been formally suspended since 2012. “That’s what’s going to bring Austin home,” said his mother, Debra Tice. President Biden met with Mr. Tice’s parents in May and promised “to work through all available avenues” for his release, according to a White House statement. Siamak Namazi, an American detained in Iran, said last month that the Iranian government would apparently free him and its other captives, including his father, only if the Biden administration offered “sufficient incentives.” “Tehran seems to be demanding more for our release than the White House can stomach,” Mr. Namazi, who has been held in Iran since 2015, wrote in a guest essay for The New York Times. The State Department’s Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs handles negotiations for wrongfully detained Americans. The office has grown to about 25 negotiators and other officials in recent years, up from five, as more Americans are detained by foreign governments. Each case is assigned an expert on the country where the person is being held. The process is extremely difficult, said the senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition that he not be named to describe some functions of the office. All of the foreign governments that are detaining Americans have, at best, rocky relations with the United States. In some cases, like Iran, messages are sent through other governments that serve as intermediaries; in others, U.S. officials work through levels of the foreign government’s bureaucracy to get to someone senior enough to influence a decision. The communications are intended to reinforce the consequences of continuing to hold Americans captive, the official said. He said foreign governments often felt as if they were the aggrieved party and usually began with demands that he called unreasonable. The State Department does not provide legal assistance to the detained Americans or their families. A 2015 directive by President Barack Obama prohibits promising “ransom, prisoner releases, policy changes or other acts of concession” to bring detained Americans home. The policy takes away key incentives for hostage takers to detain Americans in the first place and prevents the exchange of U.S. revenue or other resources that could be used for other nefarious activities, the document notes. But there have been numerous prisoner swaps with foreign governments to free detained Americans — most recently Trevor Reed, who was held for more than two years in Russia before his release in April. A Russian pilot who was imprisoned in the United States on cocaine trafficking charges was simultaneously released as part of the negotiations. Mr. Reed had suffered from tuberculosis while in prison, making his case all the more urgent. Similarly, U.S. officials late last month tried to persuade the Venezuelan government to release Matthew Heath from an underground prison cell for humanitarian reasons after his family said he had tried to kill himself. President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela has refused, although he freed two other Americans in March. Iran is holding Mr. Namazi and three other Americans while Tehran negotiates with world powers over limiting its nuclear program. The chief U.S. negotiator, Robert Malley, has said the fate of the detained Americans is not directly tied to the talks. “But I will say it is very hard for us to imagine getting back into the nuclear deal while four innocent Americans are being held hostage by Iran,” he told Reuters in January. It depends. In some cases, major displays of public pressure might not help matters, the senior State Department official said. Fear of provoking an already hostile government is among the reasons negotiations are conducted in secret. Family members of many wrongfully detained Americans also are cautious about discussing the details of cases as relayed to them by the State Department or other officials — partially for security reasons and partially to ensure the U.S. government does not hold back any updates. But some have set up advocacy networks to pressure the U.S. government to negotiate more aggressively and, above all, to make certain that their loved ones are not forgotten. “We wake up every day knowing that they are suffering far more than we could imagine — so much so that many of them dread waking up at all,” the relatives of 19 Americans captured abroad wrote in a letter to Mr. Biden in June. Ms. Griner used the public attention to her case to ask Mr. Biden to intervene not just on her behalf, but also on behalf of other Americans who are wrongfully detained. “I realize you are dealing with so much, but please don’t forget about me and the other American detainees,” she said in a handwritten note to the president this month. “Please do all you can to bring us home.” Russia has hinted at wanting to swap Ms. Griner for Viktor Bout, a former Soviet military officer who was convicted of offering to sell weapons, including antiaircraft missiles, to federal agents posing as members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. After Ms. Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges this month, maintaining that she did not intend to break the law, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei A. Ryabkov of Russia said that the “hype and publicity” surrounding her detention “creates interference in the truest sense of the word.” In some situations, particularly when the Americans are already well known, the State Department official said public attention could help. But more often than not, and even when it appears outwardly that negotiations are at a halt, officials are quietly working on the case, he said.",7
2022-07-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/20/opinion/letters/politics-third-party.html,Opinion | Discontent Leads to Calls for New Third Parties,"To the Editor: Re “A Viable Third Party Is Coming,” by Representative Tom Malinowski (Opinion guest essay, July 10): Ronald Reagan famously said that he didn’t leave the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party left him. For moderate New Jersey Republicans, it is clear that the Republican Party has left them. Big time. Donald Trump’s MAGA radicals have taken over. And so desperate times call for desperate measures. The newly announced Moderate Party seeks to provide a safe home for all reasonable folks in the state, not only disaffected Republicans but unaffiliated and other voters too. Let’s face it. The two-party lock on nominations and ballot access is just not working. Fusion voting — in which other political parties endorse and place on the ballot candidates who also run as Democrats or Republicans — works very well in New York, and it needs to come to New Jersey immediately. Mr. Malinowski personifies what we all want in our congressional representatives. He works for all the people in his district. Country before party. Imagine that. For all those disaffected Republicans and others who cringe at voting on the Democratic line, fusion voting needs to come to New Jersey. Harlin ParkerLebanon Township, N.J. To the Editor: The Moderate Party in New Jersey makes me hopeful. I’m tired of voting for the lesser of two evils. The far-right-wing extremists have even put a stain on Christianity. The majority of Americans are honest, hardworking moderates, as am I. Living in Texas has been very difficult for moderates, yet even in Texas many of the citizens are moderates. Honestly, I never thought about moving to New Jersey, but the Moderate Party movement has caused me to consider it. Is there any hope of the Moderates organizing in all 50 states? Nancy EvansLittle Elm, Texas To the Editor: Tom Malinowski’s guest essay about a new Moderate Party, composed of “Democrats of all stripes” and Republicans fed up with Donald Trump, sounds like an old-fashioned anti-Trump party. A real Moderate Party leader must declare opposition to the failed Pelosi/Schumer agenda as forcefully as it condemns the extremism of QAnon. A true center-driven party could lead to balanced debate and legislation on the environment, energy, crime, guns, health care, homelessness and immigration, and it might even lead us out of the desert created by the Supreme Court’s attack on women’s rights. Mark McKeefrySeward, Alaska To the Editor: Since 2000, I have been a third-party voter. I have often said, “I hope I live long enough to see any third party gain power, yet I don’t think God will let me live to the age of 200.” Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, living two lifetimes might not be necessary. Allow me to suggest a new third party called the Women’s Rights Party USA. A large percentage of women, now feeling like second-class citizens, would join it. Many conservative men might vote for Women’s Rights Party USA candidates out of empathy for the moms/wives/daughters in their lives. If this new political party is started, maybe I would not have to live to age 200 to see real change in our society. Tony MathisonWichita Falls, Texas To the Editor: Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, please start a third party. As a lifelong Democrat, I would vote for either of you in a heartbeat for one reason that should be the criterion for any candidate — character! They have both sacrificed everything for the Jan. 6 hearings. I think that the Democratic and Republican Parties have been hijacked by extremists. Whom can I vote for in 2022 or 2024? Should I sit it out? It would be the first time. Carol ShurmanNew York To the Editor: Re “Putin Believes He’s Winning,” by Tatiana Stanovaya (Opinion guest essay, July 19): To win, you must win more than square meters, you must win people — that is, hearts and minds. That war Vladimir Putin has already lost, as the world slowly comes to understand what is at stake here: the hard-fought but imperturbably found identity of a real people — the Ukrainians — and their fierce desire to defend and express that identity. The Ukraine war embodies this struggle better than anything else I know. Jeffrey McCabeOrdu, Turkey To the Editor: With an uncertain outcome to the Ukraine war, it is shaping up as a contest between Russian energy and sanctions. Should the war continue into the winter and if the sanctions have not seriously damaged the Russian economy, Vladimir Putin will be in a position to apply his “energy weapon.” This will be a severe test for the Europeans, who Mr. Putin is betting will seek an agreement to end the conflict on his terms. Ed HoulihanRidgewood, N.J. To the Editor: Re “I Don’t Want to See a Football Coach Praying on the Field,” by Anne Lamott (Opinion guest essay, July 11): As a Christian pastor I pray and believe in the power of prayer. I also value U.S. constitutional protections for free exercise of all religions. The Supreme Court’s majority opinion on Coach Joseph Kennedy’s midfield postgame prayers distorts reality and belies power differentials in high school. A coach’s sincere religious practice midfield immediately after a game is a leader’s public act. Mr. Kennedy’s power over lives of students, his role as teacher and his unique access to that public space reinforce that act’s power. A coach saying “This is a free country” while much of the team joined him is a form of evangelism that many of us who teach in public classrooms and on fields have refrained from out of respect for the religious freedom of all. Let’s not forget the freedom, agency and voice of students who are of other religious traditions or none. Do you remember high school? (Rev.) Odette Lockwood-StewartBerkeley, Calif. To the Editor: Anne Lamott’s kinder, gentler, Sermon on the Mount type of Christianity hasn’t a prayer against white Christian nationalists, the Southern Baptist Convention, evangelicals, assorted other theocratic “sword or the cross” groups and their enablers in the Republican Party. Theocracy is the deadly enemy of democracy, and one of the main defenses against this kind of tyranny is a very high and very thick wall between church and state, not a Southern border wall or the Second Amendment. Bruce LiptonNew York To the Editor: Re “9/11 Families Call on Trump to Cancel Saudi-Backed Golf Event” (nytimes.com, July 17): The families are asking Donald Trump to choose between money and a sense of compassion and patriotism?

2022-07-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/opinion/david-brooks-capitalism.html,Opinion | David Brooks: I Was Wrong About Capitalism,"I have a specific way I tend to be wrong. I fall behind. Every day the world turns and every day I try to adjust my belief system to the realities of the moment. You would think I’d be able to recognize the emerging challenges and shifting tectonics fairly quickly. As a newspaper columnist, I’m paid for one skill above others: careful observation. But sometimes I’m just slow. I suffer an intellectual lag. Reality has changed, but my mental frameworks just sit there. Worse, they prevent me from even seeing the change that is already underway — what the experts call “conceptual blindness.” I’m trying to address one period’s problems through the last period’s frameworks. It’s not until I dismantle and reconstruct those preconceptions that everything becomes obvious — until the next historic change. Let’s start at the beginning. When I was in high school and college, I was a democratic socialist. I was entranced by the left-wing radicals of the 1930s — the way they wrote, painted, marched and organized on behalf of working men and women. I saw the world through the lens of class struggle. That was surely a useful frame for the 1930s, when the economy was heavily industrial and when millions were hungry and out of work. But when I was in college in the early 1980s, the economy was not like that. America was suffering from stagflation — high unemployment and high inflation at the same time. The chief problem was sclerosis. Over the years special-interest groups had clogged up the economy with overly burdensome regulations, work rules, perverse tax structures and all the other sinecures the economists call “rent seeking.” The United States needed a shot of dynamism to get the entrepreneurial and innovative juices flowing. It took me until about 1985 to realize that the people I disdained — Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher — were actually doing something useful and needed. So off to The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page I went, to drink deep from the wells of free-market thinking. For a while this bet on free-market economic dynamism seemed to be paying off. It was the late 1980s and 1990s — the golden days of globalization, liberalization, the early creativity of Silicon Valley. In the early 1990s, The Journal sent me on many reporting trips to the U.S.S.R. and, later, Russia, and everything that was uncool in New York was cool in Moscow, so to be a right-wing editorial writer was to be cutting-edge and hip. I paid close attention to all the privatization plans that were floating around. If state property could be distributed to the masses, then a new capitalist Russia could be born. I saw but did not see the enormous amount of corruption that was going on. I saw but did not see that property rights alone do not spontaneously make a decent society. The primary problem in all societies is order — moral, legal and social order. It took me a while to see that what Russia really needed was not privatization first, but law and order first. By the time I came to this job, in 2003, I was having qualms about the free-market education I’d received — but not fast enough. It took me a while to see that the postindustrial capitalism machine — while innovative, dynamic and wonderful in many respects — had some fundamental flaws. The most educated Americans were amassing more and more wealth, dominating the best living areas, pouring advantages into their kids. A highly unequal caste system was forming. Bit by bit it dawned on me that the government would have to get much more active if every child was going to have an open field and a fair chance. I started writing columns about inequality. I called around to my right-leaning economist friends and they sensed inequality was a problem, but few had done much work on the subject or done much thinking on how to address it. I saw but didn’t see. By the time the financial crisis hit, the flaws in modern capitalism were blindingly obvious, but my mental frames still didn’t shift fast enough. Barack Obama was trying to figure out how to stimulate the economy and I still had that 1990s “the deficit is the problem” mind-set. I wrote a bunch of columns urging Obama to keep the stimulus reasonably small, columns that look wrong in hindsight. Deficits matter, but they were not the core challenge in 2009. I opposed Obama’s auto bailout on free-market grounds, and that was wrong, too. Sometimes in life you should stick to your worldview and defend it against criticism. But sometimes the world is genuinely different than it was before. At those moments the crucial skills are the ones nobody teaches you: how to reorganize your mind, how to see with new eyes.

2022-07-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/world/europe/russia-jewish-agency-ban.html,Russia Moves to Close Agency Handling Emigration to Israel,"Russia is threatening to ban a major Jewish nonprofit agency that helps people emigrate to Israel from operating in the country, a sign of the Kremlin’s deteriorating relationship with Israel and of the far-reaching fallout from the war in Ukraine. Russia’s Justice Ministry is seeking to liquidate the Russian branch of the nonprofit, the Jewish Agency for Israel, which operates in coordination with the Israeli government, according to a notice from a Moscow court. The Russian government’s move amounted to a broadside against Jews in Russia and seemed to reverse President Vladimir V. Putin’s efforts over the years to build closer ties to Israel and to the Jewish community. A preliminary hearing has been set for July 28, and Prime Minister Yair Lapid of Israel said Thursday that he would send a delegation to Russia for talks aimed at keeping the agency operating there. “The Jewish community in Russia is deeply connected with Israel,” Mr. Lapid said in a statement. “We will continue to act through diplomatic channels so that the Jewish Agency’s important activity will not cease.” The Justice Ministry did not disclose why it was seeking to shut down the agency’s Russian branch and did not respond to a request for comment. But according to an official at the Jewish Agency, the ministry sent a letter about two weeks ago to the agency’s Moscow office accusing it of violating privacy laws by keeping the details of applicants for emigration to Israel in a database. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly during the legal proceeding, said the letter included a gripe unrelated to the legal claims: that Israel has been taking some of the best minds out of Russia, which is home to hundreds of thousands of people of Jewish descent. After Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Israel became one of the main destinations for a wave of emigration, an exodus that included many workers from Russia’s tech industry. About 16,000 Russian citizens have registered as immigrants in Israel since the start of the war, more than three times as many as in all of last year; another 34,000 arrived as tourists. The Jewish Agency official said that Russian disgruntlement with Israel over a variety of other matters might also help explain the new Russian pressure. These include Israeli military activities in Syria and a dispute over church property in Jerusalem. Israeli officials have also become increasingly outspoken in their criticism of Russia’s war in Ukraine, after initially trying to tread a diplomatic middle path. Last week, Israel began providing helmets and other protective equipment to Ukrainian rescue forces and civilian organizations after earlier refusing to do so, and Mr. Lapid signed a joint declaration with President Biden expressing “concerns regarding the ongoing attacks against Ukraine.” “The attempt to punish the Jewish Agency for Israel’s stance on the war is deplorable and offensive,” Israel’s minister for diaspora affairs, Nachman Shai, said in a statement on Thursday. “The Jews of Russia cannot be detached from their historical and emotional connection to the State of Israel.” The Jewish Agency, founded nearly a century ago as the Jewish Agency for Palestine, was instrumental in helping establish Israel in 1948, and has facilitated the emigration of millions of Jews from around the globe. It describes itself as the largest Jewish nonprofit organization in the world, and runs social programs in Israel and for Jewish communities abroad. The agency was banned in the Soviet Union, where Jews faced pervasive discrimination, until its final years. About a million immigrants from the former Soviet Union arrived in Israel from the late 1980s to the end of the 1990s. The agency now helps Russians with Jewish roots move to Israel and runs Sunday schools and Hebrew classes across Russia. It is also active in Ukraine and is providing emergency aid to Jews there. Its Russian-language website invites visitors to enter the names and email addresses of Jewish relatives in Ukraine to allow the agency “to help rescue them from the war zone, provide them with temporary shelter and enable them to repatriate to Israel.” In a phone interview, the president of the Russian Jewish Congress, Yuri Kanner, said that the Russian government’s move to liquidate the agency represented a blow to Russia’s Jewish community, even if a complete dismantling of its operations could still be averted. He predicted that the flow of Russians moving to Israel — as evidenced, he said, by a sharp rise in interest in learning Hebrew — would increase even further. “It’s possible that someone thought that by doing this they could limit” Russian emigration to Israel, he said of the potential ban of the Jewish Agency. “I think the result will be different — it’ll give a new impetus to the wave of departures.” Mr. Kanner said that, for the moment, he was not registering a rise in antisemitism in Russian society or seeing a crackdown on Jewish life in Russia. But the government’s move against the high-profile Jewish Agency comes amid a rapid shift in Mr. Putin’s geopolitics and in the domestic political landscape — raising echoes of the Soviet era, when Jews suffered from being seen as having dual loyalties. For years, Mr. Putin worked to nurture ties to the Jewish community and to Israel. He supported the construction of a Jewish museum in Moscow and hosted Benjamin Netanyahu, then the Israeli prime minister, as a guest of honor at the World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow in 2018. But the war in Ukraine has left Mr. Putin groping for allies in his escalating conflict with the West, while feeding an expanding campaign against anyone inside Russia with suspect loyalties. Earlier this week, Mr. Putin visited Iran, Israel’s archenemy, and celebrated a rapidly tightening relationship in a meeting with the country’s supreme leader. Inside Russia, the government this year has cracked down on numerous organizations with foreign ties, from German political foundations to the American-funded Carnegie Moscow Center think tank. In December, it used a Moscow court to liquidate Memorial International, the country’s most prominent human rights organization, in a proceeding similar to the one now underway against the Jewish Agency. And in Israel, a politics long influenced by a large and influential Russian-speaking diaspora is moving away from the Kremlin. Naftali Bennett, Israel’s prime minister when the war broke out in February, avoided direct criticism of Russia, citing Israel’s security interests in Syria as well as the need to protect the safety and free movement of Jews in both Ukraine and Russia. Mr. Lapid, who took over as prime minister on July 1 after Mr. Bennett’s government collapsed, has largely abandoned Mr. Bennett’s attempts at mediating in the war and has said that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine. For Jews who have remained in Russia, the apparent crackdown on the Jewish Agency served as the latest disconcerting turn. In Volgograd in southern Russia, a Jewish community leader, Yael Ioffe, said in a phone interview that the rate of emigration to Israel from her city appeared to have doubled in recent months. She said that people of Jewish descent were emigrating not for fear of persecution of Jews, but because of the overall “unstable situation — or the expectation of an unstable situation.”",8
2022-07-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/25/us/politics/china-taiwan-biden-pelosi.html,U.S. Officials Grow More Concerned About Potential Action by China on Taiwan,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has grown increasingly anxious this summer about China’s statements and actions regarding Taiwan, with some officials fearing that Chinese leaders might try to move against the self-governing island over the next year and a half — perhaps by trying to cut off access to all or part of the Taiwan Strait, through which U.S. naval ships regularly pass. The internal worries have sharpened in recent days, as the administration quietly works to try to dissuade House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from going through with a proposed visit to Taiwan next month, U.S. officials say. Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, would be the first speaker to visit Taiwan since 1997, and the Chinese government has repeatedly denounced her reported plans and threatened retaliation. U.S. officials see a greater risk of conflict and miscalculation over Ms. Pelosi’s trip as President Xi Jinping of China and other Communist Party leaders prepare in the coming weeks for an important political meeting in which Mr. Xi is expected to extend his rule. Chinese officials have strongly asserted this summer that no part of the Taiwan Strait can be considered international waters, contrary to the views of the United States and other nations. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said in June that “China has sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the Taiwan Strait.” American officials do not know whether China plans to enforce that claim. But Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who is close to President Biden and deals with the administration often on issues involving Taiwan, said “there is a lot of attention being paid” to what lessons China, its military and Mr. Xi might be learning from events in Ukraine. “And one school of thought is that the lesson is ‘go early and go strong’ before there is time to strengthen Taiwan’s defenses,” Mr. Coons said in an interview on Sunday. “And we may be heading to an earlier confrontation — more a squeeze than an invasion — than we thought.” Chinese officials are aware that Biden administration officials, also applying lessons learned from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, are trying to shape their weapons sales to Taiwan to turn the democratic island into what some call a “porcupine” — bristling with enough effective armaments and defense systems to deter Chinese leaders from trying to attack it. U.S. officials say they are not aware of any specific piece of intelligence indicating the Chinese leadership has decided to move soon on Taiwan. But analysts inside and outside the U.S. government are studying to determine what might be the optimal time for China to take bolder actions to undermine Taiwan and the United States. A central question is what top Chinese officials think of the evolving strengths of the Chinese military relative to those of Taiwan, the United States and regional U.S. allies that include Japan and South Korea. Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week that the Chinese military’s behavior in the Asia-Pacific region was “significantly more and noticeably more aggressive.” Chinese officials have denounced a steady stream of visits by senior U.S. officials to Taiwan, which Beijing sees as being akin to formal diplomatic engagement with the island. Ms. Pelosi had planned to visit in April but postponed after her aides said she had tested positive for the coronavirus. “If the United States insists on going ahead, China will take firm and resolute measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the U.S. will be responsible for all of the serious consequences,” Zhao Lijian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a regularly scheduled media briefing on Monday. U.S. officials said the planning for Ms. Pelosi’s trip was moving ahead despite the rising furor over it. Ms. Pelosi would be likely to fly to Taipei on a U.S. military aircraft, as is typical of such visits. Some analysts looking at Chinese denunciations of the proposed visit say that China could send aircraft to “escort” her plane and prevent it from landing. This scenario is a legitimate concern, U.S. officials said, though it is improbable, and any such move would be seen by Washington as a serious escalation. The officials interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivities over diplomatic matters. Ms. Pelosi said last week that she does not publicly discuss travel plans, but that “it’s important for us to show support for Taiwan.” During the Trump administration, a cabinet member and a top State Department official became the highest-ranking U.S. administration officials to visit Taiwan in a working capacity since 1979, when Washington severed diplomatic ties with Taipei in order to normalize relations with Beijing. Newt Gingrich was the last House speaker to visit Taiwan, 25 years ago. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Asked by reporters about the proposed visit, Mr. Biden said last Wednesday that “the military thinks it’s not a good idea right now.” He also said he planned to speak with Mr. Xi, the Chinese leader, in the next 10 days. The two last spoke by video call in March, when Mr. Biden warned there would be “implications and consequences” if China gave material aid to Russia in its Ukraine offensive. Mr. Xi and other top Chinese officials and Communist Party elders are preparing for the party’s 20th congress in the fall, and they are expected to hold secret meetings in August in the seaside resort of Beidaihe ahead of the formal conclave. Analysts say Mr. Xi will almost certainly break with norms by seeking to serve a third term as president and extending his tenure as party secretary and chairman of the Central Military Commission. “The domestic political situation in China right now is extremely tense in the months before the party congress when Xi hopes to be approved for an unprecedented third term,” said Susan L. Shirk, a former senior State Department official and author of “Overreach,” an upcoming book on Chinese politics. “The risk is that the visit by Speaker Pelosi will be perceived, including by Xi himself, as a humiliation of his leadership and that he takes some rash action to show his strength,” she said. “What’s more, in view of his recent misjudgments that have harmed the country and sparked internal controversy — the draconian approach to Covid management, aligning with Russia’s war in Ukraine, and the crackdown on private business — we can’t count on his prudence in his military response to Pelosi’s trip. Better to postpone rather than risk war.” Pentagon and White House officials have been discussing the political environment and potential risks of the trip with Ms. Pelosi’s office. Officials say it is up to her to decide. Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing, said that Beijing would aim for a military response that would be seen as strong, but not so aggressive that it would provoke a larger conflict. “I don’t think anyone can predict in any detail what China will do militarily,” Mr. Shi said. Hu Xijin, former chief editor of Global Times, a nationalistic newspaper published by the Communist Party, wrote on Twitter that Chinese military warplanes might shadow Ms. Pelosi’s plane and cross into Taiwan-controlled airspace over the island. He also said China’s actions would amount to “a shocking military response.” Analysts say China could do something less provocative. It could, for example, send aircraft across the median line down the middle of the strait separating China and Taiwan, as it did in 2020 in response to a visit by Alex Azar, then the U.S. secretary of health and human services. Chinese fighter jets have crossed that line and flown into the island’s air defense identification zone with increasing frequency since 2020. On Monday, Joanne Ou, a spokeswoman for Taiwan’s foreign ministry, said Taipei had not received any “definite” information about Ms. Pelosi’s visit. Officials and lawmakers from Taiwan’s two main political parties have welcomed any such visit by the speaker. “Speaker Pelosi has many admirers in Taiwan, and her visit would be a strong statement of American support of Taiwan democracy,” said Alexander Huang, the Washington representative of the Kuomintang, the opposition party. Many in Taiwan worry that if the trip is canceled, it would give Beijing the impression that its intimidation tactics work. In Washington, some Republican lawmakers have publicly urged Ms. Pelosi to go ahead with the trip as taking a stand against China. Ivan Kanapathy, a senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a China director on the National Security Council under Presidents Trump and Biden, said canceling the trip could undermine Washington’s attempts to strengthen Taiwan’s relations with other democracies and efforts to boost its profile in international organizations and venues. “A big part of why China worries about what the U.S. does is because we open up space for others,” Mr. Kanapathy said. “And that’s what China really worries about the most — more legitimacy for the Taiwanese government in the international community.” Some analysts say there are less risky ways to demonstrate support for Taiwan. Washington could send a top military officer, for example, or sign a bilateral trade agreement, which could help the island reduce its economic reliance on China. U.S. military officials say a sea-and-air invasion of Taiwan would be difficult for the People’s Liberation Army to pull off today. If China did move earlier than expected against Taiwan, it could do so piecemeal, perhaps by first invoking their recent declaration on the status of the Taiwan Strait and conducting a limited operation to gauge Washington’s reaction. Another theory is that Beijing might try to seize an outer island close to China’s coast. American officials say it is unlikely that the Chinese government has decided what operation, if any, to carry out. But it is a subject being regularly simulated and war-gamed in Washington. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said Friday at the Aspen Security Forum that Taiwan was learning from Ukraine. After years of buying expensive defense systems, he said, Taiwan was paying more attention to “citizen mobilizations” and “information warfare.” He also noted that supplying Taiwan would add further stress to American military hardware production. “There are longer-term questions,” he said, “about ensuring that our defense industrial base, the American defense industrial base, and our allies’ defense industrial base can be put in a position to be able to sustain the kind of security assistance that we are going to need to keep supplying Ukraine as well as Taiwan as well as ourselves.” Edward Wong reported from Washington, David E. Sanger from Aspen, Colo., and Amy Qin from Taipei. Catie Edmondson contributed reporting from Washington.",22
2022-07-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/25/world/europe/eurovision-uk-ukraine.html,"U.K., Eurovision Runner-up to Ukraine, Will Host in 2023","Eurovision organizers confirmed on Monday that Britain would host the popular song contest in 2023 instead of war-torn Ukraine, which as this year’s winner would have traditionally hosted next year’s event but was ruled out because of safety concerns. The announcement by the European Broadcasting Union made official what had been widely predicted since Ukraine won the event in May and Britain finished in second place. Tim Davie, the director general of the BBC, said in a statement that the process of choosing a host city would begin soon. “Being asked to host the largest and most complex music competition in the world is a great privilege,” he said in the statement. “The BBC is committed to making the event a true reflection of Ukrainian culture alongside showcasing the diversity of British music and creativity.” Officials and artists in Ukraine protested last month when the European Broadcasting Union said that Russia’s invasion meant Ukraine could not provide “the security and operational guarantees” needed to host next year’s event. Ukraine had offered three potential locations that it said were safe from the fighting: Lviv, in western Ukraine; the Zakarpattia region, which borders Hungary and Slovakia; and the capital, Kyiv. Martin Österdahl, Eurovision’s executive supervisor, said in a statement on Monday that the 2023 contest “will showcase the creativity and skill of one of Europe’s most experienced public broadcasters whilst ensuring this year’s winners, Ukraine, are celebrated and represented throughout the event.” Representatives from UA:PBC, a Ukrainian broadcaster, will work with the BBC on the Ukrainian elements of the show, Eurovision said in a statement. Mykola Chernotytskyi, the chief executive of the broadcaster’s managing board, said in a statement that the event “will not be in Ukraine but in support of Ukraine,” adding that organizers would “add Ukrainian spirit to this event.” Although the decision was reached with the Ukrainian government, at least one of the country’s past winners still appeared unhappy with Monday’s announcement. Jamala, who won Eurovision in 2016 with “1944,” a song widely interpreted by Eurovision fans as a comment on Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, said in an emailed statement that the decision still felt “a bit premature.” “With this gesture, they are taking away the hope of Ukrainian people to win this unprovoked war in the near future,” she added. Eurovision, which began in 1956, invites artists from countries across Europe, plus some farther afield including Australia and Israel, to compete to be voted the best act. Over 160 million people watched in May as Kalush Orchestra, a Ukrainian rap act, was crowned the winner. Britain has hosted the event eight times, most recently in 1998. At least 17 cities in Britain have said they intend to bid host the contest, organizers said. The BBC and Eurovision organizers will together decide the host city, a spokesman for the European Broadcast Union said. Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, said on Twitter that he and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had “agreed that wherever Eurovision is held, it must celebrate the country and people of Ukraine.” Alex Marshall contributed reporting.",29
2022-07-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia-court.html,Brittney Griner’s Lawyers Argue for Leniency in Russian Court,"Wearing a black and gray sweatshirt with the slogan “Black lives for peace” printed on the back, Brittney Griner, the W.N.B.A. star who has been detained in Russia on drug charges, appeared in a court near Moscow on Tuesday as her defense team continued to present evidence that she had not intended to break the law. She was escorted to a courtroom by a group of police officers, one of them wearing a balaklava, and stood in a metal cage, holding photographs of her relatives, teammates and friends, according to video footage from the scene published by Russian state television. After being detained in a Moscow airport one week before Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Ms. Griner has become an unlikely pawn in a diplomatic game between Moscow and Washington. With her guilty plea making the verdict seem a foregone conclusion, experts said that her best hope was that the Biden administration could find a way to swap her for a high-profile Russian being held by the United States. During court hearings, her defense team argued for leniency, saying that Ms. Griner had not intended to smuggle drugs into Russia and that, like many other international athletes, she had used cannabis to help ease pain from injuries. A narcology expert testified in court on Tuesday, Ms. Griner’s lawyers said, to present a case that in some countries, including the United States, medical cannabis “is a popular treatment, specifically among athletes.” “With the prescription in place, Brittney may have used it for medical, but not for recreational purposes,” said Maria Blagovolina, one of Ms. Griner’s lawyers and a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin & Partners, a firm in Moscow. At the previous hearing, the lawyers presented a note from Ms. Griner’s doctor recommending cannabis to treat her pain. Ms. Griner was also expected to appear in court on Wednesday, when she could be called to testify. Ms. Griner had traveled to Russia because she played for a team in the country to earn extra money during the off-season. Russian customs officials discovered two vape cartridges with hashish oil — a cannabis derivative — in her luggage. Ms. Griner was taken into custody near Moscow and accused of willfully smuggling the vape cartridges, a charge that can carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. On July 7, Ms. Griner pleaded guilty to the charges, saying that she had unintentionally carried a banned substance into Russia because she had packed in a hurry. The Russian authorities have signaled that no possible exchange can take place before a verdict in court. American officials have said that they are doing all they can to return Ms. Griner home, arguing that she was wrongfully detained. Last week, Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said that such statements were “political, biased, and illegitimate.” “If an American citizen was detained on drug trafficking charges and she does not deny it herself, then this should correspond to Russian legislation, and not to the laws adopted in San Francisco,” Ms. Zakharova said.",7
2022-07-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/opinion/us-ukraine-leadership.html,Opinion | Our Leaderless Free World,"The central fact about the democratic world today is that it is leaderless. Twenty-five years ago, we had the confident presences of Bill Clinton, Helmut Kohl and Tony Blair — and Alan Greenspan. Now we have a failing American president, a timorous German chancellor, a British prime minister about to skulk out of office in ignominy and a chairman of the Federal Reserve who last year flubbed the most important decision of his career. Elsewhere: the resignation of Italy’s prime minister, a caretaker government in Israel, the assassination of Japan’s dominant political figure. This is bad in normal times. It is catastrophic in bad ones. We are stumbling, half-blind, into four distinct but mutually reinforcing crises, each compounding the other. The first crisis is one of international credibility. The war in Ukraine is not merely a crisis unto itself. It is a symptom of a crisis, which began with a withdrawal from Afghanistan that telegraphed incompetence and weakness and whose consequences were easily predictable. Beyond Ukraine, in which President Biden has committed enough support to prevent outright defeat but not to secure a clear victory, there is an imminent nuclear crisis with Iran, in which the president seems to have no policy other than negotiations that are on the cusp of failure, and another looming crisis over Taiwan, in which he alternates between challenging Beijing and trying to mollify it. Talented leaders turn proverbial lemons into lemonade. Biden seems to be mastering the trick of turning lemonade into lemons. He has risen just enough to the occasion in Ukraine — generating a moment of allied unity and resolve — to have that much more to lose if it loses. If the war is still raging in winter and Europe caves to Russian energy blackmail (by, for instance, demanding that Kyiv accept an armistice in some kind of humiliating Minsk 3 agreement), what conclusions will Tehran and Beijing draw? The second crisis is one of economic credibility. This is distinct from a normal economic crisis, which can happen for reasons leaders do not control. The credibility crisis occurs when leaders make confident predictions, in the face of abundant contrary evidence, that turn out to be catastrophically wrong. Insisting that inflation was “temporary,” as Biden did last year, was one such prediction. His insistence on Monday that “God willing, I don’t think we’re going to see a recession” may be the next. Economic credibility is vital when decisions are bound to be painful. At least Jimmy Carter had the guts to nominate Paul Volcker. Where is a similar confidence-inspiring move from Biden, who, remarkably, retains the same inept economic team that helped lead us into this mess? And how much graver are the consequences of economic incompetence if a U.S. recession aggravates a global recession, which the International Monetary Fund expects is coming soon? The third crisis is in poorer countries. Sri Lanka’s political and economic collapse this month, spurred partly by the pandemic but mainly by domestic mismanagement, is a foretaste of what we can expect in other developing countries, from Pakistan to Mexico to much of Africa. But unlike in Sri Lanka, crises in those places aren’t likely to remain within their own borders. In Pakistan, economic crisis can quickly turn into a nuclear crisis. In African nations and Mexico, the risks are in the form of state collapse and mass migration. The last time the world had a global recession (and spiking food prices), the result was the Arab Spring, civil wars in Syria and Libya, the rise of the Islamic State, migrant waves into Europe and populist revolts that included Brexit and the election of Donald Trump. Imagine all this but on a vastly greater scale, a year or two from today. The fourth crisis is one of liberal democracy. Democracy is not its own justification. It justifies itself by what it delivers: security, stability, predictability, prosperity — and then consent, choice and freedom. People who have spent their entire lives in stable democracies often assume that freedom is everyone’s supreme value. The depressing lesson of the past 20 years is that it isn’t. Illiberal democracy, on the Hungarian model, can be a successful form of government. Ditto for effective autocracies, like in Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Democracies that fail at delivery — by letting prices or crime or control of borders or common understandings of right and wrong get out of hand — put the best of what they stand for at risk. The free world will always retain formidable advantages over its antidemocratic adversaries because we are better able to acknowledge our mistakes and correct them. But the cascading crises we face would challenge even the most inspired leaders. Except for Volodymyr Zelensky, there are none. The best thing Biden could do for the country is announce he won’t run for re-election — now, not after the midterms. Let his party sort out its own future. Appoint a confidence-inspiring Treasury secretary (if not Larry Summers, then Jamie Dimon). Ensure that Ukraine wins swiftly. Put fear and hesitation in the minds of dictators in Moscow, Tehran and Beijing. It might be enough to rescue a floundering presidency in a sinking world.

2022-07-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia-trial.html,Brittney Griner Describes Her Legal Ordeal to Russian Court,"Brittney Griner, the American basketball star detained in Russia on drug charges, told a courtroom Wednesday that she had been tossed into a bewildering legal system with little explanation of what was happening and what she might do to try to defend herself. Ms. Griner described arriving in Russia after an exhausting 13-hour flight — and soon after recovering from Covid — and finding herself in an interrogation in which much of what was being said remained untranslated. She said she was also told to sign papers with no explanation of what they were. It was her first court testimony about her arrest in a case that has taken on outsize importance because of the war in Ukraine. Ms. Griner arrived with her wrists shackled in front of her. She was flanked by Russian security agents, including some wearing bulletproof vests, their faces covered by balaclavas. The authorities detained Ms. Griner, 31, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, about a week before President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine in February. She was accused of having two vape cartridges of hashish oil in her luggage when she arrived at an airport near Moscow on her way to Yekaterinburg, where she plays for a team in the W.N.B.A. off-season. Russia did not make her detention public until after the invasion began. Earlier this month, Ms. Griner pleaded guilty, saying that she had unintentionally carried a banned substance into Russia because she had packed in a hurry. In Russia, a guilty plea does not end a trial and the proceedings are expected to continue into August. She faces a possible 10-year sentence. Ms. Griner’s lawyers have said they hope her guilty plea will make the court more lenient, but experts say that her best hope is that the Biden administration finds a way to swap her for a high-profile Russian who is being held by the United States. On Wednesday, the American secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, said the United States had “put a substantial proposal on the table weeks ago” to gain the release of Ms. Griner and Paul Whelan, a former Marine who was sentenced last year to 16 years in prison on espionage charges. He declined to discuss details of the offer. But a person briefed on the negotiations said that the United State offered to trade an imprisoned Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout, for Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan, and that President Biden — who has been under growing political pressure to free the Americans — had backed the offer. Testifying from an enclosed witness box on Wednesday, Ms. Griner said she had been pulled aside during a luggage check in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport, according to one of her lawyers, Aleksandr Boikov, from the Moscow Legal Center. Ms. Griner testified that she had been told to sign documents during her detention without an explanation of what they meant, Mr. Boikov said. An interpreter provided to Ms. Griner after her arrest translated “almost nothing,” he said, and she was held for 16 hours before a lawyer came to help her. Maria Blagovolina, a lawyer with the Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners firm who is also representing Ms. Griner, said in a statement her client had told the court that she had a “doctor’s prescription for the use of medical cannabis” and had “emphasized that she never planned to bring it to Russia and use it.”",7
2022-07-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/russia-griner-whelan-prisoners.html,"U.S. Offers to Swap Russian Arms Dealer, Viktor Bout, for Griner and Whelan","WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has offered to free the imprisoned Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to secure the release of Brittney Griner and Paul N. Whelan, two Americans imprisoned in Russia who the State Department says were wrongfully detained, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Wednesday that the United States had “put a substantial proposal on the table” and that he would soon press for the Americans’ return in his first conversation with his Russian counterpart since Russia invaded Ukraine five months ago. Mr. Blinken’s comments represented the first time that the United States had confirmed that it had made a formal proposal to persuade Russia to release Ms. Griner, an American basketball star who has been detained for months on drug charges, and Mr. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was sentenced in Russia in 2020 to 16 years in prison on espionage charges. The notion of trading Ms. Griner for Mr. Bout surfaced in Russian news media several weeks ago. U.S. officials would not publicly discuss the idea at the time and stressed their concern about potentially incentivizing the detention of Americans abroad by foreign actors looking to win concessions. On Wednesday, however, Mr. Blinken said the two countries had “communicated repeatedly and directly” about the proposal, though he would not provide details or describe the Russian response, saying he did not want to endanger sensitive negotiations with Moscow. The person briefed on the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic negotiations, said the United States offered in June to trade Mr. Bout for Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan, and that President Biden — who has been under growing political pressure to free the Americans — backed the offer. The offer was first reported by CNN. Mr. Bout, who is known as the “Merchant of Death,” is serving a 25-year federal prison sentence for conspiring to sell weapons to people who said they planned to kill Americans. The Kremlin has demanded his release for years. Speaking at the State Department, Mr. Blinken said he expected to talk with Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, in the coming days and would urge him to accept the proposal. The two men last spoke in January at a meeting in Geneva, weeks before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 led to a near-total shutdown of American diplomacy with Russia. Mr. Blinken avoided so much as shaking Mr. Lavrov’s hand at a Group of 20 foreign ministers meeting in Bali earlier this month. Mr. Biden has been under pressure to secure the freedom of Ms. Griner in particular, whose wife, Cherelle, and several Democratic-aligned political groups have publicly urged him to strike a deal to win her release. Mr. Biden spoke to Cherelle Griner this month. In mid-July, W.N.B.A. players took the court at their All-Star Game wearing jerseys bearing Ms. Griner’s number, 42. And on Tuesday, NBC News aired an interview with Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine freed from a Russian prison in April after three years of detention, in which he said the White House was “not doing enough” to free Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan. William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, addressed talk of a potential prisoner swap during an appearance at the Aspen Security Forum last week. “These are awful and shameful steps to hold American citizens for political leverage,” Mr. Burns said. “The Russians are quite coldblooded about this right now.” Mr. Burns said it was unclear why the Kremlin has long been determined to secure the release of Mr. Bout, 55, a former Soviet military officer who made a fortune in global arms trafficking before he was caught in a federal sting operation. “That is a good question because Viktor Bout is a creep,” Mr. Burns said. Some analysts believe that Mr. Bout enjoys loyalty from former criminal associates with continued influence at the Kremlin. In 2010, Mr. Bout agreed to sell arms to undercover U.S. federal agents who said they belonged to Colombia’s FARC rebel group, which the United States classified at the time as a terrorist organization. Prosecutors said Mr. Bout did not object when the agents said they intended to use the weapons to kill American troops supporting Colombia’s military. In an interview last month, however, the judge who sentenced Mr. Bout, Shira A. Scheindlin, said that Mr. Bout “was not a terrorist, in my opinion. He was a businessman.” She added that she felt the mandatory 25-year sentence she was forced to impose was too high and that a trade of Mr. Bout for Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan would be reasonable. A White House national security spokesman, John F. Kirby, declined to provide more specifics about the U.S. proposal. “I’m sure you can all understand that it’s not going to help us get them home if we’re negotiating publicly,” Mr. Kirby told reporters. But he seemed to welcome the opportunity to say something beyond months of past official assurances that the administration was working quietly behind the scenes. “What I will say is that the president and his team are willing to take extraordinary steps to bring our people home,” Mr. Kirby said. “We believe it’s important for the American people to know how hard President Biden is working to get Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan home. We think it’s important for their families to know how hard we’re working on this.” A senior administration official said Justice Department lawyers, who have long argued against releasing Mr. Bout, part of an institutional reluctance to trade away federal prisoners, voiced initial opposition to the deal but were overruled by Mr. Biden. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Mr. Blinken disclosed the existence of the proposal hours after Ms. Griner testified for the first time about her arrest, telling a Russian courtroom that she had been tossed into a bewildering legal system with little explanation of what was happening and what she might do to try to defend herself. Ms. Griner described arriving in Russia after an exhausting 13-hour flight — soon after recovering from Covid — and finding herself in an interrogation in which much of what was being said remained untranslated. She said she was told to sign papers with no explanation of what they were. Her case has taken on outside importance amid the lowest point in relations between Russia and the United States since the end of the Cold War. She arrived for the hearing with her wrists shackled in front of her, and flanked by Russian security agents, including some wearing bulletproof vests, their faces covered by balaclavas. She has been accused by the Russian authorities of having two vape cartridges of hashish oil in her luggage when she arrived at an airport near Moscow. Russia did not make her detention public until after it invaded Ukraine. Ms. Griner, 31, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, had been traveling to Russia to play with a team in Yekaterinburg, about 900 miles east of Moscow, during the W.N.B.A. off-season. In court on Wednesday, Ms. Griner, testifying from an enclosed witness box, said she had been pulled aside during a luggage check in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport, according to her lawyer, Aleksandr Boikov. Ms. Griner “was surprised” that vape cartridges appeared in her luggage and that the interpreter she was provided translated “almost nothing,” Mr. Boikov said. A lawyer came to help after 16 hours of detention, he said. Ms. Griner “explained to the court that she knows and respects Russian laws and never intended to break them,” another one of her lawyers, Maria Blagovolina, said in a statement. “Brittney confirmed that she had a doctor’s prescription for the use of medical cannabis and that in the U.S.A. medical cannabis is quite a popular treatment among professional athletes,” Ms. Blagovolina said. “She emphasized that she never planned to bring it to Russia and use it.” Although Ms. Griner has already entered a guilty plea, the trial is expected to continue into August, her lawyers said. She faces a possible 10-year sentence. Her lawyers hope that her plea will make the court more lenient. Mr. Whelan, 52, a former Marine and corporate security executive, was detained at a Moscow hotel in late 2018 and charged with espionage. The State Department has classified him and Ms. Griner as “wrongfully detained” and has referred their cases to a special hostage affairs office. Ms. Griner’s Russian legal defense team said it had learned about the American offer from the news and that it had not been participating in the discussions. From a legal perspective, the prisoner exchange is possible only after the court reaches a verdict, the lawyers said. In a statement, Mr. Whelan’s brother, David, said the family was just hearing about the U.S. proposal but “appreciates” the administration’s efforts and hopes the Kremlin “accepts this or some other concession that enables Paul to come home to his family.” A lawyer for Mr. Bout, Steve Zissou, declined to comment. Mr. Blinken said the United States was trying to balance the imperatives of freeing wrongfully detained prisoners around the world, while “we work to reinforce the global norm against these arbitrary detentions, against what is truly a horrific practice.” Critics say that prisoner swaps encourage foreign governments and terrorist groups to arrest and kidnap Americans. But the United States did make a trade with Moscow in April, sending home a convicted Russian drug smuggler in exchange for Mr. Reed, who was arrested on charges of assaulting two police officers. Biden administration officials suggested at the time that the trade was an exceptional case. Russian officials had for years — including during discussions about Mr. Reed’s release — led American negotiators to believe they would welcome a trade such as the one now on the table, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. American officials at multiple levels have repeatedly pressed for a response from Russians, the American official said, but to no avail. The official said the decision to go public with the offer was partly an effort to dislodge the Russians, hoping that public pressure might produce a Kremlin response. The senior official said that the White House contacted Elizabeth Whelan, Mr. Whelan’s sister, about the proposal, and that she received it very positively. The White House was unable to reach Cherelle Griner because she was taking the bar exam on Wednesday, the administration official said. Mr. Blinken said he would also press Mr. Lavrov to make good on a deal struck last week between Russia and Ukraine to unblock millions of tons of Ukrainian grain and other agricultural exports to alleviate a worsening global food crisis. U.S. officials have been skeptical that Russia will follow through and open Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. On Saturday, a string of explosions rocked the Ukrainian port of Odesa, threatening to undermine the grain agreement. “There’s a difference between a deal on paper and a deal in practice,” Mr. Blinken said.

Burns, the C.I.A. director, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, did not sound enthusiastic, calling Mr. Bout “a creep.” Mr. Bout, 55, is a former Soviet military officer who made a fortune in global arms trafficking before he was caught in a federal sting operation. Russian officials have pressed his case for years, and in recent weeks Russian media outlets had directly linked his case to Ms. Griner’s. Russia has held Ms. Griner, 31, since mid-February, when she was arrested at a Moscow airport on charges involving hashish oil found in her luggage. She has pleaded guilty to the drug charges against her and said in a court appearance outside Moscow on Wednesday that she accidentally packed a small amount of the cannabis-related substance, which she uses at the direction of a doctor to manage pain. Russia has notoriously strict drug laws. At her trial on Wednesday, she testified of her ordeal navigating an unfamiliar legal system. Mr. Whelan, 52, a former Marine and security company executive, was detained at a Moscow hotel in 2019 and charged with espionage. The State Department has classified both Mr. Whelan and Ms. Griner as “wrongfully detained” and referred their cases to a special hostage affairs office. Mr. Whelan’s brother David said in a statement that the family was just learning about the U.S. proposal. “Our family appreciates the Biden administration seeking Paul’s release using the resources it has available,” he said. “We hope the Russian government responds to the U.S. government and accepts this or some other concession that enables Paul to come home to his family.” Ms. Griner’s Russian defense team said that it had learned about the American offer from the news, and that it had not been participating in the discussions. From the legal perspective, the prisoner exchange is possible only after the court reaches a verdict, the lawyers said. “In any case, we would be really happy if Brittney will be able to come home and hope it will be soon,” said one of her lawyers, Maria Blagovolina. While declining to discuss specifics, Mr. Blinken said the U.S. government was trying to balance the imperatives of freeing wrongfully detained prisoners around the world, while working “to reinforce the global norm against these arbitrary detentions, against what is truly a horrific practice.” Critics say that prisoner swaps encourage foreign governments and terrorist groups to arrest or kidnap Americans. But the United States did make a trade with Moscow in April, sending back a convicted Russian drug smuggler in exchange for Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine who was arrested in Moscow in 2019 on charges of assaulting a police officer. Biden administration officials suggested that trade was an exceptional case made urgent by Mr. Reed’s failing health.",7
2022-07-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/world/middleeast/iran-drone-exports.html,"Iran Ramps Up Drone Exports, Signaling Global Ambitions","Iran has made steady advances in the design and production of military drones in recent years, and has stepped up their transfer to militant groups across the Middle East as it seeks to shift the dynamics of battlefields from Yemen to Gaza. Those efforts have now extended far beyond the region. Iran is now seeking to build its global clout and sell increasingly sophisticated weapons-capable drones commercially to other nations, including those that have been subject to various sanctions in recent years, like Venezuela and Sudan, according to Iranian news media, satellite images and defense experts inside and outside Iran. That has provided an important source of funds and political influence for Iran, which is itself isolated and struggling under U.S. financial restrictions. Now, Russia may be a potential client. Washington said this month that it had intelligence that Moscow planned to purchase hundreds of drones from Iran to bolster its arsenal for the war in Ukraine. U.S. officials have urged Iran not to sell drones to Russia and warned of consequences for both countries. Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement that its military cooperation with Russia predated the war, without providing details, and its foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said in an interview with the Italian daily La Repubblica in July that the country had no plans to provide military equipment to either side of the conflict. Last week, the commander of Iran’s army, Brig. Gen. Kioumars Heydari, said in a speech that the country was “ready to export weapons and military equipment to friendly countries,” adding that Iranian drones were already “being operated far away and beyond our borders,” according to Iranian news media. General Heydari did not mention Russia in his speech, but his comments came on the same day that President Vladimir V. Putin visited Tehran and met with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who voiced support for the war in Ukraine. “Iran is increasingly becoming a global player in terms of drone exports,” said Seth Frantzman, a Jerusalem-based defense analyst and drone expert. “The fact that newer drones, such as the Mohajer-6, are now being seen in places like the Horn of Africa shows that countries see them as a potential game-changer,” he added, referring to an advanced Iranian drone claimed to have a range of about 125 miles and the ability to carry precision-guided munitions. “It’s amazing warfare on the cheap,” said Mr. Frantzman, adding that Iranian drones cost less than other models on the market but were growing in sophistication, and had proved their worth on battlefields across the Middle East. Tehran began drone development in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war. Despite crippling sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear and missile programs in recent years, it has managed to produce and field a vast array of military drones, used for both surveillance and attack, according to analysis by experts. That program has become a major concern for Israel and the United States in recent years. Israel has targeted drone production and storage sites in its escalating shadow war with Tehran. And the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement on July 21 that “the Iran-proliferated network of attack unmanned aerial systems,” or drones, was a key topic of discussion at a recent regional security meeting in Qatar. Iranian drones still remain largely on the margins of the global market, and are primarily bought by low-income or sanctions-hit countries unable to buy them elsewhere, according to Mr. Frantzman. Iran also faces stiff competition from powers like Turkey, whose Bayraktar TB2 drone has been bought by countries like Azerbaijan, Pakistan and Ethiopia, and has been embraced by Ukraine in its war with Russia. A United Nations embargo aimed at preventing Iran from selling and buying weapons expired in 2020, despite protests from the United States, which wanted it extended, removing a significant legal obstacle, analysts said, for Iran to export its drones and carve out its status as a global player in drone technology. An early sign that Iran was capitalizing on the lifting of the embargo and stepping up drone exports emerged in August last year. In Ethiopia, as war raged with Tigrayan rebels, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed toured a military air base on the front line, flanked by military and intelligence officials. In the background, just visible in photos, online sleuths spotted a mysterious winged object sitting on the tarmac. It was an Iranian drone — a Mohajer-6 — armed with air-to-surface missiles. Western diplomats confirmed Ethiopia’s receipt of Iranian drones to The New York Times, and this was later publicly acknowledged by the U.S. Treasury Department last October when they imposed fresh sanctions targeting Iran’s drone program. In February, Defense Minister Benny Gantz of Israel said that Iran’s Mohajer-6 — the same drone model seen in Ethiopia — was also now being sold to Venezuela. He drew attention to footage from November 2020 that showed the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, standing next to a model of the drone during a speech in an aircraft hangar. According to the Venezuelan defense ministry and U.S. officials, Venezuela began purchasing kits to make an earlier Iranian drone, the Mohajer-2, as long ago as 2007, the year the U.N. arms embargo was imposed on Iran. They were for assembly by the Venezuelan state-owned weapons company CAVIM, which was placed under U.S. sanctions in 2013 for trading in contravention of the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act. In July this year, Mr. Maduro displayed armed Iranian combat drones built using Mohajer-2 assembly kits. Israel had accused Iran in February of providing precision-guided missiles to Venezuela for use in the drones. Hossein Dalirian, a military analyst with close ties to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, posted a video on his YouTube channel in January in which he said that Iran was exporting drones to Ethiopia and Venezuela. “The Islamic Republic has long reached mass production level in the production of various drones including military surveillance and suicide drones and now has a very large stock,” Mr. Dalirian said by direct message. “Because the drones are effective and some countries have been enthusiastic about the drones, in recent years Iran has been exporting drones such as New Mohajer-2 (M2-N) and Mohajer-6 (M6) and even Ababil (AB-2).” Iran has supplied drones to Sudan, too, according to military analysts, satellite imagery, and photographic analysis of drone wreckage, although Khartoum is also subject to a U.N. arms embargo. In 2008, when U.N. peacekeepers inquired about combat drones they saw being used in Sudan, they were told these were a version of Iran’s Ababil-3. Iran has both political and financial incentives to sell drones to such countries, as well as supplying them to proxy groups as part of its regional policy in the Middle East. The sales allow Tehran to build international links in defiance of Western efforts to isolate it, and provide an additional source of revenue alongside oil sold in contravention of sanctions. In May, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, the commander in chief of Iran’s armed forces, traveled to Tajikistan to inaugurate a factory making Ababil-2 drones. It’s the first drone factory that Iran has built abroad, and Iranian media covered the event extensively, hailing it as a milestone in the homegrown weapons development program and a sign that Iran was now a real player in the drone market. The Tasnim News Agency, affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards, said that Iran was “deepening its strategic influence in the east” by exporting the drones. The official newspaper of the government, Iran, wrote that “the successful experience of Iran’s weapons in the Middle East and in Ethiopia has resulted in Iran becoming a major exporter of weapons in the region and internationally.” Iranian drones have been deployed in numerous attacks against Israel, as well as in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and, in October last year, a U.S. base in Syria, according to intelligence officials. Countries around the world have started to take notice. “They have created this viable drone capacity, so it is no surprise that other countries are interested in obtaining such technologies,” said Farzin Nadimi, a military analyst and associate fellow at the Washington Institute who specializes in Iran’s defense industry. “Iranian drones should be taken seriously as a weapon,” he said.",8
2022-07-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/world/europe/viktor-bout-russia-prisoner-swap.html,Viktor Bout Could Be Swapped for Brittney Griner. Who Is He?,"Shortly after his conviction in 2011 on charges including conspiring to kill American citizens, the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout relayed a defiant message through his lawyer, even though he faced the prospect of decades in prison. Mr. Bout, his lawyer said, “believes this is not the end.” More than a decade later, Mr. Bout, 55, may be nearing a chance for a new beginning even though he has served less than half of his 25-year prison sentence. The United States, trying to negotiate the release of two Americans imprisoned in Russia — the basketball star Brittney Griner and a former Marine, Paul Whelan — proposed exchanging them last month for Mr. Bout, according to a person briefed on the negotiations. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Wednesday that the United States had made “a substantial proposal” to the Kremlin, but declined to discuss details of a possible swap and did not name Mr. Bout. He said he expected to raise the issue in the coming days with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov. Russian officials have pressed for Mr. Bout’s return since his conviction in 2011 by a New York jury on four counts that included conspiring to kill American citizens. Prosecutors said he had agreed to sell antiaircraft weapons to drug enforcement informants who were posing as arms buyers for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The attorney general at the time, Eric Holder, called Mr. Bout (pronounced “Boot”) “one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers.” Mr. Bout become notorious among American intelligence officials, earning the nickname “Merchant of Death” as he evaded capture for years. His exploits helped inspire a 2005 film, “Lord of War,” that starred Nicolas Cage as a character fashioned after Mr. Bout. Now, he is probably the highest-profile Russian in U.S. custody and the prisoner Russia has campaigned the most vociferously to have returned. If he is sent back to Russia, it is likely to reignite the debate over the wisdom of engaging in prisoner exchanges for Americans the United States considers “wrongfully detained” — as is the case with Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan. In interviews with journalists, Mr. Bout has repeatedly denied accusations that he has worked for Russian intelligence agencies. But Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russia’s security services, said there are strong signs — Mr. Bout’s education, his social and professional networks, and his logistical skills — that he is a member, or at least was in close collaboration with, Russia’s military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U. “That is also the opinion of U.S. and other authorities — and it explains the reasons Russia has been so assiduously campaigning to get him back,” said Mr. Galeotti, a lecturer on Russia and transnational crime at University College London. “All countries try to get their citizens out of rough jurisdictions, but it is clear that it has been a particular priority for the Russians in getting Viktor Bout back.” Mr. Bout grew up in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, until his conscription into the Soviet military at age 18. After a term in the Army, he studied Portuguese at the Military Institute of Foreign Languages in Moscow, a common entree to Russian intelligence services, and eventually became an officer in the Air Force. The Soviet Union broke apart not long after Mr. Bout left the military. As Russia’s economy collapsed and criminal groups thrived, he moved to the United Arab Emirates and started a cargo company that grew to a fleet of 60 planes. With military supplies of former Soviet states leaking onto the black market, his shipping empire delivered guns to rebels, militants and terrorists around the world, prosecutors said. In the new era of privatization in Russia, arms traffickers were able to use old Soviet-era social, military and business networks, and to also develop shell companies to hide transactions. Mr. Bout was accused of selling weapons to Al Qaeda, the Taliban and militants in Rwanda. According to several investigations and his U.S. indictment, he and his associates flouted arms embargoes in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Algeria, where he sold weapons to both the government forces and the rebels fighting them. His ability to avoid being captured added to his notoriety among Western intelligence officials. In 1995, the Taliban forced down one of his planes in Afghanistan and seized the cargo and imprisoned the crew. Mr. Bout and Russian officials somehow managed to get the crew out of the country: In 2003, he told The New York Times Magazine “they were extracted,” and in 2012, The New Yorker reported, he said they simply escaped. U.S. authorities finally caught up with him in Bangkok in 2008. Mr. Bout met with undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agents he believed represented rebels from Colombia’s Revolutionary Armed Forces, or FARC, which the United States considered a terrorist organization until last year. When the prospective buyers told him the weapons could be used to kill American pilots , Mr. Bout responded, “We have the same enemy,” prosecutors said. Thai authorities arrested him on the spot. He was extradited to the United States in 2010 and two years later was sentenced to 25 years. In the years since, Russian authorities have maintained Mr. Bout’s innocence and brought him up as a possible swap for other high-profile American and Ukrainian detainees held by Russia. He has been at the center of a Russian campaign, “we don’t abandon our own,” that has cast his arrest as unfair and politically motivated. Mr. Bout’s exchange has been a priority for Russia “a matter of honor and a matter of ruthless pragmatism,” said Mr. Galeotti, the Russia expert. Russian intelligence agencies “have inherited from the former Soviet K.G.B. a culture that makes it clear to its own agents — ‘we will get you back.’ That kind of loyalty to your own is really important when you are expecting people to put themselves potentially in harm’s way.” On Wednesday evening, Mr. Bout’s wife, Alla, told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that neither she nor her husband had heard anything about his possible exchange. “We talked on the phone yesterday,” she said, according to the news agency. “We, of course, assume that such negotiations can take place, but we do not talk about this, because neither he nor I have any information.” Oleg Morozov, a member of Russia’s Parliament, the Duma, cheered the possibility of Mr. Bout’s return. “Viktor Bout was illegally convicted and has been waiting for help from the Russian state for many years,” he told Ria Novosti. “If there is an opportunity to achieve his release, then, in my opinion, this chance should be used.” It is unclear whether Mr. Bout’s possible return would further encourage Russia to arrest Westerners who can be traded; Moscow denies allegations that it intentionally arrests people to force an exchange. “The very real risk with this deal is that it stands to incentivize foreign powers to grab Americans off the streets and throw them in jail,” said Lee Wolosky, a former National Security Council official in the Clinton administration, who led the initial U.S. effort to capture Mr. Bout. “And the more prominent those traveling Americans are, the better.” Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist and expert on the security services who is a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said that while Mr. Bout was the highest profile Russian prisoner in America, there were many more Russians in U.S. prisons, particularly for hacking. The Russian authorities, Mr. Soldatov said, learned how to “create banks of hostages” in the early 2000s during a brutal war with the breakaway region of Chechnya, right after President Vladimir V Putin came to power. “It was a lesson they never quite forgot,” said Mr. Soldatov. Referring to Russian security agencies, he said, “It makes total sense, from their point of view to do the same with the U.S.” Michael Crowley and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.",7
2022-07-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/world/europe/prisoner-swaps-exchanges-us.html,Here Are Some Prisoner Swaps That Freed Americans,"The prospect of the United States exchanging a Russian prisoner for the basketball star Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, a former Marine, is reminiscent of the fraught deals Washington orchestrated with Moscow and its allies during and after the Cold War. Perhaps the most dramatic exchange was the 1962 swap on a fog-shrouded bridge between East Germany and West Berlin that became the stuff of Hollywood. The United States exchanged Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, a Soviet spy, for Francis Gary Powers, the American pilot of a U‐2 spy plane that shot down over the Soviet Union two years earlier. More than 50 years later, the trade was portrayed in Steven Spielberg’s 2015 film, “Bridge of Spies.” Now, experts say a prisoner exchange may be the only path to freedom for Mr. Whelan and Ms. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who plays for the Phoenix Mercury. If a prisoner exchange occurs, they would join a long succession of Americans abducted or arrested abroad whose releases have underscored the delicate task of negotiating with adversarial countries. Here are some of the most high-profile prisoner swaps between the United States and other countries:",7
2022-07-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/opinion/russia-us-outer-space.html,Opinion | The Final Frontier Soon May No Longer Belong to All of Us,"The Russian government has said that it will‌ withdraw from the International Space Station‌ “after 2024.” Instead of choosing multilateral cooperation, it plans to build its own station and send cosmonauts there to continue space research and exploration. Russia’s announcement sounds ominous — particularly given its invasion of Ukraine — but ‌this move, part of a broader trend away from multilateralism in international space law, is but one recent signal of the fraying of international space cooperation. Another was the Artemis Accords, a legal framework designed to potentially regulate future commercial activities in outer space, which was created under the Trump‌ administration and upheld by the Biden ‌‌administration. Such actions threaten multilateralism beyond Earth and portend a future where space may no longer belong, equally, to all people. A number of U.N. treaties‌‌ regulate outer space, and ‌strong legal norms ‌bolster those global rules. The foundational agreement is the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which lays out ‌‌the principles that govern outer space, the moon and other celestial bodies. Signed in the middle of the Cold War, the treaty was a symbol of the triumph of science over politics: States could cooperate in space, even as the prospect of mutual destruction loomed on Earth. Currently, more than 100 countries — including the United States and Russia — are parties to the ‌treaty, which establishes outer space as a peaceful zone, ‌‌prohibits the use or installation of weapons of mass destruction‌‌ and ‌designates space as “the province of all mankind.” ‌ ‌States cannot make claims of sovereignty or ‌‌appropriate territory. ‌The treaty also calls for scientific cooperation among states, with the belief that such cooperation will promote “friendly relations” among countries and their peoples. In short, the treaty intends that all nations benefit‌ from any activities conducted in space. The symbolic value of the treaty is obvious: Nationality recedes into the background when astronauts are floating in space. But beyond that, it has created standards and practices to prevent environmental contamination of the moon and other celestial bodies. It promotes data sharing, including about the many objects, like satellites and spacecraft, launched into space, which helps to avoid collisions. And its codified norms of the common heritage of mankind, peaceful use and scientific cooperation help preserve multilateralism in the face of states’ derogations. But the looming prospect of the commercialization of space has begun to test the limits of international space law. In 2020, NASA, alone, created the Artemis Accords, which challenge the foundational multilateral principles of ‌prior space agreements. These are rules primarily drafted by the United States that other countries are now adopting. This is not collaborative multilateral rule making but rather the export of U.S. laws abroad to a coalition of the willing. The accords take the legal form of a series of bilateral treaties with 21 foreign nations, including Australia, Canada, Japan, the U.A.E. and Britain. This is not simply a relic of the antiglobalist rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration. Just two weeks ago, ‌ Saudi Arabia‌ signed the Artemis Accords, during President Biden’s visit. Moreover, the accords open up the possibility of mining the moon or other celestial bodies for resources. They create “safety zones” where states may extract resources, though the document states that these activities must be undertaken in accordance with the ‌Outer Space Treaty. Legal experts point out that these provisions could violate the principle of nonappropriation, which prohibits countries from declaring parts of space as their sovereign territory. Others suggest that it is important to get in front of the changing technological landscap‌e, arguing that when mining the moon becomes possible, there should already be rules in place to regulate such activities‌. Failure to do so could result in a ‌‌crisis similar to that around seabed mining‌‌, which is poised to begin even though U.N. rules have yet to be finalized. Though well codified in international law, norms of cooperation are only as strong as the state policies and activities that reinforce them. When countries, especially powerful ones, create rules that run counter to these norms, multilateral institutions can unravel or, worse, become irrelevant. Such unraveling can create opportunities for updated rules that better reflect changes in world politics and technology. But it can also result in a less equitable institution that favors powerful nations and provides an unfair opportunity to reap economic benefits. For this reason, developing countries have long been staunch proponents of “the province of all mankind” as a way to counterbalance the power of wealthier nations and ensure their right to benefit financially from extraction of global resources. In the end, Russia’s withdrawal from the International Space Station‌ is but one piece of a larger set of fluid issues in space governance. ‌Russia and the United States — powerful, spacefaring states — have taken steps that challenge existing rules and norms. Russia alone cannot dismantle the collective efforts to maintain space as a peaceful zone of scientific research and exploration, but the current system is in trouble and is likely to be replaced with U.S.-made regulations that allow for the future commercialization of space. That future is the real threat to multilateralism and to humanity’s rights to the final frontier. Jessica F. Green (@greenprofgreen) is a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.

2022-07-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/29/opinion/brittney-griner-prisoner-swap.html,Opinion | Brittney Griner and the Total Lopsidedness of Prisoner Swaps with Russia,"Reports are circulating that the United States is negotiating with Russia to exchange two Americans being held in Russian prisons for a notorious arms dealer serving time in America. The deal is totally lopsided: The two Americans — the basketball star Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, a security company executive — are not criminals and certainly not remotely comparable to Viktor Bout, a notorious purveyor of arms to terrorists once known as the “Merchant of Death.” But if that’s the way to get American citizens out of a Russian prison, do it. The only caveat, an urgent one, would be to include in the deal Marc Fogel, an American teacher sentenced to an absurd 14 years in prison for taking marijuana into Russia. His infractions are similar to the ones Ms. Griner, 31, is charged with. She was detained in February with two hashish oil vape cartridges in her luggage; Mr. Fogel, 61, was carrying 14 vape cartridges of marijuana and some cannabis buds. Both say they need cannabis for dealing with injuries and pain. But for reasons the State Department has not clarified, the U.S. government has designated Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan as “wrongfully detained” but not Mr. Fogel. Secretary of State Antony Blinken did not mention this third American prisoner during a recent news conference, in which he said he intended to take up the matter of a swap for Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov of Russia. Mr. Fogel was a popular teacher at the Anglo-American School in Moscow (not a U.S. Embassy employee, according to The Washington Post, as some reports described him) who’d had surgeries on his back and shoulder and a knee replacement and was taking medical marijuana for pain. Ms. Griner, a W.N.B.A. star, testified that she used marijuana on the advice of a doctor. Ms. Griner and Mr. Fogel were arrested on charges related to possession of the marijuana found in their luggage on arrival at the Moscow airport, and both pleaded guilty. Mr. Whelan, a former Marine who worked as director of global security and investigations for BorgWarner and had visited Russia several times, was arrested in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years for spying. He denies the charge. The issue, however, is not whether the three American prisoners are guilty. Nor should efforts to free Americans held in repressive countries be based on their celebrity or the publicity generated by their arrests. The Russian justice system — like those in China and Iran, other countries with which the United States has organized prisoner swaps — is notoriously political, and any American imprisoned in those countries, guilty or not, is likely being held either for propaganda purposes or as hostages to exchange for imprisoned Russians. Such swaps are hardly new, so precedent is not an issue. In a celebrated swap 60 years ago, Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy, was exchanged for Francis Gary Powers, the American pilot of a downed U-2 spy plane; among the more famous ones that followed was the exchange of the Jewish dissident Natan Sharansky for a Czech caught spying for the Soviet Union. In September 1986, when I was a correspondent in the Soviet Union, a friend and colleague, Nicholas Daniloff, who was a correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, was framed by a phony dissident and arrested on charges of espionage. By no coincidence, a Soviet employee of the Soviet mission to the United Nations was arrested three days earlier on spying charges. The two were quickly swapped, and at a news conference on his release, Mr. Daniloff said that the K.G.B. was always prepared to nab someone for such an exchange. “They could have chosen Serge Schmemann,” he said, and in fact, the decoy dissident had tried to contact me as well. Most recently, Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine held for two years in Russia on what his family described as phony charges of assault, was swapped in April for a Russian pilot convicted of drug trafficking. The swaps are rarely even. Mr. Bout, the Russian who is mooted as the price for freeing the Americans, was notorious in the chaotic years after the collapse of the Soviet Union as an arms dealer to, according to U.S. prosecutors, armed groups and terrorists. Arrested in Thailand in 2008, he was extradited to the United States a couple of years later, charged with supplying arms to Colombian rebels for use against American citizens and officers, among other charges, and sentenced to 25 years in prison, which he has been serving in Illinois. It would be painful for prosecutors and those who suffered in the violence he profited from to release him in exchange for people who should not have been imprisoned at all. Mr. Fogel, if he serves his full sentence in Russia, could well die in prison. It may be that by agreeing to swap prisoners with autocrats, the United States encourages them to grab more hostages. But it is more important that American citizens should know that if they are imprisoned in a country with a dubious legal system, the U.S. government will do all it can to get them back. “I am an American citizen” should carry the full faith and promise of the American government, no matter where in the world those words are spoken. And that is as true for Mr. Fogel as it is for Ms. Griner or Mr. Whelan. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-07-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/us/politics/griner-bout-hostages-diplomacy.html,"Why the U.S. Offered to Swap Griner for Bout, a Russian Arms Dealer","WASHINGTON — One is perhaps the world’s most notorious arms dealer, a man known as the “Merchant of Death” who sold weapons to terrorists, rebels and militants around the world before finally being hunted down and locked up for conspiring to kill Americans. The other is a basketball player who got caught with a little hashish oil. By no measure are they comparable, yet the Biden administration has proposed trading the merchant of death for the imprisoned basketball player as well as a former marine held in Russia on what are considered trumped-up espionage charges. In the harsh and cynical world of international diplomacy, prisoner exchanges are rarely pretty, but unpalatable choices are often the only choices on the table. Whether the swap would go through remained unclear. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made the offer public in part to reassure the families of Brittney Griner, the basketball player, and Paul N. Whelan, the former marine, that the administration is doing all it can to free them. Russian officials, who have long sought the release of the arms trafficker Viktor Bout, confirmed the discussion on Thursday but said Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov was too busy to talk with Mr. Blinken now. The disclosure of the negotiations raised obvious questions about what, if any, standards should apply when the United States agrees to trade prisoners, a conundrum that has challenged the nation’s leaders since its founding. The debate becomes all the more complex when it involves exchanging not soldiers on a battlefield or spies in a Cold War but dangerous criminals for civilians whose real crime is being caught up in wrong-place, wrong-time international intrigue. “The fact that Bout is a big fish isn’t really part of the calculus,” said Jeremy Bash, who was chief of staff at the C.I.A. when the United States made a high-profile spy swap with Russia in 2010. “We value our own citizens a thousand times more than we value the foreign criminal. Israel takes the same approach. They’d trade a thousand Hamas fighters for one I.D.F. soldier. We in the U.S. take the same attitude. We will do almost anything to save an American life.” But other veterans of past administrations expressed concern that such exchanges, especially one that seems on its face to be as imbalanced as swapping a death-dealing arms merchant for an athlete who may have vaped, would only encourage the imprisonment of more Americans who could be used as hostages. “I take a pretty hard line on it,” said John R. Bolton, a former U.N. ambassador and national security adviser. “It’s one thing to exchange prisoners of war. It’s one thing to exchange spies when you know that’s going on.” But “negotiations and exchanges with terrorists or with authoritarian governments” become dangerous “because then you’re just putting a price on the next American hostage.” Ms. Griner’s case has commanded attention not just because she is a star player in the W.N.B.A. but also because her arrest came a week before Russia invaded Ukraine and seemed to be a brazen attempt by Moscow to gain a bargaining chip. Mr. Biden has come under enormous pressure to find a way to free her and approved the offer of Mr. Bout over the concerns of the Justice Department, which often takes a dim view of horse trading the criminals it puts away. Mr. Bout, a former Soviet military officer, was once one of the world’s most wanted men, accused of selling weapons to Al Qaeda, the Taliban and various governments and militants in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Algeria. The movie “Lord of War,” starring Nicolas Cage and released in 2005, was based on his case. American agencies hunted him down for years until finally catching up with him in Bangkok in 2008 and extraditing him in 2010. Why the Russians would be so intent on freeing Mr. Bout so long after his capture is something of a mystery. Any secret information Moscow may have worried about him revealing presumably was spilled long ago or is certainly dated by now. But it may simply be a feeling of solidarity on the part of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a former K.G.B. officer. “There are lots of hints in Bout’s biography, even on his Wikipedia page, which suggests that he had close ties with Soviet and Russian intelligence,” said Michael A. McFaul, a former American ambassador to Moscow. “You know who else does? Putin. My guess is that Putin wants to liberate his comrade. Loyalty among these folks, the Chekists, runs deep.” Still, even after the U.S. offered up Mr. Bout, Russia seemed to be playing hard to get. After Mr. Blinken said he was ready to talk with Mr. Lavrov for the first time since the invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials indicated they were in no hurry. Mr. Lavrov “will pay attention to this request when time permits,” his spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said on Thursday. “Now he has a busy schedule of international contacts.” Some veteran hostage negotiators were perplexed that Mr. Blinken made the offer public. “It is baffling why the U.S. would announce this proposal in the midst of the negotiations,” said Rob Saale, the former head of the F.B.I.-led Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell. “If you’re in sensitive negotiations why would you want to air this out publicly? It makes me wonder if the Russians haven’t already declined the deal.” The trade in soldiers, spies and hostages has been vexing American leaders since before independence, when General George Washington quarreled with the Continental Congress over a prisoner exchange with the British. Jimmy Carter’s failure to negotiate the release of hostages held by Iran cost him re-election as president, and the man who beat him, Ronald Reagan, later got in trouble for trading arms for other hostages controlled by Iranian groups. During the Cold War, American and Russian leaders traded captured spies — and sometimes journalists or other civilians accused of being spies who were seized for leverage. “As a general rule, we shouldn’t reward hostage takers with prisoner swaps as it only incentivizes hostage taking,” Mr. Bash said. “Exceptions should be exceedingly rare and only when other diplomatic efforts are exhausted.” The Biden administration’s decision to offer a swap for Ms. Griner may rile some of America’s allies, which have held the line in their own hostage situations, including on behalf of the United States. A case in point: Nine days after Canada arrested a Chinese executive of Huawei in 2018 at the request of the United States, China seized two Canadian businessmen. For nearly three years, Canada resisted linking the cases despite enormous public pressure to bring its citizens home until the United States finally agreed to let the Huawei executive return to China last year after admitting wrongdoing in a fraud case. The Canadians were freed at the same time. Among those who say that prisoner swaps should not be controversial is Trevor R. Reed, a former U.S. marine who was just freed in April from Russian custody in exchange for a Russian pilot serving a lengthy prison term in the United States on cocaine trafficking charges. “The thing that you have to understand is countries like North Korea — Russia now, obviously, China, Syria, Iran, Venezuela — countries like that are going to take Americans hostage no matter what,” Mr. Reed told CNN’s Jake Tapper in May. “And even if they don’t receive some type of exchange for those prisoners, they will do that anyway just out of pure malice just to show the United States that, ‘We took your citizens.’” For their families as well, the choice looks different than for geopolitical figures worried about the precedent. “It’s a hard call, and fortunately I’m not the president of the United States,” David Whelan, Paul’s brother, told Fox News on Thursday. “But if the president makes that difficult decision, I would absolutely support Paul’s release if that’s the outcome.” In recent years, the U.S. government has sought to create a more systematic approach to such situations. President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2015 creating a special presidential envoy at the State Department dedicated to bringing home wrongfully detained American citizens. President Donald J. Trump signed legislation in late 2020 shortly before leaving office codifying the special envoy and directing the State Department to evaluate every case of an American detained overseas to determine if they are being held illegitimately and refer those who are to the hostage affairs office. Just this month, Mr. Biden signed an executive order building on the 2020 law to provide support for families of Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage overseas and to authorize financial and travel sanctions on those who are deemed responsible. But Jared Genser, a longtime human rights lawyer who represents Americans held by foreign governments and has advocated some of the changes, said the reforms have not gone far enough. He has sent a proposal to Mr. Blinken and Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, urging a multinational agreement to facilitate joint responses to hostage taking, so that if a citizen of one signatory nation were wrongfully detained, many nations would take common action against the perpetrator. He also outlined the idea in a Wall Street Journal guest essay. “In essence, since ’79, we are over and over and over again trying the same failed approach to recover our hostages,” Mr. Genser said in an interview. “We do this on a case-by-case basis, country by country, with blinders on as we do these negotiations. If a case gets a lot of public profile, it gets more resources and attention. But if you can’t get higher profile, you get no or little help at all.” It was time, he said, to try to “end hostage taking once and for all.” Adam Goldman contributed reporting.",7
2022-08-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia-court.html,Brittney Griner Back in Russian Court as Lawyers Plead for Leniency,"Escorted by a masked police officer with a dog, her wrists handcuffed, the American basketball star Brittney Griner appeared in a Russian court on Tuesday for another hearing in a trial that is likely to end with her conviction in the middle of this month, her lawyers said. One of the best players of her generation, Ms. Griner has been caught up in a confrontation between Russia and the United States over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As the case is heard in a courtroom, the wrangling over Ms. Griner’s fate has shifted increasingly to the diplomatic arena, with Russia and the United States signaling her possible involvement in an exchange for high-profile Russians in U.S. custody. Last week, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the American government had “put a substantial proposal on the table,” although he declined to discuss the details. On Thursday, he discussed the matter with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, in their first phone call since the war in Ukraine. But no breakthroughs were reported, and no progress is expected before Anna S. Sotnikova, a judge in the town of Khimki, near Moscow, delivers a verdict in the case. Ms. Griner, 31, was detained in a Moscow airport while traveling to Yekaterinburg, Russia, to play for a local team there about one week before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Customs officials found two vape cartridges containing less than one gram of hashish oil in her luggage. News of her detention was made public only after the war started, however. She was charged with attempting to smuggle a significant amount of illegal narcotics into Russia, an offense that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Last month, Ms. Griner plead guilty to the charges, stressing that she had not intended to break Russian law and that the illegal substance had been in her luggage as a result of oversight while packing in a hurry. In Russia, a guilty plea does not end a trial, and the proceedings are expected to continue until mid-August, according to her legal team. On Tuesday, Ms. Griner’s lawyers called in an expert, who testified that the analysis of vape cartridges carried out by the state did not meet Russian legal requirements. Thus, “it would be wrong to establish the exact amount” of the illegal substance, said Aleksandr Boikov, Ms. Griner’s lawyer. According to the Russian criminal code, the severity of punishment depends on the amount of narcotics discovered in the defendant’s possession, among other things. Ms. Griner’s legal team is trying to persuade the judge to soften the eventual sentence. They had one of Ms. Griner’s Russian teammates, Yevgeniya Belyakova, testify, along with the team’s director and doctor. Her legal team has also argued that she was authorized to use medicinal cannabis in Arizona, where she has played for the Phoenix Mercury since 2013, to mitigate pain from injuries to her spine, ankle and knees. During her own testimony in court last week, Ms. Griner described how upon detention she had faced a confusing and sometimes bewildering Russian legal system. Her rights were not explained to her and a lawyer was provided only 16 hours after her detention began, she said. Ms. Griner also said that she had been instructed to sign papers with no explanation of what they implied and that an interpreter, provided by the law enforcement, had translated “almost nothing.” The hearing was adjourned until Thursday, when both sides will present their closing arguments, said Maria Blagovolina, a lawyer with the Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners firm, which is also representing Ms. Griner.",7
2022-08-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/us/politics/sweden-finland-nato-senate-vote.html,Senate Overwhelmingly Votes to Add Sweden and Finland to NATO,"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a treaty that would expand NATO to include Finland and Sweden, with Republicans and Democrats linking arms to pave the way for one of the most significant expansions of the alliance in decades amid Russia’s continued assault on Ukraine. The vote was 95 to 1, with only Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, opposing the move. The lopsided tally, far surpassing the two-thirds support necessary to approve a treaty, underscored the bipartisan appetite for a more muscular Western military alliance even amid threats from Russian officials that Sweden and Finland would face retaliation should they join NATO. “Finland’s and Sweden’s membership will strengthen NATO even further, and is all the more urgent given Russian aggression, given Putin’s immoral and unjustified war in Ukraine,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader. “Putin is strengthening the NATO alliance, and nothing shows it better” than the Senate’s resounding approval of the pact. All 30 current members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization must ratify the accession of the two countries. Twenty-two countries have already done so, but as recently as two weeks ago, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was threatening to block Finland and Sweden’s membership bids, which would prolong the process. Still, the approval of the United States is a crucial step, and the vote was a triumph for President Biden. It was a vindication of his push to rally Western allies to confront Mr. Putin’s brutal campaign in Ukraine and a step toward fulfilling his pledge as a presidential candidate to restore the alliances frayed badly during the Trump era and reassert the role of the United States in protecting democracy around the world. “This historic vote sends an important signal of the sustained, bipartisan U.S. commitment to NATO, and to ensuring our alliance is prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,” Mr. Biden said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to welcoming “two strong democracies with highly capable militaries, into the greatest defensive alliance in history.” Democrats argued that adding Sweden and Finland to NATO would reduce the burden on the United States and the broader alliance. “More than ever, it is crystal clear that NATO plays a vital role for the security of the United States and as a bulwark in protecting peace and democracies throughout the world,” said Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. “Seventy years ago, democratic nations of Europe and the United States came together to defend the liberty, freedom and individual rights of their citizens from the threat of a militarized Soviet Union,” Mr. Menendez continued. “Now — as then — the defensive alliance serves as a bulwark of stability and the rule of law for the people of its member states.” The vote margin also reflected a striking repudiation by Republicans of the “America First” philosophy espoused by President Donald J. Trump, who was openly contemptuous of NATO and of American commitments to international organizations. Some Republicans in the Senate have watched with alarm as a growing number of their colleagues, seeking to emulate Mr. Trump and appeal to his supporters, have taken up anti-interventionist positions at odds with their party’s traditional hawkish stance. Even while Mr. Trump occupied the White House, foreign policy was one of the few areas where Republicans dared challenge him. The overwhelming tally on Wednesday — with just one defection — was one of the most forceful rejections yet of that isolationist worldview. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, voted present. Few Republicans expressed qualms with the notion of entering a mutual defense pact with a country that shares an 800-mile border with Russia, instead arguing that doing so would strengthen the alliance. The vote came a day after Republicans in the House rallied around Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California — one of their most bitter political adversaries — for defying the Chinese government’s warnings and traveling to Taiwan. That support, and the resounding vote on Wednesday, were a stark contrast to the pitched battles Republicans have engaged in with Democrats on domestic policy. It also marked the success of a concerted effort by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, who has long pushed against the anti-interventionist strain in his party, but in recent months launched a particularly aggressive effort to publicly rally support for the kind of assertive military presence abroad that was once viewed as Republican orthodoxy. Determined to show the world that Mr. Trump’s views on military aid and alliances did not hold sway over Senate Republicans, the Republican leader traveled in May to Ukraine, Sweden and Finland. Mr. McConnell argued that both Sweden and Finland would be able to carry their share of the defense burden, in an attempt to counter a concern frequently raised by conservatives about adding to the alliance. And he had made the case to his members that “even closer cooperation” with the two nations would help the United States counter China, another argument invoked by Republicans contending that the U.S. needs to shift its defense resources away from Europe and toward Asia. “Their accession will make NATO stronger and America more secure,” Mr. McConnell said in a speech from the Senate floor on Wednesday. “If any senator is looking for a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish them good luck.” Only Mr. Hawley, who is widely viewed as an aspiring presidential candidate in 2024, voted against the treaty, writing in an opinion article that “NATO expansion would almost certainly mean more U.S. forces in Europe for the long haul.” “In the face of this stark reality, we must choose,” Mr. Hawley said. “We must do less in Europe (and elsewhere) in order to prioritize China and Asia.” The four other Republican senators who are widely assumed to harbor presidential aspirations — Ted Cruz of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Tim Scott of South Carolina, and Marco Rubio of Florida — all voted in favor of the expansion. Mr. Cruz, in a brief interview, called NATO “the most successful military alliance in modern history,” and said that “bringing in serious additional military capacity” would only strengthen it. And Mr. Cotton took to the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon ahead of the vote to deliver a point-by-point argument against the treaty’s opponents, casting them as “alarmist and backward.” “Some critics say America shouldn’t pledge to protect countries halfway around the world,” Mr. Cotton said. “But these critics are seven decades too late. We’re already treaty-bound to defend more than two dozen nations in Europe.” The “real question today,” he said, “is whether adding two capable and strong nations to our mutual defense pact will make us stronger or weaker.” Only the Senate is vested with the authority to consider and approve treaties. The House last month, in a display of solidarity, passed a nonbinding resolution supporting Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO, in a 394 to 18 vote.",1
2022-08-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/world/europe/china-russia-taiwan-ukraine-analysis.html,"Taiwan and Ukraine: Two Crises, 5,000 Miles Apart, Are Linked in Complex Ways","Hours before Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in late February, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement that was clear, stern and not really about Russia or Ukraine at all. “Taiwan is not Ukraine,” Hua Chunying, the ministry’s spokeswoman, told reporters in Beijing. “Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China. This is an indisputable legal and historical fact.” But with no end in sight to the bloody war in Ukraine and with tensions significantly rising in the Taiwan Strait, the two geopolitical challenges are intersecting in complex and unpredictable ways. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Wednesday wasted no time in linking the two, saying that Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit this week to Taiwan was a “manifestation of the same course” that the United States has taken in Ukraine. Even though it was Russia that invaded Ukraine, he blamed the West for the conflict. The fear since the outset of the war in Ukraine has been that Moscow and Beijing will be driven closer together as the United States casts both issues as a struggle between authoritarianism and democracy — as Ms. Pelosi did in the spring during her visit to Ukraine and on Wednesday while in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital. There are a multitude of differences between Ukraine and Taiwan, including history and geography. But both embattled democracies sit next to much larger, nuclear-armed military powers ruled by authoritarian leaders who have made it clear that they do not see their neighbors as sovereign states. One major difference, of course, is that the United States and its allies support an independent Ukraine, but America’s “One China” policy does not support Taiwan’s independence, while remaining purposely unclear about whether Washington would defend Taiwan if Beijing attacks it. As the nervousness, rhetoric and military posturing surrounding Ms. Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan demonstrated, many are asking what path China will choose, and when. The White House urged Ms. Pelosi not to visit Taiwan, reflecting Washington’s delicate balancing act as it plays a central role in both dramas, seeking to strengthen the international order around Western values while avoiding a wider conflagration. While Washington has now offered Ukraine more than $8 billion in direct military support — part of more than $54 billion in assistance that has proved a vital lifeline to Kyiv — President Biden has repeatedly said that he does not want to take any action that could set off a direct confrontation with Russia. So far, despite the mutual bluster, Moscow has been careful not to draw NATO into its war. The Biden administration has also worked to help maintain solidarity with and among European allies. But a conflict with China over Taiwan would most likely divide the United States’ allies, especially in Europe. “No one knows at this stage what the outcome of the Ukrainian conflict will be, but relations between Europe and Russia will never be the same again,” Philippe Le Corre, a French scholar of China and a senior fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School, wrote in the Ouest-France newspaper. “With Asia, the remoteness — reinforced by the absence of human contact and international travel for two years — does not favor a possible European involvement in a conflict in Taiwan or in the China Sea.” And while China has offered rhetorical support for Moscow, it has avoided becoming directly embroiled in the conflict. Beijing has not offered the Kremlin military assistance, and it has been careful not to visibly undermine Western sanctions. Both Russia and China are united in opposing what they consider American hegemony and assertion of global leadership. But China, mindful that it is not ready for a major war and needs open global trade, has always been careful not to push its confrontation with Washington or its allies in the Pacific too far. “I don’t think that provoking the U.S. over the Ukraine issue would be a response they would take,” said Steven Goldstein, an associate at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies and the director of the Taiwan Studies Workshop at Harvard University. “When China gets angry with the U.S. over Taiwan, they punish Taiwan.” “The biggest danger,” he said in an interview, “is we stumble into something.” The deeper the United States and China spiral into a cycle of provocation, the greater the chances for a false move that could turn an abstract threat into war.",22
2022-08-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/world/europe/russia-brittney-griner-sentence.html,Russian Court Sentences Griner to 9 Years in a Penal Colony,"A Russian court on Thursday sentenced the American basketball star Brittney Griner to nine years in a penal colony after convicting her on a drug charge, a harsh penalty that keeps her fate entwined with the geopolitical showdown over the war in Ukraine and ramps up already intense pressure on President Biden to win her release. The U.S. government contends that she is among several Americans who have been “wrongfully detained” by Russia, used as bargaining chips in the increasingly hostile relationship between Moscow and Washington. The Biden administration has offered a prisoner swap involving Ms. Griner, but Russian officials said it was premature to discuss a deal while her case was underway. Now that the trial is concluded, Mr. Biden faces a difficult choice between standing firm on his proposal to trade for Ms. Griner and another American, Paul N. Whelan, or sweetening the offer somehow, with either position liable to draw domestic criticism. The Kremlin, for its part, can use them as leverage, with no incentive to resolve the cases quickly. Her supporters, voicing horror at the verdict and sentence, are clamoring for the president to do something, while the administration is wary of giving in to Russian tactics it has all but labeled as blackmail. “My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible,” Mr. Biden said in a statement after the verdict. Ms. Griner, 31, one of her sport’s biggest global stars, sat mostly expressionless, eyes downcast, leaning her long frame toward the bars of the defendant’s box in a cramped courtroom outside Moscow to hear as the words of the judge, Anna S. Sotnikova, were quietly translated for her. She had already pleaded guilty and conviction is all but certain in Russian courts, so the verdict was a foregone conclusion; the real question was about sentencing. The answer was devastating. The sentence was near the 10-year maximum for her conviction for attempting to smuggle narcotics into the country, based on two vape cartridges containing hashish oil found in Ms. Griner’s luggage when she arrived in February, a week before Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, sent his forces pouring over the border into Ukraine. She and her legal team had hoped for a more lenient penalty based on her guilty plea, her statement that she had not meant to take the cartridges to Russia and testimony that she used the substance legally in the United States to manage pain. “I made an honest mistake, and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn’t end my life here,” she said before the sentencing. She told the court that while she took responsibility for her actions, “I had no intent to break Russian law.” She said that after recovering from a bout of Covid, she had packed hurriedly to rejoin the Russian team she plays for in the W.N.B.A. off-season, and had accidentally left the cartridges in her luggage. “I know that everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics,” she added, “but I hope that that is far from this courtroom.” Ms. Griner’s defense team called the ruling “absolutely unreasonable,” said the court had “completely ignored all the evidence of the defense, and most importantly, the guilty plea,” and vowed to appeal. Elizabeth Rood, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, attended the court session and called the result “a miscarriage of justice.” Russian officials have insisted that Ms. Griner’s case is simply the justice system running its course, with no political overtones — a claim that their American counterparts and many Western analysts dismissed as absurd. William Pomeranz, a Russia expert and acting director of the Kennan Institute, a research group in Washington, noted that Ms. Griner was sentenced not to a prison but to a penal colony, which tends to mean a more remote location — many are in Siberia — and harsher conditions. “She’s probably going to go to a penal colony that’s in the middle of Russia where she won’t know anybody,” he added. “They won’t be able to come and visit. Penal colonies can sometimes be very severe. It will be a tremendous test of her mental state if she ends up going to a penal colony.” The United States has few options, he said. “It will just depend on the Russians and how fast they want to make a deal.” Fellow basketball players, male and female, and basketball executives took to social media to voice support for Ms. Griner and grief at the verdict. Ms. Griner’s team, the Phoenix Mercury, said in a statement: “We remain heartbroken for her, as we have every day for nearly six months. We remain grateful to and confident in the public servants working every day to return her to her family and us.” With Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the indiscriminate destruction it has caused, relations between Washington and Moscow are more confrontational and bitter than they have been in decades. The United States has rallied the West to send arms and other aid to Ukraine, and to punish Moscow with economic sanctions, looking for opportunities to ratchet up the pressure. The two sides have made prisoner exchanges before, most recently in April, when Russia released Trevor R. Reed, an American held on what his family said was a bogus assault charge, in return for a Russian pilot convicted in the United States of cocaine trafficking charges. But rarely have proposed swaps come amid such tension, or involved anyone as prominent as Ms. Griner. In a sign of how high the stakes are for Washington, Ms. Griner’s fate was among the topics discussed last Friday by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, in their first direct conversation since before the invasion. The Biden administration has offered to trade Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan for Viktor Bout, who is serving a 25-year sentence for a 2011 conviction on a federal charge of conspiring to sell weapons to people posing as terrorists intent on killing Americans. Mr. Whelan, detained in Russia since 2018, was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years. Russia made an unspecified “bad faith” counteroffer, the White House said on Monday, which U.S. officials said they did not consider serious. John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters on Thursday, “I don’t think it would be helpful to Brittney or to Paul for us to talk more publicly about where we are in the talks and what the president might or might not be willing to do.” “Conversations are ongoing at various levels,” he added. If Mr. Biden sticks to his initial offer, he could face accusations of not doing enough. Ms. Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, and other supporters have mounted an intense public campaign to pressure the president to win her release. Supporters worry about her treatment in a country where anti-American and anti-gay vitriol are deeply embedded in popular views and official propaganda. Images of a grim-faced Ms. Griner being led, handcuffed, in and out of court, towering over her armed guards, have become commonplace in U.S. and international media. The administration could make a more attractive offer, but U.S. officials already worry that deals for prisoners could encourage hostile foreign governments to detain Americans on trumped-up charges in exchange for concessions like freeing their own wrongdoers. Some Republicans have already complained that Mr. Biden’s existing offer creates such an incentive. A 6-foot-9 center, Ms. Griner won a college national championship with Baylor in 2012, a W.N.B.A. championship with the Mercury in 2014, Olympic gold medals with the U.S. team at the 2016 and 2020 games, and four EuroLeague championships with the Russian team UMMC Yekaterinburg. Like many players in the W.N.B.A., where salaries are much lower than in the N.B.A., Ms. Griner — who also played one season for a professional team in China — has played overseas to supplement her income.

2022-08-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/world/europe/russia-penal-colony-brittney-griner.html,Griner Is Supposed to Be Sent to a Russian Penal Colony. What Is That?,"Some prisoners are tortured, or beaten by fellow inmates. Some have to work 16-hour days. A few are forced to watch Russian propaganda on repeat. This is the world of the Russian penal colony, into which Brittney Griner is about to be inducted for a nine-year term. Penal colonies are the descendants of gulags, the notorious Stalin-era labor camps where millions of Russians lost their lives. The treatment of prisoners has improved markedly since then, according to rights groups. Ms. Griner’s lawyers said on Tuesday that it could be “up to a few months” before she is transferred from the detention center where she has been held since being arrested in February on suspicion of drug smuggling. But the penal colonies, many of them scattered across Siberia as gulags were and laid out in barracks, are still characterized by brutality, overcrowding and harsh conditions, and they are often governed by a rigid prison culture. In an interview from a penal colony last year, Russia’s most famous prisoner, the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, described a schedule of calisthenics, sweeping the yard and games of chess or backgammon, as well as five daily sessions of screen time where inmates are forced to watch state television and propaganda films. “You need to imagine something like a Chinese labor camp, where everybody marches in a line and where video cameras are hung everywhere,” he said. “There is constant control and a culture of snitching.” In June, Mr. Navalny was transferred to a maximum-security prison, where he said he spends seven-hour shifts at a sewing machine. In 2012, a member of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot said that there was no hot water, warm clothes or medicine in the penal colony where she and a bandmate were imprisoned, and that people who got sick could die as a result. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said in 2010 that “The Gulag Archipelago,” Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s indictment of the Soviet penal system, should be essential reading for Russian students. During her detention so far, Ms. Griner’s reading material has reportedly been books by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, a Russian writer whose work was marked by his harrowing experiences in the country’s penal system, after he was sentenced to four years’ hard labor in Siberia. Dostoyevsky once wrote: “The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.”",7
2022-08-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/world/europe/putin-erdogan-meeting.html,Vladimir Putin and Tayyip Erdogan Meet in Sochi,"President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held marathon talks on a range of complementary and clashing interests on Friday, pledging to strengthen economic ties at a time when Turkey is emerging as a main trade bridge for Moscow to the rest of the world. In a joint communiqué issued after four hours of talks in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, the leaders stressed the importance of grain exports through the Black Sea. Turkey proved instrumental in mediating a recent, hard-won deal enabling Ukraine to resume its grain exports this week for the first time since Russia invaded in late February. The deal was accompanied by Western assurances that Russia’s agricultural exports were not subject to sanctions. The monthslong absence of Ukrainian grain on world markets sent prices soaring and threatened to spread famine in Africa and the Middle East. The two also agreed to continue cooperating on energy, which Russia supplies in volume to Turkey. Mr. Putin praised the TurkStream pipeline as a main conduit for Russian gas that is still flowing to Europe. Russian officials said that Turkey had also agreed to settle some of its substantial annual energy bill in rubles — something many Western countries have refused to do because it would blunt their stiff sanctions, some of which are aimed at weakening Russia’s currency. Russia, constantly probing for ways to evade those sanctions, sees cooperation with Turkey as a key to easing its economic and political isolation. The talks, coming less than three weeks after the leaders met in Iran, solidified Turkey’s role as an important mediator between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Russia and NATO, of which Turkey is a member. But it did not resolve some of the friction points between them, including security in the Middle East, or the possibility of Mr. Putin using relations with Turkey to try to find or create chinks in Western unity against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Erdogan is treading a fine line to retain the ability to talk to both Russia, NATO’s foe, and to Western members of the alliance. Turkey has held to its refusal to join Western sanctions against Russia, irking its NATO allies, but Mr. Erdogan also, in a crucial move, eased his initial objections to Sweden’s and Finland’s joining the alliance as a bulwark against Russian aggression. In helping Russia to export gas and grain, analysts said, Turkey is providing a useful outlet for goods that Western capitals want to see traded. And the trade with Russia is helping address Turkey’s own substantial economic woes. However, Ankara has shied away from providing the Kremlin so much help that it provokes Western capitals. For his part, Mr. Putin’s meetings with Turkey is telling the West “that he intends to keep up with the economic relations that provide a breathing channel to Russia vis-à-vis the sanctions,” said Ahmet Kasım Han, a professor of international relations and economy at Istanbul Aydin University in Turkey. Mr. Putin has tried to exploit differences between Turkey and its NATO allies in years past, by selling Turkey advanced anti-aircraft systems. “Putin is still working from the same playbook,” said Mr. Han. “He is trying to keep Turkey a little apart from its Western partners.” The joint communiqué said the two sides had agreed on working together in Syria and Libya, conflict areas where they have backed opposing sides. However, it did not specify how, and there was no indication that Mr. Putin, who has backed the Syrian government through its long civil war, had given a green light for Mr. Erdogan to attack Kurdish groups that Turkey considers terrorists, based just across its southern border with Syria. Although Dmitri S.

2022-08-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/us/politics/brittney-griner-russia-biden.html,Brittney Griner’s Sentence Renews Pressure on President Biden,"WASHINGTON — Immediately after a Moscow judge handed down Brittney Griner’s nine-year prison sentence on Thursday, calls grew louder for President Biden to find a way to bring her home. “We call on President Biden and the United States government to redouble their efforts to do whatever is necessary and possible,” the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement. U.S. officials and analysts had been resigned to a guilty verdict for Ms. Griner, a basketball star who plays for a Russian team during the W.N.B.A. off-season. But the cold reality of her sentence on a drug charge was a shock and renewed calls for Mr. Biden to secure her release — even as critics fumed that offering to swap prisoners with Moscow rewards Russian hostage-taking. The result is a painful quandary for the Biden administration as it tries to maintain a hard line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over his war in Ukraine. “There’s nothing good here,” said Andrea Schneider, an expert on international conflict resolution at Cardozo School of Law. “No matter what Biden does, he’s going to be criticized — either that we’re giving too much or we’re not working hard enough.” Kremlin officials had said that any potential deal could not proceed before her trial was complete, creating a glimmer of hope that the verdict might open the door for an exchange. But analysts called that unlikely anytime soon. “I don’t think this is going to get resolved quickly,” said Jared Genser, a human rights lawyer who represents Americans held by foreign governments. “I think the fact that Putin has not said yes right away means that he’s looked at the U.S. offer and said, ‘Well, that’s their first offer. I can get more than that.’” That U.S. offer, first presented to Russia in June, sought the release of Ms. Griner and Paul N. Whelan, a former Marine arrested in Moscow and convicted of espionage in 2020. The Biden administration proposed to trade the two Americans for the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who is midway through a 25-year federal prison sentence for offering to sell arms to a Colombian rebel group that the United States then considered a terrorist organization. The proposal has already reshaped U.S. diplomacy toward Russia, which had been frozen at senior levels since Mr. Putin’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. A phone call about the matter on July 29 between Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, was their first conversation since the war began. But it appeared to leave the Kremlin unmoved. The White House says Russia has made an unspecified “bad faith” counteroffer that the United States is not taking seriously. On Friday, Mr. Lavrov told reporters that the two nations would continue discussing the issue through established channels. He repeated the Kremlin’s insistence that the United States not discuss the negotiations in public, though Russian media outlets began linking Mr. Bout’s case to Ms. Griner’s early this summer. But the pressure is lopsided. While Mr. Putin has long sought Mr. Bout’s release, perhaps out of loyalty to a man with deep ties to Russia’s security state, the arms dealer’s continued imprisonment costs Mr. Putin little. Time, in other words, is in Mr. Putin’s favor. Mr. Biden, on the other hand, finds himself squeezed from two sides. On one side are Ms. Griner’s supporters. Her wife, Cherelle Griner, has made public pleas for Mr. Biden to cut a deal with Mr. Putin as soon as possible. Those pleas have been echoed by Mr. Sharpton, Democratic activist groups, television pundits, pro athletes and celebrities on social media. (Mr. Sharpton on Thursday also called for the release of Mr. Whelan.) “How could she feel like America has her back?” the N.B.A. superstar LeBron James said in mid-July. “I would be feeling like, ‘Do I even want to go back to America?’” That was before Mr. Biden’s proposal to free Mr. Bout became public. Officials said they disclosed the offer, which was confirmed last week by a person briefed on the talks, to increase pressure on Russia. But the revelation may have also reflected a desire to show Ms. Griner’s backers that Mr. Biden was not sitting on his hands. “We believe it’s important for the American people to know how hard President Biden is working to get Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan home,” John F. Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, said at the time. “We think it’s important for their families to know how hard we’re working on this.” After Ms. Griner was sentenced on Thursday, Mr. Biden renewed his commitment to “pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible.” The White House would not say how Mr. Biden might achieve that goal, however. “I don’t think it would be helpful to Brittney or to Paul for us to talk more publicly about where we are in the talks and what the president might or might not be willing to do,” Mr. Kirby said. But almost any additional offers would be sure to amplify criticism from Mr. Biden’s other flank — and charges that Mr. Biden was bending to extortion by Mr. Putin, a man he has called a war criminal. “This is why dictatorships — like Venezuela, Iran, China, Russia — take Americans hostage, because they know they’ll get something for it,” Rep. Mike Waltz, Republican of Florida, told Newsmax last week. “They know eventually some administration will pay. And this just puts a target on the back of every American out there.” Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state, echoed the criticism in a Fox News interview last week, saying that to free Mr. Bout would “likely lead to more” Americans being arrested abroad. And former President Donald J. Trump, who when in office prided himself on freeing detained Americans abroad, slammed the proposed deal in crude terms. Mr. Bout, he said, was “absolutely one of the worst in the world, and he’s going to be given his freedom because a potentially spoiled person goes into Russia loaded up with drugs.” (Russian officials who detained Ms. Griner at a Moscow-area airport in mid-February found less than one gram of cannabis vape oil in her bags.) Mr. Genser, the lawyer for other detained Americans, noted that Mr. Biden has an option beyond raising his offer. He could seek new ways to make Mr. Putin suffer. “You need to dramatically elevate the cost to Vladimir Putin of keeping them detained,” Mr. Genser said. “It’s not only about giving Putin what he wants. It’s about simultaneously raising the pain for him.” That is no easy task, however. Biden administration officials have spent months trying to devise ways to incur enough pain on Mr. Putin to make him cease his invasion of Ukraine. Like the freedom of Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan, that goal, too, remains elusive.",7
2022-08-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/08/world/africa/us-policy-africa-blinken.html,U.S. Promotes Democracy in Africa as Rival Nations Expand Influence,"PRETORIA, South Africa — The United States has been grappling with the growing influence of China, Russia and Middle Eastern nations across Africa, a situation made more acute in recent months by the competition to win partners in the war in Ukraine. On Monday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken unveiled the Biden administration’s main approach to addressing that challenge and other strategic goals in Africa: promoting democratic governance across the continent. “History shows that strong democracies tend to be more stable and less prone to conflict — and that the poor governance, exclusion and corruption inherent in weak democracies makes them more vulnerable to extremist movements and foreign interference,” Mr. Blinken said in a speech at the University of Pretoria, on the first stop of a tour of Africa that will also take him to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. It is unclear how his message will be received at a time when some African countries are turning away from democracy and settling into authoritarian rule — sometimes by military officers who carried out coups. The United States could risk alienating those African leaders who prefer the authoritarian model or see Washington’s governance push as imperial power projection. Some might call it hypocritical, citing the recent erosion of democratic practices in the United States. “If your tactic is to approach African countries and say, ‘Listen, you must be democratic and use our model, it works,’ I think it’s bound to lead to some failure,” said Naledi Pandor, the foreign minister of South Africa, who met with Mr. Blinken on Monday. “I do agree with Tony that all countries and peoples deserve the right to exercise their civil and political rights,” she added. “But I think given history, the approach has to be somewhat different, and I would recommend a greater attention to tools that Africans have developed.” Mr. Blinken and top diplomats from China and Russia have made multiple trips across Africa and Asia in the past year. Russia has a decades-long history of partnership with African nations and organizations, and Russian officials are counting on the many African nations that have stayed neutral on Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine — or even supported Russia — to maintain their stance. And Russia has told African leaders that the American-led sanctions on it exacerbate the global food shortage that harms the continent. Mr. Blinken is trying to counter the Kremlin’s message on this trip. China, which Mr. Blinken says is the greatest challenger to American power, has established an enormous presence in Africa, with state-owned enterprises building infrastructure across the continent, the Chinese military bolstering a base in Djibouti and the Communist Party opening a pan-Africa leadership school in Tanzania. But there has been a backlash among some Africans to labor and loan practices by Chinese companies. Middle Eastern nations are also playing a growing role across Africa: Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are influential in the Horn of Africa, and Turkey has its biggest embassy in the world in Somalia, where it also runs the main port and airport. Mr. Blinken insisted at a news conference before his speech that the administration’s Africa strategy was not centered on rivalry with China and Russia. But a White House document released the same day said the effort to strengthen “open societies” was partly intended to “counter harmful activities” by China, Russia and “other foreign actors.” Mr. Blinken said in his speech that the U.S. strategy “reflects the region’s complexity, its diversity, its agency,” and “focuses on what we will do with African nations and peoples, not for African nations and peoples.” He also said pandemic recovery, health security, climate adaptation and environmental conservation were pillars of the Africa strategy — consistent with what President Biden has named as his global priorities. The Biden administration has made democracy promotion a focus of its foreign policy, a throwback to Democratic and Republican administrations before that of President Donald J. Trump, who shunned the goal. However, contrary to the post-September-11 approach to democracy-building, which took place under a heavy American military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Biden administration seeks to de-emphasize the use of hard power in Africa. Mr. Blinken said the administration would carry out governance stability programs with local partners “in places where conditions are ripe for conflict” — projects enabled by the Global Fragility Act of 2019 that gives $200 million annually in congressional-approved funds for a decade. The strategy document says the United States aims to “stem the recent tide of authoritarianism and military takeovers” in part “through a targeted mix of positive inducements and punitive measures such as sanctions.” Bob Wekesa, deputy director of the African Center for the Study of the United States at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said, “The new strategy is to move away from that preaching and proselytizing approach of the past, but at the same time, it doesn’t go very far away from it.” Mr. Blinken and the National Security Council chose to announce the new strategy in South Africa because it is the continent’s largest democracy and an important U.S. trade partner. But American diplomacy here has run into obstacles. U.S. officials have had difficulty persuading South African counterparts to abandon a neutral position on the Ukraine war. South Africa was among 17 African nations that abstained from voting in March on a U.N. General Assembly resolution condemning Russia, in contrast to 28 African countries that approved the resolution. Mr. Blinken sought to highlight Russia’s brutality on Monday, asserting the economic devastation caused by the pandemic was “deepened by Russia’s unprovoked war on Ukraine.” He cited World Bank estimates saying the invasion could add 40 million people — mostly in Africa — to the ranks of the 193 million people worldwide who need humanitarian food assistance. Ms. Pandor, meanwhile, criticized the Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa Act passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in May, which would in part identify Africans working with Russians sanctioned by the United States. Gustavo de Carvalho, a senior researcher on Russia-Africa relations at the South African Institute of International Affairs, said African countries do not simply pick sides between the West and China or Russia, but are driven by self-interest. “In some instances, it’s slightly more pragmatic,” he said. As Africa’s most advanced economy, South Africa has nurtured trade ties with the United States and Europe. Although China is its largest trading partner, South Africa has a trade surplus with the United States. Their trade amounted to $21 billion last year. Many South African citizens have called for Cyril Ramaphosa, the president, to condemn Russia, but he has avoided doing so. He traveled in June to a multinational summit in Beijing before flying to a Group of 7 meeting in the Bavarian Alps. In China, Mr. Ramaphosa agreed to a declaration calling for talks between Kyiv and Moscow, along with impartial humanitarian assistance. In Germany, South Africa’s main summit statement dodged the Ukraine issue, and instead focused on climate change and energy policy. On Monday, Ms. Pandor took a similarly distanced position on tensions between the United States and China, saying getting involved would be destructive for African nations and other countries. “These are two great powers, the two biggest economies in the world,” she said. “They’ve got to find a way of working together to allow us to grow.” Edward Wong reported from Pretoria, South Africa, and Lynsey Chutel reported from Johannesburg.

Aren’t Kentucky’s Republican senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, concerned about the flooding from increased storms caused by climate change ravaging their state and killing Kentuckians? Aren’t Texas’ Republican senators, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, concerned about the stronger hurricanes and heat waves killing Texans? Aren’t any Republicans concerned about the high cost of drugs for seniors, or the inequity in our tax codes or extending health care to the most vulnerable in their state? The time for Republicans merely standing aside and doing nothing but taking shots at President Biden and Democrats should be over. The time for their trying to tear down the country with their election denial lies should be over. Come on, Republicans, pitch in and help save this country.

How is the climate bill a political win for Democrats when, in order to help the environment, they bargain away the environment? How is it a win when the man who has been the main impediment to President Biden’s agenda is given a huge concession that allows him to keep getting his dirty money, thereby becoming further entrenched in his ability to frustrate Democratic priorities? This may be “just politics,” but it is not winning politics. It is the type of appeasement politics that Democrats have been engaged in, and losing at, for 40 years. American voters can distinguish between commitment to core Democratic principles and self-protective political expediency. The Democrats’ go-to strategy of accepting whatever crumbs the Republicans — and now Joe Manchin — are willing to leave them will not be sufficient to arouse voter support in the midterms. At this point, the Democrats’ only hope to avoid a complete November disaster is that the fear and anger aroused by the Republican insurgency will overcome voter apathy engendered by the lack of leadership that President Biden and Senate Democratic leaders continue to show on virtually every issue that matters. Russ SkibaBloomington, Ind. To the Editor: Re “How the New Climate Bill Would Reduce Emissions” (interactive, nytimes.com, Aug. 2): You report that analyses have concluded that the climate and energy package “would put the United States much closer to its goal of cutting global warming pollution in half by 2030.” It is encouraging to read that calculations from environmental experts judge that despite the provisions for fossil fuels, the bill will be net positive for carbon. This means that the United States is taking a step in the right direction in practical terms, but also in terms of symbolism. Indeed, the U.S. could see itself reinstated as a leading environmentally conscious nation. There are now two possible scenarios. The bill may set a precedent for more ambitious bills in the future and a greater understanding of sustainable growth and development. On the other hand, it might become an example of diminished ambition: too much deal making behind closed doors, and watered down commitments.

A new axis of evil is indeed in play, and its success depends on our willingness to mince words. These governments have spent decades encroaching on Western interests without firing a shot. For their weapons Moscow chose energy, Beijing chose critical supply chains and Tehran lured the West into a farcical attempt at nuclear diplomacy. This entanglement is no less dangerous than a bomb specifically because so many proclaimed “experts” have waved it off as the natural result of global competition. Vladimir Putin and the rest may have finally embraced the trappings of diplomacy, but their rival interests have meshed far too cleanly for us to accept the coincidence. The “coordinated campaign of aggression” began long ago (indeed, my references to this new axis of evil stretch back to 2018) and reflects not only shared interests, but also a willingness to align from afar.

2022-08-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/world/middleeast/russia-iran-launch-satellite.html,"Russia Launches Iranian Satellite, a Sign of Closer Cooperation","A Russian rocket on Tuesday launched into orbit an Iranian surveillance satellite that Western analysts say will improve Iran’s intelligence gathering, in a tangible sign of the expanding cooperation between two countries faced with crippling Western economic sanctions. Russia has been seeking closer alliances, including with Iran, since its invasion of Ukraine left it isolated by many Western countries. Iran said this week that the satellite launch is part of a four-year space cooperation agreement between the two countries. “The successful launch of the satellite in the interests and on the order of Iran has become an important milestone in Russian-Iranian bilateral cooperation, opening the way to the implementation of new and even larger projects,” Yury Borisov, the director general of Roscosmos, the Russian state-run space agency, said in a statement. The Iranian space agency said the “Khayyam” satellite is fitted with a high-resolution camera. U.S. officials and some independent experts said it would dramatically improve Tehran’s ability to monitor sites, including potential military targets, in Israel and the wider Middle East. Tal Inbar, a senior research fellow at the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, an American nonpartisan organization, said the satellite would be capable of providing far better images of the ground from space, representing a significant challenge for Israel, Iran’s longtime adversary. “Israel has long had such an observation capability, but as far as Iran is concerned, this is a real breakthrough — for the first time an Iranian owns and operates a satellite with a high imaging resolution, much better than what they had until now,” Mr. Inbar said. “From now on, Iran will be able to collect much more accurate intelligence information for military operations of their forces as well as for the organizations they support.” It will also be able to serve real-time operations by Iran or the militias it supports, he said. “This is a significant narrowing of the technological gap between Iran, and Israel and the United States,” Mr. Inbar said. The Iranian space agency insisted that the satellite would not be used for military purposes, saying in a statement on Aug. 7 that it was intended for agricultural programs, water resources and other environmental applications. But analysts affiliated with Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards force posted messages on social media boasting that the satellite gives Iran the ability to monitor American military bases and Israel from space. “A country’s path to developing native satellites cannot be stopped or denied,” the Iranian space agency said in a statement. “The same is true for international cooperation. This will turn Iran’s space industry into one that exports,” it added. A Soyuz rocket carrying the “Khayyam” satellite into orbit lifted off from the Russian-run Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan just before 9 a.m. Iranian scientists took control of the satellite immediately after the launch, the agency said, and no other nation would have access to the information it gathered. According to Russian news reports last week, Roscosmos said that Russian companies built the satellite for Iran. The Russian embassy in Tehran said in a post on its Instagram account that the satellite was ordered by Iran and built by Russia and that it was designed for nonmilitary purposes. Iran relied on Russian expertise because until now, it had only launched satellites that weighed less than 50 kilograms, about 110 pounds, and Khayyam weighs nearly half a ton, according to Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards. “Today is a turning point for the start of a new interaction in the field of space between our two countries,” Isa Zarepour, the Iranian minister for communications and information technology, said in a statement. Although negotiations over the launch preceded Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it comes less than a month after President Vladimir V. Putin visited Tehran in his quest to show that Western sanctions imposed over the war had failed to isolate his country. Iran has long experience with evading Western sanctions, and the U.S. says Tehran has offered to sell Russia drones for use in Ukraine and other equipment using technology that Western nations are no longer selling to Moscow. Iranfirst launched its own domestically produced satellite into orbit in 2009, and its still-young space program has had a shaky history. In the decade after its first launch, some 67 percent of Iranian orbital launches failed, compared to a 5 percent failure rate worldwide for similar space launches. The satellite launched Tuesday was named after Omar Khayyam, the renowned medieval Persian scientist and poet. The Baikonur facility has been used for space launches for decades, and was inaugurated when Kazakhstan was part of the Soviet Union. Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.",8
2022-08-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/19/world/europe/dmitri-vrubel-dead.html,"Dmitri Vrubel, Who Planted a Kiss on the Berlin Wall, Dies at 62","BERLIN — Dmitri Vrubel, a Russian artist-provocateur best known for a startling mural on the Berlin Wall depicting the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev laying a fat kiss on the mouth of the East German leader Erich Honecker, died on Saturday in Berlin. He was 62. His wife and longtime artistic partner, Victoria Timofeeva, said the cause was heart failure related to a Covid-19 infection. In 1990, the year Germany reunified, Mr. Vrubel was one of 117 artists from 21 countries to descend on a surviving stretch of the Berlin Wall, which had fallen the previous year. With paint and a ladder, he recreated a larger-than-life version of a 1979 photo of a kiss between Mr. Brezhnev and Mr. Honecker. Below it he wrote a caption in Russian and German: “My Lord, give me the strength to survive this deadly love.” By that time Communism was falling around the globe, and the Soviet Union was not long for this world. Mr. Honecker was out of a job, and Mr. Brezhnev was dead. But the mural took on a life of its own as a subversive commentary on the dissolute ways of a dying system. “More than any other work of art, it symbolizes the peaceful triumph over the seedy empire of antiquated Communist leaders,” the German newspaper Spiegel wrote in 2009. The Berlin daily Tagesspiegel called it “a symbol of peace, love and transgression of all kinds.” The image became an emblem of the freewheeling, graffitied, artistic Berlin of the 1990s. More than three decades on, it remains one of the most photographed murals in Berlin and is replicated on countless T-shirts, mugs and postcards. Mr. Vrubel said he copied the image from a picture he saw in the French magazine Paris Match. The photograph was taken by the French photojournalist Régis Bossu in 1979 in East Berlin, just a few miles from where it would later become famous, on the occasion of East Germany’s 30th anniversary. Although the sight of two elderly heads of state engaging in a sloppy kiss on the mouth was shocking to many modern Western viewers, many of whom assumed the image was purely the creation of the artist’s imagination, the gesture was a certain tradition among Communist leaders, who used it to symbolize their solidarity. Friends thought Mr. Vrubel was crazy for wanting to paint on the Berlin Wall, a relic of a bygone era, he recounted in a 2013 interview with the government-funded Goethe Institute. But he knew he was onto something. “I had no doubts about it,” he said. “It was just very fun.” Indeed, the painting’s satirical simplicity and power to shock were so resonant that it has often been copied, with other leaders subbing in for Mr. Brezhnev and Mr. Honecker. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the mural was temporarily covered by a canvas painting depicting Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor-turned-Russian energy lobbyist, embracing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Dmitri Vrubel was born in Moscow on July 14, 1960, the only child of two engineers. He started painting at 15 and studied at the graphic art department of the Moscow State V.I. Lenin Pedagogical Institute. He married at 18 and had three children with his first wife before divorcing and marrying Ms. Timofeeva, with whom he had a son. In addition to her, he is survived by three sons, Mikhail, Alexandr and Artemy; a daughter, Natalia; and four grandchildren. After painting his Berlin mural, Mr. Vrubel returned to Moscow in 1990 and found some success there in 2001 with a limited-edition calendar capturing 12 moods of Mr. Putin. In 2009, long after his mural had become a must-see stop on any Berlin itinerary, he returned to Berlin to repaint it. The East Side Gallery artist collective, which manages the mural-filled stretch of wall, had the surface cleaned and asked artists to repaint their famous works with more durable paint. Mr. Vrubel initially balked when he learned that the artists were being paid only 3,000 euros, or roughly $3,000, for their efforts, but he finally accepted the fee and repainted his famous image anyway. That was his only financial remuneration for the work. Because it was public art, he did not have the copyright to his image and never made a cent off the merchandise, Ms. Timofeeva said. Mr. Vrubel believed that the second version was an improvement. “In two decades I have become a better painter,” he told Spiegel in 2009. Settling in Berlin in 2010, he became a fixture of the Russian expatriate community. In a small exhibition space in the tony Prenzlauer Berg district, he and Ms. Timofeeva created an open studio where people could watch them create art and interact with them. Among his other works in Berlin was the Evangelical Project, a series of paintings focused on the faces of both famous and ordinary people. “He took boring pictures from newspapers that no one would ever look at and made art out of it,” Ms. Timofeeva said. “That was his method.” Recently he worked in the medium of virtual reality, creating exhibition spaces that could be viewed through virtual reality goggles. It gave him what he long craved, said Ms. Timofeeva: a canvas of unlimited size. Mr. Vrubel also painted a second, lesser known mural, “Thank you, Andrei Sakharov,” on the Berlin Wall in 1990 in honor of the nuclear physicist who developed thermonuclear weapons before becoming a dissident and human rights activist. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Vrubel became an outspoken critic of the war. “Because of this whole situation since February, he was on fire before my eyes,” said Ms. Timofeeva, who was born in Odessa, Ukraine. “He was so furious, so sad, so ashamed.” But he will be forever known for one work, which had come to him in an instant. “When I first saw the Berlin Wall, I knew exactly what I wanted to paint: Brezhnev and Honecker,” he said in the 2013 interview. “A picture for Berlin,” he added, “for the Germans.” Milana Mazaeva contributed reporting from Washington.",29
2022-08-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/world/europe/ukraine-artillery-shells.html,Ukrainians Are Paying to Paint Personal Messages on Artillery Shells,"Artem Poliukhovych, a 32-year-old Ukrainian, had been thinking for a year about how to propose to his girlfriend. He considered kneeling on a beach on a tropical island or asking her to marry him on a hot-air balloon ride. In the end, he decided to have the proposal written on a Soviet-era shell targeting the Russian military. “It can be considered in some way an aggressive proposal,” he said. She said “yes.” Her enthusiasm is matched by other people around the world. Several hundred have paid thousands of dollars to have their words written on shells used by the Ukrainian Army. War is often pervaded with gallows humor, and soldiers have long scrawled graffiti on munitions meant for the enemy. Selling such messages marks an inventive, if macabre, twist on the practice, another way Ukrainians have found to raise money for their underdog resistance to Russia’s invasion. One shell bore the tag “This one’s a gay bomb.” Another read, “Fighting fascism is a full-time job.” And another was signed: “From Silicon Valley with love.” These latest tags were ordered from Signmyrocket.com, the most prominent of several fund-raising initiatives in Ukraine’s burgeoning personalized shells sector. The fund-raiser, which calls itself “artillery mailing,” was created by Anton Sokolenko, a 21-year-old information technology student, to compensate for a drop in donations to the Center for Assistance to the Army, Veterans and Their Families, the charity for which he had started volunteering in March. He initially ran it on a Telegram channel, and then moved to a website to allow international costumers to gain access to it. Now, he said, requests come from all over the world, with more than 95 percent of the writing in English. The website says it has raised more than $200,000 dollars in donations in less than three months for the charity. Buyers get pictures of their message on a shell. For a higher price, the charity also provides videos as the shell is launched — “to show their friends or post on social media,” Mr. Sokolenko said. On the site, users can pick a weapon, type in a message and then proceed to check out. Prices range from $150 for a message on a Howitzer shell to $3,000 for one written on the side of a tank’s turret. The site says the charity has delivered more than 200 permanent markers to soldiers, who offered to write on the weapons and photograph the result in return for cars, drones or optical equipment that the charity has purchased across Europe with the profits. Mr. Sokolenko said that the charity had many contacts in the military, and that he had reached soldiers through word of mouth. A spokeswoman for Ukraine’s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. For some people, buying a message is a way to help the Ukrainian Army and to feel directly involved in the war effort. For others, it is a chance to express their anger at Russia. Mr. Sokolenko described the process as an informal way for military platoons to support themselves. “It’s not very official, and not very allowed,” Mr. Sokolenko said. “But they kind of need to do it because we can give them stuff that our government cannot give them right now.” Cristina Repetti, 32, who lives in Chicago, said that she was shocked by the aggression of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and that she had commissioned several messages on shells for friends and family members. She expressed some discomfort with the idea that the weapons could be used to kill soldiers who might be at war against their will, but her desire to help Ukraine was bigger. “I can’t just sit there and do nothing.” On one shell, she commissioned the message “I love you Vinny,” in the hopes of getting her boyfriend back. “He is into dark romantic things,” she said. “And I thought that putting our love on a shell that is going to hit a Russian tank would really make an impression.”",29
2022-08-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/opinion/russia-china-trade-surpluses.html,Opinion | Of Dictators and Trade Surpluses,"According to a new NBC News poll, U.S. voters now consider “threats to democracy” the most important issue facing the nation, which is both disturbing and a welcome sign that people are paying attention. It’s also worth noting that this isn’t just an American issue. Democracy is eroding worldwide; according to the latest survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit, there are now 59 fully authoritarian regimes out there, home to 37 percent of the world’s population. Of these 59 regimes, however, only two — China and Russia — are powerful enough to pose major challenges to the international order. The two nations are, of course, very different. China is a bona fide superpower, whose economy has by some measures overtaken the United States’. Russia is a third-rate power in economic terms, and events since Feb. 24 suggest that its military was and is weaker than most observers imagined. It does, however, have nukes. One thing China and Russia have in common, however, is that both are currently running very large trade surpluses. Are these surpluses signs of strength? Are they evidence that autocracy works? No, in both cases the surpluses are signs of weakness. And the current situation offers a useful corrective to the common notion — favored, among others, by Donald Trump — that a country that sells more than it buys is somehow a “winner.” Start with Russia, whose trade surplus has ballooned since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. What’s that about? The answer is that it’s largely a result of Western economic sanctions, which have been surprisingly effective — albeit not in the way many expected. When the invasion began, there were widespread calls for an embargo on Russian exports of oil and gas. In reality, however, Russia has had little trouble maintaining its oil exports; it is selling crude at a discount, but high global prices mean that plenty of money is still coming in. And while there has been a sharp fall in Russian gas exports to Europe, this reflects the Putin regime’s efforts to put pressure on the West rather than the other way around. What sanctions have done, instead, is undermine Russia’s ability to import, especially its ability to buy crucial industrial inputs. One example of the problem: Reports indicate that Russian airlines are grounding some of their planes to cannibalize them for spare parts they can no longer buy abroad. So Russia’s trade surplus is actually bad news for Putin, a sign that his country is having trouble using its cash to purchase goods it needs to maintain its war effort. China’s problem is different: Its trade surplus is a result of long-running internal problems that may, finally, be coming to a head. Outside observers have long noticed that too little of China’s national income filters down to the public, so that consumer spending has remained weak despite rapid economic growth. Instead, the nation has maintained more or less full employment by channeling cheap credit into increasingly unproductive investment spending, above all a bloated housing market supported by ever-growing private debt. China has managed to keep this ultimately unsustainable game running for a remarkably long time. At this point, however, China’s housing market appears to be crashing and consumer demand appears to be plunging. This is dragging down the country’s imports — which makes its trade surplus bigger. Again, a surplus can be a sign of weakness, not strength. Two more points about China. First, its economy is also suffering from the government’s refusal to revisit a failing Covid strategy, relying on relatively ineffective domestic vaccines and a disruptive policy of draconian lockdowns to contain the pandemic. Second, under current conditions, weak Chinese demand is, unintentionally, a boon to the rest of the world. A dozen years ago the world economy was suffering from inadequate demand, and Chinese trade surpluses made the problem worse by sucking purchasing power away from the rest of the world. Today, however, the world economy is suffering from inadequate supply, which has led to high inflation in many countries. In this context Chinese weakness is actually good for the rest of us: Falling Chinese demand is putting a lid on the prices of oil and other commodities, reducing global inflationary pressure. So what can we learn from dictators and their trade surpluses? As I said, we’re getting a demonstration that exporting more than you’re importing doesn’t mean that you’re winning: In different ways both Russia’s and China’s trade surpluses represent failure rather than success. And at a broader level, we’re seeing the trouble with dictatorships, where nobody can tell the leader when he’s wrong. Putin seems to have invaded Ukraine in part because everyone was too afraid to warn him about the limits of Russian military power; China’s Covid response has gone from role model to cautionary tale, probably because nobody dares tell Xi Jinping that his signature policies aren’t working. So autocracy may be on the march — but not because it works better than democracy. It doesn’t. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-08-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/opinion/russia-science-ukraine-war.html,Opinion | What the Loss of Russian Cooperation Means For Science,"ORCAS ISLAND, Wash. — One of the many unfortunate consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the collateral damage to international scientific cooperation. The past two decades may have been the apex of this cooperation. Now it appears to be coming to at least a pause, if not an end. In the years immediately after the Cold War ended in 1991, Russian scientists turned increasingly to Europe and the United States to remain involved in frontier research. Through the efforts of Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Space Station Freedom became the International Space Station, which included major contributions from Canada, Japan, European nations and Russia as partners. From 1993 to 1996, the Russian agency responsible for atomic energy signed agreements with the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, known as CERN, and contributed money, equipment and brainpower to the Large Hadron Collider project. That project led to the discovery in 2012 of the Higgs boson, a heavy subatomic particle that imbues other elementary particles with mass. Its existence was predicted a half-century earlier. And during the 1990s, Russian scientists from Lomonosov Moscow State University joined the international LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which in 2016 announced striking evidence of mergers of ultramassive black holes. The discovery confirmed the prediction in Einstein’s general theory of relativity that cataclysmic events like the merger of two black holes — in this case, about 1.3 billion light years away — create ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves. But Russia recently decided to terminate its participation in the space station after 2024, and CERN will no longer allow Russian institutes to participate in collider experiments after its contracts with Russia expire that year. What’s more, the European Space Agency has excluded Russia from its planned ExoMars rover project, despite the yearslong delays that will likely result. And notwithstanding Russia’s efforts in support of the X-ray laser project known as European XFEL in Germany, which has opened opportunities for research in materials science, biology and physics, scientists and institutions based in Russia cannot (at least for now) perform new experiments at this facility. Scientific research has advanced to such an extent since the end of the Cold War that such large, expensive international projects are the only way to push back the frontiers in many disciplines. Individual nations no longer have sufficient financial and intellectual resources to pursue the science unilaterally. The current retreat from Russian involvement in these big projects can in this way easily curtail scientific progress — as well as impair international relations more broadly. CERN was established in a suburb of Geneva in the early 1950s to promote peaceful cooperation among European nations, which experienced two disastrous wars during the previous 40 years. Organizers viewed nuclear and high-energy physics as promising disciplines that invited cooperation. And it succeeded. With the discovery in the early 1980s of the W and Z bosons, which together are responsible for one of the four fundamental forces that govern the behavior of matter in the universe, CERN established itself as the world’s premier laboratory for high-energy physics. To many European leaders, it had become the highest expression of continental unity — reason enough to approve its multibillion-euro L.H.C. project in the 1990s. After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, the funding of many of its institutes for scientific research collapsed. CERN became the principal venue where Russian high-energy physicists could continue doing cutting-edge research. And CERN had begun to seek additional L.H.C. funding from well beyond its European member nations. Physicists from Russia’s Joint Institute for Nuclear Research joined the gargantuan Compact Muon Solenoid experiment on this collider, contributing to its design and making sophisticated contributions. They could take due credit for their part in the breakthrough Higgs boson discovery — perhaps the pinnacle of international scientific achievement. Russia became an important player in a world laboratory knit together by the internet and Web, which now includes Canada, China, India, Japan, the United States and many other non-European nations. Part of the rationale for establishing CERN was to promote international understanding among researchers working toward common scientific goals. It has proved a wonderful polyglot place. Although English and French dominate conversations in labs, offices and the cafeteria, national differences seem to melt away amid vigorous technical exchanges and good food. But this scientific camaraderie begins to dissolve when one of the participant nations savagely attacks another. During the first month of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, thousands of Russian scientists signed a petition opposing the attack, taking great risks to their careers and livelihoods. In contrast, Russian scientific institutes have toed the Kremlin line — dependent as they are on its continued support. Collaborations on the basis of individual relationships may continue with some Russian scientists. This intellectual exchange is certainly valuable. But one can easily imagine that pullbacks and withdrawals will continue on other large scientific projects, if they haven’t already, to the detriment of international relations generally. That would be an unfortunate aspect of a renewed bifurcation of the world order much like what happened during the Cold War. But I sincerely hope that the strong scientific bonds established during the past three decades will survive and help re-establish broader East-West relations.

2022-08-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/31/opinion/letters/harry-styles-queer-identity.html,Opinion | Is Harry Styles Co-opting a Queer Identity?,"To the Editor: Re “Harry Styles Walks a Fine Line,” by Anna Marks (Opinion guest essay, Aug. 31), about the singer’s use of queer symbols while declining to claim a queer identity: The fine line that Harry Styles actually walks is not between so-called “queerbaiting” and the closet, but between being his authentic self (someone who chooses to use his massive platform to celebrate and uplift gender fluidity, nonconformity and queer positivity) and being the person Ms. Marks and others wish him to be (explicitly one thing or another). The good he has done in helping so many young people feel comfort in expressing themselves is measurable and profound — not something that, as the author suggests, we should “mourn” just because he hasn’t claimed any specific labels. David ValdesArlington, Mass. To the Editor: I understand the impulse to ask a celebrity to come out — if they are indeed queer — so that a wider public may increase their acceptance of queer people and queer lives. However, I also believe that visibly living in the world as a queer person is in itself an important symbol to queer and non-queer people alike. Many places have moved beyond the completely closeted world faced by Harvey Milk, who said, “Every gay person must come out.” The later-reclaimed term “queer” reflects an obscuring of identity, a reference to how one is perceived in the world, rather than a specification of one’s exact placement on the sexual orientation and gender identity rainbow. As an attorney who represents queer people experiencing job discrimination, I see value in explicitly “coming out,” but also in simply “being out” — being one’s self moving through the world as a perceived queer person without satisfying the world’s ceaseless curiosity in “what are you?” This, too, is working toward the goal that perceived differences in gender identity and sexual orientation are irrelevant to one’s civil rights. This does not erase our identities. Rather, it recognizes and breaks down that rigidity that kept L.G.B.T. people out of civil society and forced us into categories created by older heterosexual norms. I express my identity as a trans woman without identifying myself to the public as such. It’s not a question of privacy. It is a statement that, in the words of the immortal songwriter Jerry Herman, “I am what I am, and what I am needs no excuses.” Nor explanations, I might add. Jillian T. WeissBrooklyn To the Editor: I am a 54-year-old queer man who has been fully out of the closet since I was 18. The symbols of queer identity are not “ours” like a trademark litigation case. Queerness is not a sorority with strict hazing rituals to earn admission. And the price of Harry Styles’s concerts does not entitle others to make any demands on his private life, his truth or his journey. They can ignore him, not buy his concert ticket, critique his art, his costumes, his hair or whatever irks them about pop music. They have no right to appropriate his or any other human being’s truth. That’s the whole point of queerness. Kevin IversWashington To the Editor: I could not agree more with Anna Marks. It is absolutely true that Harry Styles has established himself as a formidable pop icon who has consistently used queer symbols in order to perform allyship with the queer community while also presenting a sanitized version of queerness that is accepted and even celebrated in the mainstream. Corporations have been rainbow washing for years now by performing allyship during pride month and L.G.B.T.+ history month. But when it comes to critical solidarity — whether that be challenging the growing transphobia in the U.K. or the homophobic regimes that their businesses make a profit from — they remain silent. Mr. Styles’s sexual identity is his own business and I don’t think any of us should be pushing him to “come out.” But if Mr. Styles is to continue to be a queer icon, I think it is fair that queer fans ask more of him: to be more vocal in condemning transphobia and homophobia, to be vocal about queer politics of liberation, to ask for more support for queers of color and those without Mr. Styles’s privilege and to use his celebrity voice to show critical solidarity with queer communities who have supported his rise to stardom.

To the Editor: Re “Visionary Soviet Leader Who Lifted the Iron Curtain” (obituary, front page, Aug. 31): Winston Churchill liberated Western Europe, and Mikhail Gorbachev liberated Eastern Europe. Why didn’t Mr. Gorbachev’s enlightenment period — the world of prominent reformist political figures like Andrei Sakharov, Yelena Bonner, Eduard Shevardnadze and Boris Yeltsin — last? Also, as Mr. Gorbachev bitterly asked: Why didn’t the West step up and give Russia a Marshall Plan of generous economic aid and trade terms to sustain it? It was our shortsightedness that pushed the Russian people backward to Vladimir Putin, and to an invasion of Ukraine. James AdlerCambridge, Mass. To the Editor: Twenty years ago, Mikhail Gorbachev gave a speech at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, that foretold the current crisis in Russia. I was in the audience at the time as an exchange student, and I’ve never forgotten his message, but, sadly, it seemed to go largely unnoticed at the time outside of the local press. Although the German audience gave him a rousing ovation in honor of his role in reuniting their country, the theme of Mr. Gorbachev’s speech was somber and pointed: If Russia was excluded from active partnership with Europe, he said, it would turn inward upon itself and become very dangerous. He said that both Russia and the United States had vested interests in Europe, and both should participate in discussions and deliberations about Europe’s future. With his death, it is time for our leaders to re-examine his message and consider ways to engage with a post-Putin generation in Russia on peaceful, mutually beneficial terms. Robert SchechtmanSan Francisco To the Editor: Re “Stars Return to Fill the Stage, But Gaze at Many Empty Seats” (front page, Aug. 22): As a 77-year-old passionate theatergoer, I was thrilled to return to Broadway when masks were being required. Once that mandate was dropped, I stopped going and, in fact, even requested and received a refund for tickets I purchased long ago to “The Kite Runner.” However, when I learned that show was introducing Friday night mask-required performances, I eagerly went online and purchased tickets for one of those evenings. I have continued to enjoy Off Broadway and Lincoln Center shows during this period because many of them have continued to require audience members to wear masks. So, here’s a hint to Broadway producers: Bring back mask requirements and watch your older audience members flock to fill those empty seats! Carol NadellNew York To the Editor: Because I have a compromised immune system and heart disease, my wife and I have not only stopped going to plays, movies and concerts — which we loved doing — but we haven’t even set foot inside a supermarket since the start of the pandemic (based on my doctor’s advice). A possible partial solution for some venues to increase revenues: Try more streaming of performances. We have paid to stream live lectures from the 92nd Street Y, along with some staged play readings and musical performances from regional theaters. We would love to have more choices of these types of events. Fred CantorWestport, Conn.",29
2022-09-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/opinion/brittney-griner-russia-wnba.html,Opinion | What Brittney Griner’s Income Says About Women’s Basketball,"Brittney Griner, the W.N.B.A. eight-time All-Star and two-time Olympic gold medalist, remains in a Russian jail, nearly 200 days after she was arrested on Feb. 17 for possessing less than a gram of hashish oil. In spite of global calls for her release, she may be there for a while. On Aug. 4, Ms. Griner, who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, was sentenced to nine years in prison. While efforts are underway to exchange the arms dealer Viktor Bout for the release of Ms. Griner and Paul Whelan, another American imprisoned in Russia, Russian officials say that will not be possible until all legal avenues are exhausted, a process that may take months. But what Ms. Griner was doing in Russia in the first place reveals an inconvenient truth: that for more than a decade, Russian oligarchs have valued American female star athletes more than U.S. executives have. Ms. Griner, like roughly 70 of her fellow W.N.B.A. athletes, has supplemented her income by playing overseas during the W.N.B.A. off-season. While American fans are supporting the W.N.B.A. — filling up arenas, donning jerseys, following players on social media — in many ways American executives do not. “Russia was so far ahead of the U.S. in terms of paying female basketball players because attracting foreign — and especially Western — talent is a matter of national prestige for Russia,” Stanislav Markus, a business professor at the University of South Carolina who studies oligarchs, said. “Until the recent geopolitical standoff, it was tacitly encouraged by the state and generously financed by the oligarchs who often own the teams.” The economics stateside for female hoopers are abysmal. Top male college basketball stars may pursue multimillion-dollar careers in the N.B.A. Women who possess comparable talent fare differently. The maximum W.N.B.A. base salary for the 2022 season was about $228,000. The salary of Stephen Curry, the highest paid N.B.A. player last season, was almost $46 million, which means the highest paid man earned roughly 200 times what his woman counterpart did for a similar job. That isn’t a glass ceiling — it’s a glass stratosphere. In one of the most public workplaces in the world. Enter the oligarchs. “They want to win,” Mike Cound, who played overseas and now represents about 60 women basketball players as an agent, said of Russian team owners. Mr. Cound said that throughout his career he’s placed roughly 20 basketball players on UMMC Ekaterinburg, a longstanding Russian Premier League team based out of Ekaterinburg that had Ms. Griner on its roster since the mid-2010s. “There were private jets, business class tickets, cars and drivers, luxury apartments, salaries that are double, sometimes triple what they could be anywhere else,” Mr. Cound said. “They wanted to send the message: We can do this. That made it a destination.” UMMC Ekaterinburg is controlled by Andrei Kozitsyn and Iskander Makhmudov, the billionaire co-founders of a mining company. The team was built into a powerhouse in part by Shabtai von Kalmanovic, a convicted K.G.B. spy who was murdered in a contract killing in 2009. In addition to paychecks, for decades Russian teams have also provided venues for players trying to hone their craft, both as developing athletes and in the off-season, according to Katia Clanet, a professional basketball player from France. Ms. Clanet’s mother, an Olympian who played for Russia’s national team, coached in Russia, and Ms. Clanet trained there as a teenager and maintains dual citizenship. “Russia for a long time was a land of basketball,” Ms. Clanet said. “The quality of the coaches was good, more technical.” One of the common refrains to explain away the American basketball pay gap is that the W.N.B.A. is a newer league than the N.B.A., founded in 1996, compared to the N.B.A.’s origination in the 1940s. Yet by crunching the numbers for pay between the N.B.A. and the W.N.B.A. at the same period in their life cycles, the professors Nola Agha of the University of San Francisco and David Berri of Southern Utah University found that W.N.B.A. players were paid less even after accounting for the age of the league. “It can sometimes explain systems in place that cause completely different outcomes,” Professor Agha said in an interview. She added: “You have a century of people not used to spectating women’s sports because in so many ways it was belittled and shut down and questioned. And then we go to the current time frame and you see underinvestment.” The real cash infusion in sports has come from television. The W.N.B.A.’s television deal with ESPN pays about $25 million per year, compared with the N.B.A.’s total combined $24 billion for its deals with ESPN and Turner Sports, which wrap after the 2024-25 season. Consider also the literal space in which people watch women’s sports. There is only one — one! — sports bar in the country, perhaps in the world, devoted exclusively to women’s sports, the Sports Bra in Portland, Ore. Limited television exposure in the United States not only makes it hard for fans to follow the games or find them in the first place but also fuels the pay gap. Smaller TV contracts mean smaller paychecks for players. Creating a culture of fandom around women’s sports can’t happen overnight and needs effort from fans, leagues, sponsors and media stakeholders. The opportunity for an investment of more American money and attention couldn’t come more quickly for W.N.B.A. players, as the pipeline of Russian cash into the sport is likely narrowing. In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ms. Griner’s team, UMMC Ekaterinburg, along with other Russian teams, was suspended by the EuroLeague. While some players will hop on planes in the coming weeks to compete in countries such as Spain and Turkey, it’s hard to see how any W.N.B.A. stars will compete in Russia anytime soon. Yet in some ways, the choppy landscape is nothing new for W.N.B.A. players, who have been no strangers to handling controversy, be it dedicating their season to Breonna Taylor or helping to flip a U.S. Senate seat. And, no surprise, they’re bringing activism into Ms. Griner’s case, wearing “We are BG” shirts and tweeting at the White House daily. From detention, Ms. Griner herself penned a letter to President Biden. Now it’s on fans to pay attention.

2022-09-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/04/opinion/letters/logging-national-forests.html,Opinion | Logging in National Forests: A Crime or a Necessity?,"To the Editor: Re “Leave Forests Alone, Before It’s Too Late,” by Carole King (Opinion guest essay, Aug. 26): I love Ms. King’s music and I love the public forests of the American West. As a federal wildland firefighter I spent my career watching those forests burn — including in Idaho, Ms. King’s home state. Climate change has only exacerbated the issue. My experience has taught me that older trees are more resistant to fire than younger trees when it comes to wildfires, but only if crowded groups of small-diameter trees are not growing directly underneath or adjacent to them. Within the context of climate change, the forests of the West cannot simply be left “as they are.” The landscape is not a museum; it is a dynamic collection of living ecosystems that now require active management to promote their resilience against a climate that is rapidly changing. Mike BenefieldTerrebonne, Ore. To the Editor: Thanks to the musician Carole King for an urgent and cogent call to protect our nation’s irreplaceable forests. Amid rising global temperatures and climate chaos evidenced by persistent droughts and mega-floods, conscientious caring for arboreal wilderness is imperative. Writing in 2003, the Indian environmental activist Vandana Shiva expressed dismay at the assault on forest lands: “It is a war unleashed by the violence of the monoculture mind, which reduces nature to raw material, life to a commodity, diversity to a threat, and views destruction as ‘progress.’” The American prophet of ecology Henry David Thoreau proclaimed that in pristine purlieus of the wild “is the preservation of the world.” These ongoing venal acts of brute commercial exploitation bring humanity inches closer to our own eradication. There is a better and more harmonious way to live in peace with the trees. Joe MartinSeattle To the Editor: In calling for the government to leave forests “as they are” — an end to active management of America’s 193 million acres of national forests — Carole King is effectively asking us to needlessly condemn millions of acres to the ravages of climate change. She also leaves out critical parts of the story. We have tried to exclude all fire — even, in many cases, ecologically beneficial fire — from most national forests for more than a century. Once open, seasonally dry forests that thrived with frequent low-intensity fires have become dense forests with weakened resilience. Trees are struggling to survive the most severe mega-drought the West has seen in 1,200 years — a result of climate change. Working in climate-stressed forests, my colleagues and I see the results of this daily. Massive tree die-offs and uncharacteristically severe wildfires are now common in these unnaturally dense and unnaturally dry forests. Climate-smart forestry such as strategic ecological thinning, prescribed burning and climate-informed reforestation can help forests adapt and become more climate resilient. If we do nothing, we will lose many more trees across more acres than will ever be removed through forest management. Brian KittlerPortland, Ore.The writer is the vice president of forest restoration at American Forests, a nonprofit conservation organization. To the Editor: Carole King’s opinion piece is high on emotion but low on the facts. Wood is much less carbon intensive, and better for the environment, than many other materials, such as steel, concrete or plastic. If our wood doesn’t come from sustainably managed forests on public lands in the United States, it will come from illegal logging in places like the rain forest. The concept is called “leakage,” where our demands for wood are merely transferred elsewhere, often in places with fewer environmental controls than in this country. The way to reduce global warming is to use fewer fossil fuels by changing our lifestyles. Stop flying in airplanes and mowing lawns is a good start. Jerry MilnePlymouth, Conn.The writer is a certified forester who has managed thousands of acres of public forests for over 40 years. To the Editor: Re “Your Doppelgänger Is Out There and You Probably Share DNA” (front page, Aug. 24): Doppelgängers have fascinated, and frightened, human beings for a very long time. In ancient Egypt, for example, someone’s spiritual double was named “ka.” Writers from Shakespeare to Mark Twain to Stephen King have drawn on the phenomenon for their works, with Hollywood voraciously scooping up their ideas and then some. Startlingly close look-alike stand-ins and body doubles have built entire careers in movies and television. As your story points out, with the billions of people who share our small planet, it stands to reason that Mother Nature can only be so creative, that “there are, after all, only so many ways to build a face.” It really is a conceit to think that, looks-wise, there could only be one of us. What intrigues, though, as alluded to in your article, is how behavior and environment might come into play in shaping the way we look. Close resemblance or not, a quote attributed to the cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead says it all: “Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.” In the end, each of us is a bundle of uniqueness to be celebrated, from “the way your smile just beams” to “the way you sip your tea,” as George and Ira Gershwin reminded us in “They Can’t Take That Away from Me.” And they really can’t. Greg JosephSun City, Ariz. To the Editor: I notice all the doppelgängers in the article look to be about the same age. If we look across the human life span, how many more “twins” can we find? Imagine looking into your much older face — or, in my case, seeing myself as I looked when I was much younger. What would that be like? Louise SpechtBerkeley, Calif. To the Editor: I have never seen my doppelgänger, but my mother has. Years ago, Mom was quite upset when I walked right by her on the sidewalk near where she worked. But I had not been anywhere near that location that day. When your own mother mistakes someone else for you, that must be quite the doppelgänger. Jared StillBeaverton, Ore. To the Editor: Re “Russia’s War Is Curtailing Scientific Progress,” by Michael Riordan (Opinion guest essay, Aug. 23): I read with great interest Mr. Riordan’s essay about the toll on scientific knowledge created by the Russian attack on Ukraine. This is a toll I’ve frequently thought about in the past six months with respect to my own field. Twenty years ago I spent a semester teaching American history at Moscow State University under the auspices of the Fulbright program. I developed warm friendships with many colleagues, particularly one historian who’s often been my houseguest and to whom I’ve introduced a number of American scholars in her area of expertise. I haven’t heard from my dear friend since the war started, and the future of such cultural exchanges looks bleak. Not the biggest tragedy unleashed by this ghastly war, but painful nonetheless. Glenna MatthewsLos Altos, Calif. To the Editor: Re “Oklahoma, Rejecting Clemency Guidance, Executes a Murderer” (news article, Aug. 26): The death penalty has been used less often in recent years but, as the execution of James Coddington shows, some states are keen to reverse this trend. His is the first of 25 executions scheduled in Oklahoma over the next 28 months. President Biden has said he will work to end the death penalty. It would be a good start if, instead of pardoning a turkey or two this Thanksgiving, he spared the lives of the 44 men languishing on federal death row. This would be a magnificent gesture.

Li Zhanshu, the third-ranking member of the Communist Party of China, visited Moscow last week after attending an economic forum in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok, where he met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Li is the highest-level Chinese official to leave the country since the start of the pandemic. Mr. Li traveled in advance of a trip by Xi Jinping, China’s leader, who is expected to go to Kazakhstan on Wednesday and Uzbekistan later in the week, where he will meet with Mr. Putin at a gathering of leaders from the region. Russia is touting warming ties with China as its war drive is facing setbacks, with Ukrainian forces retaking territory in the country’s northeast and some Kremlin allies grumbling about the grinding conflict’s lasting longer than expected. In Vladivostok Mr. Li praised Mr. Putin, saying that under his leadership Russia was “not crushed by the severe sanctions of the United States and the West, but rather in a short period achieved stability and showed resilience.” But it was later in Moscow that he offered his strongest endorsement of the Russian leadership. “We see that the United States and its NATO allies are expanding their presence near the Russian borders, seriously threatening national security and the lives of Russian citizens,” Mr. Li said, according to a description from the Russian Parliament. “We fully understand the necessity of all the measures taken by Russia aimed at protecting its key interests; we are providing our assistance.” “On the Ukrainian issue, we see how they have put Russia in an impossible situation,” he added. “And in this case, Russia made an important choice and responded firmly.” China has tread carefully in addressing the war in Ukraine. The Chinese state news media did not report on Mr. Li’s Ukraine comments and has given his trip modest coverage. Russia invaded Ukraine days after the end of the Beijing Olympics. Mr. Xi met with Mr. Putin in Beijing before the start of the Games, releasing a 5,300-word statement that described a friendship with “no limits” between the two countries and a shared ambition to counter the influence of outside forces in their regions, a message aimed squarely at the United States. While Beijing has refused to criticize Mr. Putin’s actions or refer to the conflict as a “war,” it has also been cautious about overtly endorsing it and denied any advance knowledge of Russia’s plans. China has maintained robust trade ties with Russia, buying record levels of its oil in May, June and July as Europe is increasingly shunning Russian petroleum. But China has been careful to avoid violating sanctions on Russia that could lead to its being punished as well.",22
2022-09-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/13/world/asia/china-russia-xi-putin.html,Challenges for Russia and China Test a ‘No-Limits’ Friendship,"BEIJING — The summit this week between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China is a show of force by two autocratic leaders united against what they consider American hegemony. It is also a moment of mutual weakness as Russia suffers losses in Ukraine and China endures an economic slowdown. They come to the meeting, expected to take place later this week in Uzbekistan, with their own agendas and their own challenges that will test an important relationship both have described as a friendship with “no limits.” Moscow needs Beijing. Russia’s recent routs on the battlefields of Ukraine, coupled with the broad damage inflicted by Western sanctions, have made Chinese support all the more important. China has emerged as a major buyer of Russian commodities, purchases that have helped replenish Moscow’s coffers. Beijing, though, remains cautious. It wants to project strength in the increasingly acrimonious competition with the United States and can’t afford for its main partner in an authoritarian alliance to face a humiliating defeat. But providing substantial, additional help to Russia, either economically or militarily, risks running afoul of Western sanctions and imperiling China’s economy. “Xi’s China has been carrying out an exquisite tightrope walk with regard to Russia,” said Rana Mitter, a professor of history and politics at Oxford University. “It is keen to show support for Russia in general, but finds active support for an invasion too politically embarrassing to contemplate and wants Moscow to resolve matters one way or another.” Image matters for Mr. Xi as he prepares to secure a third term at a pivotal Communist Party congress in Beijing next month. His trip this week, during which he will attend a regional summit in Uzbekistan and visit Kazakhstan, marks the first time Mr. Xi has traveled abroad since the start of the pandemic and signals just how much he values the relationship. The meeting with Mr. Putin will give the Chinese leader a chance to look like a global statesman, playing well to a home audience. Russia also provides much-needed backing for China’s agenda. When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last month in defiance of China’s claims to the self-ruled democracy, the Kremlin was quick to support Beijing’s stance, describing the trip as “provocative” and pledging “absolute solidarity with China.” But China has tied itself to a war that has so far backfired for Russia. Any serious weakening of Mr. Putin’s dominance in Russia could hurt Beijing’s position at a time when the leadership is dealing with the political and economic fallout from its strict Covid policies. The question confronting China is whether to double down or let Russia navigate the setbacks on its own. Both strategies carry risks, and most experts expect China to choose a middle path of continued economic support without openly circumventing sanctions or providing outright military assistance. China, which has avoided describing Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a war, appears to be tempering its bets. When Mr. Xi’s second-highest-ranking deputy, Li Zhanshu, met with Mr. Putin in Russia last week, Chinese state media emphasized the two countries’ shared admiration but steered clear of overt advocacy for Russia’s actions in Ukraine. China’s official Xinhua news agency said Mr. Li has told Mr. Putin that, “political mutual trust, strategic coordination and pragmatic cooperation between the two countries have reached an unprecedented level.” Xinhua made no mention of Ukraine, even as Russia state media claimed Beijing backed the invasion, portraying Mr. Li as having said that China “understands and supports Russia” particularly “on the situation in Ukraine.” “China keeps avoiding military involvement in any degree in Russia’s war and will continue to do so, especially when the Russians have been in a drastic failure situation in the field,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “China’s diplomatic and political support or sympathy will not really help them, though dramatic purchases of their energy since April help a little non-militarily.” Mr. Putin, who describes his war as part of a battle against nefarious Western powers that threaten Russia’s very existence, appears to find China’s middle ground vexing. He suggested as much last week in describing the long-running negotiations for a new pipeline that could allow Russia to export more Siberian natural gas to China rather than Europe — a matter of critical importance to Moscow as Europe rushes to reduce energy imports from Russia. “Our Chinese friends are tough bargainers,” Mr. Putin said at a conference in the Russian port city of Vladivostok focused on increasing economic ties with Asia. “Naturally, they proceed from their national interests in any deal, which is the only way to go.” Mr. Putin will go into the meeting with Mr. Xi looking to China as a lifeline at perhaps Russia’s most tenuous moment since the invasion began in February. Russian forces have recently lost more than one thousand square miles of territory in Ukraine, creating new political headwinds for Mr. Putin — even from some of his longtime supporters, now frustrated by Russia’s bumbling war effort. At this week’s meeting, Mr. Putin hopes to close a deal for the natural gas pipeline. Russia also needs access to China’s high-tech exports and Chinese currency to pay for those goods, since Russia’s access to dollars is severely restricted. “China has more leverage than Russia,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. As Western countries shun Moscow, it is the expanding ties with China that Mr. Putin points to most as proof that Russia cannot be isolated. It is a relationship to which Mr. Putin has devoted enormous effort, one that accelerated after relations with the West took a dive following Russia’s annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The honor of meeting Mr. Xi in person is sure to be extolled by Russia’s state media as evidence of Mr. Putin’s continued acumen on the world stage. “Our relations have reached unprecedented heights,” Mr. Putin said at the Vladivostok conference. The century-old relationship between the two nations is steeped in ideology and history. Moscow was crucial to the Chinese Communist Party’s founding, early survival and eventual victory in 1949 in China’s Civil War. Relatively close relations have continued, although they were interrupted by a rift in the 1960s so serious that the two countries fought border skirmishes. Mr. Xi himself has a longstanding connection to Russia and Mr. Putin, whom he has met with 38 times. The Chinese leader’s father, Xi Zhongxun, a leading party figure in the 1950s, oversaw Soviet experts who came to China to help build the country’s heavy industry after the civil war, said Joseph Torigian, the author of an upcoming biography on the elder Mr. Xi. Mr. Xi’s father visited Moscow, full of admiration. “He brought back mementos from Russia,” Mr. Torigian said, “that Xi Jinping later recalled.” A week after he became China’s president in March 2013, Mr. Xi chose Russia for his first trip abroad and hinted in a speech there that the two countries would work together against the West. “Currently, China and Russia are both in important periods of national revival, and bilateral relations have entered a new stage,” Mr. Xi said. China now has the upper hand in the relationship, given its economic and military might. China’s economy was 10 times the size of Russia’s last year, before the war in Ukraine. From May through July, China bought record amounts of Russian oil at a deep discount and imported more Russian natural gas and coal. Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, announced last week that China’s payments for gas from one pipeline would no longer be made in dollars or euros, but in Russian rubles and Chinese renminbi. Such deals make it easier for Russia to bypass Western banks and buy Chinese goods that are similar to high-tech Western products under export restrictions. While China has sold many cars and other products that do not use Western technology to Russia, it appears to have avoided the riskier activity of reselling advanced Western technology. China appears to have refrained so far this year from shipping weapons to Russia, forcing Moscow to ask Iran and North Korea for military equipment. China’s military has a long history of training with its Russian counterparts. Last week, China sent more than 2,000 People’s Liberation Army soldiers, 21 combat aircraft and three warships to participate in joint military exercises in eastern Russia. It was the first time that China had sent air, land and naval forces to participate in the major military exercise, which Mr. Putin personally oversaw. But Mr. Xi is unlikely to tie his country more closely to Russia than he did in February, when he declared the limitless friendship. “I don’t really expect any sort of new statement to be made by Xi Jinping that would be perceived as more strategic support for Russia,” said Li Mingjiang, a specialist in China’s international relations at the National University of Singapore, “nor would I expect China to walk back from what has been said.”",22

Humans are inherently highly social, but also have fundamental social anxiety that hinders us from engaging in the social activity we need, crave and enjoy. Every technology that enables us to keep to ourselves elevates the anxiety instinct over the social instinct. Cellphones and earbuds are very obvious culprits. But so was television in generations past, and even air-conditioning, which kept people inside, rather than chatting out on the front stoop. The environments in which we live have the same effect. As a suburban kid, I was deeply influenced by camp in the summer, where I exchanged my own room in a large house for a crowded bunk and constant companionship. The lively interactions there led me to choose urban life as an adult. Entering my building on a recent night, I had conversations with three different neighbors (and their kids, and their dogs) before I even got into the elevator to my apartment. This is a radically different kind of human experience than one has in the suburbs or the wide-open areas that are usually colored red on our political maps. The severe political divisions between urban and nonurban areas strongly suggest that these different experiences of human interaction color our views in fundamental ways. Ron MeyersNew York To the Editor: Here in Great Neck, N.Y., we have recently designated “conversation stations” at sidewalk seating around town, inviting passers-by to “please sit here if you’d welcome some friendly conversation.” According to the local press, it’s working just as David Brooks envisages: “Once you get used to filling your day with social exercise, it gets easier and easier, and more and more fun.” Ronald GrossGreat Neck, N.Y.The writer, director of Conversations New York, organized the conversation stations. To the Editor: Decades ago, in Paris, I sat down on an unoccupied park bench in the Tuileries Garden to read my newspaper. Shortly thereafter, a Parisian gentleman sat down on the other end of the bench and started a conversation. My first reaction was to be annoyed, but I didn’t want to be totally rude so I tried to be polite in a perfunctory way without encouraging him too much. Two years later we were married, and we remained together for over 20 years until his death! Irene Bernstein-PechmèzeQueens To the Editor: I have personally learned so much from a daily practice of having at least one conversation with a stranger. Over the past 30 years, for example, I have spoken with a blind man looking to feel the vibrations of an incoming subway car, a young woman on a grocery checkout line searching for a doctor to treat her aunt’s cancer, and an exhausted man on his way home after having worked a double shift at the weapons bureau at the police department. I even attended the graduation of a young Korean design student I befriended the summer before on a 16-hour flight to Seoul. This life-changing activity has opened my mind and given me a deep appreciation for the diversity of my city and the world. It has also humbled me to have been made aware of the challenges so many others face. Indeed, I now look at a stranger as a new friend I haven’t met yet. Jacquelyn OttmanNew York To the Editor: After my husband’s death from cancer four years ago, and stricken by loneliness, I made many attempts to meet other widows for coffee, or on a park bench, or to go for walks, and felt as if I was up against a stone wall. Many would speak on the telephone, but meeting in person was burdensome for them. They had doctors’ appointments galore, which they kept, but social meetings seemed impossible. I found few women who would venture out, so I went alone when I had no one else. I never stopped talking to strangers, if only to say “Good morning.” I am still lonely but surviving with the few friends I have. Shirley SmithbergNew York To the Editor: Thank you for urging us to connect. I’ll add this suggestion for enhancing your life: Talk to cabdrivers! This is an entry-level position for many foreigners. Their reasons for coming to the U.S. are various and their stories are informative. You might meet a military officer fleeing regime change or a business person from a suddenly collapsed economy. You can learn a lot through unfiltered accounts of the politics in Sudan, or the food of Ethiopia or the government of Venezuela. Most people seem eager to tell their stories. I have always found the goodbye at the end of the ride to be warmer than the hello at the beginning. Mary Barrow NicholsAustin, Texas To the Editor: If we suffer from “undersociality” and the remedy is talking to strangers, we will have to update our parenting practices. Instead of teaching “stranger danger” from the earliest years, as parents we will need to both model and teach our children how to talk to strangers regularly, in appropriate circumstances. It may or may not be true that the fate of America will be “determined by how we treat each other in the smallest acts of daily life,” as David Brooks asserts, but I believe that our mental health is. If my neighbors, my fellow passengers on the bus and strangers in line at the store speak to me in a friendly way, I feel better and am likely to pass on those good feelings to others both at home and out and about. Can we reweave the torn fabric of our society by chatting? I like to think so. Eve SullivanCambridge, Mass.The writer is the founder of Parents Forum, a nonprofit that provides workshops on parenting. To the Editor: David Brooks expresses concern that, according to an online survey, “only 24 percent said they would talk to a stranger on a train.” I suspect that neither Mr. Brooks nor the aforementioned 24 percent have ever seen the 1951 Alfred Hitchcock film “Strangers on a Train” (or read the Patricia Highsmith novel upon which it is based). If they had, they might better understand why people shouldn’t talk to strangers. Jonathan RaffMilwaukee To the Editor: Re “After Big Gains, Ukrainians Face Critical Choices” (front page, Sept. 13): Ukraine’s impressive military breakthroughs against Russia should lead to diplomacy to end this destructive and dangerous war. Rather than trying to humiliate Moscow, Washington should press for a compromise that assures Ukraine’s territorial integrity, economic health and security. A peaceful settlement would be a huge victory for the Ukrainian people and for Europe. It would also stand as a rebuke to the imperial designs of Vladimir Putin. But we should not push humiliation to the point of blowback, which would be a new spur to Putinism. Instead, this crisis should remind us that the U.S.-Russian nuclear standoff is one of the world’s worst dangers. Progress toward nuclear disarmament cannot come too soon. David KeppelBloomington, Ind. To the Editor: Re “Reporter Whose Beat Was Vice in Las Vegas Meets a Violent End” (news article, Sept. 11), about a politician charged with murdering a reporter who had written an exposé about him: Too often the current response when someone speaks truth to power is to violently attack the messenger. I remember Jeff German’s steadfast voice resonating through his columns as he followed my own defamation battle against four powerful politicians in the mid-1990s. Three decades ago, calling out elected officials did not mean putting your life on the line. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. Mr. German will be remembered as an intrepid reporter, and, I hope, an inspiration to the next generation of journalists. To me, he was truly a hero. Lori Lipman BrownSilver Spring, Md.The writer is a former Nevada state senator. To the Editor: Re “How I Want the World to Remember Gorbachev,” by James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state (Opinion guest essay, Sept. 7): Mikhail Gorbachev deserves primary credit for ending the Cold War, as any alert observer could detect from the currents running in international relations at the time. It is important to remember what the reality was — how it looked, how it felt — to those engaged in relations with the Soviet Union when certain events occurred: the 1989 collapse of the Berlin Wall, the revolutionary changes that swept Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ronald Reagan met the initial challenge from a dynamic new Soviet leader — recognizing early in his second term that Mr. Gorbachev was for real and that the U.S. government could “do business with him” — whereas the succeeding George H.W. Bush administration was slow to change its skeptical perspective as it pushed NATO’s boundaries eastward. William E.

2022-09-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/world/asia/xi-jinping-putin-china.html,Xi Jinping Heads to Central Asia in First Foreign Trip Since 2020,"After spending all of the pandemic hunkered down in China, Xi Jinping, the country’s leader, finally stepped outside its borders on Wednesday for the first time in more than two years, making a short visit to Central Asia to project himself as a global statesman and engage in the sort of diplomacy that can’t be done by video call. The trip offers Mr. Xi a chance to point to China’s growing geopolitical clout in the region despite the sharp deterioration in Beijing’s relations with much of the West. At a summit with leaders of several Asian nations, he will likely seek to present China as a reliable regional and global power — and an alternative to American leadership. Mr. Xi arrived in Kazakhstan on Wednesday for the start of a three-day trip. In the evening, he continued on to Uzbekistan, where he will attend a summit of regional leaders and is expected to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. That meeting will give Mr. Putin, whose country has been increasingly isolated by the United States and Europe over its invasion of Ukraine and whose forces have faced sharp battlefield setbacks in recent days, a needed boost as he stands alongside one of the world’s most powerful leaders. Mr. Xi will seek to use the trip to shore up confidence in his grip on power weeks before a key meeting of the ruling Communist Party leadership, where he is expected to claim another five-year term. Across its official propaganda apparatus, the party is promoting Mr. Xi’s trip heavily at a time when the country faces grave challenges. China’s economy has slowed drastically. Youth unemployment is at a record high. Rising inflation around the world has hurt demand for Chinese exports. The party is imposing extensive — many say excessive — lockdowns to try to curb Covid outbreaks, confining an estimated tens of millions of people to their homes and subjecting some residents to dire food shortages. The country’s stringent and single-minded focus on avoiding and eliminating the coronavirus at all costs also explains Mr. Xi’s long absence from the global stage. Mr. Xi’s last trip to a foreign country was to Myanmar in January 2020. Even when he ventured to the southern Chinese city of Hong Kong this July, he took few risks, requiring that all officials, journalists and others attending the events undergo daily coronavirus testing and isolate themselves before his arrival. Mr. Xi’s conspicuous retreat was a stark contrast to his schedule before the pandemic, when he spent the equivalent of more than a month abroad each year. In recent months, as more countries have opened up, it made him an outlier among the leaders of powerful countries. It also limited his ability to directly influence China’s image abroad amid rising concerns about Beijing’s human rights record, its saber-rattling against Taiwan and other issues. “The only reason Xi Jinping did not go out over the past three years was the epidemic prevention and control policies,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing. But staying home “also brings some losses to China’s diplomacy,” he added. “Now the leaders of the Chinese government should start to cautiously and properly resume face-to-face exchanges and foreign visits with leaders of other countries,” Mr. Shi said. Even though Mr. Xi’s and Mr. Putin’s meeting will show the growing closeness of Beijing and Moscow, its setting will offer a reminder of the many ways in which they compete. In Central Asia, China has worked to expand its footprint in the former Soviet republics that Russia views as within its sphere of influence. In a pair of essays written before his trip for Kazakh and Uzbek media, Mr. Xi emphasized China’s historical ties with the two countries and depicted Beijing as a generous benefactor and reliable regional power. He highlighted Chinese investment in pipelines, wind power, oil refining and auto manufacturing in Kazakhstan and the joint production of Chinese Covid vaccines in Uzbekistan. “Uzbekistan is welcome to board the express train of China’s development and share its development opportunities,” he wrote. Mr. Xi is sure to emphasize the potential of trade and investment with China. His first stop, Kazakhstan, has been key to China’s vast international investment and development program known as the Belt and Road Initiative, which he started on a visit in 2013. The program, which centers on Chinese-led investment in bridges, rails, ports and energy to link dozens of countries to China, has been a signature project of Mr. Xi’s, with ambitions of remaking the global economic order. But critics say the infrastructure and investment scheme leaves the participating nations dependent on China. Such concerns are shared by many in Kazakhstan, who worry that the country’s economic reliance on China gives Beijing too much leverage. The country’s ethnic Kazakh majority shares linguistic, cultural and in some cases family ties with Kazakhs in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China. Beijing has imposed an expansive crackdown in Xinjiang that has led to the mass detentions of many members of predominately Muslim groups, including Kazakhs. The crackdown has created a sticking point in ties between the two countries, but the Kazakh leadership has not publicly criticized China for it, and the country’s authorities have also punished activists seeking to lobby for those facing repression in China. A military band and top officials, including President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, greeted Mr. Xi at the airport in Kazakhstan’s capital. Like Mr. Xi, the Kazakh officials were all masked, apparently in deference to China’s strict efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Kazakh president has conducted other recent official business, including a meeting with Pope Francis, without a face mask. Chinese state media reports depicted Mr. Tokayev as showering Mr. Xi with praise, calling him “a genuine great leader” and awarding him the Order of the Golden Eagle, the highest honor given by the president for service to Kazakhstan. In Uzbekistan, Mr. Xi is expected to meet with Mr. Putin during a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a multilateral, security-focused organization that includes China, Russia, India, Pakistan and four Central Asian nations. The topic on everyone’s mind, the war in Ukraine, will likely be publicly played down as the leaders focus on regional trade. Russia, China and Mongolia have tentatively agreed to build a new gas pipeline, Mr. Putin said last week, and the leaders of the three countries are set to meet on the sidelines of the Uzbekistan summit. The biggest item on the agenda will be the building of roads and pipelines to move goods and fossil fuels across the region, said Niva Yau, a senior researcher at the OSCE Academy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. “No one is really going to address the Ukraine war so openly, but everyone will say why transit potential is important,” Ms. Yau said. The meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi will be their first in person since February, at the start of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, when they released a lengthy statement on the “no limits” friendship between their nations. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began shortly after the Olympics ended, placing Beijing in the awkward position of continuing to draw closer to Moscow even as it avoided openly endorsing the war or providing the sort of material support that could lead to American sanctions. The Chinese leadership is attracted to Russia because it can be a partner against American-led Western influence. But Central Asian countries are wary of Russia’s intentions and don’t think China recognizes their concerns, Ms. Yau said. China and Russia are “trying to end Western global dominance and that is in line with China’s interest,” Ms. Yau said. “The problem is that across Eurasia, everybody understands Russia’s goal as revival of the Soviet Union. I don’t think this is something China understands or takes seriously.” Amy Chang Chien contributed reporting.",22
2022-09-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/world/europe/biden-brittney-griner-paul-whelan.html,Biden to Meet With Families of Griner and Paul Whelan,"WASHINGTON — President Biden will meet with the families of Brittney Griner and Paul N. Whelan at the White House on Friday, making good on a longstanding request from the relatives of the two Americans being held prisoner in Russia. But the president does not have good news to deliver about the prisoner exchange that the administration offered Russia this summer, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday. “While I would love to say that the purpose of this meeting is to inform the families that the Russians have accepted our offer, and we are bringing their loved ones home, that is not what we’re seeing in these negotiations at this time,” Ms. Jean-Pierre said. “The president wanted to make sure that their families understood that they were front of mind,” she added, “and that his team was working tirelessly every day to get Brittney and Paul home safely.” Ms. Griner, a W.N.B.A. star and two-time Olympic gold medalist, was detained in Russia in February after the Russian authorities found vape cartridges with 0.7 grams of cannabis oil in her luggage when she arrived in the country to play basketball. She was convicted last month of trying to smuggle narcotics into Russia and sentenced to nine years in a penal colony. Mr. Whelan, a former Marine and corporate security executive, was arrested in 2018 and convicted in 2020 on spying charges and later sentenced to 16 years in prison. The fates of both Americans have been complicated by the deteriorating diplomatic relationship between the United States and Russia over President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Biden has condemned Mr. Putin’s actions in Ukraine, and the United States has joined with other nations to impose severe sanctions on the country. Despite that, Mr. Biden’s administration offered this summer to free Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer sentenced to 25 years by a court in New York in 2012, in exchange for the release of Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan. Russian officials have confirmed that diplomatic discussions are taking place, but White House officials have been frustrated by the lack of a response to the offer. “The Russians should accept the offer that’s at the table, and we will encourage them to do that,” Ms. Jean-Pierre said on Thursday. In the meantime, the families of Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan have been increasing public pressure on Mr. Biden to ensure that his administration does not let up. Early in the summer, relatives of both prisoners expressed frustration that they had not heard directly from Mr. Biden. Cherelle Griner, Ms. Griner’s wife, said on CBS in early July that the administration was “not doing anything” and that she wanted to hear from Mr. Biden directly. Two days later, Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke with Cherelle Griner. That prompted Elizabeth Whelan, the sister of Mr. Whelan, to publicly question why she had not received a similar call. In a call soon after, Mr. Biden assured Ms. Whelan that the administration was working to free both of the prisoners. Since then, there has been continued pressure for Mr. Biden to meet with the families face to face. Ms. Jean-Pierre said on Thursday that the meeting was scheduled for Friday because one of the family members was already going to be in the area and that the president wanted to meet with both families on the same day. It is not clear whether the president will meet with the families together or separately. The possibility of reaching a prisoner-exchange deal with Russia comes several months after the United States freed a convicted Russian drug smuggler in exchange for Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine who had been detained in a Russian prison for three years. White House officials said their Russian counterparts indicated at the time that another trade, for Mr. Bout, could be possible. Mr. Bout is known as the “Merchant of Death” for his activities as an arms dealer. He is serving a 25-year federal prison sentence for conspiring to sell arms to undercover U.S. agents, telling them he did not object to the use of the weapons to kill Americans.",7
2022-09-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/world/europe/putin-china-ukraine.html,Putin Nods to Xi’s ‘Concerns’ on Ukraine War,"President Vladimir V. Putin acknowledged on Thursday that China had “questions and concerns” about Russia’s war in Ukraine, a notable, if cryptic, admission that Moscow lacks the full backing of its biggest, most powerful partner on the world stage. Mr. Putin met China’s leader, Xi Jinping, on Thursday in their first in-person meeting since Russia invaded Ukraine, and as Mr. Xi traveled abroad for the first time since the start of the pandemic. But rather than put on a show of Eurasian unity against the West as Russia struggled to recover from last week’s humiliating military retreat in northeastern Ukraine, the two leaders struck discordant notes in their public remarks — and Mr. Xi made no mention of Ukraine at all. “We highly appreciate the balanced position of our Chinese friends in connection with the Ukrainian crisis,” Mr. Putin said in televised remarks at the start of the meeting. “We understand your questions and concerns in this regard.” It was a moment, on the sidelines of a regional summit in Uzbekistan, that showed the daunting political straits Mr. Putin finds himself in nearly seven months into his invasion of Ukraine. On the battlefield, Russia has lost more than 1,000 square miles of territory this month, rendering the prospect of a decisive victory over a Western-armed Ukraine as remote as ever. At home, Mr. Putin is facing unusual criticism from some supporters over his slow military progress. And internationally, as the West continues to ratchet up sanctions against the Kremlin, the Russian president on Thursday saw Mr. Xi — who had pledged a friendship with “no limits” just three weeks before Russia invaded — conspicuously withhold any public support for Mr. Putin’s war. Instead, in a statement issued after their meeting, China said it was “willing to work with Russia to demonstrate the responsibility of a major country, play a leading role, and inject stability into a turbulent world.” To scholars who study the between-the-lines messaging of the Chinese government’s public remarks, it sounded like an implicit rebuke. Sergey Radchenko, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said the statement appeared to telegraph “a reproach to the Russians, that they’re not acting like a great power, that they are creating instability.” Shi Yinhong, a longtime professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said it was “the most prudent or most low-key statement in years on Xi’s part on the strategic relationship between the two countries.” Accentuating the dissonance, even as Mr. Xi said nothing on camera about Ukraine, Mr. Putin at Thursday’s meeting backed Beijing in its confrontation over Taiwan, where tensions rose last month amid a visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to lend support for Taiwan’s resistance to pressure from Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island democracy. Still, China continues to represent a critical lifeline for Russia as Moscow looks for new export and import markets amid the crush of Western sanctions over the war. China has increased its purchases of Russian energy, while selling Russia more cars and some other goods. That support is “very important for Russia,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, adding that he believed the Kremlin was “cleareyed” about the limits of China’s backing. After their one-on-one talks on Thursday, Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin also held a joint meeting with President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh of Mongolia, whose country is in talks about hosting a new natural gas pipeline that would allow Russia to sell more of its Siberian gas to China, rather than to Europe. A Russian deputy prime minister, Aleksandr Novak, said Russia was close to reaching a deal to sell 50 billion cubic meters of gas per year to China through the planned pipeline — about the same volume as the capacity of the idle Nord Stream 2 pipeline linking Russia with Germany. Such a pipeline would, however, require years to complete. “We see completely eye to eye on the international situation,” Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said of the talks between Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi, describing the meeting as “wonderful.” He pledged that Russian and Chinese officials would coordinate closely at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week. But although Chinese state media have echoed Russian propaganda in recent months, there is much that China has not done to support Russia in the war and its conflict with the West — confrontations that Mr. Putin describes as existential for his country. China appears to have refrained so far this year from shipping weapons to Russia, forcing Moscow to ask Iran and North Korea for military equipment, according to U.S. officials. And it has done little to help Russia circumvent Western sanctions that prevent it from importing advanced Western technology. “Access to Western technology, Western markets, Western money is of paramount importance” for China, Mr. Gabuev said, explaining why Mr. Xi was not prepared to support Russia in ways that could lead to Western sanctions against Beijing. U.S. officials say that Russia and China see each other as useful in challenging the West, but also that Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi will only go so far to support the other. Russia is seeking material aid from China for its war efforts, Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, said on Thursday at a news conference. But American officials said this week that they have not seen China give any such aid yet. “What’s striking is Putin’s admission that President Xi has concerns about Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Mr. Price said. “It’s not surprising the P.R.C. has such concerns. It is somewhat curious that President Putin would be the one to admit it.” Mr. Radchenko, the professor, said Mr. Putin “has severely undercut his leverage with China” by cutting himself off from the West. The Chinese government, he said, appeared to see the war as a harmful development, in part because the resulting turmoil in global food and energy markets “created a kind of environment that is not conducive to China’s economic growth.” “Putin is extremely reckless,” Mr. Radchenko said. “And he’s willing to take risks that China would not approve of.” Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi met on the sidelines of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security-focused organization that includes China, Russia, India, Pakistan and four Central Asian nations. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey also attended and was expected to meet Mr. Putin on Friday. Russian state television reminded viewers that the gathered leaders represented more than half the world’s population, a message aimed at rebutting the idea that invading Ukraine had left Mr. Putin isolated. But for Mr. Xi, analysts said, the summit was as much about building ties with other countries in the region as it was about seeing Mr. Putin. China’s state broadcaster showed videos depicting Mr. Xi as being feted with enormous pomp and fanfare upon his arrival in Kazakhstan, where he stopped on Wednesday before being greeted by an honor guard, dancers and musicians in Uzbekistan. For China, “this is not fundamentally about China-Russia — they’ve spent a lot of time cultivating their neighbors across the border,” said Evan A. Feigenbaum, an Asia specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Mr. Feigenbaum said that while Beijing wants to show diplomatic support for Russia, to counter the U.S. dominance, it will also avoid any moves that might draw sanctions that would further hurt China’s slowing economy. At the same time, he said, China is seeking to offer rhetorical reassurances to former Soviet republics in Central Asia that have been made uneasy by the Ukraine war — an invasion that signaled to some that Mr. Putin is prepared to use force to try to rebuild the Soviet empire. Mr. Shi, the professor in Beijing, said Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin have almost certainly been in regular communication for months and know each other well, so it was less important for them to talk than for Mr. Xi to speak with Central Asian leaders. “Talking with Putin after so many online conversations in the past 200 days is far from so important or necessary,” he said, “while Russia’s failure in the present campaign in the field make China’s prudence and military noninvolvement more imperative.” Anton Troianovski reported from Washington, and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.

2022-09-16,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/world/asia/china-xi-central-asia.html,"In Central Asia’s ‘Great Game,’ China Seeks the Advantage","BEIJING — As Xi Jinping, China’s leader, visited Central Asian countries this week, he stepped off planes to rousing performances by rows of dancers, musicians and ceremonial guards. Uzbekistan’s leader called him “the greatest statesman,” Chinese state media declared, while the leader of Turkmenistan praised his “wise leadership.” They draped him in medals. For Beijing, the pomp and fanfare that greeted Mr. Xi, as well as the effusive rhetoric of his counterparts, served to show that China is not isolated despite coming under pressure from the United States and much of the West for its human rights violations and threats to Taiwan. Such messaging by China’s propaganda apparatus carries more urgency as Mr. Xi prepares to extend his power and elevate his authority at a Communist Party congress next month. In the narrative presented by Beijing, Mr. Xi is the reliable global leader that other countries look to for support in a world made turbulent by American hegemony. Even Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s autocratic leader, seemed almost deferential in his meeting with Mr. Xi on Thursday, acknowledging that China had “questions and concerns” about Russia’s war in Ukraine. But the pageantry also demonstrated China’s growing sway in Central Asia — a vast, resource-rich region of mountains and steppe once considered Russia’s domain, where great powers have long vied for influence. In Mr. Xi’s meetings with several Central Asian leaders, they were quoted as using phrases and political slogans coined by the Chinese Communist Party, praising him for “building a moderately prosperous society” and advancing toward China’s “great rejuvenation.” Mr. Xi was described by his counterparts as “the core” of his country, for instance, and the single person responsible for China’s successes — a narrative Beijing has intensified in recent months. “The words from the president of Uzbekistan are exactly like the local governors in China use when they have the chance to praise the current leader — they use that script,” said Peidong Sun, a Cornell University associate professor of contemporary Chinese social and cultural history. The image China’s propaganda outlets are cultivating is partly an exaggeration. Uzbekistan’s leader, in presenting Mr. Xi with an award, had expressed respect for him “as a statesman,” according to the president’s website, and not “the greatest statesman.” Many Central Asian nations welcome Chinese investment but are wary of becoming dependent on Beijing. In countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, people share linguistic, cultural and in some cases family ties with groups in Xinjiang, a region in China’s far west. Many have been concerned about the vast crackdown there that has ensnared Central Asian people. But China’s extensive reach in the region has reshaped the landscape in undeniable ways. Beijing has long seen Central Asia as a critical frontier for the country’s trade expansion, energy security, ethnic stability and military defense. China has built railroads, highways and energy pipelines and expanded educational exchanges throughout the region. While the former Soviet republics of Central Asia are still connected to Moscow by roads, rail lines and other infrastructure, their trade is now increasingly with China. The end of the American military presence in Afghanistan last year reduced the role of the United States as a geopolitical counterweight to Moscow and Beijing. Mr. Putin’s subsequent invasion of Ukraine, followed by a series of humiliating defeats of the Russian army, may give Beijing room to gain an edge. One complication for Mr. Xi’s ambitions in the region is his alignment and personal bond with Mr. Putin, the Russian leader whose invasion of Ukraine drew unease in the region. Mr. Xi has often described Mr. Putin as his “best friend,” and in February he hailed a friendship that had “no limits.” On Thursday, Mr. Xi appeared to distance himself, at least in public, saying nothing about Moscow’s position on Ukraine and offering reassurances to Central Asian leaders that China would support their sovereignty. The region’s concerns about Russian expansionism were most evident when President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan, an ally of Mr. Putin’s, said at a forum in June in St. Petersburg, Russia, that he would not recognize the “quasi states” that Russia has set up in occupied Ukrainian territory. The pushback against the Kremlin was striking because in January, Mr. Putin sent troops into Kazakhstan at Mr. Tokayev’s request to quell an uprising and stabilize his government. “These are resource-rich countries, relatively sparsely populated, and if Putin’s grip on them weakens, China has been clever and opportunistic,” said Harry Broadman, a former American trade official and a World Bank specialist in Central Asia and China. The region is familiar with walking a tightrope between powers. The Great Game, a term popularized by Rudyard Kipling, was the 19th-century competition between Russia and Britain for control over Central Asia. Russia’s influence peaked in 1979, with the Soviet miliary occupation of Afghanistan, then waned with the breakup of the Soviet Union 12 years later. In what has become a new version of the Great Game, China, with nine times the population of Russia and 10 times as large an economy, has also long been viewed with wariness in Central Asia. Countries there have responded over the years with stringent limits on immigration from China and other measures. They have also sought investment from the United States in projects like a factory that builds locomotives in the capital of Kazakhstan. But Mr. Xi accelerated China’s efforts to expand its influence in Central Asia, starting in 2013 the so-called Belt and Road Initiative, a program of railway, port and highways along the land and maritime Silk Roads that linked China to Europe and the Mideast for centuries. “China’s impact and influence in Central Asia has been increasing for a decade or so,” said Chen Dingding, a professor of international relations at Jinan University in Guangzhou. William C. Kirby, a Harvard professor of Chinese history, said that Chinese influence in Central Asia may now be reaching levels not seen since the peak of the ancient Silk Road during the Tang dynasty, which ruled China from 618 to 907. Russia has been the main threat to the independence of Central Asian republics since Peter the Great, the czar in the early eighteenth century. China seems less threatening right now by comparison. “The greatest danger for them is to become once again drawn too tightly to Moscow’s orbit,” Mr. Kirby said. China’s courtship of Central Asia is aimed in part at drumming up support on the global stage for its interests. In meetings with Mr. Xi on Thursday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, ahead of a Chinese-led security conference on Friday, one leader after another pledged support for China’s territorial claim to Taiwan, a self-ruled island democracy. But there appeared to be some limits to Beijing’s sway. Mr. Xi made little headway on an issue at the heart of the security conference on Friday: support for his hard line policies in Xinjiang. No Central Asian leaders joined China in publicly denouncing a United Nations report that found China may have committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, though Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan referred generally to backing China’s stance on the region. “Central Asian countries don’t want to deal with this, they would really like to stay out of this,” said Niva Yau, a senior researcher at the OSCE Academy, a research center and graduate school in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. In that respect, she said, “China failed a bit on this trip.” Li You contributed research.",22
2022-09-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/17/opinion/queen-elizabeth-putin-legitimacy.html,Opinion | The Quality That Sustained Queen Elizabeth Is Hobbling Putin,"Why is Vladimir Putin failing to win his war in Ukraine? The answers multiply: hubris, corruption and incompetence on the Russian side; military valor, canny leadership and American munitions on the Ukrainian side. But the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the wave of antique pageantry help illuminate one of the Russian president’s important weaknesses. He has been hobbled in his fight because his regime lacks the mystical quality we call legitimacy. Legitimacy is not the same thing as power. It’s what enables power to be exercised effectively amid trials and transitions, setbacks and successions. It’s what grounds political authority even when that authority isn’t delivering prosperity and peace. It’s what rulers reach for when they call their societies to sacrifice. In most of the world today there are only two solid foundations for legitimacy: the demos and the nation, democracy and national self-determination. The legitimacy that once attached to imperial rule has washed away, and likewise, outside of the Middle East and a few other places here and there, the legitimacy of hereditary monarchy. Alternative claims to legitimacy exist — the ideological authority invoked by the Beijing Politburo, the religious authority invoked by the mullahs in Tehran — but those claimants rely more on repression for power and survival. The Elizabethan pageantry emphasizes this global reality because the House of Windsor is an exception that proves the rule. Like almost no other institution in the West outside the Vatican, the British monarchy has retained a pre-modern, pre-democratic legitimacy; in the outpouring of secular grief there was still a sense that the queen was somehow God-ordained to sit on the throne. But the royal family has kept that legitimacy by giving up all but a fraction of its personal power; it has legitimacy and little else. In Moscow you have the contrast: personal political power, far greater than the power of King Charles III, that lacks deep legitimating structures. Putin is a pseudo-czar but not a real one, with no divine anointing or ancient oath. He claims some Russian-nationalist legitimacy, but his system is actually a polyglot imperium. He claims some democratic legitimacy by holding regular elections, but their results are neither fair nor free. So all he has to really justify his power is success. Which he has delivered for most of his career — a Russia richer and more stable than in the years before he took the presidency, and a series of successful foreign policy gambits. But now comes the test, the gambit that hasn’t delivered, the specter of defeat, and what does he have to fall back upon? Not the authority of a czar: He cannot mobilize the Russian people as feudal subjects, calling on them to treat imperial Russia’s grand projects as their own. Not the authority of a national leader in a struggle for self-determination: He is the invader; it’s Ukraine that’s fighting for a nation. And not the authority of a democratic leader: He cannot have his war policy vindicated in an election, as Abraham Lincoln did in 1864, because any election would be a masquerade. In recent years, as authoritarian leaders have gained ground around the world and democracy has decayed, there’s been a fear that these figures have a stronger hand to play than the dictators of the past, because their authoritarianism is gentler and subtler, and also wrapped in the legitimating structures of elections. But Putin’s predicament suggests that this subtler authoritarianism is weaker than its predecessors in a crisis. The 20th century’s totalitarian regimes often co-opted the rhetoric of democracy and nationalism, but at bottom they made their own unique (and dreadful) claims to legitimacy — the people’s republic, the rule of the master race. Putin, lacking any such foundation, cannot just be a proud imperialist or autocrat or revolutionary: He has to legitimize his ambitions in the frameworks of his Western enemies, with absurd results (Ukraine isn’t a real nation, Russia is liberating Ukraine from Nazis, the Russians are fighting for human rights). There are parallels to the internal politics of the United States, where movements tempted toward authoritarianism nevertheless legitimate themselves in the familiar language of democracy. Thus Donald Trump has to claim that the will of the people was thwarted in 2020, not that he had a right to autocratic rule. Likewise, the push from the left to cancel or de-platform, to steer public opinion via censorship, tends to be justified in the name of “safeguarding democracy.” This pattern doesn’t mean there aren’t authoritarian perils in our politics, any more than Putin’s legitimacy problems make his invasion any less destructive. But it helps to see our crises clearly if you recognize that they’re still happening inside the lines of late modernity — that as Elizabeth II is laid to rest, nothing like her radically un-democratic legitimacy seems ready for rebirth.

2022-09-18,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html,How Russian Trolls Helped Keep the Women’s March Out of Lock Step,"To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. Linda Sarsour awoke on Jan. 23, 2017, logged onto the internet, and felt sick. The weekend before, she had stood in Washington at the head of the Women’s March, a mobilization against President Donald J. Trump that surpassed all expectations. Crowds had begun forming before dawn, and by the time she climbed up onto the stage, they extended farther than the eye could see. More than four million people around the United States had taken part, experts later estimated, placing it among the largest single-day protests in the nation’s history. But then something shifted, seemingly overnight. What she saw on Twitter that Monday was a torrent of focused grievance that targeted her. In 15 years as an activist, largely advocating for the rights of Muslims, she had faced pushback, but this was of a different magnitude. A question began to form in her mind: Do they really hate me that much? That morning, there were things going on that Ms. Sarsour could not imagine. More than 4,000 miles away, organizations linked to the Russian government had assigned teams to the Women’s March. At desks in bland offices in St. Petersburg, using models derived from advertising and public relations, copywriters were testing out social media messages critical of the Women’s March movement, adopting the personas of fictional Americans. They posted as Black women critical of white feminism, conservative women who felt excluded, and men who mocked participants as hairy-legged whiners. But one message performed better with audiences than any other. It singled out an element of the Women’s March that might, at first, have seemed like a detail: Among its four co-chairs was Ms. Sarsour, a Palestinian American activist whose hijab marked her as an observant Muslim. Over the 18 months that followed, Russia’s troll factories and its military intelligence service put a sustained effort into discrediting the movement by circulating damning, often fabricated narratives around Ms. Sarsour, whose activism made her a lightning rod for Mr. Trump’s base and also for some of his most ardent opposition. One hundred and fifty-two different Russian accounts produced material about her. Public archives of Twitter accounts known to be Russian contain 2,642 tweets about Ms. Sarsour, many of which found large audiences, according to an analysis by Advance Democracy Inc., a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that conducts public-interest research and investigations. Many people know the story about how the Women’s March movement fractured, leaving lasting scars on the American left. A fragile coalition to begin with, it headed into crisis over its co-chairs’ association with Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, who is widely condemned for his antisemitic statements. When this surfaced, progressive groups distanced themselves from Ms. Sarsour and her fellow march co-chairs, Carmen Perez, Tamika Mallory and Bob Bland, and some called for them to step down. But there is also a story that has not been told, one that only emerged years later in academic research, of how Russia inserted itself into this moment. For more than a century, Russia and the Soviet Union sought to weaken their adversaries in the West by inflaming racial and ethnic tensions. In the 1960s, K.G.B. officers based in the United States paid agents to paint swastikas on synagogues and desecrate Jewish cemeteries. They forged racist letters, supposedly from white supremacists, to African diplomats. They did not invent these social divisions; America already had them. Ladislav Bittman, who worked for the secret police in Czechoslovakia before defecting to the United States, compared Soviet disinformation programs to an evil doctor who expertly diagnoses the patient’s vulnerabilities and exploits them, “prolongs his illness and speeds him to an early grave instead of curing him.” A decade ago, Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, oversaw a revival of these tactics, seeking to undermine democracies around the world from the shadows. Social media now provided an easy way to feed ideas into American discourse, something that, for half a century, the K.G.B. had struggled to do. And the Russian government secretly funneled more than $300 million to political parties in more than two dozen countries in an effort to sway their policies in Moscow’s favor since 2014, according to a U.S. intelligence review made public last week. What effect these intrusions had on American democracy is a question that will be with us for years. It may be unanswerable. Already, social media was amplifying Americans’ political impulses, leaving behind a trail of damaged communities. Already, trust in institutions was declining, and rage was flaring up in public life. These things would have been true without Russian interference. But to trace the Russian intrusions over the months that followed that first Women’s March is to witness a persistent effort to make all of them worse. In early 2017, the trolling operation was in its imperial phase, swelling with confidence. Accounts at the Internet Research Agency, an organization based in St. Petersburg and controlled by a Putin ally, had boasted of propelling Mr. Trump to victory. That year, the group’s budget nearly doubled, according to internal communications made public by U.S. prosecutors. More than a year would pass before social media platforms executed sweeping purges of Russian-backed sock-puppet accounts. For the trolls, it was a golden hour. Under these auspicious conditions, their goals shifted from electoral politics to something more general — the goal of deepening rifts in American society, said Alex Iftimie, a former federal prosecutor who worked on a 2018 case against an administrator at Project Lakhta, which oversaw the Internet Research Agency and other Russian trolling operations. “It wasn’t exclusively about Trump and Clinton anymore,” said Mr. Iftimie, now a partner at Morrison Foerster. “It was deeper and more sinister and more diffuse in its focus on exploiting divisions within society on any number of different levels.” There was a routine: Arriving for a shift, workers would scan news outlets on the ideological fringes, far left and far right, mining for extreme content that they could publish and amplify on the platforms, feeding extreme views into mainstream conversations. Artyom Baranov, who worked at one of Project Lakhta’s affiliates from 2018 to 2020, concluded that his co-workers were, for the most part, people who needed the money, indifferent to the themes they were asked to write on. “If they were assigned to write text about refrigerators, they would write about refrigerators, or, say, nails, they would write about nails,” said Mr. Baranov, one of a handful of former trolls who have spoken on the record about their activities. But instead of refrigerators and nails, it was “Putin, Putin, then Putin, and then about Navalny,” referring to Aleksei Navalny, the jailed opposition leader. The job was not to put forward arguments, but to prompt a visceral, emotional reaction, ideally one of “indignation,” said Mr. Baranov, a psychoanalyst by training, who was assigned to write posts on Russian politics. “The task is to make a kind of explosion, to cause controversy,” he said. When a post succeeded at enraging a reader, he said, a co-worker would sometimes remark, with satisfaction, Liberala razorvala. A liberal was torn apart. “It wasn’t on the level of discussing facts or giving new arguments,” he said. “It’s always a way of digging into dirty laundry.” Feminism was an obvious target, because it was viewed as a “Western agenda,” and hostile to the traditional values that Russia represented, said Mr. Baranov, who spoke about his work in hopes of warning the public to be more skeptical of material online. Already, for months, Russian accounts purporting to belong to Black women had been drilling down on racial rifts within American feminism: “White feminism seems to be the most stupid 2k16 trend” “Watch Muhammad Ali shut down a white feminist criticizing his arrogance” “Aint got time for your white feminist bullshit” “Why black feminists don’t owe Hillary Clinton their support” “A LIL LOUDER FOR THE WHITE FEMINISTS IN THE BACK” In January 2017, as the Women’s March drew nearer, they tested different approaches on different audiences, as they had during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. They posed as resentful trans women, poor women and anti-abortion women. They dismissed the marchers as pawns of the Jewish billionaire George Soros. And they derided the women who planned to participate, often in crudely sexual terms. In coordination, beginning on Jan. 19, 46 Russian accounts pumped out 459 original suggestions for #RenameMillionWomenMarch, a hashtag created by a right-wing podcaster from Indiana: The Why Doesn’t Anybody Love Me March The Strong Women Constantly Playing the Victim March The Lonely Cat Lady March The Cramp Camp The Bearded Women Convention Broken Broads Bloviating The Liberal Trail of Tears Coyote Ugly Bitchfest In the meantime, another, far more effective line of messaging was developing. As one of the four co-chairs of the Women’s March, Ms. Sarsour came with a track record — and with baggage. The daughter of a Palestinian American shopkeeper in Crown Heights, she had risen to prominence as a voice for the rights of Muslims after 9/11. In 2015, when she was 35, a New York Times profile anointed her — a “Brooklyn Homegirl in a Hijab” — as something rare, a potential Arab American candidate for elected office. In 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders featured her at a campaign event, a stamp of approval from one of the country’s most influential progressives. That troubled pro-Israel politicians in New York, who pointed to her support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which seeks to secure Palestinian rights by isolating Israel. Critics of the movement contend that it threatens Israel’s existence. Rory Lancman, then a city councilman from Queens, recalls his growing alarm as she began to appear regularly at events for left-wing causes unrelated to Israel, like fair wages, where, he felt, “her real agenda was trying to marry an anti-Israel agenda with different progressive causes.” The news that Ms. Sarsour was among the leaders of the Women’s March, said Mr. Lancman, a Democrat, struck him as “heartbreaking — that’s the word — that antisemitism is tolerated and rationalized in progressive spaces.” That was politics as usual, and Ms. Sarsour was accustomed to it: the long-running feud among Democrats over the implications of criticizing Israel. But 48 hours after the march, a shift of tone occurred online, with a surge of posts describing Ms. Sarsour as a radical jihadi who had infiltrated American feminism. Ms. Sarsour recalls this vividly, because she woke to a worried text message from a friend and glanced at Twitter to find that she was trending. Not all of this backlash was organic. That week, Russian amplifier accounts began circulating posts that focused on Ms. Sarsour, many of them inflammatory and based on falsehoods, claiming she was a radical Islamist, “a pro-ISIS Anti USA Jew Hating Muslim” who “was seen flashing the ISIS sign.” Some of these posts found a large audience. At 7 p.m. on Jan. 21, an Internet Research Agency account posing as @TEN_GOP, a fictional right-wing American from the South, tweeted that Ms. Sarsour favored imposing Shariah law in the United States, playing into a popular anti-Muslim conspiracy theory that Mr. Trump had helped to popularize on the campaign trail. This message took hold, racking up 1,686 replies, 8,046 retweets and 6,256 likes. An hour later, @PrisonPlanet, an influential right-wing account, posted a tweet on the same theme. The following day, nearly simultaneously, a small army of 1,157 right-wing accounts picked up the narrative, publishing 1,659 posts on the subject, according to an analysis conducted by the online analytics firm Graphika on behalf of The Times. Vladimir Barash, Graphika’s chief scientist, said the pattern of interference was “strategically similar” to troll activity targeting the vast anti-Putin protests of 2011 and 2012, with sock-puppet accounts “similarly trying to hijack the conversation, sometimes succeeding.” “There is some circumstantial evidence that they learned in a domestic context and then tried to replicate their success in a foreign context,” Dr. Barash said. Things were changing on the ground in New York. At the Arab American Association of New York, the nonprofit immigrant advocacy organization Ms. Sarsour ran in Bay Ridge, hate mail began to pour in — postcards, handwritten screeds on notebook paper, her photo printed out and defaced with red X’s. “This was an entirely new level, and it felt weird, because it was coming from all over the country,” said Kayla Santosuosso, then the nonprofit’s deputy director, who remembers bringing the mail to Ms. Sarsour in shoe boxes. Ms. Sarsour, worried that she had become “a liability,” stepped down from her position there that February. By the spring, the backlash against Ms. Sarsour had developed into a divisive political sideshow, one that easily drowned out the ideas behind the Women’s March. “It was like an avalanche,” she said. “Like I was swimming in it every day. It was like I never got out of it.” When she was invited to appear as a graduation speaker at the City University of New York’s graduate school of public health, the furor began weeks in advance. It caught the attention of the far-right polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos, who traveled to New York for a protest that attracted, as a Times reporter wrote, “a strange mix, including right-leaning Jews and Zionists, commentators like Pamela Geller, and some members of the alt-right.” “Linda Sarsour is a Shariah-loving, terrorist-embracing, Jew-hating, ticking time bomb of progressive horror,” Mr. Yiannopoulos told the crowd. Ms. Sarsour recalls the period leading up to the graduation speech as particularly stressful. As it approached, she had visions of a figure coming out of the shadows to kill her, “some poor, like, deranged person who was consumed by the dark corners of the internet, who would be fueled by hate.” Russian troll accounts were part of that clamor; beginning more than a month before her speech, a handful of amplifier accounts managed by Russia’s largest military intelligence agency, the G.R.U., circulated expressions of outrage at her being selected, often hashtagged #CancelSarsour. When Mr. Yiannopoulos spoke, @TEN_GOP tweeted the juiciest phrases — the “ticking time bomb of progressive horror” line — and racked up 3,954 retweets and 5,967 likes. Her graduation speech passed without incident. Then the trolls waited, it seems, for her to say or do something divisive. And that happened in early July, when, emboldened after her C.U.N.Y. appearance, she urged a Muslim audience outside Chicago to push back against unjust government policies, calling it “the best form of jihad.” In Islam, the word “jihad” can denote any virtuous struggle, but in the American political context it is inextricable from the concept of holy war. A more pragmatic politician might have avoided using it, but Ms. Sarsour was feeling like her old self. “That’s who I am in real life,” she said. “I’m from Brooklyn, and I’m Palestinian. It’s my personality.” To the Russian trolls, it was an opportunity. The following week, Russian accounts dramatically increased their volume of messaging about Ms. Sarsour, producing 184 posts on a single day, according to Advance Democracy Inc. Once again, the audience responded: When @TEN_GOP tweeted, “linda sarsour openly calls for muslims to wage jihad against trump, please look into this matter,” it received 6,222 retweets and 6,549 likes. The accounts sustained an intense focus on her through July, producing 894 posts over the next month and continuing into the autumn, the group found. And once again, the backlash spilled out from social media. Protesters camped outside the kosher barbecue restaurant where her brother, Mohammed, worked as a manager, demanding that he be fired. He left the job, and, eventually, New York. Her mother opened a package that arrived in the mail and screamed: It was a bizarre self-published book, titled “A Jihad Grows in Brooklyn,” that purported to be Ms. Sarsour’s autobiography and was illustrated with family photographs. “I mean, just imagine,” Ms. Sarsour said, “every day that you woke up, you were a monster.” It is maddeningly difficult to say with any certainty what effect Russian influence operations have had on the United States, because when they took hold they piggybacked on real social divisions. Once pumped into American discourse, the Russian trace vanishes, like water that has been added to a swimming pool. This creates a conundrum for disinformation specialists, many of whom say the impact of Russian interventions has been overblown. After the 2016 presidential election, blaming unwelcome outcomes on Russia became “the emotional way out,” said Thomas Rid, author of “Active Measures: The Secret History of Disinformation and Political Warfare.” “It’s playing a trick on you,” said Dr. Rid, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. “You become a useful idiot if you ignore effective info ops. But also if you talk it up by telling a story, if you make it more powerful than it is. It’s a trick.” The divisions within the Women’s March existed already. Internal disputes about identity and antisemitism had strained the group from its early days, when one of its organizers, Vanessa Wruble, who is Jewish, was pushed out after what she described as tense conversations with Ms. Perez and Ms. Mallory about the role of Jews in structural racism. Ms. Perez and Ms. Mallory have disputed that account. And discomfort with Ms. Sarsour had dampened enthusiasm among some Jewish progressives, said Rachel Timoner, the senior rabbi of Congregation Beth Elohim in Park Slope, Brooklyn. She recalled stepping up to defend Ms. Sarsour against “racist and Islamophobic” attacks, only to find, each time, that a new firestorm would arise, often resulting from something inflammatory and “ultimately indefensible” Ms. Sarsour had said. As the months wore on, Rabbi Timoner said, Jews began asking themselves whether they were being excluded from progressive movements. In 2018, a new internal crisis was triggered by Ms. Mallory’s attendance at Saviours’ Day, an annual gathering of the Nation of Islam led by Mr. Farrakhan. Ms. Mallory grew up in Harlem, where many viewed the Nation of Islam and its founder positively, as crusaders against urban violence. Pressured to disavow Mr. Farrakhan, she refused, though she said she did not share his antisemitic views. After her son’s father was murdered, she explained, “it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me.” “I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,” she said. After that, the fabric of the coalition tore, slowly and painfully. Ms. Sarsour and Ms. Perez stuck by Ms. Mallory, and before long, progressive groups began distancing themselves from all three. Under intense pressure to step down as the leaders, Ms. Sarsour, Ms. Perez, and a third co-chair, Bob Bland, did so in 2019, a move they say was long planned. Russian accounts boosted their output around Mr. Farrakhan and the Women’s March leaders that spring, posting 10 or 20 times a day, but there is no evidence that they were a primary driver of the conversation. Around this time, we largely lose our view into Russian messaging. In the summer of 2018, Twitter suspended 3,841 accounts traced to the Internet Research Agency, preserving 10 million of their tweets so they could be studied by researchers. A few months later, the platform suspended and preserved the work of 414 accounts produced by the G.R.U., the military intelligence agency. With that, a chorus of voices went silent — accounts that, for years, had helped shape American conversations about Black Lives Matter, the Mueller investigation and NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. The record of the messaging around the Women’s March breaks off there, too, frozen in time. Russia’s exploitation of Ms. Sarsour as a wedge figure should be understood as part of the history of the Women’s March, said Shireen Mitchell, a technology analyst who has studied Russian interference in Black online discourse. Russian campaigns, she said, were adept at seeding ideas that flowed into mainstream discourse, after which, as she put it, they could “just sit and wait.” “It’s the priming of all that, starting from the beginning,” said Ms. Mitchell, the founder of Stop Online Violence Against Women. “If those thousand tweets hit a division between the groups that matter, if they open and allow that division, it’s no longer a crack. It becomes a valley.” Others saw Russia’s role as marginal, tinkering around the edges of a necessary American discussion. “It’s a shame that Linda Sarsour damaged that movement by trying to inject into it noxious ideas that had no reason to be part of the Women’s March,” said Mr. Lancman, the former city councilman. “Unfortunately,” he added, Russians “seem very adept at exploiting these fissures.” Rabbi Timoner sounded sad, recalling all that had happened. The wounds that opened up between progressives that year have never quite healed, she said. “There is so much Jewish pain here,” she said. “Those Russian bots were poking at that pain.” The Women’s March continued under new leadership, but during the months of controversy, many women who had been galvanized by the first march drifted away. “I can’t remember all the negative stories, I just remember that there were so many of them,” said Jennifer Taylor-Skinner, a Seattle woman who, after the 2017 march, quit her job at Microsoft and founded “The Electorette,” a podcast geared toward progressive women. She hasn’t ever recaptured that feeling of unity. “Just thinking about it, I still feel a bit unmoored from any central movement,” she said. “There was a coalition possibly forming here that has been broken up.” Ms. Sarsour, 42, was back in her old office in Bay Ridge this past spring, five years after the first Women’s March, when she learned, from a reporter, that the Russian government had targeted her. She is seldom invited to national platforms these days, and when she is, protests often follow. Whatever buzz there was around her as a future political candidate has quieted. She knows how she is seen, as a polarizing figure. She has adjusted to this reality, and sees herself more as an activist, in the mold of Angela Davis. “I’m never going to get a real job,” at a major nonprofit or a corporation, she said. “That’s the kind of impact that these things have on our lives.” Data on Russian messaging around the Women’s March first appeared late last year in an academic journal, where Samantha R. Bradshaw, a disinformation expert at American University, reviewed state interference in feminist movements. She and her co-author, Amélie Henle, found a pattern of messaging by influential amplifier accounts that sought to demobilize civil society activism, by pumping up intersectional critiques of feminism and attacking organizers. Movements, Dr. Bradshaw argues, are fragile structures, often unprepared to weather well-resourced state-backed sabotage campaigns, especially when combined with algorithms that promote negative content. But healthy social movements are essential to democracies, she said. “We’re not going to have a robust public sphere if nobody wants to organize protests,” she said. Ms. Sarsour isn’t an academic, but she understood it well enough. “Lord have mercy,” she said, glancing over Dr. Bradshaw’s findings. Ms. Sarsour tried to get her head around it: All that time, the Russian government had been thinking about her. She had long had a sense of where her critics came from: the American right wing, and supporters of Israel. A foreign government — that was something that had never occurred to her. “To think that Russia is going to use me, it’s much more dangerous and sinister,” she said. “What does Russia get out of leveraging my identity, you know, to undermine movements that were anti-Trump in America — I guess —” she paused. “It’s just, wow.” Understanding what Russian trolls did would not change her position. Still, it helped her understand that time in her life, when she had been at the center of a storm. It wasn’t just her fellow countrymen hating her. It wasn’t just her allies disavowing her. That had happened. But it wasn’t the whole story. She placed a call to Ms. Mallory. “We weren’t crazy,” she said. Aaron Krolik and Milana Mazaeva contributed reporting.

2022-09-18,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/world/europe/pelosi-armenia-azerbaijan.html,"Pelosi, in Armenia, Condemns Azerbaijan Over Clashes","Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed strong support for Armenia on Sunday and condemned “illegal and deadly attacks by Azerbaijan” on its neighbor, openly taking sides in a dispute where American officials have been careful to mediate discreetly. “This was initiated by the Azeris,” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference during her visit to Armenia. “There has to be recognition of that.” Ms. Pelosi traveled to Armenia to meet with the country’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, after fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan erupted last week, resulting in the deaths of more than 180 people. Each side has accused the other of provoking the clashes, which broke out on Tuesday. They have been locked in an armed standoff over the Nagorno-Karabakh region for decades and fought a war over it in 2020 that left thousands dead. Azerbaijan took a further step in the latest fighting, however, attacking targets and entering Armenia’s internationally recognized borders for the first time, analysts said. Ms. Pelosi said that she wanted to convey “the strong and ongoing support of the United States” for Armenia but also called for a negotiated settlement. In a statement published on Sunday, Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs described Ms. Pelosi’s remarks as “groundless and unfair,” and “a serious blow to efforts to normalize relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.” The clashes were the biggest escalation in the conflict since a truce brokered in 2020 by Russia, a longtime protector of Armenia. Analysts said Azerbaijan might have been emboldened by the recent setbacks of Russia in Ukraine and in general by Russia’s focus on the war there. Azerbaijan has recently pushed Mr. Pashinyan to sign a peace deal that would recognize Azeri sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but closely allied to Armenia and claims independence. Mr. Pashinyan has said that he intends to agree to a deal. His opponents inside Armenia have described the idea as treasonous. The Armenian government said that it appealed to Russia to resolve the situation last week, and Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it had brokered a cease-fire within hours on Tuesday, and called on both sides to respect the 2020 agreements. Ms. Pelosi said that the recent attack “threatens prospects for a much needed peace agreement,” and that there could be no military solution to the conflict. Ms. Pelosi, the highest-ranking American official to visit Armenia since it became independent three decades ago, said the trip had been planned since before the “assault on the border of Armenia” took place. The congressional delegation she led to to the country was a “powerful symbol of the United States’ firm commitment to a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Armenia, and a stable and secure Caucasus region,” she wrote on Twitter before her trip. Representative Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, who was traveling with Ms. Pelosi, added his concern. “The United States is very concerned about Armenia’s security and we want to do whatever we can to be more supportive of Armenia’s security,” he said. Last year, President Biden described the mass killings of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire more than a century ago as genocide, a characterization that Turkey has long pushed against. Traveling into a zone of international tension is not a new experience for Ms. Pelosi. Her itinerary this summer included Kyiv, Ukraine, as well as a visit to Taiwan, to which China responded with days of large-scale military exercises. This time, Ms. Pelosi said the United States wanted to help and support Armenia in what she described as part of a global struggle between democracy and autocracy. “Territorial security and sovereignty of Armenia, the democracy of Armenia, is a value to us in America,” she said.",8
2022-09-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/19/opinion/letters/work-office-home.html,"Opinion | Burnout, Productivity and Other Tales of the Office","To the Editor: Re “‘Quiet Quitting’ Is Not the Solution to Burnout,” by Laura Vanderkam (Sunday Opinion, Sept. 18): Ms. Vanderkam misses another key alternative to “quiet quitting”: returning to the office. We’ve always had burnout, and returning to the office won’t solve that for everyone. But part of the burnout we’re feeling is a lack of stimulation. My job is fully remote, but I recently started at a co-working space to break up the monotony of working from home. Even my bike ride to and from work is the active, effortful break I need to engage more meaningfully in my work. I’m jealous of the people who have an office to return to, and managers who are encouraging them to come back in. It’s an opportunity that I’d certainly take. Abigail ConyersBoulder, Colo. To the Editor: “So You Wanted to Get Work Done at the Office?” (Business, Sept. 12) says office distractions are detrimental to productivity. That’s right, but working at home can be unproductive, too. After two years of isolation during the pandemic, I cannot overemphasize the disadvantages of working remotely. It creates a natural sense of isolation; what could have been a short talk becomes a long string of emails and misunderstandings. Collaboration in general becomes unnecessarily difficult. Working alone means it’s important to have a strong sense of self-regulation. Being away from a shared work space allows for an unrestricted number of breaks, resulting in less work time. After being in the same environment all day, it’s hard to not continue thinking about work and to draw a distinct line between work, family and personal downtime. Zichang (Amanda) WangHerndon, Va. To the Editor: Re “The Immortal Awfulness of Open Plan Workplaces,” by David Brooks (column, Sept. 9): I agree with Mr. Brooks that open-plan office spaces don’t work, although he talks mostly about productivity and the effects on employees’ mental health. My issue with the lack of privacy is that everyone can overhear your private calls. Many years ago, when I worked in such an office, my biggest complaint was that there was no place to call and have a confidential conversation with my doctor. There were no cellphones then, but I imagine that people have this same issue today. Many businesses can be reached only during office hours, and they may be businesses that you don’t want your co-worker to know about. Correcting billing mistakes, medical issues, calls from the school: These calls compound stress, knowing that people you work with now know your personal problems. If a company does insist on an open plan, it should at least offer some small rooms (not the conference room) where people can make and take some private calls. Amy McCormacLos Angeles To the Editor: Office workers choosing to work at home, and David Brooks, are telling us that open-plan offices are not a one-size-fits-all solution to our office needs. Office productivity is notoriously difficult to measure. Research on office design is often based on small samples and not subject to easy replication. There is little research funding for this work. Models other than open-plan office are seldom studied. Strikingly, major furniture manufacturers have both directly and indirectly contributed to this research, often supporting their open-office systems. Office space is an investment. Ironically, open-office schemes fabled for crowding do not always use less space than private-office schemes. Evidence suggests that daylight, fresh air, views, quiet and privacy are key to supporting human well-being and performance. Christie Johnson CoffinBerkeley, Calif.The writer is an architect and an author. To the Editor: “Parties Agree on U.S. Crisis, but Not Cause” (news analysis, front page, Sept. 3) does a superb job detailing the divide between Americans regarding their perceptions of threats to the democratic system. Unfortunately, it also falls into the same trap as President Biden and many Democrats by broad-stroking Republicans as a party that wants to restrict democracy and “overturn voter preferences” while Democrats champion “majoritarian politics.” Left unsaid is that the United States is not a majoritarian democracy, but a constitutional republic, with built-in safeguards for less populous regions and minority interests. So when the Democratic Party supports eliminating the Electoral College, vitiating the Senate filibuster, nationalizing election laws and watering down the power of the Supreme Court, many Americans — including many staunch Trump opponents — equally see that as a threat to our longstanding system of government. Worse, they see it as an end-around simply meant to elect more Democrats. Ever since the founding of the Republic, political parties have fought over which parts of government should hold more sway: the ones focused on popular democracy, or those based on republican checks. Even in the current state of Trump-induced crisis, these competing passions contribute to a balance that makes American democracy unique and enduring. Stuart GottliebNew YorkThe writer, a former adviser and speechwriter in the U.S. Senate, teaches public policy at Columbia University. To the Editor: Haunting Russia’s dismal military performance in Ukraine is the legacy of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. With another war of choice having gone bad, from the grave Mikhail Gorbachev could tell Vladimir Putin a thing or two. At a Nov. 13, 1986, meeting of the Politburo, the Soviet leader told his comrades and generals: “We have been fighting in Afghanistan for six years already. If the approach is not changed, we will continue to fight for another 20 to 30 years. … What, are we going to fight endlessly, as testimony that our troops are not able to deal with the situation? We need to finish this process as soon as possible.” Bennett RambergLos AngelesThe writer was a foreign affairs officer in the State Department’s Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs in the George H.W.

To the Editor: Re “Free the Student Press,” by Margaret Renkl (Opinion guest essay, Sept. 8): Ms. Renkl’s tale of the travails of the Northwest High School student newspaper, The Viking Saga, in Grand Island, Neb., brought back old memories, and a solution: samizdat. When I was in the ninth grade, some of my friends and I decided that our junior high school needed a newspaper about the students, by the students and for the students. So we created one. I was the copy editor, the layout artist and the guy who typed up the mimeograph stencils. We arranged with another student who had access to his father’s mimeograph machine to print the newspaper for us. We provided the paper and the mimeograph stencils. He provided the ink. We peddled the paper for five cents a copy. At the end of the school year we took the accumulated profits and threw ourselves a big party at the city’s most prestigious ice creamery. But in the internet age, self-publishing is much easier. Those Grand Island student journalists should simply take matters into their own hands and publish their own paper, electronically.

2022-09-24,https://www.nytimes.com/article/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes.html,"The Fight Between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Explained","Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in New York this week for the first direct talks since more than 180 people were reported killed last week in fighting between the two countries. The flare-up subsided within days, but the high-level meeting reflects worries that the causes of the conflict — and the full-scale war that preceded it in 2020 — are nowhere near resolved. Those worries are aggravated by the underlying geopolitical tensions. Russia is a longtime protector of Armenia. Turkey, a NATO member, is a key ally for Azerbaijan, and backed it in the 2020 war. And although U.S. diplomats have sought to maintain a mediating role, Speaker Nancy Pelosi stepped into the middle of the fray last weekend, visiting Armenia to show support and declaring that the recent violence “was initiated by the Azeris.” The trip was widely seen as a political move by Ms. Pelosi ahead of the midterm elections in November. She was accompanied by Representatives Jackie Speier and Anna G. Eshoo, both Armenian Americans from her home state of California, where there is a large Armenian community. Here’s a guide to what happened in the most recent clashes, what lies behind them, and the potential stakes of the dispute. The mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh has long been at the heart of tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but with a majority ethnic Armenian population, it declared independence in the late Soviet period. A yearslong war between Armenia and Azerbaijan followed, killing tens of thousands of people and leaving hundreds of thousands displaced. It ended in a 1994 cease-fire that left Armenia in control of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts that were legally part of Azerbaijan. During the war in 2020, Azerbaijan — with powerful Turkish backing including attack drones — recaptured much of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding districts. The death toll was in the thousands, and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee. A cease-fire brokered by Russia left Azerbaijan holding most of the territory, with Armenian forces pulling back and heavily armed Russian peacekeepers moving in. Now, analysts say, Azerbaijan is pushing to have Armenia recognize Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh, and to make other concessions. Each side has a different story about how the fighting started last week. Armenia said that Azerbaijan attacked and that 105 of its service members were killed and six civilians wounded. Azerbaijan said its military actions were “retaliatory measures” in response to provocation from Armenia, and it reported 71 of its service members were killed. Although tensions between the two countries spring from who controls Nagorno-Karabakh, fighting this time took place directly between Armenia and Azerbaijan, where the border remains undemarcated. Other details about the latest conflict remain disputed. The United Nations said that heavy fighting involving artillery and drones had been reported along the international border between the two nations on Sept. 12. Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke of “an incident” on “the deemed border,” but Armenia said Azerbaijan had attacked three towns in Armenia itself: Jermuk, Goris and Kapan. Several analysts also pointed to fighting inside Armenia. “This was an Azerbaijani attack in Armenia proper,” said Thomas de Waal, a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe and the author of a book about Nagorno-Karabakh. The International Crisis Group, a research institute, said troops from Azerbaijan had entered Armenia. Several Biden administration officials declined to discuss the issue of whether Azerbaijani soldiers had entered Armenia, although the U.S. State Department spokesman, Ned Price, said early on that the United States had seen “significant evidence of Azerbaijani shelling inside Armenia and significant damage to Armenian infrastructure.” On Monday, Armenia’s foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan, said that forces from Azerbaijan were still inside Armenian territory and should withdraw. The exact location matters, not least because Armenia is part of a mutual defense alliance led by Russia which, like NATO’s founding treaty, declares an attack on one member to be an attack on all. Many analysts suggested that Azerbaijan had been seeking to capitalize on Moscow’s preoccupation with Ukraine after recent setbacks in the war there, and they noted a lack of military support for Armenia emanating from the Kremlin. One problem is that peace talks after the 2020 war have not yet yielded a resolution. Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, has said he intends to come to terms, but his domestic opponents have denounced the sort of deal that would be on the table as treasonous. He already faced angry protests after the 2020 cease-fire. Analysts said that Azerbaijan’s government had three demands: a renunciation by Armenia of its claims in Nagorno-Karabakh, the demarcation of the international border on its terms and security control of a yet-to-be-built road and rail corridor to Nakhchivan, an island of Azerbaijani territory inside Armenia. That would also connect Azerbaijan with Turkey. Paul Stronski, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, said that Azerbaijan’s military action amounted to probing that aimed to alter the facts on the ground where possible and to press Armenia to negotiate a treaty on its terms. Russia has laid claim to two roles in this dispute, brokering cease-fire deals while also guaranteeing Armenia’s security. The first role has so far helped it avoid the full potential costs of the second. Mr. Pashinyan spoke by phone with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia when fighting reignited last week, and the Kremlin brokered a rapid cease-fire, calling on the two sides to respect the 2020 agreement. But that initial cease-fire did not hold — leading the United States to use its influence with both sides to halt fighting. And Mr. Putin did not offer military aid. Moscow’s ability to project strength in the South Caucasus, for example by supplying arms or providing other military support to Armenia, is constrained by its war in Ukraine, according to Arkady Dubnov, a Russian expert on the country’s ties with former Soviet republics. But Moscow may also find its double role in the South Caucasus harder to maintain if the situation grows more dangerous. In 2020, Mr. Stronski said, the line between the two forces was in territory occupied by Armenia inside Azerbaijan. Now, “the Armenian and Azerbaijani militaries are pretty much facing each other on the still undemarcated state border between the two countries.” Turkey says it will stand by its ally Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan’s gains in 2020 reflected more extensive Turkish backing than in previous confrontations, part of a turn to a more assertive foreign policy by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. At the same time, Turkey’s economy is in crisis, and it has made overtures to Russia in the past over security, including the purchase of a missile system. Mr. Blinken this week urged the two sides to return to negotiations and prevent further hostilities. This is in line with the stance of the Minsk Group of states, the United States, Russia and France, which have been cautious in assigning blame, according to Mr. Stronski. More broadly, Washington has long sought influence in the South Caucasus and other states in the former Soviet empire. The European Union, meanwhile, has redoubled efforts for a peace deal since the 2020 war: The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan held peace talks in Brussels in late August under the auspices of a top E.U. official, Charles Michel. But Europe’s position is now complicated by its search for additional natural gas supplies to make up for the loss of Russian imports given the war in Ukraine. In mid-July, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, visited Azerbaijan to sign an agreement with Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev. During the visit, she said Azerbaijan was a “reliable, trustworthy” partner. Reporting was contributed by Cora Engelbrecht, Carlotta Gall, Anton Troianovski, Michael Crowley and Andrew E. Kramer.",8
2022-09-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/us/politics/italy-election-biden.html,Italy’s Hard-Right Lurch Raises New Concerns in Washington,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration publicly reacted with calm on Monday to Italy’s election of a far-right governing coalition, pledging to work with the country’s incoming leaders despite concern about their party’s fascist roots. But the latest rightward lurch of a European country — two weeks after a far-right party performed startlingly well in Sweden’s elections — is raising concerns in Washington about the continent’s combustible populism and what it could mean for some of President Biden’s foreign policy goals, including confronting Russia and defending democracy against authoritarianism. It has also underscored divisions within the United States, as members of the Trump wing of the Republican Party embraced the rise of a nationalist whose party has roots in Mussolini-era fascism. In the near term, the political success of Giorgia Meloni and her nationalist Brothers of Italy party, which leaves her poised to become the country’s next prime minister, is unlikely to rupture relations between Washington and Rome. Nor should it hobble the U.S.-led effort to unify Europe in defense of Ukraine against Russian conquest. Although Ms. Meloni has espoused radical nationalist views, and key members of her coalition openly oppose the European Union and call for friendlier relations with Moscow, as a candidate she expressed support for NATO and the defense of Ukraine. Writing on Twitter on Monday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken set a tone of comity, saying that the Biden administration was “eager to work with Italy’s government on our shared goals: supporting a free and independent Ukraine, respecting human rights, and building a sustainable economic future.” “Italy is a vital ally, strong democracy, and valued partner,” he added. Mr. Blinken’s comments appeared to reflect an initial belief that officials in the Biden administration can do strategic business with Ms. Meloni, even if many of her core values, including skepticism of gay rights and “gender ideology,” clash with their own. The Biden administration also understands that even an anti-establishment firebrand like Ms. Meloni will need financial support from the European Union to survive in office — a tall order if she wages political fights with Washington and Brussels. And with Italian public opinion slanted against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, Ms. Meloni would be hard-pressed to soften Italy’s line toward Moscow or seek to block the E.U.’s consensus-based support for Kyiv, analysts said. “From a foreign policy perspective, I do not expect a U-turn,” said Giovanna De Maio, a visiting fellow at George Washington University who studies trans-Atlantic relations. “It will be a moderate approach, at least for now,” she added. In an unsettling sign for the administration and centrist European leaders alike, however, several prominent Republicans hailed Ms. Meloni’s showing — a reminder of the growing kinship between European nationalists and the Trump wing of the Republican Party, who share a general philosophy of traditional social values, support for restricted immigration and deep skepticism of multilateral institutions. “This month, Sweden voted for a right-wing government,” Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, wrote on Twitter. “Now, Italy voted for a strong right-wing government. The entire world is beginning to understand that the Woke Left does nothing but destroy. Nov 8 is coming soon & the USA will fix our House and Senate! Let freedom reign!” Mike Pompeo, President Donald J. Trump’s secretary of state, who is of Italian heritage, also tweeted his congratulations. “Italy deserves and needs strong conservative leadership,” he wrote. “Buona Fortuna!” After Mr. Trump derided the European Union and clashed with longtime U.S. allies like Germany and France over foreign policy, Mr. Biden has worked to restore relations between America and Europe. That effort was accelerated by Russia’s invasion of Europe. But the shock wave from Italy is a reminder of Europe’s volatile politics and the threat they pose to the established, U.S.-backed order. The ascent of Ms. Meloni’s coalition also deals a blow to a central theme of Mr. Biden’s presidency: the effort to defend democracy and reject authoritarianism abroad. Europe’s right-wing parties have shown authoritarian tendencies in power, with conservatives in nations like Poland and Hungary cracking down on press freedom, an independent judiciary and other checks on central power. Europe’s far right may see greater opportunity in the months ahead, analysts said, as the continent stumbles toward winter amid soaring energy prices and other forms of inflation that many economists predict will produce a recession. Mr. Blinken and other administration officials have warned that winter will test Europe’s resolve on Ukraine, as analysts worry that economic pain could shift public anger away from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and toward the continent’s establishment leaders. “In the coming months, our unity and sovereignty will be tested with pressure on energy supplies and the soaring cost of living, caused by Russia’s war,” Mr. Blinken warned during a stop in Brussels this month. Daniel Baer, the director of the Europe program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that if economic conditions grew much worse, they could “drive populist strains on established democracies the way the 2008 financial crisis did.” Mr. Biden has worked with a set of strongly pro-American, internationalist leaders in Europe’s major capitals. France and Germany, along with Britain, have largely been in sync with Mr. Biden’s agenda. Italy was governed for nearly all of the Biden presidency by Prime Minister Mario Draghi, an economist who prioritized Italy’s international integration. Mr. Draghi’s resignation this summer triggered Sunday’s election. Mr. Baer noted that hard-right candidates had fizzled in two major elections over the past year. In April, the centrist French president, Emmanuel Macron, defeated his nationalist challenger, Marine Le Pen, and the moderate Olaf Scholz emerged from Germany’s elections last fall. Since then, the far-right Sweden Democrats won the second-largest share of the country’s vote, Ms. Meloni is poised to lead Italy once a government is formed there and Spain’s Vox party continues to gather momentum. “The sighs of relief that a lot of people breathed when Scholz was elected and Le Pen lost — was that premature?” Mr. Baer asked.",4
2022-09-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/opinion/iran-protest-russia.html,Opinion | Bring On the Women’s Revolutions,"Wouldn’t it be fitting if the regimes in Moscow and Tehran — the first defined by a cult of its leader’s machismo, the second by its systemic misogyny — were brought down by protests inspired and led by women? The possibility is no longer remote. The protests that have unfolded throughout Iran since the cruel death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini — accused of violating Iran’s hijab rule, arrested by the morality police and almost certainly beaten into a coma in detention — are the most serious since the Green Revolution of 2009 after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s fraudulent re-election. But this time may be different. Then, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was vigorous and in full control of the system. Now, there are reports that he is gravely ill. Then, Iran exported roughly 2.3 million barrels of oil a day. Now, thanks in part to sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, it exports about 800,000. Then, the protests were mainly about politics, which were centered in Tehran. Now, they are about human rights, and there is a potent ethnic component: In Iran’s Kurdish region, from which Amini hailed, the city of Oshnavieh was briefly seized by protesters over the weekend. Then, the regime’s militia and security services seemed to easily overpower the protests. Now, Iran’s chief justice, Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, has been caught on video complaining that his officers are overwhelmed and “have not slept.” But the biggest factor is the female factor. “In 1979, when women were demonstrating against the threat of hijab, they were alone,” the writer Roya Hakakian, who lived through the Iranian revolution as a teenager, told me on Monday. “Now the tide has dramatically changed. Men recognize women’s leadership and are at their side. It’s clear that these demonstrators have forged a collective identity that is contrary to the identity of the regime. They counter the regime’s misogyny with unprecedented egalitarianism.” Running a dictatorship is a delicate art. Those who try to govern with too light a touch — leaving ordinary people more or less alone except where politics are concerned — run the risk of letting a taste for freedom gain too much ground. But those who try to interpose the regime in the most personal aspects of people’s lives, including the choice of what to wear, run different kinds of risks. They require the state to monitor the behavior of everyone, not just a few. They vastly enlarge the circle of people with personal reasons to hate the system. And they furnish them with the simplest instruments of revolution. If every woman in Iran must don hijab, every woman has the means of starting a revolution. For years, Vladimir Putin knew better than to fall into this trap: His weapon was the scalpel, not the sledgehammer, and his bargain with the Russian people was that they would be left alone if they left politics alone. As for the would-be troublemakers, in 2007 the Russian human-rights lawyer Karinna Moskalenko explained Putin’s method to me. “It isn’t necessary to put all the businessmen in jail,” she said. “It is necessary to jail the richest, the most independent, the most well connected. It isn’t necessary to kill all the journalists. Just kill the most outstanding, the bravest, and the others will get the message.” A vague scent of fear, not an omnipresent system of compulsion, is what gave Putin’s regime its staying power. Overnight, this has changed. The “partial mobilization” Putin ordered to fill his army’s decimated ranks is the essence of compulsion. To judge from images coming out of Russia, military-age men are fleeing for the border, and women are taking to the streets. On Sunday, an item in Sky News reported “more women than men at the protest in Moscow — one by one, they were thrown into police vans.” Putin has reasons to worry. The Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers of Russia, run at the time by Maria Kirbasova, helped put an end to Russia’s first disastrous war in Chechnya in the early 1990s. Before that, Russian mothers were instrumental in calling attention to the evils of dedovshchina — the routine and brutal abuse of young military conscripts — which also helped undermine the Soviet military effort in Afghanistan. Now, for every one of the 300,000 young men Putin seeks to turn into cannon fodder in his disastrous and illegal war, there are uncountable mothers, wives, sisters, daughters and girlfriends who have, in effect, been mobilized, too. They have a better chance of taking Moscow than the Russian Army will ever have of taking Kharkiv or Kyiv. It’s good that the Biden administration, which has done so well in standing up to Putin, has now thrown its weight behind Iran’s protests, including by trying to keep Iranians connected to the internet via Elon Musk’s Starlink boxes. It can do even better by withdrawing from the nuclear talks, on the principle that a regime that will not give relief to women deserves no relief from sanctions. The West has had a women’s movement and a Women’s March. Now is the time for a Women’s Revolution in Iran and a Women’s Peace in Russia. The opportunities are ripe.

2022-09-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/world/foreign-correspondents-arts-music.html,"Our Correspondents on the Biggest Music, Shows and Books in Their Parts of the World","Our correspondents around the world cover breaking news, major investigations and the essential stories of their regions. But they’re not only reporters, they’re also residents of the countries they cover, whether Japan, Kenya, Iraq or Australia. Like residents everywhere, they keep an eye on and ear out for the breakout novels, blockbuster movies, hit TV shows and inescapable pop songs that people are discussing in their corners of the world. As summer ends, we asked our correspondents to share a little from their lives. Here are a few of the cultural works that resonated with them. “Everyone, and I mean everyone, has either read, is reading, or was at some point being shamed for not reading ‘The Sex Lives of African Women.’” said Abdi Latif Dahir, our East Africa correspondent. The book, which features 32 first-person accounts by African women, was born of a blog founded by Nana Darkoa Sekyiamah, the Ghanaian author of the book who also shares her own personal journey toward sexual freedom. Published in 2021, the book “has been explosive since it came out,” said Mr. Dahir, who wrote about the phenomenon. The frank conversations about sex, freedom and spirituality show no sign of slowing down: This spring, a staged reading of the book in a 200-seat Nairobi auditorium was completely sold out. One of the biggest Japanese cultural exports this past year was “Maria Beetle,” a novel by Kotaro Isaka that was adapted into the film “Bullet Train” — with its Japanese main characters recast as Brad Pitt and Sandra Bullock. Motoko Rich, our Tokyo bureau chief, profiled Mr. Isaka and his feelings about the novel’s transformation. (The original Japanese context, he said, didn’t much matter: “It’s not like I understand that much about Japan, either.”) The year’s other ascendant phenomenon, she noted, was Atarashii Gakko!, a dance and vocal group that made its international debut with 88rising, an American music company that represents many Asian-American acts. Consisting of four young women who dress in high school uniforms, Gakko! has garnered a sizable following on TikTok, Spotify and YouTube, with their hit song “Nainainai” streamed millions of times. “Married at First Sight,” a reality show that originated in Denmark years ago and has offshoots around the globe, including in the U.S., is an unlikely candidate to raise eyebrows in 2022. But when the Israeli version featured a same-sex couple this year, in the show’s fifth season, viewers in the country paid attention, said a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, Isabel Kershner. Same-sex weddings are not officially recognized in Israel, where the Orthodox state religious authorities have a monopoly on legal Jewish marriage. Until recently same-sex couples had to physically travel to another country to be married, then register the union after returning home. A legal case shifted that this year, when an Israeli court ruled that marriages performed through an online civil marriage service, based in Utah, would be sanctioned by the country. So the union between Guy Dalal and Matan Weiss, the couple on the show, spurred plenty of conversation — if little controversy, perhaps because the show tends to draw a liberal audience in Israel. Instead, much of the reaction, Ms. Kershner reported, was “of the ‘what took so long’ variety.” Before the death of Queen Elizabeth II, before the resignation of Boris Johnson — and perhaps as a much-needed distraction from daily crises — many Londoners were entranced this summer by the “Wagatha Christie” trial, said Megan Specia, a correspondent in London. An online feud that escalated into a libel trial, the scandal featured two women married to famous athletes: Coleen Rooney, the wife of the former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney, and Rebekah Vardy, who married Jamie Vardy, a striker for Leicester City. Ms. Rooney accused Ms. Vardy of selling information about her personal life to a tabloid, citing her own Instagram sleuthing as proof — thus earning the “Wagatha Christie” nickname, a cheeky mash-up of Agatha Christie, the mystery writer, and the acronym W.A.G., which refers to wives and girlfriends of prominent athletes. Ms. Vardy accused Ms. Rooney in High Court of defaming her; in July, a judge decided there was no libel. But the world hasn’t heard the last of Wagatha: Ms. Rooney just signed an agreement to help turn the trial into a documentary for Disney +. The actor Lee Jung-jae, who’s been famous in his native South Korea for nearly three decades, became well known to the rest of the world for his starring role in “Squid Game,” the Netflix hit that earned him an Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a drama. But it was his debut as a director with the film “Hunt” that became a surprise blockbuster in South Korea this summer, said Choe Sang-Hun, our bureau chief in Seoul. (The film premiered to acclaim in May at the Cannes festival.) A thriller set in the 1980s, “Hunt” follows two government agents trying to uncover an assassination plot, and has won praise for its deft examination of the complex relationship between South Korea and North Korea. North American audiences can expect the film later this year. When asked to identify Australia’s song of the summer, Damien Cave, our bureau chief in Sydney, reminded Northern Hemisphere colleagues of the obvious: “It’s winter here.” But he had an answer about a dominant musical act, saying it was the Kid Laroi, a teenage Australian rapper and “the hottest musical act Australia has produced in years.” For those seeking quieter distractions, he noted that a much-discussed novel this summer was “The Dictionary of Lost Words,” a debut by Pip Williams. The novel tells the story of words that were discarded or excluded from the original Oxford English Dictionary. It became the first Australian book to be chosen for Reese Witherspoon’s book club. “Stefania,” a soaring rock tribute by the Ukrainian band Kalush, was inspired by the lead singer’s mother. But after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the folk-hip-hop track was reinterpreted as a paean to the motherland, said Jane Arraf, our Baghdad bureau chief who helped report from the ground in Ukraine this year. Kalush performed their song at the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 in May, delivering a moral, musical victory for Ukraine. In the months since, “Stefania” has seemed ubiquitous in the streets of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. “It’s almost as if it’s disloyal to pay attention to just ordinary pop hits or hit TV series now,” said Ms. Arraf. In Egypt, the annual Ramadan TV season brings the debut of big-budget, highly anticipated shows. This year, the third season of “The Choice,” a popular political drama that blends fiction with facts and incorporates previously unseen footage of prominent figures, ignited controversy for its portrayal of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt’s president since 2014. “Everyone was abuzz about it and its political ramifications” said Vivian Yee, our Cairo bureau chief, noting that the Ministry of Defense is listed as a collaborator in the credits. In the show, Mr. el-Sisi is portrayed as a conquering hero over adversaries such as the Muslim Brotherhood — a depiction that critics of the show call overblown political propaganda. On the night that a particularly contentious episode aired, the president claimed in a speech that every word of the series was true. There’s a growing trend in Brazil’s artistic circles to elevate the work of self-taught artists from the country’s favelas, the densely packed poor neighborhoods in Brazil’s biggest cities. Perhaps no artist has earned more attention this year than Jota, said Jack Nicas, our Brazil bureau chief. The 21-year-old artist got his start painting on cardboard from discarded boxes; this year he was prominently featured in one of Brazil’s largest newspapers. The Times bureau chief for South Asia, Mujib Mashal, noted a book that made history this year: Geetanjali Shree’s “Tomb of Sand,” the first novel written in Hindi to win the International Booker Prize for Translated Fiction. (Several novels by Indian authors or authors of Indian descent have won the English-language Booker prize, including “Midnight’s Children” by Salman Rushdie.) Although winning an International Booker represents a watershed moment for Indian literature written in Hindi, “Tomb of Sand” has not been without its controversies. After a complaint was filed over the book’s portrayals of two Hindu deities, Ms. Shree canceled an event scheduled in her honor at a hotel in Agra, India. The death of the Iraqi poet Mudhafar al-Nowab, at the age of 88, brought his poetry of protest to the forefront in Iraq this summer, said Ms. Arraf, the Baghdad bureau chief. Mr. al-Nowab, who had been living in the United Arab Emirates, was a treasured voice among Iraqi dissidents, many of whom quoted his work when they took to the streets in anti-government protests three years ago. The poet had long lived in exile in many countries, including Syria and Egypt, before his death this year. He could be more acerbic than unfamiliar readers might expect. One poem includes the lines: “I pee on the governing police. It is the era of urine. I pee on the tables, the parliaments and ministers with no shame.”",29
2022-09-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/us/politics/senate-bill-ukraine-government-shutdown.html,Senate Passes Bill to Aid Ukraine and Avert Government Shutdown,"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday approved a temporary spending package to keep the government funded past a Friday deadline and send another significant round of emergency aid to Ukraine in its war against Russia, punting negotiations on a longer-term funding measure until after the November elections. The legislation, which would extend government funding through Dec. 16, passed 72 to 25. That sent it to the House, which was expected to quickly pass the measure, sending it to President Biden for his signature before funding was scheduled to lapse at midnight Sept. 30. In addition to continuing government spending for several weeks, the measure would provide about $12.3 billion in emergency aid for Ukraine as it fights to continue reclaiming territory from Russia. It sailed through the Senate with few objections, after Democrats removed an energy permitting measure by Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who had initially insisted upon its inclusion after being promised it would receive a vote in exchange for his support last month for the party’s major climate, health and tax package. The proposal, which would make it easier to build solar, wind, oil and gas infrastructure, had rankled members of both parties, and Mr. Manchin agreed to remove it on Tuesday, as it threatened to derail the spending package and prompt a government shutdown at the end of the week. “The last thing the American people need now is a pointless government shutdown,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said in a speech on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. “I’m optimistic we’re on track to avoiding one well before the funding deadline.” The tranche of aid for Ukraine comes after Congress has already approved about $54 billion in two previous packages. When it is enacted, the investment in Ukraine will be the highest amount of military aid the United States has committed to any country in a single year in nearly half a century, since the Vietnam War. It would provide $4.5 billion for a fund dedicated to supporting the Ukrainian government, and $3 billion for weapons, equipment and other military support. It also would provide $1.5 billion to replenish American weapons already sent to Ukraine, and $2.8 billion for the Defense Department. And it would allow Mr. Biden to authorize the transfer of up to $3.7 billion of American weapons and equipment to Ukraine. “Assisting Ukraine is not some feel-good, symbolic gesture — it’s literally an investment in our own national security and that of our allies,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, in a speech urging support for the package. Lawmakers also agreed to address some domestic needs, including ensuring the continuation of a “user fee” agreement that supplements a significant portion of the Food and Drug Administration’s budget. It also would allow more flexibility for the federal government to spend existing disaster relief funds and provide $20 million to help address the water crisis in Jackson, Miss., and $2 billion in grant funding for rebuilding efforts after natural disasters in 2021 and 2022. The administration’s announcement on Thursday morning that it would provide more federal assistance and expand a disaster declaration for western Alaska, where a powerful storm pummeled several communities, helped resolve a last-minute objection from that state’s delegation. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, Republicans of Alaska, had lobbied the administration for the expansion, particularly after a similar request was fulfilled for Puerto Rico. The measure also includes $1 billion for a program championed by Democrats to help lower-income families handle higher energy and heating costs in the coming winter. But party leaders, confronting Republican opposition, dropped other Democratic priorities from the package, including the Biden administration’s request for billions of dollars in emergency funds to combat the coronavirus pandemic and the spread of monkeypox across the country. Democrats have struggled to pass another round of pandemic aid money since it was abruptly dropped from a sprawling government funding package in March, as Republicans balked at the inclusion of any new federal money to address the coronavirus crisis. “I will keep fighting for these important resources,” Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Democrat and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, vowed in a statement, adding that he would continue to push for an annual omnibus package. “The federal government funds programs that the American people rely on, and we should do the job they sent us here to do,” he added. Passage of the stopgap spending bill was the final legislative deadline facing the Senate before its members scatter ahead of the midterm elections, and senators swiftly began departing Washington after casting their votes. But the action set up a daunting to-do list for after the November balloting. Senators will have to wrangle the dozen annual spending bills — and another round of earmarked projects for their states — before several senior lawmakers, including Mr. Leahy, retire at the end of the year. “I think both sides — at least the overwhelming majority of the Democrats and Republicans — would like to fund the government, do their job,” said Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, who is retiring. “There’s always some that say, ‘Let’s kick it to next year.’ I said that’s nonsense.” Mr. Manchin and other senators have pushed to revisit his plan to streamline the construction of energy infrastructure across the country in the coming weeks. Senators will also have to address the annual military policy bill, as well as ambitions to vote to codify same-sex marriage protections and strengthen the Electoral Count Act and the nation’s democratic systems in response to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.",1
2022-09-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/us/politics/congress-passes-stopgap-spending-bill.html,Congress Clears Stopgap Spending Bill With $12.3 Billion in Ukraine Aid,"WASHINGTON — Congress gave final approval on Friday to a short-term spending package to keep the government open through mid-December and President Biden signed it soon afterward, staving off a midnight shutdown and sending about $12.3 billion in military and economic aid to Ukraine. The House passed the measure less than 12 hours before funding was set to lapse. It will keep the government open through Dec. 16, giving lawmakers time to iron out their considerable differences over the dozen annual spending bills. The package included a third tranche of aid to Ukraine for its battle with Russia, on top of a total of about $54 billion approved earlier this year. With the vote on Friday, Congress has now committed more military aid to Ukraine than it has to any country in a single year since the Vietnam War, reflecting a remarkable bipartisan consensus in favor of pouring huge amounts of American resources into the fight as the nation seeks to reclaim more of its territory from Russia. Still, most House Republicans opposed the measure, which passed on a largely party-line vote of 230 to 201. Ten Republicans joined every present Democrat in voting for the legislation. Passage of the bill met the last legislative deadline facing Congress before the November midterm elections. Lawmakers, eager to return the campaign trail, vowed to address outstanding disputes in the annual legislation as part of an increasingly packed to-do list for when the House and Senate return in November. “The investments included in this bill are urgent and necessary to avoid disruptions to vital federal agencies, to help communities get back on their feet, to ensure we have the time needed to negotiate a final funding agreement that meets the needs of hardworking people,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. Republican leaders, however, counseled their conference to oppose the package. Though several Senate Republicans supported the package when it passed that chamber on Thursday, House Republicans argued that it did little to address their priorities, including providing a substantial increase for the military and shoring up resources at the southern border. Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee, chastised Democrats for a bill she said was being “rushed through the House today, with just hours to spare to avoid a government shutdown.” “It’s deeply unfortunate that we have once again waited to the last minute to fund the government,” said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. Mr. Cole, a longtime member of the appropriations panel, added, “We should not be in this situation — both sides have done this, I’ll grant my friend that — but this is a particularly egregious process.” But the desire to avoid a government shutdown and to help Ukraine was enough to rally the support needed to pass the measure. It will allocate $1.5 billion to replenish weapons and equipment previously sent to the country, while allowing Mr. Biden to authorize the transfer of up to $3.7 billion of American equipment and weapons. It will also provide $3 billion for equipment, weapons and military support, as well as $4.5 billion for the Ukrainian government to continue operating throughout the war. “This package comes at a critical moment,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, pointing to Ukraine’s recent success in reclaiming land that had been seized by Russia and commitments of support she and the Biden administration had made. “With this supplemental, we take another strong step toward honoring that pledge, our country’s pledge.” Lawmakers agreed to address some domestic needs, including $20 million to support recovery from the water crisis in Jackson, Miss., and $2 billion for a community block grant program designed to help relief efforts after natural disasters in 2021 and 2022. It also ensures the renewal of a five-year “user fee” agreement that the Food and Drug Administration relies on as part of its budget and sets aside $1 billion for a program that will help lower-income families with heating and energy costs in the coming months. The legislation also allows the federal government more flexibility to spend existing disaster relief funds in the coming weeks, even as lawmakers acknowledged that it was likely that a separate round of emergency aid would be needed in the coming weeks to address the devastation left by hurricanes in southwest Florida and Puerto Rico. “This short-term funding bill will keep the government open and meet a range of critical needs — from helping communities recover from extreme weather events, to supporting Ukraine, to helping fulfill our promises and commitments to Afghan allies and partners, and more,” said Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. She added, “We’re looking forward to working with Congress to get this done for the American people.” To ensure there would be enough Republican support for the measure to pass the Senate, however, Democrats agreed to remove billions of dollars in emergency funds to help address the coronavirus pandemic and the spread of monkeypox across the country. Republicans have refused to consider devoting additional emergency money on top of aid previously approved by Congress that has yet to be used. Democrats also dropped an energy infrastructure plan that had initially been included at the request of Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a conservative Democrat, as part of an agreement that won his vote last month for the party’s major climate, health and tax package. Dozens of House Democrats had called for the energy plan to be stripped out and considered separately, and senior lawmakers said they would reconsider it once Congress returned in mid-November.",1
2022-10-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/02/world/asia/worst-soccer-deaths.html,Indonesian Soccer Tragedy Is Latest in History of Stadium Disasters,"Soccer matches around the world have seen deadly stadium disasters, sometimes set off by crowd violence and often made worse by inept police responses that result in spectators being crushed as they try to flee. These deadly events have prompted major changes, like phasing out fenced-in terraces where crowds of fans can stand in favor of seating-only stadiums. But fatal tramplings still occur, with more than 125 killed in Indonesia on Saturday. Here are some of the worst past disasters. More than 300 people were killed and more than 500 injured in a riot in Lima, Peru, set off by a referee’s decision to nullify Peru’s equalizing goal in the final minutes of an Olympic qualifying match against Argentina. In that May 24, 1964, episode, some fans stormed the field of the Estadio Nacional, and others hurled objects at the police, who responded by throwing tear gas grenades, driving panicking crowds into locked exit corridors. Most of those killed were trampled to death in the tunnels, but an unknown number were shot by the police. The deadly crush at a match between a Moscow team and the visiting Dutch side on Oct. 20, 1982, was long wrapped in secrecy. Official reports mentioned only a handful of injuries, until it emerged in 1989 that at least 66 people had been killed, with one Soviet newspaper saying the death toll was as high as 340. The blame was first put on football hooligans, but Soviet news media later said the police had forced fans out through a single corridor at the Luzhniki Stadium, where they were crushed as others tried to rush back into the stadium after hearing news of a late goal from the Soviet side. Local authorities and some news outlets had long blamed drunk and unruly Liverpool supporters for the death of 97 soccer fans at a F.A. Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in Sheffield on April 15, 1989. That notion was rejected by a British inquest in 2016, which found that those killed in the Hillsborough Stadium had been the victims of mistakes by the police. It was a vindication that survivors had been seeking for decades. That disaster spurred safety reforms, including the removal of standing areas and fences around soccer fields. When fans of Kumasi Asante Kotoko began to throw objects onto the field as their team fell behind their chief rival, Hearts of Oak, on May 9, 2001, the police fired tear gas into the stands, setting off a chaotic race for the exits that killed 126 people. Joe Aggrey, the deputy sports minister of Ghana, told the BBC that he believed the use of tear gas caused the disaster, adding he saw groups of young dead men too numerous for him to count. “I’m devastated,” he said.",29
2022-10-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/world/europe/brittney-griner-appeal-hearing-russia.html,"Brittney Griner’s Appeal Hearing Set for Oct. 25, Russian Court Says","An appeal hearing for Brittney Griner, the W.N.B.A. star sentenced to nine years in prison for drug possession, has been set for Oct. 25, a Russian court said Monday. Ms. Griner, 31, was arrested in February after landing at a Moscow-area airport, where the Russian authorities say they found two vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. She was sentenced in August after entering a guilty plea. The imprisonment of Ms. Griner has posed a major challenge for the Biden administration, which is seeking to secure her release at a time of acrimonious relations with the Kremlin over the invasion of Ukraine, which the United States is supplying with billions of dollars in military aid. President Biden met last month with family members of Ms. Griner and Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine convicted by a court in Moscow of espionage charges. Mr. Biden spoke with Mr. Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth, and then with Ms. Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, and her agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, to discuss his “continuing commitment” to bringing both Americans home. In June, the Biden administration offered to release the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in exchange for the two Americans. Mr. Bout is serving a federal prison sentence for agreeing to sell weapons to a Colombian rebel group that had been designated by the United States as a terrorist organization, under the belief they would be used against American troops. While Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan remain in Russian custody, one of the largest mass releases of Americans detained abroad in recent memory took place over the weekend. Seven Americans who had been held in Venezuela for years were freed Saturday after Mr. Biden agreed to grant clemency to two nephews of Cilia Flores, Venezuela’s first lady, officials said. Ms. Flores’s relatives had been sentenced in 2017 to 18 years in prison for conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States. At the same time, Iran on Saturday released Siamak Namazi, a 51-year-old Iranian American businessman who had been jailed since 2015, on a temporary furlough and lifted the travel ban on his father, Baquer Namazi, an 85-year-old former official for the United Nations, according to the family’s lawyer.",7
2022-10-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/06/opinion/ukraine-liberal-nationalism.html,Opinion | The Triumph of the Ukrainian Idea,"The war in Ukraine is not only a military event; it’s an intellectual event. The Ukrainians are winning not only because of the superiority of their troops. They are winning because they are fighting for a superior idea — an idea that inspires Ukrainians to fight so doggedly, an idea that inspires people across the West to stand behind Ukraine and back it to the hilt. That idea is actually two ideas jammed together. The first is liberalism, which promotes democracy, individual dignity, a rule-based international order. The second idea is nationalism. Volodymyr Zelensky is a nationalist. He is fighting not just for democracy but also for Ukraine — Ukrainian culture, Ukrainian land, the Ukrainian people and tongue. The symbol of this war is the Ukrainian flag, a nationalist symbol. There are many people who assume that liberalism and nationalism are opposites. Liberalism, in their mind, is modern and progressive. It’s about freedom of choice, diversity and individual autonomy. Nationalism, meanwhile, is primordial, xenophobic, tribal, aggressive and exclusionary. Modern countries, by this thinking, should try to tamp down nationalist passions and embrace the universal brotherhood of all humankind. As John Lennon famously sang, “Imagine there’s no countries/ It isn’t hard to do/ Nothing to kill or die for/ And no religion too.” Those people are not all wrong. Nationalism has a lot of blood on its hands. But it has become clear that there are two kinds of nationalism: the illiberal nationalism of Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, and the liberal nationalism of Zelensky. The former nationalism is backward-looking, xenophobic and authoritarian. The latter nationalism is forward-looking, inclusive and builds a society around the rule of law, not the personal power of the maximum leader. It’s become clear that if it is to survive, liberalism needs to rest on a bed of this kind of nationalism. Nationalism provides people with a fervent sense of belonging. Countries don’t hold together because citizens make a cold assessment that it’s in their self-interest to do so. Countries are held together by shared loves for a particular way of life, a particular culture, a particular land. These loves have to be stirred in the heart before they can be analyzed by the brain. Nationalism provides people with a sense of meaning. Nationalists tell stories that stretch from a glorious, if broken, past forward to a golden future. Individuals live and die, but the nation goes on. People feel their life has significance because they contribute these eternal stories. “Freedom is hollow outside of a meaning-providing system,” Yael Tamir writes in her book “Why Nationalism.” Democracies need nationalism if they are to defend themselves against their foes. Democracies also need this kind of nationalism if they are to hold together. In his book “The Great Experiment,” Yascha Mounk celebrates the growing diversity enjoyed by many Western nations. But he argues they also need the centripetal force of “cultural patriotism,” to balance the centrifugal forces that this diversity ignites. Finally, democracies need this kind of nationalism to regenerate the nation. Liberal nationalists are not stuck with a single archaic national narrative. They are perpetually going back, reinterpreting the past, modernizing the story and reinventing the community. Over the past decades this kind of ardent nationalism has often been regarded as passé within the circles of the educated elites. I suspect there are many people in this country who are proud to wear the Ukrainian flag but wouldn’t be caught dead wearing an American flag because they fear it would mark them as reactionary, jingoistic, low class. The first problem with this posture is that it opened up a cultural divide between the educated class and the millions of Americans for whom patriotism is a central part of their identity. Second, by associating liberalism with the cosmopolitan global elite, it made liberalism seem like a system used to preserve the privileges of that elite. The populist class backlash combined with an anti-liberal backlash, imperiling democracies across the globe. Third, it opened the door for people like Trump to seize and hijack American patriotism. Liberal nationalism believes in what liberals believe, but it also believes that nations are moral communities and the borders that define them need to be secure. It believes that it’s sometimes OK to put Americans first — to adopt policies that give American workers an edge over workers elsewhere. It believes it’s important to celebrate diversity, but a country that doesn’t construct a shared moral culture will probably rip itself to shreds. American nationalism has characteristically been a liberal nationalism. From Alexander Hamilton to Walt Whitman to Theodore Roosevelt, it has often been a song in praise of a liberal revolution, a liberal constitution and a diverse, liberal society. Trumpian nationalism doesn’t flow from that traditional American nationalism but is a repudiation of it. Ukraine’s tenacity shows how powerful liberal nationalism can be in the face of an authoritarian threat. It shows how liberal nationalism can mobilize a society and inspire it to fantastic achievements. It shows what a renewed American liberal nationalism could do, if only the center and left could get over their squeamishness about patriotic ardor and would embrace and reinvent our national tradition. Yael Tamir makes the essential point: “Self-centered individualism must therefore be replaced with a more collectivist spirit that nationalism knows how to kindle.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-10-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/world/europe/ukrainians-crimea-bridge-memes.html,"‘Happy Birthday, Mr. President’: Ukrainians Celebrate Bridge Blast With Memes.","KYIV — Nearly every significant military gain for Ukrainian interests in the war with Russia has been met with jubilation from Ukrainians and their supporters, who flood social media with celebratory memes. The blast on Saturday morning that damaged the vital Kerch Strait Bridge that links the Crimean Peninsula to Russia was no exception. The bridge has both practical and symbolic resonance as it is not only a critical supply line for Russian forces in the country’s south but also a personal passion project for President Vladimir V. Putin. Within hours of the explosion, several government agencies in Ukraine had posted some sort of meme or joke on social media to celebrate it, to poke fun at Mr. Putin or to hint at who might have been behind it. Among them was Ukraine’s national rail service, which posted a photo on Twitter of the Kerch Strait Bridge’s rail line engulfed in flames. “No smoking onboard the trains!” the service tweeted, accompanying the message with a winking emoji. Dozens of photoshopped images depicted President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine grilling kebabs over the flames shooting from the bridge. Others reveled in the moment by positioning “Game of Thrones” characters alongside pictures of the damage or by suggesting that traditional Russian birch bark sandals could be used as flippers for swimming across the Kerch Strait. Ukraine’s postal service quickly came up with a mock stamp depicting the bridge in a scene from the movie “Titanic.” One Ukrainian bank — Monobank — offered a new image for their virtual mobile bank cards that showed the destroyed surface of the Crimean bridge and the burning train. By midday, it had been downloaded more than 300,000 times. Oleksiy Danilov, head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, posted footage of the destruction alongside a video of Marilyn Monroe singing, “Happy Birthday, Mr. President,” alluding to Mr. Putin’s birthday a day earlier. The post was liked and shared tens of thousands of times. The social media glee harked back to other pivotal moments since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February — including when the Moskva, the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, was destroyed. That ship had been a major target of Ukrainian ire after it bombarded Snake Island, a Ukrainian territory in the Black Sea, at the start of the war. When the Moskva was sunk, a popular joke among foes of the Kremlin was that the vessel had been turned into a submarine. Messages on social media have often provided a rallying point for Ukrainians since the Russian invasion, with tens of thousands of images pouring out on Telegram channels and in other forums. Memes have also been part of a major fund-raising effort for the Ukrainian side, reinforcing and commodifying the public image of a plucky nation that has managed to counter an invasion by a superpower.

2022-10-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/opinion/russia-iran-china-putin.html,"Opinion | From Moscow to Tehran, a Crisis of Illiberalism","The worldview behind Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine assumed the following premises: The West and America are declining, decaying and internally divided. The globalized world is becoming multipolar, with “civilization-states” re-emerging and competing to claim their spheres of influence. And Russia and China in particular represent potent alternatives to Western liberalism that stand ready to contend for global dominance. As badly as the war has gone for Putin, some of this analysis still holds up. The world has indeed responded to the Ukraine War along multipolar lines. Saudi Arabia’s snub of the Biden administration’s plea to pump more oil is just the latest example of how the anti-Russian coalition is essentially a Western coalition, with India, China and the Arab world playing more cynical and complicated parts. Meanwhile, the West’s unity, while obviously more impressive than Putin expected, is still a thin netting flung over deeper vulnerabilities. There has been no sustained post-Covid boomtime, no new era of good feelings. The populist wave is not receding; since the war in Ukraine began the European establishment has suffered political disappointments and defeats in Sweden and Hungary and Italy. Two of the governments most committed to the defense of Ukraine, Joe Biden’s administration and Britain’s Tory government, are well underwater in approval polls. Europe has only just begun to feel the cost of its naïve energy policies, and Western economies are caught between measures that feed inflation and solutions that might induce recession. So in key respects the world still looks as Putin imagined it more than seven months ago, with clear opportunities for a potent challenger to the liberal world order. But now we know something that he didn’t when he ordered the invasion: Russia isn’t that potent challenger, and its claims to represent an alternative to the liberal West have melted into Ukrainian mud. It’s not only Putin’s regime showing signs of illiberal meltdown. Beijing still looks much more powerful than Moscow, but China’s early-Covid successes have given way to an insane-seeming attempt to sustain a zero-Covid policy at whatever cost to prosperity, domestic tranquillity and global influence. At the same time Iran, whose Islamic Republic represents a different sort of rival to Western liberalism, is enduring a wave of protests that, even if they don’t topple the regime, are a reminder of just how miserably unpopular the Islamic Revolution is today. As the right-wing gadfly Richard Hanania, usually a critic of liberal pieties and American self-regard, acknowledged in a recent essay, 2022 has been pretty good for the well-worn, Francis Fukuyama argument that liberal democracy lacks plausible ideological competitors. Liberalism has enemies aplenty, sure, and relative to the origin point of Fukuyama’s “End of History” argument in 1989, the liberal order is showing clear signs of internal decay. But a desire for alternatives is not enough to bring them into being; instead, we’re seeing that a world system can weaken dramatically without its rivals being ready to supplant it. If Russia is the biggest, ugliest flop, China is the more interesting case. It was always clear that Putinism existed in an imitative, parodic relationship to the West — as a pseudo-democracy, not a true rival with a different source for its legitimacy. But China over the last few decades seemed to be creating something more stable and self-legitimating, a one-party meritocracy capable of managing peaceful transitions from one leader to another, resistant to cults of personality and able to steward rapid economic and technological progress. But the combination of Xi Jinping’s Mao-lite consolidation of personal power and his government’s conspicuous failures (on economic management and soft-power diplomacy, not just the zero-Covid blunders) suggests that China’s system is reverting to an authoritarian mean, that the idea of one-party meritocracy collapses back into banal dictatorship the moment you get a mediocre leader. Then the turmoil in the Islamic Republic is interesting in a different way. As Shadi Hamid noted in a provocative essay for First Things, the Muslim world’s various Islamist movements anticipated the more recent Western fascination with (and fear of) “post-liberal” politics — offering non-Western attempts to forge a political-cultural system that could claim to be secular liberalism’s successor, not just a throwback to the past. So their mixture of failure, defeat and, in the Iranian case, corruption and stagnation stand as a sustained caution to Western thinkers trying to imagine something after liberalism. These imaginings will continue because liberalism remains on a path to an unhappy destination — sterile, fragmented, stagnant, dystopian. All the optimistic chest-thumping about the Ukraine War inspiring a wider liberal revival has not altered that reality. But in Moscow, in Beijing, in Tehran, you can see other roads available, and all of them run quickly down into the dark. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-10-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/world/asia/russia-putin-soviet.html,A Distracted Russia Is Losing Its Grip on Its Old Soviet Sphere,"With the Kremlin distracted by its flagging war more than 1,500 miles away in Ukraine, Russia’s dominium over its old Soviet empire shows signs of unraveling. Moscow has lost its aura and its grip, creating a disorderly vacuum that previously obedient former Soviet satraps, as well as China, are moving to fill. On the mountain-flanked steppes of southwestern Kyrgyzstan, the result in just one remote village has been devastating: homes reduced to rubble, a burned-out school and a gut-wrenching stench emanating from the rotting carcasses of 24,000 dead chickens. All fell victim last month to the worst violence to hit the area since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union — a brief but bloody border conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, both members of a Russia-led military alliance dedicated to preserving peace but which did nothing to halt the mayhem. “Of course, they are distracted by Ukraine,” Kyrgyzstan’s president, Sadyr Japarov, lamented in an interview in Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital. Before President Vladimir V. Putin invaded Ukraine in February, Russia played an outsize role in the affairs of Central Asia and also the volatile Caucasus region, in what had passed for a far-flung Pax Russica. In January, it rushed troops to Kazakhstan to help the government there calm a wave of violent domestic unrest. In 2020, it sent around 2,000 armed “peacekeepers” to the Caucasus to enforce a Moscow-mediated truce between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Today, Armenia is fuming. Its prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, who has been a close ally, appealed to Moscow in vain last month for help to halt renewed attacks by Azerbaijan. Furious at Russia’s inaction, Armenia is now threatening to leave Moscow’s military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization. The Kazakh government that Mr. Putin helped prop up in January is veering far from the Kremlin’s script over Ukraine, and is looking to China for help in securing its own territory, parts of which are inhabited largely by ethnic Russians, and which Russian nationalists view as belonging to Russia. And here along the mountainous border between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, long-running quarrels between farmers over land, water and smuggled contraband escalated last month into a full-scale conflict involving tanks, helicopters and rockets, as the armies of the two countries fought each other to a standstill. The conflict, according to Kyrgyz officials, killed scores of civilians and drove more than 140,000 people from their homes. It also left many local residents and officials in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, asking why Moscow — long seen as an attentive guardian of stability on the combustible fringes of the former Soviet empire — had barely lifted a finger. “Russia could have stopped all this in a second. But it did nothing. Why did it let this happen?” asked Zaynaddin Dubanaev, a 75-year-old Russian-language teacher at the burned-out school in Ak-Sai, a Kyrgyz village next to a fenced-off patch of Tajik territory. Moscow’s security alliance has long been touted by Mr. Putin as Russia’s answer to NATO and an anchor of its role as the dominant (and often domineering) force across vast expanses of the former Soviet Union. But now the bloc is barely functioning. Five of its six members — Armenia, Belarus, Russia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan — have been involved in wars this year, while the sixth, Kazakhstan, has seen violent internal strife. In response, China is newly asserting itself, while the United States also sees an opening, pressing Kyrgyzstan to sign a new bilateral cooperation agreement. It would replace one scrapped in 2014 after Russian pressure forced the closing of an American air base outside Bishkek that had been set up to fuel warplanes flying over Afghanistan. “Until Ukraine, China and Russia were not interested in open competition in Central Asia,” said Asel Doolotkeldieva, a senior lecturer at the OSCE Academy in Bishkek, a center for postgraduate studies focused on security issues. “There was a tacit division of labor: security for Russia, economics for China. But Russia is not doing its job anymore. It has shown that it is unable, or unwilling, to protect the region.” Russia still has tremendous leverage in Central Asia. Its biggest foreign military base is in Tajikistan, and it has a small air base in Kyrgyzstan, a poor, remote country that remains heavily dependent on Russian energy supplies and remittances from more than a million Kyrgyz migrant workers in Russia. Mr. Japarov, the Kyrgyz president, aware of his country’s vulnerability, has stalled on signing the new agreement with the United States. Doing that would be perceived in Moscow as a “stab in the back and they would be right,” he said. “Russia is obviously focused on other things right now, not Central Asia, but the moment it wants to lay down the law, it just has to hint that it will make life difficult for migrant workers in Russia,” said Peter Leonard, Central Asia editor for Eurasianet, a media outlet that reports on the region. But the recent border war between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan unsettled longstanding assumptions about Russian power. It erupted just as Mr. Putin was in neighboring Uzbekistan for a summit meeting of a Chinese-sponsored regional grouping, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which was attended by President Xi Jinping of China, as well as leaders of India, Turkey, Azerbaijan and four Central Asian countries. Overshadowed by the Chinese leader, Mr. Putin endured a series of humiliating protocol snafus that left him waiting awkwardly in front of the cameras as other leaders, including Mr. Japarov of Kyrgyzstan, showed up late to meet him. “This was of course not deliberate,” Mr. Japarov said. “No slight was intended.” But widely circulated videos of an uncomfortable-looking Mr. Putin; a public rebuke from the prime minister of India, who stated that “today’s era is not of war”; and an acknowledgment from the Russian leader that China had “questions and concerns” over the war in Ukraine all reinforced an image of shrinking clout and diminished appeal. “Putin is no longer the great invincible leader that everyone wants to meet,” said Emil Dzhuraev, a researcher in Bishkek with Crossroads Central Asia, a research group. “He has lost his aura.” By contrast, Mr. Xi has become more assertive. On a visit to Kazakhstan last month, he pledged to “resolutely support Kazakhstan in the defense of its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” a remark widely interpreted as a warning to Moscow not to try anything. A few days later, after Tajik forces advanced, China issued a similar pledge with respect to Kyrgyzstan, horning in on Russia’s longstanding role as the guardian of Central Asian borders. China also delivered another affront during the summit meeting by signing an agreement with Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan that fixed the route of a proposed new railway line to get Chinese exports to Europe by land without going through Russia. The immense project, which is expected to cost more than $4 billion and still faces immense obstacles, had long been on hold, largely because China already had rail links to Europe through Kazakhstan and Russia, and did not want to risk Moscow’s wrath by building an alternative that would break its chokehold on land transport across Eurasia. Mr. Japarov, a nationalist politician who has often spoken of the need to strengthen his country’s sovereignty, said he had “not asked Russia for permission” to build the railway line “and had not been told not to.” He added, “Even if they tell me not to, we will, God willing, still build it.” Mr. Japarov complained that when the border fighting erupted with Tajikistan, Russia’s military alliance “did nothing at all,” adding that the Russians are “taking care of so many problems of their own.” Some officials in Bishkek wonder if Russia winked at the military action by Tajikistan, a tightly controlled dictatorship ruled by the same leader since 1994, even longer than Mr. Putin has been in control of the Kremlin. Kyrgyzstan, by contrast, is considered the only Central Asian country with a modicum of real democracy and a relatively free press. The view of Mr. Putin siding with Tajikistan — rather than being an unbiased umpire between two members of his military alliance — gained more ground this past week when the Kremlin declared that it was giving the veteran Tajik dictator, Emomali Rahmon, a prestigious state award for his contribution to “regional stability and security.” Kyrgyzstan’s foreign ministry said the award, announced by Moscow “while the blood of innocent victims has not yet cooled on Kyrgyz soil,” had caused “bewilderment.” In Batken, the southwestern region of Kyrgyzstan where the border fighting broke out, the rolling steppes, studded with rocky outcrops, sustain a jumble of rival ethnic groups — impoverished farmers and herders who, armed with farm implements, have for decades skirmished sporadically in what they called the “shovel wars.” But last month this fight quickly became a real war, with shells even landing in the regional capital, Batken city, scores of miles from the disputed border. Particularly gruesome is the scene in the village of Ak-Sai, where the cages of a large farm are now filled with thousands of chickens that apparently died from suffocation when their brick-and-mud coop was set on fire. The Kyrgyz owner of the business, who stayed behind to guard his chickens, according to local officials, was shot in his office by marauding Tajiks. Feathers and bullet casings litter the ground outside. “The perverse aspect of this is that both sides are members of the same military alliance of which Russia is in charge,” said Mr. Leonard, the Eurasianet editor. “The days when Russia dictated these countries’ military posture has clearly gone out the window.” The head of the district administration, Jorobaev Imamalievich, said he was dismayed. “Russia was silent. It is busy in Ukraine and is not paying attention,” he said. “It is just not here anymore.”",22
2022-10-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/09/world/europe/bill-richardson-brittney-griner-paul-whelan.html,Former Gov. Bill Richardson ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ About Griner’s Release,"Bill Richardson, the former New Mexico governor and ambassador to the United Nations, said on Sunday that he is “cautiously optimistic” that a deal will be reached to release Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, two Americans imprisoned in Russia. Mr. Richardson — who has been unofficially negotiating with Russian officials as a private citizen — told CNN’s “State of the Union” that a deal could be feasible by the end of the year, saying that Russia appeared to be willing to move forward on an agreement to exchange Ms. Griner, a W.N.B.A. all-star, and Mr. Whelan, a former Marine, for two Russian prisoners held by the United States. “I got the sense that the Russian officials that I met with, that I’ve known over the years, are ready to talk,” Mr. Richardson said. Ms. Griner, who was arrested just before Russia invaded Ukraine in February, was sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to a drug possession charge. Mr. Whelan was sentenced to 16 years on espionage charges in 2020. The White House has recently ramped up efforts to secure their release. Last month, President Biden and his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met with members of Mr. Whelan’s family and Ms. Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, and her agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas. But without much public progress in the negotiations, members of Ms. Griner’s family have also looked for help from Mr. Richardson, who has previously worked behind the scenes to secure the release of American prisoners from countries such as Iran, North Korea and Sudan. Mr. Richardson’s unofficial diplomacy has put him at odds with the Biden administration as relations between Washington and Moscow have deteriorated over Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. He has also drawn criticism from human rights advocates, who have said his trips — such as his meeting with members of Myanmar’s military junta last year — lend legitimacy to authoritarian governments and distract from the White House’s official efforts. On Sunday, CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Mr. Richardson to respond to comments last month from John Kirby, the former Pentagon press secretary, in which he implored Mr. Richardson and other private citizens not to negotiate on behalf of the U.S. government. “I respect that. I think any decision, for instance, release of prisoner exchange, has to be made by the president,” Mr. Richardson said. But he insisted that there was still value for him and other like-minded individuals to continue pushing for Ms. Griner’s release in private channels. “There are a lot of nervous Nellies in the government that think they can know it all, and that’s not the case,” he said. “Look at my track record over 30 years — I’m going to continue these efforts.”",7
2022-10-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/10/world/europe/india-china-russia-strikes-ukraine.html,India and China Call for De-Escalation After Russian Strikes,"NEW DELHI — India and China, two powers that have offered Russia some relief in the face of Western sanctions, expressed concern after the deadly missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday and renewed calls for de-escalation and dialogue. Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for China’s Foreign Ministry, told a press briefing that “all countries deserve respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity” and that “support should be given to all efforts that are conducive to peacefully resolving the crisis.” Arindam Bagchi, the spokesman for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, said New Delhi would offer support for efforts to calm the fighting. “India is deeply concerned at the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, including targeting of infrastructure and deaths of civilians,” Mr. Bagchi said. As the war in Ukraine has dragged on, President Vladimir V. Putin’s continued aggression has put his remaining allies in a difficult position. China and India have increasingly sought to distance themselves from the Russian leader, even as they have avoided directly condemning his invasion of Ukraine and continued to engage with Moscow economically — especially by purchasing more Russian oil as Europe has moved to reduce its imports. At a summit in Uzbekistan last month that was meant to be a show of force for Mr. Putin, the Russian leader acknowledged that President Xi Jinping of China had raised “questions and concerns” about the war. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was more public and direct, describing how the war has exacerbated challenges for developing countries. He told Mr. Putin at the summit that their meeting would be “a chance to discuss how we can move forward on the path of peace.”",22

As a corporate counsel, now retired, I always felt that my employer misrepresented the nature of its relationship with employees by urging them to share and bare their personal lives. The obvious differences between personal and employment relationships became lost, and personal problems became excuses for missing deadlines. Clear boundaries between one’s personal and work lives exist for good reasons and should be honored. Traci GoodwinBend, Ore. To the Editor: Well, on some level, sure — don’t bring your whole self to work. But often when you share an office, and work in a collaborative business as I do as an advertising copywriter, you develop a closeness with your immediate colleagues: art directors, producers, editors — the people you see often and who are mostly a few feet away. I’m retired now, but my closest friendships over my 44-year career have been with these people I worked intimately with daily. After 10 years of retirement, I am still close to a bunch of them. Opening up to some people whom you trust and care for is cathartic. It can inspire creativity and lead to lifelong friendships. Hy AbadyNew York To the Editor: It’s not simply about being able to “bring your whole self to work.” It’s about how organizational culture has been built by an ideology and way of being called whiteness. As a woman of color, specifically a Black Latina, I want my ways of being as a Latina to also have space in organizational culture. My cultural values of family and relationship-building and my devotion to service, for example, as well as my passion and intensity — I want to bring those qualities to the traditional white, cisgender, male-dominated workplace. Once again, we are not looking at this concept of bringing your whole self to work from the lens of those who have been traditionally marginalized. I challenge us to hold space, in an act of true inclusion, for others who have been sidelined.

It is hard enough to contend with diverse personalities, office politics and incompatible professional opinions — let alone an added avalanche of personal displays and disclosures that may not even be that welcome at home. I’ve been advising clients, colleagues and students to temper any tendencies to unload or unravel their private lives in the workplace, and keep a good part of that “whole self” safely reserved. I call it “edited authenticity”: yourself, but in judicious proportions. One hundred percent of anyone is … a lot. Raleigh MayerNew YorkThe writer is a professional development and leadership lecturer at Columbia University’s School of Engineering. To the Editor: In my career as a corporate culture strategist, I have found that what is needed is neither to bring your “whole self” to work, nor to bring only part of yourself, but rather to focus on a third alternative: your “future self.” The one you want to be. Focusing on our goals, both personal and professional, automatically elevates us out of the drama and banality of our current petty grievances. People become not only interested in their own growth, but in helping the growth of everyone around them. A natural byproduct of this focus is a high functioning team with better results.

Women have fought for decades to have a say in their own prerogatives. While protesting the assault on their rights, Iranian women and girls are fighting the misogynistic regime. As a student, and especially as a woman, I believe that this is a global movement. It is a change that must occur, a change that will ensure freedom and justice. Mahsa Amini’s death in police custody should serve as a wake-up call to every country and every woman. Everyone should have the freedom to dress, behave and live their lives as they see fit, without fear of being silenced or killed. Iranian women are launching a revolution.

2022-10-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/us/politics/biden-china-russia-national-security.html,"Biden’s National Security Strategy Focuses on China, Russia and Democracy at Home","President Biden declared on Wednesday that the overwhelming challenge for the United States in the coming years would be “outcompeting China and restraining Russia” while focusing on restoring a damaged democracy at home. In his 48-page national security strategy, which every new administration is required to issue, Mr. Biden made clear that over the long term he was more worried about China’s moves to “layer authoritarian governance with a revisionist foreign policy” than he was about a declining, battered Russia. More than six months after the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military appears less fearsome than it did when the first drafts of the document circulated in the White House in December. “Russia and the P.R.C. pose different challenges,” Mr. Biden wrote, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. “Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown.” China “is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to advance that objective,” the president wrote. Mr. Biden’s strategy is notable for its erasure of the distinctions between domestic and foreign policy; it argues that the source of U.S. strength will come from a reaffirmation of the nation’s democratic traditions. But it also comes as China is on the rise and seeking to rewrite the rules of commerce, surveillance and influence over other countries and Russia is seeking to redraw national boundaries. Allies and adversaries alike will examine the strategy for indications of Mr. Biden’s commitment to standing up to both opponents. The president took some unusual positions, especially for a Democrat. He urged a speedier modernization of the military, though critics say his budget does not reflect his ambitions. And he took a dark view of the benefits of globalization, describing at length how it has fueled pandemics and disinformation and contributed to supply chain shortages. And Mr. Biden returned to a theme he has established since his second month in office, describing a coming struggle as one of autocracies versus democracies. He said the United States must invest with allies and private industry as part of a Western effort to reduce dependence on adversaries. The strategy document was delayed last winter, as it became clear that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent and that the U.S. relationship with its European allies was about to undergo a tremendous test. The revised document celebrates a new coherence among NATO countries but also includes warnings to Moscow that were clearly inserted to reflect a new era of containment, the word used during the Cold War to restrain the biggest challenge at the time: Soviet expansionism. “The United States will not allow Russia, or any power, to achieve its objectives through using, or threatening to use, nuclear weapons,” the new document says. But the sentence stands alone, with no clarification of the meaning of “not allow” or discussion of the U.S. and NATO response if President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia chooses to use a tactical nuclear weapon to make up for the failures of his conventional force in Ukraine. Mr. Biden declined to go into detail about his options when pressed on CNN on Tuesday in an interview with Jake Tapper. For every administration, the national security strategy is a combination of guidance, a signaling of intent to allies and adversaries, and, often, a self-celebratory ode to American power. President George W. Bush’s strategy was known for its establishment of a “pre-emption” doctrine that contributed to his administration’s justification for the invasion of Iraq. Mr. Obama used his to call for a move to a world without nuclear weapons, but also for an expansion of American soft power to conquer disease and global poverty. President Donald J. Trump declared that the era of counterterrorism was being replaced by a revival of superpower competition against what he called “revisionist” powers, though he usually ignored his document’s declarations about the value of NATO and other alliances. Mr. Biden’s strategy document delves into the workings of American democracy, absent from previous strategies. “As Americans, we must all agree that the people’s verdict, as expressed in elections, must be respected and protected,” the document says. It then discusses moves against “domestic terrorism” and says “America will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections.” The opening sections of the strategy focus on domestic issues, led by the reinvigoration of key technologies and starting with the ability to produce the most advanced semiconductors. “We have broken down the dividing line between foreign policy and domestic policy to make far-reaching investments here at home in our industrial and innovation base,” Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, told reporters on Wednesday morning. Mr. Biden recently traveled to Ohio to help break ground on a new Intel facility and to an IBM site in upstate New York, celebrating investments made by the federal government through the newly passed CHIPS Act. But it will be years before those plants — and others built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung in the American Southwest — will be in production. Even then, they will account for a tiny fraction of the most advanced microelectronics that American industry consumes. Mr. Sullivan said the strategy was driven chiefly by a changed landscape, one the document describes bluntly: “The post-Cold War era is definitively over.” “We have entered a decisive decade with respect to two fundamental strategic challenges,” Mr. Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday. “The first is the competition between the major powers to shape the future of the international order,” he said, and the second to deal with transnational challenges such as “climate change, food insecurity, to communicable diseases, to terrorism, to the energy transition, to inflation.” The past few weeks have shown how difficult some of those will be. Mr. Biden was undercut by Saudi Arabia, which he visited over the summer, when the kingdom led a movement in OPEC last week to cut oil production after telling him it would increase it. The OPEC move contributes to inflation, and it also aids Russia’s effort to finance the war in Ukraine. Mr. Biden said on Tuesday that he would reconsider his relationship with the Saudis and make them pay a price. China’s cooperation on climate issues has slowed to a near halt; “strategic stability” talks with Russia on limiting nuclear arsenals have ended. “Russia now poses an immediate and persistent threat to international peace and stability,” the document says, a sharp departure from decades of strategies that discussed working to integrate Russia and the West. “This is not about a struggle between the West and Russia. It is about fundamental principles of the U.N. Charter, which Russia is a party to, particularly respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and the prohibition against acquiring territory through war.” Mr. Putin clearly sees it differently: He claims Ukraine was always part of Russia, back to the era of the czars, and has described this moment as driven by the West’s effort to contain and starve Russian power. But what leaps from the pages of Mr. Biden’s strategy, which was drafted by the National Security Council with input from around the administration, is a relentless focus on China. This was also the theme of a speech this week by Jeremy Fleming, the chief of Britain’s cyber and signals intelligence agency. Much of the military planning described in the administration’s document is meant to counter China in space, cyberspace and at sea. Each of those arenas requires very different arms, software and strategies than the push to contain Russia on the ground in Europe. The document describes a more aggressive U.S. effort to enhance cybersecurity and urges work with allies and the private sector to “withstand attempts to degrade our shared technology advances” by limiting Chinese and other investment in the United States and controlling exports of key technologies to China. Some critics of the strategy fear that it does not move fast enough. “China’s plans for Taiwan center around 2027,” Kori Schake, who directs foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said in an interview. “The budget does not envision modernization at that speed.” Ms. Schake wrote in a New York Times opinion essay last month that “the ships, troop numbers, planes and missile defenses in the Pacific are a poor match for China’s capability.” Mr. Sullivan pushed back on that critique, maintaining that Mr. Biden’s budget followed the strategic guidance that was first laid out in preliminary form in his first weeks in office. The new national security strategy paves the way for the Pentagon to publish in the coming weeks its national defense strategy and an associated document, called the nuclear posture review, which will describe Mr. Biden’s plans for the nuclear arsenal. Mr. Sullivan said that despite Russia’s recent threats, the documents would be “a step forward toward the reduction of the role of nuclear weapons in American strategy.” “We are not seeking to have competition tip over into confrontation or a new Cold War,” he insisted. But it is that last phrase that Chinese officials have often used to describe U.S. strategy.",4
2022-10-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-gas-russia.html,Opinion | Is It Time for the United States to Break Up With Saudi Arabia?,"This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Wednesdays. Saudi Arabia aroused Washington’s ire last week when it joined with Russia to raise oil prices by cutting production, undermining global efforts to restrict the oil revenue that Russia is using to fund its war in Ukraine. U.S.-Saudi relations have grown increasingly tense in recent years, and for many congressional Democrats, the production cut was merely the latest in a long list of unacceptable transgressions. “The Saudi royal family has never been a trustworthy ally of our nation,” said Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. “It’s time for our foreign policy to imagine a world without this alliance with these royal backstabbers.” After signaling Tuesday that he would work with Congress to “re-evaluate” the United States’ relationship with Saudi Arabia, President Biden warned that there would indeed be “consequences for what they’ve done with Russia.” Why has the U.S.-Saudi alliance endured for so long, and is it time for the two countries to put some distance between themselves? Here’s what people are saying. The U.S.-Saudi alliance dates back to 1933, when Standard Oil was granted rights by the freshly founded Saudi state to explore its eastern province. The company soon discovered some of the largest oil reserves in the world, and in 1943, Franklin Roosevelt declared that the defense of Saudi Arabia was “vital to the defense of the United States.” The exchange of oil for security guarantees became the basis of the U.S.-Saudi alliance even as it broadened along other dimensions later in the 20th century. Both countries developed an interest in constraining the ambitions of Iran after the Iranian revolution in 1979 and in opposing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that same year. Since the 1990s, the United States has been the world’s largest arms exporter, and Saudi Arabia is its single largest customer. This arrangement has always required a high tolerance for certain critical differences. Saudi Arabia is one of the last absolute monarchies in the world, and a fundamentalist theocratic one at that, with very few civil liberties to speak of. And until just a few years ago, the United States and Saudi Arabia disagreed on Israel’s right to exist in what was, during Roosevelt’s presidency, British-controlled Palestine. “This was always a high-risk business, and for a while the rewards seemed commensurate,” Joan Didion wrote in 2003 of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. “We got the oil for helping the Saudis, we got the moral credit for helping the Israelis, and, for helping both, we enjoyed the continuing business that accrued to an American defense industry significantly based on arming all sides.” But particularly since the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S.-Saudi alliance has come under intense scrutiny: As a candidate, Biden said that there was “very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia” and vowed to turn the country into a “pariah.” Once in office, he took a far more conciliatory approach, in part in an attempt to keep gas prices down. “If there is any lesson from Mr. Biden’s bitter experience,” The Times’s David E. Sanger and Ben Hubbard write, “it is that the days are gone when American presidents could request favors from their Saudi allies and expect them to be carried out merely for the good of the relationship.” Saudi Arabia’s official rationale for cutting production was nothing more than economic self-interest amid signs of a global downturn. But some analysts and U.S. politicians believe that it was an attempt to weaken the Democratic Party’s position just before the midterms in the hopes of installing a more Saudi-friendly government. This is the crown prince’s “October surprise,” said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. “This is his election interference.” Even in the absence of such ulterior motives, the United States would still invite charges of hypocrisy for being so cozy with the kingdom: “If we’re serious about strengthening democracy against authoritarianism, this would be a good moment to seriously reassess the United States’ longstanding relationship with one of the worst authoritarian governments in the world,” said Matt Duss, a foreign policy adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders. Perhaps the alliance’s utility to the United States was once worth its moral cost, but many contend that this is no longer the case. The notion that Saudi Arabia’s partnership is a “necessary evil” in countering Iran, for example, is difficult to square with Biden’s push to revive the Iran nuclear deal: Either the deal constrained Iran’s nuclear ambitions, in which case Saudi Arabia, which has long opposed the deal, is an obstacle to regional stability; or, as Kevin D. Williamson argued in National Review in July, the deal empowered Iran, in which case “the Biden administration is not really orchestrating a grand alliance against Iran.” “Biden’s focus is not on the Middle East but on gasoline prices in the United States, one of the most painful expressions of the destructive inflation that threatens the electoral prospects of Biden’s party in this winter’s midterm elections and beyond,” Williamson wrote. In the view of the Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman, the world’s dependence on Saudi and Russian oil proves the need for the United States to increase its own production so that it could offset their cutbacks; that it can’t right now is an indictment of the environmental progressives in Congress who have opposed new oil and gas projects. For climate hawks, though, the same predicament only underscores the urgency of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. “Until the United States truly makes democracy and climate change our overriding priorities, the U.S.-Saudi relationship may indeed be rooted in ‘shared interests,’’’ wrote Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to Barack Obama, in July. “That’s what has to change.” If Saudi Arabia seems more like a frenemy than an ally these days, the Bloomberg Opinion columnist David Fickling argues it’s because the kingdom recognizes just how vital it is to America’s global superpower status. If the United States withdrew its military presence in the region, as some Democrats have suggested, Fickling believes China would most likely step in to protect Saudi oil shipments from piracy. The United States would lose much of the military and economic leverage it has over China, which would leave East Asian countries more vulnerable to Chinese influence and eliminate an important deterrent to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. “The U.S. doesn’t want China deploying the energy weapon to obtain hegemony in East Asia via a Pax Sinica,” Fickling writes. “In the circumstances, stationing a few thousand troops in the Gulf to head off those scenarios is a small price for Washington to pay.” Saudi Arabia’s authoritarian government and human rights abuses obviously run counter to America’s professed values. But in the opinion of Yasmine Farouk, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the United States stands the best chance of improving the lot of Saudi citizens by engaging with the kingdom, not turning away from it. “Realpolitik policymakers like to wave away human rights as having any place in pragmatic policymaking, but there is an opportunity for Mr. Biden to make human rights part of a revamped strategy with Saudi Arabia that the kingdom could accept, even if not enthusiastically,” she wrote in The Times in July. But such a strategy, Farouk added, would also require the United States to apply a consistent standard to all of its relationships: “It is easy for Saudi leaders to dismiss Mr. Biden’s human rights rhetoric if the killing of the journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, which the State Department said was likely caused by gunfire from Israel Defense Forces positions, generates nothing like the official outrage over the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.” To Jason D. Greenblatt, a Middle East envoy in the Trump administration, Democrats’ outrage over the Saudi production cuts reveals a need to recalibrate their expectations for the alliance, which, in the end, is a transactional relationship between two autonomous powers. The United States does not put its allies’ interests ahead of its own, and “similarly, we should not make demands of other nations to put our interests ahead of theirs,” he writes. Saudi Arabia and its neighbors “are powerful, on the move and not vassal states of the United States.” Do you have a point of view we missed? Email us at debatable@nytimes.com.

2022-10-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/world/europe/brittney-griner-lawyer-russia.html,"Brittney Griner Is Struggling in Russian Prison, Her Lawyer Says","MOSCOW — Brittney Griner, the American basketball star facing nine years in prison in Russia, is increasingly anxious about her chances of being freed in a prisoner swap and struggling emotionally, one of her lawyers has said. “She has not been in as good condition as I could sometimes find her in,” the lawyer, Alexandr D. Boykov, said in a recent interview. Ms. Griner is allowed outside once a day, Mr. Boykov said, during which she walks for an hour in a small courtyard at a penal colony outside Moscow where she was detained after a Russian court convicted her on drug possession charges. Ms. Griner spends the rest of her time in a small cell with two cellmates, sitting and sleeping on a specially elongated bed to accommodate her 6-foot-9 frame, Mr. Boykov added. She is in her ninth month in detention, with a hearing about the appeal of her conviction scheduled for Oct. 25. She’s not optimistic. “She is not yet absolutely convinced that America will be able to take her home,” Mr. Boykov said, adding that he had spoken to Ms. Griner on Tuesday. “She is very worried about what the price of that will be, and she is afraid that she will have to serve the whole sentence here in Russia.” On Wednesday, President Biden said that there had been no movement with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, over Ms. Griner’s case. A day earlier, Mr. Biden told CNN that he would only talk to Mr. Putin at a Group of 20 meeting to be held in Bali, Indonesia, next month if it was to discuss her situation. Mr. Boykov said that the uncertainty over which type of prison Ms. Griner would end up in is a particular concern, as she fears it will be one with miserable or inhumane conditions. Ms. Griner, 31, was stopped in February at an airport near Moscow on her way to play for UMMC Yekaterinburg, a Russian professional women’s basketball team. Customs officials said that she had been carrying two vape cartridges with hashish oil in her luggage. In August, she was sentenced to nine years in prison after a trial that was all but assured to end in a conviction. The United States has said that her detention and trial were politically motivated and that the Kremlin wants to exchange her for high-profile Russian citizens held in the United States. Before the appeals court hearing, Mr. Boykov said that he hoped Ms. Griner’s nine-year sentence, which he called “an unprecedented punishment” for marijuana possession, would be reduced. “Perhaps the verdict will somehow be changed and, perhaps, the sentence will be reduced, because the decision taken by the first court is very different from judicial practice,” he said. “Considering all the circumstances, taking into account my client’s personality traits and her admission of guilt, such a verdict should be absolutely impossible.” While she waits, Mr. Boykov said, Ms. Griner struggles in large part because it is “very difficult” to speak to her relatives. “She suffers a lot without her family because she hasn’t seen them for so long and it’s very difficult to talk to them in any way,” Mr. Boykov said, adding that it had been very difficult to organize phone calls with Ms. Griner’s wife, Cherelle, and that she had been unable to speak to her parents or siblings since her detention, as far as he was aware. In an interview with “CBS Mornings” last week, Cherelle Griner said that she had been able to speak to her wife only twice since February, adding that the most recent conversation had been so disturbing that she cried for two or three days afterward. “It was the most disturbing phone call I’d ever experienced,” she told the interviewer, Gayle King, adding that her wife worried about being abandoned in Russia. Ekaterina Kalugina, a journalist, visited Ms. Griner in her cell in the springtime as part of a civil society team that monitors the conditions in Russian prisons. She said in a phone interview that Ms. Griner’s two cellmates at the time were women who spoke English and were also in prison on drug-related charges. She said that Ms. Griner had been reading a translation of Dostoyevsky’s novel “Demons,” a political tragedy considered one of the author’s most important works. Ms. Griner was also reading a biography of the rock band the Rolling Stones, Ms. Kalugina said, adding that she sometimes also played a game with her cellmates that is similar to the board game Battleship. Ms. Kalugina said that in Ms. Griner’s lockup, a pretrial detention center inside Correctional Colony No. 1, women were allowed to shower twice a week. She also said that, when they met, Ms. Griner had told her she was suffering from pain including headaches. Mr. Boykov said that the prison was dated and uncomfortable. “It’s an old building, and made of stone,” he noted. “When it is hot outside, it’s too hot, and when it’s cold outside, it is too cold.” Ms. Kalugina, who works for the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets, said that she was no longer able to visit Ms. Griner as part of the public oversight commission that is supposed to inspect and monitor prison conditions. After she visited in April, Ms. Kalugina said, she reported to the commission that Ms. Griner needed a longer bed and she was able to lodge a request with the authorities. Officials in Washington said that they had not given up on negotiations for Ms. Griner and other Americans that the U.S. authorities have designated as “wrongfully detained,” including Paul Whelan, who has been in a Russian prison for almost four years on espionage charges that the former U.S. ambassador to Moscow derided as “bogus.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the return of Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan had his “full attention” and that the State Department was “focused on it every single day.” “No. 1 on my list of priorities around the world is doing everything we can to bring home any American, anywhere, who’s being arbitrarily or unjustly detained,” Mr. Blinken told a news conference in Santiago, Chile, this month, urging Moscow to accept the “substantial proposal” Washington put on the table months ago. It was an oblique reference to a proposed swap of Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan for the convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, told reporters this month that the United States had not received a serious response to that offer. “We need to see a serious counteroffer,” she said. A White House official said last week that the administration was trying “every available channel” with Moscow, including the one through which U.S. officials arranged a prisoner swap in April to secure the release of Trevor Reed, a former Marine who had been serving a nine-year prison sentence in Russia. The official declined to provide details of that channel. But American officials have said that U.S. government efforts in that case were led by John Sullivan, the ambassador to Russia at the time, and by the team of Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. Bill Richardson, a former ambassador to the United Nations who runs a nongovernmental group that works to free American prisoners and hostages overseas, landed in Moscow the day before Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February to discuss Mr. Reed, who was released on April 27 after being detained in Russia for 985 days. Mr. Richardson, who has been unofficially negotiating with Russian officials as a private citizen, said on Sunday that he was “cautiously optimistic” that Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan would be released and suggested that they could be freed by the end of the year. “I got the sense that the Russian officials that I met with, that I’ve known over the years, are ready to talk,” Mr. Richardson told CNN’s “State of the Union.” Despite Mr. Richardson’s past successes in freeing Americans in places like North Korea and Myanmar, U.S. officials have publicly discouraged such private negotiations, saying that they are not helpful to their efforts. If Ms. Griner’s appeal is unsuccessful and she is not released, she could be sent back to the penal colony where she is currently detained, albeit to a different section, or to one of a number of prison camps for women where she may be expected to spend hours a day sewing or doing other forms of labor for meager compensation. Mr. Whelan, who was sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years, has spent most of his time sewing buttons at a prison camp in the Mordovia region of western Russia.

2022-10-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/world/middleeast/us-saudi-oil-production.html,Saudi Arabia and U.S. Trade Accusations Over Oil Cuts,"Saudi Arabia and the United States traded rare public accusations on Thursday over the kingdom’s decision last week along with other oil producers to cut output despite American objections, signaling a new low in a relationship increasingly frayed over how to respond to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. The Saudi Foreign Ministry answered a vow by President Biden to reassess relations over the oil cuts with an unusual statement on Thursday that accused the United States of distorting facts and said that the White House had asked for the cuts to be delayed by one month. That appeared to suggest that the White House was motivated, at least in part, by short-term political considerations rather than by purely trying to deprive President Vladimir V. Putin of the oil money needed to feed Russia’s war machine: A month’s delay would have diminished the chances that rising fuel prices would hurt Democrats in the midterm elections set for Nov. 8. The Saudis said that they had disregarded the U.S. request because they feared that such a delay “would have had negative economic consequences,” without explaining what they would be. The White House shot back later on Thursday with its own raft of accusations. “The Saudi Foreign Ministry can try to spin or deflect, but the facts are simple. The world is rallying behind Ukraine in combating Russian aggression,” said John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, making clear that in Washington’s view, the Saudis were undermining the efforts to isolate Russia, which also benefits from high oil prices. “We are re-evaluating our relationship with Saudi Arabia in light of these actions, and will continue to look for signs about where they stand in combating Russian aggression,” Mr. Kirby said. The exchange laid bare a new level of tensions between the partners over oil and the Ukraine war. Ties had already grown strained over the kingdom’s human rights record and Saudi worries about Washington’s commitment to the kingdom’s security and interest in reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran, the Saudis’ nemesis. For the United States, the Saudi move was portrayed as treachery, a deliberate strike by a longtime ally at American efforts to sap Mr. Putin’s war effort. The Saudis have defended their decision, saying it was based on economics, not politics, and that OPEC Plus decisions are reached by consensus among the members, not decided by Saudi Arabia alone. Saudi commentators have taken umbrage at the assumption by the United States that it can dictate the kingdom’s oil policy. Jim Krane, an energy research fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute, said he did not think the Saudis were seeking to help Mr. Putin, but that his interests overlapped with theirs when it came to oil. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, has announced multiple spending programs in the hundreds of billions of dollars aimed at diversifying his economy away from oil, launching new industries and building a futuristic new city in the desert. And for all of that, he will need the capital that high oil prices can bring, Mr. Krane said. He said that OPEC had previously prioritized price stability and maintaining long-term demand for oil. In recent years, the cartel appeared to be comfortable with prices between $60 and $80 per barrel. But last week, while the price was approaching $100 per barrel, they cut output instead of increasing it, to push up the price. “Stability is taking a back seat to politics and economic self-interest,” Mr. Krane said. The public feud began after OPEC Plus, an expansion of the original cartel to include Russia and other oil-producing countries, announced on Oct. 5 that it would cut output by 2 million barrels per day. The decision came despite efforts by White House officials to persuade Saudi Arabia to use its clout in the organization to keep output steady. The move was announced one day before the European Union adopted a sanctions package that was intended to cap the price of Russian oil, and it was widely seen as weakening the sanctions’ effectiveness. Mr. Biden warned that Saudi Arabia would face “consequences,” which he did not detail, and that he planned to re-evaluate the relationship. Some members of Congress went further, accusing the Saudis of siding with Mr. Putin, who also benefits from higher oil prices, and discussing legislation that would cut arms sales to Saudi Arabia or allow lawsuits against OPEC Plus members for price-fixing. The Saudi statement on Thursday voiced its “total rejection” of the idea that the decision on oil cuts had been politically motivated. It said “any attempts to distort the facts about the kingdom’s position regarding the crisis in Ukraine are unfortunate,” an apparent reference to the accusation that it was siding with Russia. It underscored this by referring to Saudi votes on United Nations resolutions related to the war. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states voted at the United Nations on Wednesday to condemn Russia’s annexation of four eastern Ukrainian territories, backing a resolution that demanded Moscow reverse course. On Thursday, the International Energy Agency portrayed the cuts as both bad for consumers because they increase energy prices and bad for producers because they undermine the long-term demand for oil. At a time of rampant inflation and interest rate increases in many countries, the agency said, “higher oil prices may prove the tipping point for a global economy already on the brink of recession.” Other United States partners in the Persian Gulf have continued to engage with Russia, despite American efforts to isolate Mr. Putin. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates, met with Mr. Putin in St. Petersburg on Tuesday. And the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, met with Mr. Putin at a regional summit meeting in Kazakhstan on Thursday. These countries, which maintain close ties to the United States, have resisted calls to boycott Russia, either because they have mutual economic interests or because they believe they can boost their international standing by serving as intermediaries between Russia and other countries. The United Arab Emirates is a member of OPEC, and its leader, Sheikh Mohammed, facilitated an agreement for Russia to release 215 Ukrainian fighters in exchange for a close friend of Mr. Putin’s and 54 other prisoners of war. A person familiar with the talks between Sheikh Tamim of Qatar and Mr. Putin on Thursday said that Qatar needed to maintain cordial relations with Russia for other diplomatic efforts, including coordination in Syria and as a go-between with Iran about negotiations over its nuclear program. But the Saudi pushback against American criticism highlighted the new, more independent course the kingdom has taken under Prince Mohammed. The opinion of the United States is not as important as it once was in Saudi decision-making, regional analysts said. “The effect of Saudi decision-making on U.S. national interests will be, at the most, one factor among many that the Saudi leadership will consider before drawing their conclusions and will not be determinative,” Gerald M. Feierstein, a distinguished fellow at the Middle East Institute, wrote in an analysis published on Thursday. Prince Mohammed did not seem to have considered that the oil cut might help Russia in Ukraine, Mr. Feirstein wrote, or perhaps he even saw it as “a positive factor as a gesture to Russian President Vladimir Putin.” Valerie Hopkins contributed reporting.",8
2022-10-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/world/europe/russia-iran-alliance-drones.html,Drones Embody an Iran-Russia Alliance Built on Hostility to the U.S.,"The Iranian-made drones that Russia sent on Monday to divebomb Ukraine’s capital delivered the most emphatic proof yet that Tehran has become a rare, increasingly close ally to the Kremlin, offering both weapons and international support that Russia sorely lacks. There is no deep love between Russia, newly a pariah for attacking another country, and Iran, for decades one of the most strategically isolated nations in the world. But the two authoritarian governments, both chafing under Western sanctions, share a view of the United States as their great enemy and a threat to their grip on power. “This is a partnership of convenience between two embattled dictatorships,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Both countries are deep in crisis, struggling economically and politically. Iran is attempting to quell street protests that pose the most serious challenge in years to the government, while Russia is trying to manage rising dissension over a faltering war effort and an unpopular draft. The emergence of a Moscow-Tehran alliance has multiple international implications, potentially dimming prospects for a new agreement to rein in Iran’s nuclear program and raising the pressure on Israel, Iran’s sworn enemy, to take Ukraine’s side in the war. The relationship between Russia and Iran has been developing for years. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia deployed his air force to Syria starting in 2015 to prevent the collapse of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, a longtime ally of Tehran. Russia and Iran worked in lock step militarily, with Russian warplanes providing cover for Iranian militiamen and Iranian proxy forces fighting on the ground. Syria was one example of the effort by both to find ways to sap American strength and prestige wherever they could in the world, and Ukraine provides a similar opportunity on an even larger, more visible scale. After its 1979 revolution, Iran formulated foreign policy around the slogan “Neither East nor West,” equally wary of the Soviet Union and the United States. Now, the Islamic Republic is choosing sides, analysts said, and images of Iran’s exploding drones accurately hitting their targets advertise it as a regional power to be taken seriously. In Tehran, the spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry denied on Monday that his country was selling weapons to Russia, even as social media outlets linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which developed the lumbering yet lethal drones, boasted about them. “There is no doubt that the drones used by Russia’s military are Iranian,” said a post on Sepah Cyberi, a Telegram channel affiliated with the Guards, while the country’s cyberarmy chief, Ali Akbar Raefipour, gloated on Twitter that Iran’s Shahed drone was now “the most talked about weapon in the world.” Iran does not want to highlight the weapons sales because Ukraine is generally more popular than Russia among ordinary Iranians, and the Islamic Republic casts itself as a defender of underdogs in world affairs, said Mahmoud Shoori, deputy director of the Institute of Iran and Eurasia Studies in Tehran and an expert on Iran-Russia relations. But at the same time, “Iran also wants to show the world that it has a military superpower as an ally and it has the capacity to sell weapons to such a power,” he said in a telephone interview. “It shows the West’s policies of maximum pressure to isolate Iran have not worked.” Aside from weapons, the two have found some common ground on energy, oil and gas. Russia has worked on Iran’s Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant for decades, but extensive delays and multibillion-dollar cost overruns have turned it into a sore point in relations. Russian forces have run low on precision-guided ballistic and cruise missiles, Western analysts say, and as a result, the war has reversed the usual pattern of major powers’ selling arms to smaller ones. Unable to buy weapons elsewhere — except, perhaps, from North Korea — Moscow has turned to Iran. The drones carry smaller payloads and are much slower than such missiles, making them far easier to shoot down. But they are also much cheaper, so Russia can launch them in bunches, overwhelming air defenses and allowing some to reach their targets. “They can be used by Russia to target electricity, fuel, et cetera, and to attempt to economically exhaust Ukraine over time,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at C.N.A., a defense research institute in Arlington, Va. Iran or its proxies have been accused of using drones for attacks on adversaries in its own region, like Saudi Arabia. For Iran, Russian use of its drones sends a message to its domestic audience, including those who have been protesting against restrictions on women’s rights and personal freedom for weeks. The government is trying to show Iranians that it is “not in a position of weakness, and has not been cowed by external pressure and threats,” said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director for the International Crisis Group, an independent research institute. The Washington Post reported on Sunday that Iran would also sell short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, weapons far more deadly than the drones. Analysts used to laugh off Iranian missiles as cheap knockoffs of Soviet or North Korean weapons, but no longer. In recent years, Iran has made “lots of advances and has really improved their targeting ability,” said Afshon Ostovar, an associate professor of Middle Eastern politics at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. It is not clear how Saudi Arabia, Iran’s primary regional adversary, will react to the Kremlin’s drawing closer to Tehran. The Saudi government and Moscow have joined forces recently in trying to raise oil prices, irking Washington and fueling inflation. In Israel on Sunday, a cabinet minister, Nachman Shai, said on social media that Iran’s military assistance to Russia removed “any doubt where Israel should stand in this bloody conflict. The time has come for Ukraine to receive military aid, as well, just as the U.S.A. and NATO countries provide.” The Israeli prime minister’s office declined to comment. Since the start of the war in February, Israel has not provided Ukraine with arms despite frequent Ukrainian requests for air-defense systems, and has been wary of criticizing Russia too strongly. Russia has given Israel a relatively free hand to strike Iranian targets in Syria, and the Israelis are also concerned about the Kremlin’s obstructing Jewish emigration. In a sign of brewing tensions, Dmitri A. Medvedev, a former president and now deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, warned on social media Monday against any “reckless” supply of Israeli military aid to Ukraine. “It will destroy all interstate relations between our countries,” wrote Mr. Medvedev. The deepening alliance between Russia and Iran “should be seen as a profound threat and something that any country should pay very close attention to,” said Vedant Patel, a deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department, at a Monday news briefing. “We’re in close touch with our allies and partners, including those in the United Nations, to address Iran’s dangerous proliferation of weapons to Russia.” The European Union is closely monitoring the use of drones, said Josep Borrell Fontelles, its foreign policy chief. The bloc had already been weighing further action against Iran for its violent crackdown against domestic dissent in recent weeks. Ukraine on Monday called for further sanctions. The drone sales provoked more questions about the prospects for a nuclear deal under which Western sanctions against Iran would be lifted in exchange for Tehran’s greatly reducing its capacity to enrich the uranium needed for nuclear weapons. President Donald J. Trump withdrew from the original 2015 pact, which included Russia and other world powers, and President Biden has been keen to negotiate a new one. The Russians are now seen as perhaps the least enthusiastic about the deal as it would return significant amounts of Iranian oil and gas to the international market, competing with Russia’s own sales and potentially driving down prices. Nor is it clear how willing Iran’s ruling mullahs would be to return to accepting limits on their nuclear program. Mr. Putin made a rare overseas trip last July in order to cement the alliance with Iran as a counterweight to being isolated from the West. Since then, the challenges facing both his and Iran’s governments have grown significantly. “In their view, the West is either irreconcilably hostile or unreliable,” Mr. Vaez said of Iran. “I think in this conflict in Ukraine, they see an opportunity for consolidating the relationship with the East as a way of trying to neutralize the pressure they face from the West, be it economic, military or political.” Reporting was contributed by Farnaz Fassihi, Patrick Kingsley, Steven Erlanger, Edward Wong and Oleg Matsnev.",8

According to a statement from two of her lawyers in Russia, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, Ms. Griner said: “Thank you everyone for fighting so hard to get me home. All the support and love are definitely helping me.” The lawyers said they had met with Ms. Griner for several hours on Tuesday and relayed messages from well-wishers. “Today is of course a difficult day for Brittney,” they said, adding that she was “very stressed” in anticipation of a hearing over the appeal of her conviction on drug charges, which is scheduled for Oct. 25. Ms. Griner told her lawyers last week that she was not optimistic about the chances of her being freed before serving her full nine-year sentence and that she was struggling emotionally. Ms. Griner is allowed outside once a day, according to Mr. Boykov, during which she walks for an hour in a small courtyard at the penal colony outside Moscow where she is being held. She spends the rest of her time in a small cell with two cellmates, sitting and sleeping on a specially elongated bed to accommodate her 6-foot-9 frame. While she awaits the appeals court hearing, Mr. Boykov said, Ms. Griner struggles in large part because it is “very difficult” to speak to her relatives. He added that it had been very difficult to organize phone calls with Ms. Griner’s wife, Cherelle, and that she had been unable to speak to her parents or siblings since her detention, as far as he was aware. Last Wednesday, President Biden said that there had been no movement with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, over Ms. Griner’s case. A White House official said last week that the administration was trying “every available channel” with Moscow, including the one through which U.S. officials arranged a prisoner swap in April to secure the release of Trevor Reed, a former Marine who had been serving a nine-year prison sentence in Russia. Ms. Griner was stopped in February at an airport near Moscow on her way to play for UMMC Yekaterinburg, a Russian professional women’s basketball team. Customs officials said that she had been carrying two vape cartridges with hashish oil in her luggage. In August, she was sentenced to nine years in prison after a trial that was all but assured to end in a conviction. The United States has said that her detention and trial were politically motivated and that the Kremlin wants to exchange her for high-profile Russian citizens held in the United States. After her conviction, Russian officials said that political negotiations with the United States were already underway.",7
2022-10-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/opinion/letters/election-deniers.html,Opinion | Election Deniers Running for Office,"To the Editor: Re “2020 Election Skeptics Crowd the Republican Ticket Nationwide” (front page, Oct. 15): It is inevitable that many Republican election deniers running for office in November will be elected, especially in red states and districts, but I am just as worried about the election deniers who will lose. Will they accept their losses or, like Donald Trump, refuse to concede and charge that their election was rigged? Even worse, and again emulating Mr. Trump, will they incite their supporters to storm the offices where votes are being tabulated and/or where elections are being certified? This could be especially problematic in districts and states that take a long time to count absentee and mail-in ballots. Democracy requires that losers accept their losses. Unfortunately, 2020 election deniers care more about winning at any price than they do about democracy. I envision violence breaking out at county election boards and state offices from Maine to California. I just hope that local police departments are better prepared than the Capitol Police were on Jan. 6. Richard KaveshNyack, N.Y.The writer is a former mayor of Nyack. To the Editor: The number of election skeptics running should not come as a surprise to anyone. When we allow partisan politicians to gerrymander their states into electorally “safe” districts, the real voting occurs in the primaries. Extremists tend to win in the primaries, so this system almost guarantees that extremists, from both ends of the political spectrum, will be elected. When we send extremists of the left and the right to Washington, no one should be surprised that the process of compromise, so essential for good government, is impossible for them. Until the Supreme Court bars partisans from the electoral mapping process, America will remain stuck in a political quagmire of its own making. In recent times partisans have been barred from this process in countries such as Canada, Britain and Australia. Why can’t we take the same step in America? James TysonTrenton, N.J. To the Editor: In the midst of Covid, America significantly relaxed its voting formalities for 2020, with unrequested mail-in ballots; unsupervised, 24-hour drop boxes; and no-excuse-needed absentee voting. When the G.O.P. suggests that lax voting procedures harmed electoral integrity, they are charged with threatening American democracy. Yet when the G.O.P. attempts to restore pre-Covid voting formalities, the Democrats histrionically scream that American democracy is being threatened by Jim Crow voter suppression. The Times not only fails to challenge this specious Democratic assertion, but also joins the charge. Mike KueberSan Antonio To the Editor: It seems that there has been one essential question left unasked in this challenging time period for our republic. I would suggest directing it to each and every election-denying Republican who was “elected” on that very same 2020 ballot: If the 2020 election was ripe with fraud, as you claim, and Donald Trump was cheated at the polls, then please explain how your election to office on the very same ballot managed to avoid being tainted as well. I expect the silence to be deafening. Adam StolerBronx To the Editor: I object to The Times’s use of the term “skeptics” to describe Republican candidates who claim that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent. Please leave “skeptic” to its proper uses. No one would say a politician who claimed that 2 + 2 = 13 million is a “math skeptic.” There are plenty of suitable words in the dictionary, including “liar” and “loon.” William Avery HudsonNew York To the Editor: Re “Trump Is Subpoenaed, Setting Up Likely Fight Over His Role on Jan. 6” (front page, Oct. 22): The decision by the House Jan. 6 committee to subpoena former President Donald Trump to testify is a mistake. Even if he agrees to appear before the committee, Mr. Trump’s behavior is predictable. Based on his inability to accept defeat, and his view of disagreement as something personal that warrants lashing out at the other party, we can expect him to approach the committee as an enemy, deserving nothing but contempt. Based on his past and continuing behavior, we can expect him to be nasty, offensive and obnoxious. Attempting to belittle the committee members individually and as a group, he would make a mockery of the proceedings. Nothing of substance would be accomplished, except to place his personality on public display, which continues to delight his supporters. So the committee should avoid the futile effort and potential embarrassment, and refrain from trying to have Mr. Trump appear before it. Ken LefkowitzMedford, N.J. To the Editor: Re “Taken by Russia, Children Become the Spoils of War” (front page, Oct. 23): The abduction of Ukrainian children into Russian families is more than “a propaganda campaign presenting Russia as a charitable savior.” It follows an insidious playbook used by Soviet leaders after their 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. Thousands of Afghan children were abducted to the Soviet Union to be given a Communist education, so that a new generation of Afghans would be trained to lead a Soviet-sponsored Afghanistan. In 1989, however, Soviet troops were forced from Afghanistan, unable to prevail against Afghans fiercely defending their homeland. Vladimir Putin may very well be repeating past practices, hoping to brainwash Ukrainian children into a love for Russia, and thus preparing them to lead a Russian-dominated Ukraine. But he should learn other lessons from the past instead: that people defending their country are not easily defeated, and that the Soviet failure in Afghanistan upended the Soviet leadership and, ultimately, the Soviet Union itself.

To the Editor: Re “Berlusconi, Caught on Tape Gushing Over Putin, Heightens Concerns” (news article, Oct. 21): Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s talk of “sweet” letters and affection for Vladimir Putin, the barbaric Russian president, is as troubling as the right-wing political party that has ascended to power in Italy, a party in which Mr. Berlusconi has a patriarchal, deeply influential role. But Mr. Berlusconi’s defense of Mr. Putin’s savage invasion of Ukraine is even more sickening and chilling. Woe to Europe and the world if we see any significant scaling back or ultimately an abandonment of financial and military support for Ukraine. Mr. Putin may send Mr. Berlusconi bottles of fine vodka, but the Russian leader’s main exports to the real world are terror, autocracy and death.

2022-10-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/world/europe/biden-liberals.html,House Progressives Urge Biden to Engage in Direct Talks With Russia,"WASHINGTON — A group of House progressives on Monday urged President Biden to engage in direct diplomatic talks with Russia in an effort to “seek a realistic framework for a cease-fire.” In a letter led by Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the chairwoman of the Progressive Caucus, 30 House Democrats called on the Biden administration to “pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine.” “We agree with the administration’s perspective that it is not America’s place to pressure Ukraine’s government regarding sovereign decisions,” the lawmakers wrote, adding: “But as legislators responsible for the expenditure of tens of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in military assistance in the conflict, we believe such involvement in this war also creates a responsibility for the United States to seriously explore all possible avenues, including direct engagement with Russia.” The letter came less than a week after Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, said that if Republicans win a majority in next month’s midterm elections, his members would be unwilling to “write a blank check” to Ukraine, suggesting it could be more difficult to secure congressional approval for large infusions of aid. The timing prompted an unusually fierce backlash among even centrist Democrats, who fretted about whether support for Ukraine could erode among both the hard left and right flanks in Congress as the conflict drags on. Representative Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona, wrote on Twitter: “The way to end a war? Win it quickly. How is it won quickly? By giving Ukraine the weapons to defeat Russia.” The contents of the letter betrayed no new appetite among House liberals — at least for now — to choke off additional military or humanitarian funding to Ukraine. Ms. Jayapal in March put out a similar statement on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus calling for “a rapid, negotiated settlement to prevent more loss of life” and “a diplomatic solution to this crisis.” In May, when the House voted to approve a $40 billion tranche of aid to Ukraine, not a single Democrat opposed it. Administration officials have repeatedly said that any decision on direct negotiations to end the war must come from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, a posture they reiterated on Monday when asked about the letter. “We’ve been very clear: nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,” Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said in a briefing with reporters on Monday when asked about the letter from progressives. “And we’ve been very, very clear this is a decision that President Zelensky is going to have to make when it comes to any type of conversations with Russia, any kind of a negotiation — that is something that Ukrainians need to make. We will continue to support them as long as it takes.” In total, Congress has approved more than $60 billion to Ukraine this year alone by overwhelming margins, the largest amount of military aid the United States has committed to any country in a single year in nearly half a century, since the Vietnam War.

A ruling is expected later on Tuesday after the hearing, said Maria Blagovolina and Aleksandr Boikov, lawyers for Ms. Griner, who is jailed in Russia. The court can either leave the verdict as it is, reduce the jail term, or overrule it and send it back to the lower court, they said. The appeal is being heard before a panel of three judges in a court in Krasnogorsk, a town outside Moscow. If the appeals court does not overrule the verdict, it will come into force and Ms. Griner will be sent to a penal colony. On the eve of the hearing, which began on Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Griner’s lawyers said in a statement that she did not expect “any miracles to happen.” The fate of Ms. Griner — who was arrested on drug charges in a Moscow airport days before Russia invaded Ukraine — has been intertwined with a confrontational tug of war between Moscow and Washington. Ms. Griner — who has been “very nervous” ahead of the hearing, according to her lawyers — is not appearing in court and is participating in the proceedings via a video link from the detention center she has been held in since her arrest in February. “Brittney is a very strong person and has a champion’s character,” the lawyers said in their statement. “She of course has her highs and lows as she is severely stressed being separated from her loved ones for over eight months.” Ms. Griner was arrested on Feb. 17 in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, where she had arrived from the United States. She was en route to Yekaterinburg, a Russian city near the Ural Mountains, where she played for a women’s basketball team. Customs officials in Moscow said they had found two vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage and detained her. Ms. Griner admitted her guilt in court but insisted that she had no intention to break the law, saying that the small amount of hashish oil appeared in her luggage because of negligence. She told the court that she had made “an honest mistake.” Since she was sentenced in August, her lawyers have argued that the nine-year prison term — near the 10-year maximum for such a conviction — was too harsh for a first-time offense and was politically motivated. American officials have accused Russia of using Ms. Griner and other Americans in Russian custody as bargaining chips. In July, the Biden administration offered a prisoner swap involving Ms. Griner, but Russian officials said it was premature to discuss a deal while her case was underway. President Biden has said that there had been no movement with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, over Ms. Griner’s case. He also told CNN that he would only talk to Mr. Putin at a Group of 20 meeting to be held in Bali, Indonesia, next month if it was to discuss her situation. Bill Richardson, the former New Mexico governor and ambassador to the United Nations who has been unofficially negotiating with Russian officials as a private citizen, said in October that he was “cautiously optimistic” that Ms. Griner can be exchanged together with Paul Whelan, who has been serving time in a Russian prison, before the end of the year. Ms. Griner’s lawyers said that she was allowed to walk outside once a day in a small courtyard at her detention center. She spends the rest of her time in a small cell with two cellmates, sitting and sleeping on a specially elongated bed to accommodate her 6-foot-9 frame.",7
2022-10-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/world/europe/democrats-biden-ukraine.html,Jayapal and Liberal Democrats Retract Call for Ukraine Ceasefire,"WASHINGTON — Progressive House Democrats on Tuesday retracted their call for President Biden to engage in direct diplomatic talks with Russia over a Ukraine cease-fire, an abrupt retreat that exposed Democratic divisions and the first public hints of dissent in Congress over the war. What began this summer as an effort among liberal Democrats to persuade Mr. Biden that he had political support to pursue diplomacy for ending the conflict imploded on Tuesday after an extraordinary 24 hours. First came a letter from the liberal Congressional Progressive Caucus pressing the president to seek a “rapid end to the conflict,” then a clarifying statement to respond to a hail of criticism from other Democrats, and ultimately a complete retraction as members of the group scrambled to distance themselves from their own missive, grasping for someone else to blame. The letter, released on Monday, called on the Biden administration to “seek a realistic framework for a cease-fire” and to “pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine.” By Tuesday, Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the chairwoman of the caucus and the letter’s principal author, had taken it all back. Ms. Jayapal faulted unnamed aides for releasing the letter, which she said had been drafted several months ago “but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting.” The unusual turnabout came after a biting backlash from other Democrats, who accused the 30 lawmakers who signed the document of undermining support for Kyiv at a critical time in its war against Russian aggression, and of sowing division within the party just two weeks before the midterm elections. It was a striking show of internal Democratic rifts just as the party is in the final stretch of an uphill fight to keep control of Congress, and it pointed to a subtle but distinct shift in how lawmakers are approaching the war in Ukraine. Over the last year, as Congress has approved more than $60 billion for Ukraine — the largest amount of military aid the United States has committed to any country in a single year in nearly half a century, since the Vietnam War — there has been little in the way of dissent or debate from lawmakers in either party. The aid has been approved by overwhelming margins, and members of Congress in both political parties have largely kept to themselves their questions about the Biden administration’s strategy for American involvement. The outraged response to the progressives’ letter this week — including streams of biting messages on Twitter and private calls from upset donors — and the ensuing retraction suggested that support for Ukraine in Congress remains strong, and that the appetite for openly questioning the administration’s strategy is still relatively weak. But it also pointed to growing uneasiness among antiwar Democrats about the scope and consequences of American involvement in a war that has dragged on for months, just as Republicans pressing to take the majority in Congress are more openly questioning money for Ukraine. And it forecast a potentially rougher road ahead for Mr. Biden in making the case domestically for robust American investment in the war, at a time when Western officials have grown more concerned that Russia is searching for a pretext to use a nuclear weapon as a warning to the West. In the House, a substantial number of Republicans aligned with former President Donald J. Trump and his “America First” positions have consistently voted against the aid packages for Ukraine, even as leaders such as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, have toiled to keep the party united in favor of such support. A new Republican majority would be under pressure to challenge the administration on the war more aggressively. And some Democrats argue it is high time for Congress to start debating the conflict more openly. Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California and a signer of the letter, said in an interview on Tuesday that he had voted to arm Ukraine in the face of President Vladimir V. Putin’s brutal war and would continue to do so. But he added, “History shows that silencing debate in Congress about matters of war and peace never ends well.” “It is my responsibility as a United States congressman to make sure we are doing everything possible to mitigate the risks of nuclear war, to ensure that the conflict doesn’t escalate and to see as many creative pathways for a just, negotiated settlement,” Mr. Khanna said. Mr. Khanna’s concern about “silencing debate” appeared to refer to the intense wave of criticism that had washed over liberal lawmakers who signed on to the letter. Third Way, a center-left think tank based in Washington, said the letter had effectively dishonored Ukrainians’ “courageous sacrifice by suggesting they give up everything they’ve been fighting for.” “This letter is an olive branch to a war criminal who’s losing his war,” Representative Jake Auchincloss, Democrat of Massachusetts and a former Marine, wrote on Twitter. “Ukraine is on the march. Congress should be standing firmly behind @JoeBidens effective strategy, including tighter — not weaker! — sanctions.” The denunciations continued even after the group retracted the letter on Tuesday, and as several progressive signers were frantically trying to disavow or explain it. Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin, tried on Monday night to calm Twitter users who had tagged him in angry messages. He by turns agreed that the timing of the letter could have been better — “I have no idea why a July letter went out now. Misses the point,” read one post — and defended its sentiment: “I’m not sure a lessening of bombing and death is ever a bad idea???” read another. In her lengthy statement withdrawing the letter, Ms. Jayapal said its timing had allowed detractors to portray it “as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican Leader McCarthy threatening an end to aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over.” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, who is in line to be speaker should his party win control of the House in next month’s elections, said in a recent interview that Republicans would be unwilling to “write a blank check” to Ukraine, suggesting that they would raise questions about future funding requests for the war. “The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance that Democrats, who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of military, strategic and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people, are somehow aligned with Republicans who seek to pull the plug on American support for President Zelensky and the Ukrainian forces,” Ms. Jayapal said on Tuesday. “Nothing could be further from the truth.” Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, on Tuesday released a nearly 900-word statement about the retraction (the letter itself was 800 words long) that affirmed the historic imperative of an outright military victory in Ukraine. “It is important to be on the right side of a just war, and it is even more important to be on the right side and win,” he wrote. “Timing in diplomacy is everything,” Representative Sara Jacobs, Democrat of California, wrote on Twitter. “I signed this letter on June 30, but a lot has changed since then. I wouldn’t sign it today.”",1
2022-10-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/world/europe/brittney-griner-appeal-russia.html,Brittney Griner’s Prison Term Is Upheld by Russian Court,"A Russian appeals court on Tuesday upheld a nine-year prison sentence imposed on Brittney Griner, the American basketball star arrested after she arrived in the country carrying a small amount of hash oil. Ms. Griner has been jailed since her detention in February, and the new ruling may now pave the way for her transfer to a prison colony, although it was not clear when that might happen. Her lawyers said they might ask a higher court to intervene. “We need to discuss this with our client,” they said in a statement on Tuesday. “We generally think that we must use all the available legal tools, especially given the harsh and unprecedented nature of her sentence.” But higher courts in Russia are loath to overturn verdicts, especially if a case involves foreign policy and the interests of the Kremlin, experts say, and the athlete’s fate may now be in the hands of Russian and American officials feeling each other out about a possible prisoner exchange. President Biden, asked what the United States would do now in the wake of the court ruling, said: “We are in constant contact with the Russian authorities to get Brittney and others out, and so far we have not been meeting with much positive response. But we’re not stopping.” The negotiation comes at a time of extraordinary tensions between the two countries over the war in Ukraine, and the ruling by the three-judge appeals panel Tuesday did nothing to change that. “We are aware of the news out of Russia that Brittney Griner will continue to be wrongfully detained under intolerable circumstances after having to undergo another sham judicial proceeding today,” Jake Sullivan, the American national security adviser, said in a statement. Russian officials have said that prisoner exchanges cannot be considered until the legal process has concluded. From the very start, Ms. Griner’s case has become entangled with global tensions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On Tuesday, as Ms. Griner appeared remotely in a Moscow courtroom, Russian and Ukrainian forces were battling over territory and concerns were rising that Moscow might be considering detonating explosives laced with radioactive material and blaming Ukraine. Days before Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Ms. Griner, an All-Star center with the W.N.B.A.’s Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was detained at an airport near Moscow after customs officials found two vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. She had been en route to Yekaterinburg, a city near the Ural Mountains, where she played for a women’s basketball team. Ms. Griner, who recently turned 32 in Russian custody, pleaded guilty to drug-smuggling charges and apologized for what she called an inadvertent offense. She apologized again on Tuesday before the appeals court ruled. “I did not intend to do this,” she said via a video link from a detention cell, “but I understand the charges against me, and I just hope that that is also taken into account.” Addressing the court, she protested her unusually long sentence. “I’ve been here almost eight months,” she said, “and people with more severe crimes have gotten less than what I was given.” Since Ms. Griner was sentenced in August, her lawyers have argued that the nine-year prison term — near the 10-year maximum for such a conviction — is too harsh for a first-time offense and was politically motivated. “We are very disappointed,” her lawyers said in their statement Tuesday. “The verdict contains numerous defects, and we hoped that the court of appeal would take them into consideration. We still think the punishment is excessive.” Before the court ruled, the lawyers had appeared to be lowering expectations. “Brittney does not expect any miracles to happen,” they said, “but hopes that the appeal court will hear the arguments of the defense and reduce the number of years.” American officials contend that Russia, struggling under the weight of international sanctions imposed over the war, is hoping to use the athlete and another imprisoned American, Paul Whelan, a former Marine held since December 2018, as bargaining chips. Mr. Sullivan said on Tuesday that American officials had “continued to engage with Russia through every available channel” to secure the freedom of Ms. Griner and other Americans wrongfully detained in Russia. “The president has demonstrated that he is willing to go to extraordinary lengths and make tough decisions to bring Americans home,” Mr. Sullivan said. One person briefed on the talks between Moscow and Washington this summer said that the United States had proposed exchanging Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year federal prison sentence for charges including conspiring to kill Americans. Mr. Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia are expected to attend a summit of Group of 20 leaders next month in Indonesia, but Mr. Biden has said he would speak with the Russian leader there only if it were to discuss Ms. Griner’s case. For American basketball players, playing in Russia during the off-season can be lucrative, but since Ms. Griner’s arrest, most W.N.B.A. players have shunned the country, and on Tuesday, the organization denounced the court decision. “This appeal is further verification that B.G. is not just wrongfully detained — she is very clearly a hostage,” it said.

2022-10-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/us/politics/us-saudi-oil-deal.html,"A Secret, Failed Oil Deal: How the U.S.-Saudi Relationship Ruptured","WASHINGTON — As President Biden was planning a politically risky trip to Saudi Arabia this summer, his top aides thought they had struck a secret deal to boost oil production through the end of the year — an arrangement that could have helped justify breaking a campaign pledge to shun the kingdom and its crown prince. It didn’t work out that way. Mr. Biden went through with the trip. But earlier this month, Saudi Arabia and Russia steered a group of oil-producing countries in voting to slash oil production by two million barrels per day, the opposite of the outcome the administration thought it had secured as the Democratic Party struggles to deal with inflation and high gas prices heading into the November elections. The move led angry Biden administration officials to reassess America’s relationship with the kingdom and produced a flurry of accusatory statements between the two governments — including a charge by the White House that Saudi Arabia was helping Russia in its war in Ukraine. Lawmakers who had been told about the trip’s benefits in classified briefings and other conversations that included details of the oil deal — which has not been previously disclosed and was supposed to lead to a surge in production between September and December — have been left fuming that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman duped the administration. This account is based on interviews with American officials and officials from Gulf Arab nations, as well as Middle East experts with knowledge of discussions between the two nations. What happened over the last half-year is a story of handshake agreements, wishful thinking, missed signals and finger-pointing over broken promises. Far from rebuilding a relationship with a leader Mr. Biden had once pledged to treat as a “pariah” after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the outcome has been another low point in America’s tumultuous ties with Saudi Arabia. The episode is also a revealing example of how Saudi Arabia, under the leadership of its ambitious and often ruthless crown prince, appears eager to shed some of its longtime reliance on the United States, with Prince Mohammed trying to position Saudi Arabia as a powerhouse of its own. American officials said that, even days before the OPEC Plus decision, they had received assurances from the crown prince there would be no production cuts — and when they learned of the Saudi reversal they made a futile last-ditch push to change minds in the royal court. The Saudi Energy Ministry said in a statement that “the kingdom rejects these allegations and stresses that such mischaracterizations made by anonymous sources are entirely false.” The ministry added, “The decisions of OPEC Plus are reached by the consensus of all members and determined solely by market fundamentals, not politics.” White House officials admit they were angered and surprised by what they said was a Saudi about-face, but insist their overall strategy to lower energy costs is working. “We have a disagreement with Saudi Arabia over the most recent production cut, but our energy policy has always focused on prices, not number of barrels — and that policy is succeeding with crude oil prices down over 30 percent this year alone,” Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement on Tuesday night. At the same time, U.S. officials are bracing for another potential price surge in December, if a European embargo on Russian oil goes into effect and the Saudis refuse to increase oil production to make up for the anticipated reduction in supply. The officials say that would be a sure sign that the Saudis were helping the Russians by undermining the American and European-led plan. “While we clearly disagreed with the OPEC Plus decision in early October, we recognize the importance of continuing to work and communicate with Saudi Arabia and other producers to ensure a stable and fair global energy market,” said Amos Hochstein, Mr. Biden’s energy envoy. Some analysts say that senior American and Saudi officials have misread each other on both the dynamics of the oil market and the geopolitics around Russia, and that the Biden administration will have a hard time figuring out how things went awry. “Deconstructing Saudi decision-making right now is like Kremlinology on steroids,” said Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “It’s become a matter of a relative handful of people around the king and the crown prince.” “Even the most well-informed people in the United States often don’t know,” he added. The White House has indicated it might seek retribution for the Saudi decision, and some Democrats in Congress are making a push to scale back some military and economic ties to the kingdom. Even some of the president’s staunchest supporters have called the episode an example of the administration sacrificing principles for political expediency — and having little to show for it. “There’s now a level of embarrassment as the Saudis merrily go on their way,” said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Biden administration officials began planning in the spring for the president to make a summit stop in Saudi Arabia while also visiting Israel over the summer. They knew such a trip would bring criticism: Mr. Biden had denounced Prince Mohammed during the presidential campaign, had ordered the declassification of an intelligence assessment that the prince likely ordered the killing of Mr. Khashoggi and had thus far in his presidency refused to have a one-on-one meeting with the crown prince. But some of the president’s aides saw both short- and long-term benefits for the trip and had quietly tried to repair the relationship. They said it was important to work with the kingdom on the Yemen war and Iran, and to expand Israel’s acceptance in the region. More immediately, they believed, the trip could shore up a Saudi commitment to convince OPEC to increase oil production as Russia’s war in Ukraine had led to surging global fuel prices. Leading proponents of the visit, including Mr. Hochstein and Brett McGurk, the top National Security Council official for Middle East policy, met during the spring with Prince Mohammed and his advisers. American officials said that in May, they reached a private oil deal with the Saudis that had two parts. First, the Saudis would accelerate an OPEC Plus production increase of 400,000 barrels per day already planned for September, moving it to July and August. Then the Saudis would get the cartel to announce a further production increase of 200,000 barrels per day for each month from September to December of this year. American officials said they hoped the announcements of gradual increases would signal to the markets that the Saudis were willing to address supply issues. On June 2, OPEC Plus announced they would move up the production increase scheduled for September — fulfilling the first part of the secret deal. That same day, the White House announced Mr. Biden would soon make a trip to Saudi Arabia. Democratic lawmakers remained skeptical of the efforts at rapprochement. Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House intelligence committee, said publicly that Mr. Biden should not travel to the kingdom. He and five other senior Democratic House members sent a letter on June 7 to Mr. Biden urging him to take a more guarded approach to Saudi Arabia — the most immediate issue, they said, was that “Saudi Arabia’s refusal to ​​stabilize global energy markets is helping bankroll Vladimir Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine.” The White House agreed to give the lawmakers classified briefings about their diplomatic efforts on a range of issues, including the Yemen war, Iran and Saudi Arabia’s relations with Israel. In briefings and talks with members of the congressional intelligence and foreign affairs committees, Mr. McGurk and Mr. Hochstein laid out the elements of a variety of agreements they had brokered with the Saudis, including the oil production boost intended to bring down prices. Mr. McGurk said in a statement on Tuesday that diplomacy with the Saudis was mainly aimed at building stability and prosperity in the Middle East, “from establishing a truce in Yemen to countering Iran to fostering regional interconnectedness, including with Israel.” For Democratic lawmakers who attended the briefings, the apparent oil pledge from the Saudis promised relief both for American consumers being pummeled by inflation, and for Mr. Biden and his embattled party as they headed into the November elections. The price of oil was slowly dropping by the time Mr. Biden arrived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on July 15 for his meeting with Prince Mohammed and other Arab leaders. The image of the American president bumping fists with the Saudi crown prince he once vilified endures from the trip, but behind the scenes, White House officials believed they had at least shored up Saudi commitments on a number of fronts. Saudis officials seemed eager to demonstrate to the Americans that they had delivered on their commitments — during the summit, they gave members of Mr. Biden’s delegation a chart showing oil prices had fallen to $101 per barrel, down from more than $120 per barrel after the war in Ukraine began. The kingdom would soon pump more than 11 million barrels per day, a level it had reached for only a few months in total over the past several years. The Americans came away from the summit with the belief that the agreement was on track and that Prince Mohammed was satisfied. But in Riyadh, top Saudi officials were privately telling others that they had no plans for further meaningful oil production increases. Indeed, the first public warning of this came on Aug. 3, when OPEC Plus announced a paltry bump in production for September of 100,000 barrels a day — half of what U.S. officials believed the Saudis had promised them. American officials said they did not understand why that decision was made. Then OPEC Plus announced on Sept. 5 it would cut production by 100,000 barrels per day — retracting the increase it had announced a month earlier. After that, U.S. officials were increasingly confused and concerned about the kingdom’s direction. In late September, American officials began hearing that Saudi Arabia could get OPEC Plus to announce a deep cut to oil production at a meeting scheduled for Oct. 5. U.S. officials scrambled to get Prince Mohammed to back away from any such move. On Sept. 24, American officials met in person in the kingdom with Prince Mohammed and his brother Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the Saudi energy minister. During the meeting, Prince Mohammed assured the Americans that there would be no production cuts, according to U.S. officials with direct knowledge of what transpired. But four days after that, the White House learned the crown prince had done the opposite: Saudi officials notified the Americans that Saudi Arabia would back production cuts at the OPEC Plus meeting, which took place in Vienna. The White House dispatched Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to speak by phone to Mohammed al-Jadaan, the Saudi finance minister, to argue against the production cut, but that failed to sway the Saudis. American officials say they believe that Prince Mohammed was particularly influenced by a high-level Sept. 27 meeting in which Prince Abdulaziz, the energy minister, argued that oil production cuts were needed to keep prices from plummeting to as low as $50 per barrel. The U.S. officials said they learned Prince Abdulaziz asserted that, under such a scenario, the Saudi government would lack the resources to fund economic diversification projects at the heart of Prince Mohammed’s domestic agenda. Some U.S. officials believe that the Russians influenced the Saudi about-face, pointing to Prince Abdulaziz’s strong working ties with top Russian officials close to Mr. Putin, particularly Alexander Novak, the deputy prime minister who oversees energy policy. Saudi officials vehemently denied marching in lock step with Russia and said they have viewed themselves as a neutral mediator in Russia’s war with Ukraine. Some American officials said that an answer to whether Riyadh has truly cast its lot with Moscow will come on Dec. 4, when OPEC Plus is scheduled to meet again. The White House is working with European allies to implement a partial embargo and price cap on Russian oil sales beginning in December. Their goal is to deprive Moscow of resources and to increase pressure on Mr. Putin to end the war in Ukraine, while keeping global oil supplies stable. But much hinges on what the Saudis choose to do. If they refuse to announce a production increase at that December meeting — around the time when Russian oil could come off the market — oil prices might surge, undermining Mr. Biden’s efforts against Russia and stoking global inflation. On Tuesday, speaking at an annual investment forum in Riyadh, Prince Abdulaziz suggested that was unlikely, arguing that Saudi Arabia was preserving its spare capacity to be ready for such shocks and saying the country felt great responsibility to be a “dependable supplier of oil.” Prince Abdulaziz said that the kingdom would do what was in its best interests. “I keep listening to, ‘Are you with us or against us?’ Is there any room for, ‘We are for Saudi Arabia and the people of Saudi Arabia’?” he said. “We will have to deliver our ambitions.” Vivian Nereim contributed reporting from Riyadh.",8
2022-10-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/world/asia/russia-myanmar-junta.html,"Shunned by the West, Russia and Myanmar Form a Partnership of Unequals","Myanmar has been cut off from the West and shunned by its neighbors after its military seized power last year and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even China, its closest ally, has signaled it is not thrilled about the instability. With few friends left in the world, the junta, desperate for legitimacy, is embracing deeper ties with Russia. It is a relationship of unequals where each side has something to gain. Myanmar gets resources, ammunition, and a powerful partner to back them at the United Nations, while Russia gets another customer at a time when it is struggling to find sources of revenue. And both can use the other to undermine the Western sanctions imposed on them — Myanmar, for launching a coup, and Russia, for invading Ukraine. In their vision, they are part of a new world order, two countries led by strongmen ideologically opposed to democracy. Ever since the coup in February of last year, the head of Myanmar’s junta, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, has been on a charm offensive. He has visited Russia three times, more than any other country. Just days after the war began in Ukraine, his administration was quick to say that Moscow had “done its part to maintain its sovereignty,” the only country in Southeast Asia to endorse the invasion. It all laid the groundwork for his biggest diplomatic achievement yet: a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. During that meeting, at an economic forum in Vladivostok last month, General Min Aung Hlaing told Mr. Putin that “Russia has become such a leading country because of your leadership.” “We see that you’re dealing with world affairs impartially and correctly,” the junta chief said. In return, the general got oil, an agreement from Russia to explore nuclear energy in Myanmar — and respect. The Kremlin has referred to General Min Aung Hlaing as the “prime minister,” a post the junta leader gave himself that no other major country recognizes. And last month, Myanmar was invited to become a dialogue partner at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an eight-member organization, including Russia, India and Pakistan, that founded by China as a counterweight to Western influence in Central Asia. “Russia is the last diplomatic resort,” said Aung Thu Nyein, a political analyst at the Institute for Strategy and Policy Myanmar, a research group. Since the coup, the junta has struggled to find even a modicum of support elsewhere in the world. The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on dozens of top military officials and state-owned enterprises. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has long maintained a policy of noninterference in each country’s internal affairs, blocked Myanmar from participating in recent leader summits. And the relationship with China, sometimes fraught, has only gotten more complicated. Both China and Myanmar like to say that their relationship is so close that it’s fraternal, using the Burmese phrase “pauk phaw,” meaning siblings from the same mother. China, along with Russia, has consistently vetoed U.N. resolutions to denounce the military regime. But the Tatmadaw, as the Myanmar military is known, has also long been suspicious of China, its northern neighbor. Many generals spent most of the 1970s battling communist rebels funded by Beijing. Senior officials in Myanmar have also complained to China that armed insurgents along their shared border are getting Chinese financial and military aid. The coup, and the instability it has caused, has frustrated China. When China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, visited Myanmar in July, he snubbed General Min Aung Hlaing, choosing to meet only with the country’s foreign minister, in a departure from the past. “I would probably characterize the relationship as tepid,” said Ian Storey, a senior fellow with the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. “Min Aung Hlaing has yet to meet a single senior Chinese leader, so that’s very telling.” Moscow gets something out of the relationship with Myanmar’s junta, gaining another customer for its oil and at least another country that isn’t outraged over its invasion of Ukraine. But Myanmar needs Russia much more. The Southeast Asian state has been mired by a fuel shortage, compounded by the junta’s mismanagement and the global surge in energy prices. The spokesman for Myanmar’s junta, Zaw Min Tun, said last month that the oil from Russia came “at a cheap price” and that the first 30,000 tons of Russian oil were set to arrive soon in Myanmar. While the proportion is minuscule compared to what Russia has sold to China and India, General Min Aung Hlaing has promised a “continuous purchase” of fuel from Moscow that he would pay for in rubles. “It shows that this axis of autocrats is a problem for using sanctions as leverage,” said Laurel Miller, the program director for Asia for International Crisis Group. Russia could also eclipse China as Myanmar’s top supplier of weapons, which have been frequently deployed by the military against civilians since the coup. From 2001 to early 2021, Myanmar bought $1.7 billion of arms from Russia, equal to the amount provided by China over the same period, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Myanmar bought an air defense missile system from Russia in 2021, according to data from SIPRI. There were no known figures for weapons imports from China after the coup. General Min Aung Hlaing has said that he was willing to sign more arms deals, even as there were questions about whether Russia, struggling in its war against Ukraine, would have the supplies. During his recent trip to Russia, he inspected the production of the Russian-made Su-30 fighter jets that are set for delivery to the Myanmar army soon, according to Mr. Zaw Min Tun, the junta spokesman. In his interview with Russia’s Rossiya Segodnya news agency, General Min Aung Hlaing said Russia’s defense equipment is “really high quality.” “We like it very much,” he said. “We will continue to buy and cooperate more.” For most of the 2000s, much of Myanmar’s engagement with Russia was limited to arms purchases and military training. But this year marked a higher level of engagement with Moscow. In August, the Tatmadaw took part in the International Army Games in Moscow. A month later, it joined China and India and 11 other countries in Vostok 2022, Russia’s large-scale military exercises in the Russian Far East. The cooperation has also extended to finance, with the ultimate, if somewhat quixotic, goal of what the junta says is the creation of “a financial system that does not rely on the U.S. currency.” Last month, Mr. Zaw Min Tun, the junta spokesman, told reporters that in a meeting with Mr. Putin, his country’s officials discussed replacing the use of the dollar with other currencies such as the Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee and the Russian ruble. Myanmar also plans to use a barter system to import fertilizer from Russia, he said. “Both sides have a real incentive to avoid dollar transactions, and so any trade that could take place that could build up this interdependence, and that helps evade sanctions, would be very important,” said Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, D.C., and an expert on Southeast Asian politics. Myanmar will also allow the use of Mir bank cards, Russia’s alternative to Visa and Mastercard, according to Mr. Zaw Min Tun. The sanctions imposed by the West have cut Russia off from the global financial system, and Moscow is scouring the globe looking for more countries to accept their bank cards. During the most recent trip, General Min Aung Hlaing discussed a host of proposals with Russia, ranging from the easy, like increasing diplomatic cooperation, to the rather improbable, like space technology development in Myanmar. Returning to Myanmar in late September after his trip together with General Min Aung Hlaing, Mr. Zaw Min Tun told reporters: “The Russian trip was a success for Myanmar. It was more successful than expected.” “Among Southeast Asian nations, Russia sees Myanmar as the most reliable and trusted country,” he said.",22
2022-10-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/opinion/russia-putin-war.html,"Opinion | Russians Know the Reality of War, and Many of Them Still Support Putin","Don’t count your chickens before they hatch, an old English proverb says. Its Russian counterpart advises you to count your chickens in the fall. In Russia, fall starts looming in August and is often revelatory. The August 1991 putsch burst open the cracks within the Soviet elite, accelerating the country’s implosion, and the August 1998 financial crisis exposed the bankruptcy of the new Russian state. Terrorist bombings in 1999, the Beslan massacre in 2004 and even the revolution in 1917 all took place in the fall — as if not only nature but also social and political forces ripen and bear fruit this season. In the fall of 2022, Russians have been forced to face the reality of war. Vladimir Putin’s decision in September to mobilize Russians lifted the final flimsy veil from what the government continues to call a special military operation in Ukraine. Many Russian families, after months of detachment, have had to confront the ugly face of war, a full 210 days into the full-scale invasion. Almost half of Russians felt “anxiety, fear and horror,” while 13 percent were angry, according to surveys conducted by the independent Levada Center after the announcement. A bitter war of revenge, borne with stunning resilience and moral courage in Ukraine, has been further underlined by Russia’s escalatory assault on civilian targets. Yet for all the emotion it has inspired, the escalation hasn’t seemed to affect most Russians’ views of the war. According to one recent study, 43 percent of Russians support the bombing of Ukrainian cities and overall support for the war has not changed much. Given the parlous state of the country — internationally isolated and economically precarious — and the dawning realization of what the war in Ukraine entails, such a sturdy bank of support for the Kremlin’s actions might seem surprising. But it emerges from a deep well of collective feeling, nurtured in recent decades, that conflates individuals’ interests with those of the state, embodied by Mr. Putin. That support may dim, but it won’t disappear. When the war started, hopes that Russians would rise up and challenge the senseless cruelty of their country’s leadership were quickly disappointed. Some courageous Russians, often from younger generations, took to the streets or engaged in more clandestine opposition to the war. But the protests, while attended by thousands in the initial days after the invasion, never really snowballed to a grand scale. The main factor was fear. After the Kremlin made criticism of the war punishable by up to 15 years in prison, protests understandably dropped away. After all, people have one life and want to live it, rather than spend it being tortured by a police officer and left to rot in jail. If a minority of Russians were roused to anger by the invasion, the majority were in a state of shock. In days, Russia had become a pariah, cut off from international travel and targeted with deep sanctions. It was profoundly disorienting. To navigate this uncharted territory, Russians in the main reached for familiar moral ground: collective national identity. “My country, right or wrong” was the default reaction. One message from a popular movie star resonated intensely: “You don’t criticize your own folks in war, even if they are wrong.” Instead, people blamed President Joe Biden, NATO expansion and the West, as well as Ukrainian nationalists. As time passed, many Russians distanced themselves. They lived the summer months as if nothing was happening. The Russian state took note of public disengagement and at the beginning of September state-controlled media moved away from the style of coverage that characterized the early war, with its emphasis on the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, and toward infotainment, with new historical television series and late-night shows with familiar hosts. For a while, soccer results and “House of the Dragon” trended in Google searches in Russia. Mr. Putin’s mobilization order, in response to the military’s difficulties on the battlefield, shattered this equilibrium. As men were called up to fight, Russians’ attitude toward the war was once again tested. Mobilization was a second shock that was, once again, internalized by society. Despite instances of unrest and disquiet in some regions, the Russian public broadly acquiesced. The more educated and well-resourced Russians looked for ways to circumvent the potential draft; exit options ranged from leaving the country to obtaining official paperwork to avoid conscription. But the duty to the state and to their own folks is seen, by many ordinary Russians, as an unavoidable obligation. This ought not to be too surprising. War, after all, magnifies the role of collective identity — itself the primary standpoint from which many Russian individuals understand their reality. This isn’t just a matter of propaganda, though it’s true that the majority of citizens take their cues from government-controlled media. It operates at a deeper level of perception and interpretation, where citizens shape their opinions on the basis of what they know — or imagine — are the dominant, socially desirable views. This reflex explains seeming contradictions thrown up by polling. A recent poll revealed that almost 40 percent of Russians were hypothetically ready to support any of Mr. Putin’s decisions, whether he were to sign a peace agreement or march to Kyiv. The paradox of support for these antithetical strategies dissolves once you grasp that people respond to these surveys not individually but collectively — they support whatever is thought to serve the collective interest, expressed by their president. In wartime, with the nation pitted against a range of adversaries, these dynamics are only intensified. Rallying around the flag at times of war is not unique to Russia, of course. The uniqueness of Russia today is in the symbolic merger of its national identity with the figure of Vladimir Putin. This strange conflation is the fruit of a two-decade-long process of depoliticization, in which the Kremlin encouraged people to trust Mr. Putin — conceived as a uniquely heroic figure who saved the country from the wild and painful 1990s — while sowing a deep distrust of all other politicians. In the 2000s, this largely successful strategy depended on rising living standards. In the past decade, as economic growth stalled and discontent broke out, it has taken the form of national identity politics. Patriotism, veneration of state symbols and admiration for the glories of Russian history and the country’s recent successes have become a burnished mirror in which citizens see themselves. At the center of this national idea sits Mr. Putin, the embodiment of a stronger and more successful Russia. Awakening from this illusion will be nothing if not painful and prolonged. As of now, like their leader, many Russian citizens are invested in victory in Ukraine — whatever that is deemed to mean. Yet this fall, though it may take some time for Russians to admit it, has been similarly revelatory. It marks the point at which Mr. Putin started to slide, slowly but surely, from Russia’s national pedestal.

2022-10-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/29/opinion/classical-music-war-ukraine-russia.html,Opinion | Classical Music Still Plays in the Theater of War,"There is a trope often heard in discussions about culture that classical music is irrelevant — an elite and moribund art form disconnected from contemporary life. If the trope were true, however, would Russian soldiers have assassinated a Ukrainian conductor in his home after he refused to conduct a concert celebrating Russia’s “improvement of peaceful life”? That is the claim of the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture, which issued a statement on the recent death of Yurii Kerpatenko, an active and influential leader of theaters and orchestras in the occupied city of Kherson. (One wonders what would have been on that program. Tchaikovsky? Prokofiev? Surely not Mussorgsky’s “The Great Gate of Kyiv.”) And if classical music is irrelevant, why would the National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine, which resides in Kyiv, announce a three-week tour to Britain — the most extensive in its more than 100-year history? And why would a recent performance of Adolphe Adam’s 1841 “Giselle” in London by the United Ukrainian Ballet be praised as a triumph of civilization against the barbarism of Vladimir Putin’s Russian Federation? Those who believe the trope, then, that classical music has little or no currency are mistaken. At least the leaders of Russia and Ukraine believe it is very important indeed. When the Metropolitan Opera’s general director, Peter Gelb, announced in February, soon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that the company “can no longer engage with artists or institutions that support Putin or who are supported by him,” the Met and other arts institutions that followed suit were scrutinized. But the clash of classical music and world politics, for better or worse, was nothing new. In 1917, the Metropolitan Opera banished the operas of Wagner and Beethoven in the run-up to America’s entrance into World War I because the very spirit of the German Hun was thought to be embedded in this music. Wagner’s musical depiction of the descent of the Holy Grail in his prelude to “Lohengrin” and Beethoven’s hymn to marriage and the triumph of freedom over political repression in “Fidelio” were now unacceptable in the free city of New York. In Boston, the German-born Swiss conductor Karl Muck — along with more than 20 members of the Boston Symphony — was arrested and jailed in 1918 on suspicion of being a German sympathizer. Muck spent more than a year incarcerated at Fort Oglethorpe, Ga. At so many flashpoints over the past century, war on another country has also been a war on music. Making classical music a target and a weapon is one of the legacies of the 20th century. Before World War I, there were styles of music attributed to certain countries. The German-born Handel wrote Italian operas in London. His exact contemporary, J.S. Bach, composed what became known as the French Suites in Germany. These were not seen as political acts. However, when Arnold Schoenberg joined the Austrian Army in 1916, he was determined to wipe out the music of France’s “kitsch-mongers.” Classical music had become proof of the superiority of countries as well as their political regimes. Unlike the case during World War I, Wagner’s works were performed throughout World War II in America as well as in the Third Reich. Hitler marketed Wagner’s operas as the artistic epitome of Nazi Germany, even though the composer had died in 1883, six years before Hitler was born. Beethoven was claimed by both the Allied and Axis powers. The opening of his Fifth Symphony became the musical motto of victory over the Germans who had claimed those very same four notes as another example of their über alles superiority. When the Bayreuth Festival — an event founded by Wagner and devoted exclusively to his music — returned in 1951 after seven years of wartime silence, the program opened not with a Wagner opera but with something that was, at the time, politically neutral: Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, conducted, nonetheless, by Hitler’s favorite maestro, Wilhelm Furtwängler. The emotion of the Bayreuth performance of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony can be summed up by listening to its last minute and a half and hearing the pandemonium of notes as the conductor and orchestra accelerate into warp speed and the chaotic world of The Unplayable — and yet somehow end together. And when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, it was Leonard Bernstein who led that same symphony, having replaced the word “joy” (Freude) in the work’s finale with “freedom” (Freiheit), thus transforming it into an overt “Ode to Freedom.” Despite the vast number of people who claim to have no interest in or understanding of classical music, it’s clear that something very powerful is at work here. It is what the 20th-century American composer Charles Ives once described as “in-known” — something that we can sense profoundly even if we can’t fully grasp or explain it. There are few who understand what Ukraine gave us in the last century. Much of the music we think of as American was composed by the children of Ukrainians who escaped another kind of terrorism — anti-Semitism. Our country was the safe harbor for many who escaped the pogroms that surely would have killed them. And who were some of their children, their American children? Bernard Herrmann, Alex North, Elmer Bernstein, Alfred Newman, Leonard Bernstein and George Gershwin. Any time you hear the music of “West Side Story” or “Rhapsody in Blue,” or watch “A Streetcar Named Desire,” “Psycho,” “The Ten Commandments” or “The Magnificent Seven,” you are hearing the sound that freedom gave back to us and to the world.

2022-10-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/us/politics/jd-vance-peter-thiel-rumble.html,Company Backed by J.D. Vance Gives Platform for Russian Propaganda,"In June, two American veterans fighting as volunteers in Ukraine, Alex Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, were captured by Russian forces. They were taken to a black site where they were beaten, run into walls with bags over their heads and hooked up to a car battery and “electrocuted,” the men said after being freed in late September. Between beatings, they told The New York Times, they were interviewed on Russian media outlets, including RT, one of the Kremlin’s primary propaganda organs in the West. “They stayed away from our faces because they knew that we were going to be on camera, that they were going to try and use this for propaganda.,” Mr. Drueke said. “So they wanted our faces to look OK. But they took care of our bodies pretty good.” RT had been largely taken off the air in the United States and banned by the European Union in March after Russian President Vladimir V. Putin’s armies invaded Ukraine. But in June, its version of the captives’ story appeared on Rumble, a video-sharing platform that stepped in this year and began carrying RT’s live feed, in addition to its clips. There, a glum-looking Mr. Huynh says they joined the fight in Ukraine after being duped by “propaganda from the West” that “Russian forces were indiscriminately killing civilians.” Rumble has become a leading destination for conservative content by positioning itself as a platform for unfettered speech, an alternative to the content moderation — or “censorship,” to many on the right — of mainstream social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. Last year, Rumble received a major investment from a venture capital firm co-founded by J.D. Vance, the Republican Senate candidate in Ohio. The firm, Narya Capital, got a seat on Rumble’s board, and its more than seven million shares place it among the company’s top 10 shareholders, according to securities filings. Mr. Vance also took a personal Rumble stake worth between $100,000 and $250,000, his financial disclosures show. Narya is backed by the prime patron of Mr. Vance’s Senate campaign, the billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel. And it was Mr. Thiel who played a leading role in Narya’s Rumble investment last year, becoming what the platform’s chief executive described as its first outside investor. The investment fits into an enduring narrative of Mr. Thiel, who has expressed skepticism of democracy and advocated keeping the airwaves open for hard-right voices since his student days at Stanford. It also helps illuminate the relationship between Mr. Vance and Mr. Thiel, who mentored the candidate in his Silicon Valley business empire and has contributed more than $15 million to his campaign and affiliated political action committees. (Mr. Thiel has contributed another $15 million to support the candidacy of another protégé, the Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, Blake Masters.) Asked about Rumble’s hosting of RT, the Vance campaign issued a statement. “J.D. does not play an active role at Rumble, nor does he set Rumble’s content moderation policies,” the campaign said. “It’s a dishonest straw man to suggest that just because someone believes in free speech rights online that they also personally endorse that speech. It’s embarrassing that an industry like the media, which relies on the First Amendment, has so much trouble comprehending that.” Mr. Thiel’s spokesman did not comment. Even so, Rumble is serving as a platform for RT’s Russia-friendly content at a time of growing unhappiness on the right — and also from some voices on the left — about the Biden administration’s expansive arming of Ukraine. The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, has said that if his party wins back the House next month, it will resist writing “a blank check” to the Ukrainian government. While Russia’s war has been broadly condemned in the West, several influential conservative pundits, including Tucker Carlson on Fox, have often been reluctant to criticize Mr. Putin. Mr. Vance, who once assailed Donald J. Trump (“my god what an idiot,” he tweeted in 2016), has‌ become an enthusiastic supporter and adopted his isolationist stance on foreign policy. In February, several days before the invasion, he said: “I gotta be honest with you. I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine.” Over the summer, Mr. Vance, a Marine veteran, sought to clarify that, saying, “We want the Ukrainians to be successful,” and calling Mr. Putin “the bad guy.” But he added, “We’ve got to stop the money spigot to Ukraine eventually.” Mr. Vance is hardly the first candidate backed by Mr. Thiel, who has been underwriting political allies for many years — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri among them, not to mention Mr. Trump. But his relationship runs deeper than most. Mr. Vance met Mr. Thiel in 2011 while studying at Yale Law School. He attended a speech in which Mr. Thiel lamented the failings of both the legal world and Silicon Valley, and he called it “the most significant moment of my time at Yale.” Within a half-decade, he was hired to work at Mithril Capital, one of Mr. Thiel’s venture funds. Mr. Vance gained celebrity for writing “Hillbilly Elegy,” a best-selling memoir from 2016 about his hardscrabble Ohio roots. He co-founded Narya in 2020 with Mr. Thiel’s backing, envisioning it as an Ohio-based venture fund that would focus on the Midwest instead of Silicon Valley. But Mr. Thiel’s imprint remains, starting with the name, which follows the Thielist convention of using various details from “The Lord of the Rings.” Narya is named for one of the “Rings of Power” that was forged, per J.R.R. Tolkien, by the “Elven-smiths of Eregion” in the Second Age, under the watchful eye of the evil wizard Sauron. This took place in Middle-earth, presumably a long way from Ohio. The nine companies that Narya lists in its portfolio include AppHarvest, a Kentucky based company that is developing indoors farms, and a Catholic prayer and meditation app called Hallow. But Rumble is the highest-profile of these. Popular Rumble videos this year have headlines like “Biden’s Invasion at the Southern Border Is Next Step to Global Government” and “George Soros’ Shocking New Plans.” RT’s livestream has received nearly five million views since Rumble began hosting it in March. On Sept. 10, an RT report on Rumble mocked “Kiev’s flawed counteroffensive” as “incredibly unsuccessful,” even as Ukraine was on the cusp of sweeping gains. A more recent RT piece interviewed Ukrainians sympathetic to Russia on the front lines, including one woman saying, “I’m sure the Russian troops will not leave us.” Typical headlines seek to project a sense of competence onto Mr. Putin’s beleaguered military (“Russian sea-based missile strikes hit all designated targets”) and recklessness onto Ukraine and its Western allies (“Ukraine hits Donetsk civilian areas with over 200 NATO-supplied shells”). Brian Doherty, an outside spokesman for Rumble, said the company’s platform was open to those who “hold politically unpopular views, so long as they comply with our content policies,” adding, “We cannot fight aggressive authoritarians by surrendering a key principle that separates us from them.” He also pointed to instances when users on Twitter and YouTube shared video clips of Mr. Huynh talking on RT about his capture. But Rumble provides an official outlet for RT, while both Twitter and YouTube’s parent, Google, have taken steps to curb its content — though YouTube has been more aggressive. The company removed an RT clip within hours of being asked about it by The Times. Ivy Choi, a YouTube spokeswoman, said, “YouTube channels associated with Russian state-funded news channels are blocked on our platform, globally.” Anna Belkina, RT’s deputy editor in chief, said that the company “always follows the highest journalistic principles in its reporting,” and that “interviewing inmates seems to be quite standard for The New York Times.” She added, “We hope that you’ve provided ample evidence that the inmates weren’t coerced or tortured.” Mr. Drueke is a 40-year-old Army veteran who was working as a delivery driver in Alabama when the war broke out. Mr. Huynh is a 27-year-old former Marine. Both are from Alabama and were inspired by news coverage to travel to Ukraine and join other foreigners fighting on the ground. They were captured after coming under fire during a reconnaissance mission, and held for 104 or 105 days — they are not sure of the precise number — mostly in Donetsk, a Russian-occupied region in eastern Ukraine. They were freed in September as part of a prisoner exchange. “Those interviews were very much under duress,” Mr. Drueke said after The Times sent him a link to the video, which he had not previously seen. He said that his captors were watching off camera, “pantomiming, scribbling things on paper, stopping the interview so they can tell us to try again.” “We were stored in a closet in between interviews,” he said. “They bring us in the room, sit us down in front of a light and camera, where it felt like just another interrogation,” adding, “We didn’t even know if it was media or an interrogation.” Mr. Huynh, after watching the video, said: “We know it’s a lie from our experience. We know that they’re just straight up putting words in our mouths.”",1

It is past time for clearheaded Americans, no matter their political party, to stand up and say, “No more!” We must find ways to come together, support one another without prejudice, and build the coalitions that reject violence, rhetoric, manipulation and the dehumanization of one another. No political party in this country is without responsibility for where we are, but one party clearly advocates division, disrespect, violence and the destruction of our democracy. So much easier to create an enemy than build community. So much easier to perpetuate fear than exercise courage. So much easier to dehumanize than recognize our shared humanity. Kelly Grace SmithFayetteville, N.Y. To the Editor: I don’t understand why an article detailing an apparent planned attack on the speaker of the House was below the fold in the print edition on Saturday. Are we that desensitized to violent physical and political attacks? Nancy Pelosi is second in line for the presidency. This attacker who severely injured her husband with a hammer after screaming “Where is Nancy?” is reportedly steeped in the same election lies and QAnon conspiracy theories espoused daily and viciously at rallies by former President Donald Trump and his followers, like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has voiced support for executing the speaker. It’s a sad commentary on our society how numb to violence we’ve become. I hope the speaker stays safe from this MAGA contingent led by the former president and his ilk. Jane RupertHuntington, N.Y. To the Editor: I was very puzzled when I heard about Paul Pelosi being attacked by a man with a hammer. While I am not a fan of Nancy Pelosi, no one deserves to have someone break into their house trying to kidnap or kill them. I pray that Mr. Pelosi has a speedy and full recovery and that the person who attacked him spends at least the next 20 years in prison. What initially struck me was how this person was able to access the Pelosi house. I would have thought there would have been some sort of security detail there regardless of whether Ms. Pelosi was present. The speaker of the House and people in similar high positions in the government, such as the Supreme Court justices and major cabinet officials, should always have at least one armed agent at their residences in the Washington, D.C., area and in their home districts, whether they are there or not. At a minimum the property should be under 24-hour security monitoring so a police unit can be dispatched to the residence within a matter of minutes. A call to 911 should not have been needed. Wayne L. JohnsonAlexandria, Va. To the Editor: The attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, was horrific, but in many ways it was predictable in the current climate of far-right rhetoric filled with warped political views and intense hatred toward forces they identify as the enemy — all Democrats. This sickening assault is largely the result of such extremists being incited by right-wing propaganda on platforms like Fox News as well as prominent Republicans in Congress and across our country. They have used the most inflammatory rhetoric and often contributed to extremist views that include harassment, targeted threats and calls to violent action. This is the direct result of Donald Trump’s Big Lie. Those forces stoking toxic conspiracy theories include dozens of Republican candidates for office. I urge all responsible Americans to vote for Democratic candidates to block the Republican Party from completing its destructive agenda. There are many important issues in this midterm election, but none more critical than the salvaging of our democracy that is under assault. T.R. JahnsHemet, Calif. To the Editor: Why has Nancy Pelosi been so viciously demonized by MAGA zealots? Perhaps the fact that she has repeatedly stood up to Donald Trump, tearing up his State of the Union address and calling him out fearlessly. The fact that few of her male colleagues have been able to confront him so effectively is a major reason that he has directed his base to see her as his worst enemy. The tactic to “monitor” voters with armed vigilantes drives a new intensity of bullying, increasingly aimed at poll workers. Ordinary citizens now fear for their families if they simply participate in elections with integrity. It takes only a few actual assaults to terrorize the nation and drive good people from public life. Sara HartleyNew York To the Editor: Re “Rule Bars Justice Dept. From Seizing Records or Notes From Reporters” (news article, Oct. 27): The announcement by Attorney General Merrick Garland that the Justice Department would not use subpoenas or seek court orders that would require journalists to provide information leading to the revelation of their confidential sources is an enormous step in the public interest. Many journalists from this and other publications have risked and sometimes endured lengthy jail sentences to protect their sources. Their willingness to do so to ensure that the public would receive significant information about misconduct in and out of government has been essential. Mr. Garland deserves the thanks and appreciation not only of journalists but also the public generally. Floyd AbramsNew YorkThe writer, a First Amendment lawyer, has often represented journalists, including New York Times reporters, who refused to identify their confidential sources. To the Editor: Re “I.O.C. Nudges Federations to Readmit Russians” (Sports, Oct. 25): Pressure is building to bring back Russian athletes into international competitions. As you report, the president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, has called on sports federations to “choose the path of unity and peace,” and not make athletes the victims of their government’s bellicose policies. This is a noble enough sentiment for an ignoble world — though cynics would say it is just the business-as-usual, look-the-other-way stance already adopted in professional sports in which Russians are prominent such as hockey, tennis and soccer. But if Russian athletes are now to be viewed as benign independent contractors, could we not at least urge them to make a small but significant gesture that would help restore some of the tarnished Olympic ideals? Could they take a moment from their training and call for the humanitarian release of the W.N.B.A. player Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison colony for possession of cannabis oil? An N.H.L. star and Olympian such as Alex Ovechkin, who has supported Vladimir Putin in the past, now has an opportunity to use his fame and influence in a good cause. It is well past time to do so. John AllemangToronto To the Editor: Re “The Mood of America Goes Up and Down With the Price of Gas” (front page, Oct. 27): If, on Election Day, a majority of voters consider the price of gas more important than the attempted coup on Jan. 6, then to paraphrase William Faulkner, we do not deserve to survive as a democracy and probably will not.

2022-11-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia-us.html,"US Officials Met With Brittney Griner in Russia, White House Says","U.S. officials met with the jailed American basketball star Brittney Griner on Thursday for the first time since a Russian court rejected her appeal on a drug-possession conviction, and the White House said she was doing “as well as can be expected.” Ms. Griner has become unwillingly ensnared in a geopolitical battle between Russia and the West, and has been grappling with the decision by a Russian appeals court to uphold a nine-year sentence in a penal colony on charges of drug possession. Ms. Griner, who recently turned 32 in Russian custody, pleaded guilty to drug-smuggling charges and apologized for what she called an inadvertent offense. “We are told she is doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances,” the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, told reporters on Air Force One as she traveled with President Biden to New Mexico. Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, also noted that the meeting had occurred, posting on Twitter that officials from the U.S. Embassy in Russia had seen Ms. Griner and seen “firsthand her tenacity and perseverance despite her present circumstances.” In October, one of Ms. Griner’s lawyers said that she was increasingly anxious about her chances of being freed in a prisoner swap and struggling emotionally. She is allowed outside once a day at a penal colony outside Moscow, the lawyer, Alexandr D. Boykov, said in a recent interview. He said she walks for an hour in a small courtyard, and spends the rest of her time in a small cell with two cellmates, sitting and sleeping on a specially elongated bed to accommodate her 6-foot-9 frame. Ekaterina Kalugina, a journalist who visited Ms. Griner in her cell in the springtime, said in a phone interview in October that Ms. Griner’s two cellmates at the time were women who spoke English and were also in prison on drug-related charges. She said that Ms. Griner had been reading a translation of Dostoyevsky’s novel “Demons,” a political tragedy. The Biden administration has been trying to negotiate a prisoner swap with Russia to bring home Ms. Griner and Paul Whelan, an American imprisoned on espionage charges, but with no reported breakthroughs — and extraordinary tension between the two countries over the war in Ukraine — a public pressure campaign from athletes, led by her wife, Cherelle Griner, has intensified. American officials have said the United States has offered to free the imprisoned Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout as part of the deal. He is serving a 25-year prison sentence for conspiring to kill Americans. A week before Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Ms. Griner, an All-Star center with the W.N.B.A.’s Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was detained at an airport near Moscow after customs officials found two vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. She had been en route to Yekaterinburg, a city near the Ural Mountains, where she played for a women’s basketball team. Ms. Jean-Pierre said, in comments livestreamed by the White House, that embassy officials in Moscow were able to visit Brittney Griner on Thursday. “As we have said before, the U.S. government made a significant offer to the Russians to resolve the current unacceptable and wrongful detentions of American citizens Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan,” she said. She added: “I can also tell you that in the subsequent weeks, despite a lack of good faith negotiation by the Russians, the U.S. government has continued to follow up on that offer and propose alternative potential ways forward with Russians through all available channels. “This continues to be a top priority,” Ms. Jean-Pierre said.",7
2022-11-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/us/politics/bill-richardson-griner-whelan.html,Can Bill Richardson Free Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan?,"WASHINGTON — It was days before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and Paula and Joey Reed were losing hope of seeing their son, Trevor, freed from a Russian prison. Then a call came from an aide to Bill Richardson. The aide said that Mr. Richardson, a former New Mexico politician known for striking deals with foreign strongmen to free American prisoners, was headed to Moscow to negotiate Trevor’s release. “I said, What about the State Department?” Joey Reed recalled in an interview. The aide, Mickey Bergman, replied that the department’s attitude had been, “butt out of this,” according to Mr. Reed, and that the trip was “basically a guerrilla operation.” Two months later, Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine, was free. After more than two years behind bars on charges that he had assaulted two police officers, he was released on April 27 in a prisoner exchange between the Kremlin and the Biden administration. “I really feel that if Richardson hadn’t gotten involved,” Trevor would still be there, Ms. Reed said. Whether that is true, however, is hard to say. U.S. officials have never credited Mr. Richardson with any significant role in the release, instead describing their own urgent work to free Mr. Reed once his health began to fail. And after Mr. Richardson traveled to Moscow again in September, this time trying to win the release of the jailed Americans Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, the Biden administration signaled that his help was not welcome. “Our concern is that private citizens attempting to broker a deal do not and cannot speak for the U.S. government,” the State Department spokesman, Ned Price, said at a Sept. 14 briefing. Freelance diplomacy, he warned, was “likely to hinder” efforts to free Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan. He noted that Mr. Richardson’s trip had not been coordinated with the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Asked about Mr. Richardson later that day, a National Security Council spokesman, John F. Kirby, told CNN that “private citizens should not be in Moscow at all right now.” In an interview, Mr. Richardson said he was still on the case and sought to downplay any disagreements. “In these hostage relationships between government and private efforts, sometimes friction and tensions emerge,” he said. “On the Whelan-Griner case, we are working together and coordinating our efforts.” “But,” he added, “my first responsibility is to the American hostages and their families, and not to the government.” For decades in politics and as a private citizen, Mr. Richardson has specialized in helping to win the release of Americans detained overseas, traveling to danger zones like North Korea and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and producing miracles that the U.S. government alone could not. Now the families of Mr. Whelan and Ms. Griner — whose appeal of a nine-year sentence on drug smuggling charges was denied by a Russian court last week — are hoping that Mr. Richardson can deliver again. But several people who have worked with Mr. Richardson or followed his efforts closely are uneasy. They describe him as a rogue publicity hound who risks complicating the Biden administration’s delicate talks with Russia — and who may even be playing into the Kremlin’s hands. The Biden administration’s warnings about Mr. Richardson’s efforts follow other disputes in recent years over his role in prisoner exchanges and reflect the pressures of dealing with foreign governments that turn American prisoners into bargaining chips. “There are some clear benefits but also some real risks” that come with the involvement of an outsider like Mr. Richardson, said Danielle Gilbert, a specialist in prisoner negotiations at the Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College. Ms. Gilbert praised Mr. Richardson’s past successes and said he can play a valuable role by meeting with unsavory actors and brainstorming ideas that would be off limits to American officials. The danger, she said, is that a freelance diplomat could wind up working at cross purposes with the U.S. government, potentially “putting deals in jeopardy.” During his long political career, Mr. Richardson, 74, was known for his folksy, unpretentious style and self-promotional skill. After eight years as New Mexico’s governor and a failed 2008 Democratic presidential bid, his political career ended when his nomination to be President Barack Obama’s commerce secretary was withdrawn amid a federal investigation into state contracting while he was governor. The case was dropped. Before that he served as a New Mexico congressman, as well as energy secretary and United Nations ambassador under President Bill Clinton. As a young member of the House Intelligence Committee in the 1980s, he developed a flair for secretive back-channel diplomacy, and Mr. Clinton dispatched him on sensitive missions to places like Iraq, North Korea, Afghanistan and Sudan. Mr. Richardson once wrote a book titled “How to Sweet-Talk a Shark” and has shared such maxims as: “Respect the other side. Try to connect personally. Use sense of humor. Let the other side save face.” Today he runs the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, which says it “promotes global peace and dialogue.” Based in a Santa Fe office building, the center has just two full-time employees: Mr. Richardson and Mr. Bergman, a former Israel Defense Forces paratrooper who specializes in what he calls “fringe diplomacy.” Mr. Richardson says the families of prisoners do not pay him. He never represents himself as working on behalf of the U.S. government, he says, but keeps U.S. officials briefed on his efforts. He is now assisting several Americans held in Russia, he says, along with an American prisoner of war held by Russians in eastern Ukraine. But most prominent among them are Ms. Griner, a W.N.B.A. star arrested in mid-February when authorities at a Moscow airport found hash oil in her luggage, and Mr. Whelan, a security consultant arrested at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 and convicted of espionage. The State Department considers them both “wrongfully detained” and is treating them as hostages. Under growing pressure to act, the Biden administration offered in June to trade Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer serving a long federal prison sentence, for Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan. Russia has not publicly responded. Mr. Richardson would not describe his contacts but often notes that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, served as his counterpart when he was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. According to Paula Reed, Mr. Richardson approached Mr. Lavrov about her son’s case and the Russian diplomat directed Mr. Richardson to “a wealthy third party.” After Trevor Reed was freed in April, in exchange for the release of a Russian pilot convicted in a U.S. court of drug smuggling, Mr. Richardson publicly thanked a man named Ara Abramyan. An Armenian businessman who lives in Moscow, Mr. Abramyan boasts of his close ties to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, who has awarded him Russia’s prestigious Order for Merit to the Fatherland. Mr. Putin “gives instructions, and I fulfill them,” Mr. Abramyan said in 2015. While U.S. officials are studiously tight-lipped about the prospects of freeing Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan, Mr. Richardson is willing to prognosticate. “I remain cautiously positive about my prediction that a deal can be reached before the end of the year to bring Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan home,” he said. “From my experience, once the legal process concludes, there is an opportunity to make a deal.” He warned of “a few bumps in the road nonetheless” but said “the White House strategy is sound and realistic.” He told CNN in early October that he expects a “two-for-two” swap, returning two Russians for the pair of Americans. U.S. officials have set no such timeline for a deal, however, nor is there evidence that the Biden administration is willing to sweeten its known offer to return Mr. Bout, who was convicted in federal court in 2011 of conspiring to kill Americans. There is evidence that Moscow welcomes Mr. Richardson’s role. On July 8, Russia’s state-run news service Tass quoted the country’s deputy foreign minister, Sergey A. Ryabkov, as saying that “the aspiration of such a respected figure to aid his compatriots is praiseworthy.” Speaking on CNN, Mr. Richardson was less politic about his dealings with Biden administration officials. “There are a lot of nervous Nellies in the government that think they could know it all, and that’s not the case,” he said. “Look at my track record over 30 years.” In recent years, friction with U.S. officials has been a recurring theme in Mr. Richardson’s work. During the Trump administration, Mr. Richardson tangled with officials over tactics and credit in the release of Xiyue Wang, an American graduate student imprisoned in Tehran. Last November, when Mr. Richardson brought home the American journalist Danny Fenster on a chartered flight from Myanmar, the Biden administration’s special envoy for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens, thanked him for “securing the release.” “Sometimes it takes an unconventional approach, and it can’t be the government,” Mr. Carstens added. But when Rolling Stone magazine recently wrote about the case, a White House spokesperson corrected Mr. Carstens’s account, saying: “The government secured Fenster’s release.” The White House declined to comment for this story. Last month, after President Biden approved a prisoner exchange with Venezuela that freed seven Americans, the Richardson Center released a statement citing Mr. Richardson’s many efforts on their behalf. In a background briefing for reporters detailing the release, however, a senior administration official did not mention Mr. Richardson at all but noted that only the U.S. president can grant clemency and therefore only the U.S. government can negotiate a prisoner exchange. Similarly, U.S. officials have not described Mr. Richardson as key to Trevor Reed’s release. In a July email to supporters, Paul Whelan’s brother, David, wrote that his family had contacted Mr. Richardson in early 2019 “when we were at sea” about how to help Paul. But he acknowledged the limits of a freelance negotiator who cannot bargain on behalf of the U.S. government and might be unaware of official efforts. “This means they can both help and hinder a possible resolution of a detainee’s case,” Mr. Whelan added. Paula Reed is sure that Mr. Richardson helped. When Mr. Richardson flew to Moscow in February — on a private jet borrowed from the FedEx founder Fred Smith — he was told by his intermediary that Mr. Putin had personally approved trading Mr. Reed for the jailed Russian pilot, Konstantin Yaroshenko, she said. During a March 30 meeting in the Oval Office, Paula and Joey Reed said, they told Mr. Biden that they were aware of Mr. Putin’s offer. That made it nearly impossible, in their telling, for Mr. Biden not to act. Mr. Richardson’s visit to Moscow “was critical,” Paula Reed said. “We could go in there saying, ‘We know there’s a deal on the table.’” U.S. officials have not pointed to that meeting as decisive, however. And experts note that Mr. Biden has approved exchanges for other American prisoners without first meeting their families. Paula Reed thinks Mr. Richardson deserves more credit from the Biden administration. But she understands its frustration. “With Bill Richardson inserting himself, and then to take credit with these hostage returns, is kind of a negative deal” for U.S. officials, she said. “That’s all Richardson’s looking for: ‘Hey, thank you, we appreciate it.’”",7
2022-11-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/opinion/ukraine-congress-progressives-letter.html,Opinion | The Backlash to Progressives’ Ukraine Letter Shows the New Cancel Culture in Washington,"Rarely does a document so bland generate such heat. On Oct. 24, 30 progressive members of Congress wrote President Biden a letter about Ukraine policy. The letter blamed Russia for the war. It endorsed military aid to Ukraine and long-term security guarantees to ensure it remains “free and independent.” And while it proposed “a proactive diplomatic push” to end the fighting, it also insisted that it “is not America’s place to pressure Ukraine’s government regarding sovereign decisions.” Given that Mr. Biden has already said the war must end in a “negotiated settlement” and that his top advisers are already talking to their Russian counterparts, the missive largely encouraged him to continue what he’s already doing. Daniel Drezner, an international relations scholar at Tufts University, called it “a giant nothingburger.” And yet its release sparked a ferocious backlash. An official from the centrist think tank Third Way claimed the letter’s proposals “dishonor” the Ukrainian people’s “courageous sacrifice by suggesting they give up everything they’ve been fighting for.” Representative Jake Auchincloss, Democrat of Massachusetts, called it “an olive branch to a war criminal.” Within a day of the letter’s publication, its authors retracted it. They retracted it because a new Cold War atmosphere now pervades Washington. Politicians who suggest even modest compromises with America’s great power foes face censure from both sides of the aisle. During the last Cold War, fears of appearing soft on communism cowed progressive legislators into silence as the United States descended into war in Vietnam. After the attacks of Sept. 11, many Democrats acquiesced to the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq because they feared being called soft on terrorism. When it comes to Russia and China, another climate of conformity is now taking hold. Unless challenged, it could eventually bring disaster as well. Ukraine’s struggle to recapture its stolen territory deserves America’s vigorous support. But it does not obligate Congress to stop asking hard questions. And the fierce response to last week’s letter makes it less likely that Democrats will ask them. As the letter notes, legislators are “responsible for the expenditure of tens of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in military assistance” to Ukraine. According to the Stimson Center, a foreign policy think tank, Washington has sent Ukraine more in military aid this year than it gave either Afghanistan’s or Iraq’s military at the height of the war on terrorism. The aid is warranted, but its volume and speed raise the possibility of widespread corruption. “Even if it’s a noble cause, there’s going to be theft. There’s going to be misconduct. There’s going to be nepotism,” warned John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, this summer. But despite pleas from good-government groups, Congress and the Biden administration have neither folded Ukraine into the Afghanistan special inspector general’s portfolio nor confirmed permanent inspectors general for the State and Defense Departments as a whole. Unless progressives demand stronger oversight, they will cede the issue to America First conservatives like Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson, who use concerns about corruption to mask the fact that they don’t care what happens to Ukraine at all. If progressives risk being browbeaten into silence over Ukraine, there’s an even greater danger that they will acquiesce to America’s increasingly confrontational policy toward China. The more relations between Washington and Beijing deteriorate, the less effectively the two governments can work together against environmental apocalypse and future pandemics. And the greater the risk of a nuclear confrontation over Taiwan. Yet rather than tell voters that cooperation with China saves American lives and promotes progressive values, many Democrats seem terrified of appearing softer than their Republican rivals on Beijing. When asked in the Pennsylvania Senate debate to name “the greatest foreign threat to the United States,” John Fetterman didn’t answer climate change, which risks rendering swaths of the country uninhabitable. He responded that he’d “stand firm against China” and accused his opponent, Mehmet Oz, of manufacturing merchandise there. For close to half a century, America’s “one China” policy — which requires keeping relations between the United States and Taiwan unofficial — has helped keep the peace in one of the most dangerous regions on Earth. But when Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi undermined that compact this summer by becoming the highest-level American official to visit the island in a quarter-century, thus prompting a vigorous military response from Beijing, few Democrats in Congress expressed opposition. Nor have many congressional Democrats challenged Mr. Biden’s repeated statements that the United States would use force to defend Taiwan. Four times now, the president has casually upended a decades-old American policy of strategic ambiguity and committed the United States to wage war, even though the Constitution grants that authority to Congress. Yet Washington progressives have stayed largely silent. They’ve also acquiesced to higher military budgets. When asked why most Democrats in Congress had voted to allocate even more money to the military than the Biden administration requested, Representative Ro Khanna admitted that the political climate had left his colleagues scared: “I think it’s an irrational fear that our party has of being painted in a TV ad as being weak.” That fear is nothing new. In June 1964, President Lyndon Johnson told Senator Richard Russell that Americans will “forgive you for anything except being weak.” Two months later, that fear led even congressional liberals to overwhelmingly support the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which authorized Johnson’s disastrous escalation of the Vietnam War. Like the war on terrorism, cold wars create their own cancel culture. They encourage politicians to swallow their doubts as conflicts escalate. They make compromise and cooperation with America’s adversaries appear dishonorable. The backlash against last week’s Ukraine letter will now serve as a cautionary tale. When a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine finally becomes possible — a solution that may require the United States to relax some sanctions on Russia — members of Congress will be wary of endorsing it, even if it enjoys Kyiv’s tacit support. When hawks push to ditch the “one China” policy entirely, many congressional progressives will fear objecting, lest they be accused of sympathy for Xi Jinping. The greatest current threat to wise American foreign policy isn’t polarization. It’s groupthink. That groupthink has a greater hold today than it did a week ago.

2022-11-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/opinion/letters/midterm-elections.html,Opinion | How the Two Parties and Their Voters View the Election,"To the Editor: Re “Biden Faces Polarized U.S. as Vote Nears” (White House Memo, front page, Nov. 7): The framing of your headline and the reference to “polarizing politics” within the article are deeply destructive. While the Democratic Party has become more progressive in working to defeat climate disaster and advancing the rights of our most vulnerable citizens, it remains overwhelmingly centrist by global standards. Meanwhile, the Republican Party embraces a leader and national candidates who openly demonize those with differing views, incite violence against them, and undermine our Constitution’s promise of a democratic republic by attacking voting rights and democracy itself. Republicans, of course, love to hear today’s politics framed as “polarization,” which implicitly tells readers that “both sides” bear blame. But such false equivalency is neither fair nor objective. Let’s hope that voters choose the party and candidates that favor progress toward multiracial democracy over a descent toward authoritarianism. Jeff MilchenBozeman, Mont.The writer is the founder of Reclaim Democracy! To the Editor: Re “In Rich Suburb, Republicans vs. ‘Trumplicans’” (front page, Nov. 7), about Greenwich, Conn.: Democrats trade in hysteria in their last-ditch attempts to save the midterms. “Our democracy teeters at the abyss” is the pitch, both depressing and untrue. American democracy will prevail as it always has. At the same time, the continuing efforts of Donald Trump and his supporters to undermine the public’s confidence in the system of free elections that binds us together is unforgivable, nothing more than vanity and poor sportsmanship. I was 8 years old when John F. Kennedy beat Richard Nixon in the presidential election of 1960. The race was so close that we didn’t know until the next morning that Kennedy had won. There were said to be irregularities in the voting. Nevertheless, Nixon conceded graciously because it was best for the country and because his devotion to his party was real. For all that Trump supporters boast endlessly of their “patriotism,” it could be argued that those of us proud to be called RINOs are the true patriots. Margaret McGirrGreenwich, Conn. To the Editor: Dan Barry’s writing compelled me to seek a new perspective — the perspective of a polarized nation. Although this article focused on one town, it’s important to note that this is a national issue. When a person has strong ties to their political party, it often encourages the villainization of the opposing party. We must ask ourselves, “What progress can truly be made if we don’t work together?” I urge each reader to form their own opinions and not be swayed by political figures or polarizing language. We must learn to be mindful of how we encourage polarization through our interactions with people of opposing or similar views. How can we expect to be listened to if we do not first listen to others? The next time you’re in a political setting or conversation, look for similarities and not differences. Look for hope and not despair. Look for progress and not conformity within your party. Peyton SchooneMinden, Neb. To the Editor: Re “Republicans Are Doubling Down on Trumpism. It’s Going to Work,” by Daniel McCarthy (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Nov. 6): Mr. McCarthy argues that Republican voters are entrepreneurial, seeking the freshest, most exciting candidates. I have a different view. I’m convinced that Republican voters see politics as entertainment, not policy and governance. The Republican Party increasingly resembles reality TV, replete with cartoonish, one-dimensional characters like Donald Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Kari Lake, etc. The attendees at Mr. Trump’s rallies look like the fans at pro wrestling matches. They cheer for those speakers who are most inclined to hit Democrats with metaphorical chairs and spew outrageous attacks. The wilder, the more fantastic, the better. For the Republican base, policy doesn’t matter. Democracy doesn’t matter. Elections are just seasons of the Trump reality show writ large. And, like pro wrestling, the faux villainy and outrageousness of the Republican spectacle have to keep getting notched up to keep the rubes entertained. Wait until the next election … John RantaHancock, N.H. To the Editor: Some have criticized Republicans for not having a plan to deal with inflation, despite the centrality of the issue to their case for election. This is unfair. The plan is: Take credit if it subsides, and blame President Biden, who will conveniently still be in office, if it doesn’t. Andrew RatzkinHastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. To the Editor: I pray to God that sensible judges in the courts will save us from the election conspiracists as they did in 2020. Mark BradyDix Hills, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “Many Muslims Are Ambivalent About Oz’s Milestone Run for Senate” (news article, Nov. 6): As a Turkish-American Muslim myself, I welcome Dr. Mehmet Oz’s not commenting on his faith or visiting mosques. I suggest that other candidates follow in his path and not turn houses of worship into stages for political theater. This is what separation of church (or in this case mosque) and state looks like. Sadly, Americans have become all too accustomed to our leaders ignoring this basic tenet of democracy. It is now newsworthy when a politician does not muddy the waters with their religion, whereas the opposite should be the case. Sahin AltunerIzmir, Turkey To the Editor: Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff who sat passively on his office sofa while armed thugs attacked our Capitol, is still quietly sabotaging our democracy. In “Republicans Begin a Push for Ballot Watching Ahead of Election Day” (news article, Nov. 6), you report that Mr. Meadows is a senior partner with the Election Integrity Network, which places hypervigilant trained observers in ballot processing centers to scrutinize the counting of ballots. How ironic! Mr. Meadows, champion of voter integrity, has a sketchy history in this area, most recently in September 2020 when he registered to vote in Macon County, N.C., using as his address a rural mobile home that his wife had rented briefly as a vacation home. Mr. Meadows does not own or live at that property and is not known to have spent a single night there. Using that address, he was sent an absentee ballot by Macon County, and used it to vote. Kate FahertyHillsborough, N.C. To the Editor: My past observance of Kristallnacht (Nov. 9-10, 1938) was limited to attending a synagogue lecture to hear survivors and/or historians speak about how in a few short years Nazi antisemitism, which began with insulting and bullying Jews on the street, culminated in the largest pogrom in Western Europe since the Middle Ages. When I attend this year’s program, I won’t be thinking about the Jews in 1938 Germany, but Jews in 2022 America, where antisemitic incidents have risen to their highest levels in decades. Paul L. NewmanMerion Station, Pa. To the Editor: ﻿It is well past time for the West to declare full speed ahead on indictments against Russia’s leadership for war crimes committed in Ukraine. Further, it is well past time for those governments to start the process of forfeiture of the $300 billion of Russian assets frozen in the West and to state clearly that it will be Russian money that pays for reparations and rebuilding in Ukraine after the war. Russia must be put on notice that the more it prosecutes this illegal war, the more it will need to pay to fix things and the greater the legal consequences for its leaders. David TannerSan Diego",1

Ms. Griner was instead being transferred from a jail outside Moscow and thrust into Russia’s vast and opaque penal colony system, lawyers said. Beyond that, little was known. Ms. Griner’s legal team said in a statement that her intended destination was unknown and that it expected to be officially notified, along with the U.S. Embassy, once she had arrived. The process can take up to two weeks. It has been more than eight months since the W.N.B.A. star was seized after she flew into an airport near Moscow with a small amount of hash oil in her luggage. She has apologized repeatedly for what she says was an unintentional act, and pleaded guilty to the charges. Late last month, a Russian court upheld the nine-year prison sentence imposed on Ms. Griner, 32, setting the stage for her transfer to a penal colony, even as American and Russian officials broached the possibility of a prisoner exchange. Those negotiations came at a low point in relations between the two countries. The sentence imposed on Ms. Griner, an All-Star center with the Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was harsher than those ordinarily imposed for the drug infraction, experts say, and critics say Moscow is using her as a political pawn. Her arrest came just days before Russia invaded Ukraine. American officials have repeatedly denounced the treatment of Ms. Griner, and they did so again on Wednesday. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, in a statement, called Ms. Griner’s transfer to a penal colony “another injustice layered on her ongoing unjust and wrongful detention.” And President Biden directed his administration to “prevail on her Russian captors to improve her treatment and the conditions she may be forced to endure in a penal colony,” the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said in her own statement. Ms. Jean-Pierre said the United States was “unwavering in its commitment to its work on behalf of Brittney and other Americans detained in Russia,” including Paul Whelan, a former Marine who in 2020 was sentenced to 16 years in a high-security Russian prison on espionage charges. Russian and American officials have signaled that Ms. Griner’s fate may be decided during high-level negotiations over a potential exchange for Russian inmates held in the United States. But those talks could not begin in earnest until the legal process was completed, Russia officials said. That is now the case, but for the moment, Ms. Griner’s whereabouts is likely to be shrouded in mystery. President Biden said in a news conference on Wednesday that he hoped the negotiations could enter a new phase, now that the midterm elections were over. “My guess is, my hope is, that now that the election is over, that Mr. Putin will be able to discuss with us and be willing to talk more seriously about a prisoner exchange,” he said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Drawn-out transfers to a penal colony are a longtime practice in Russia, as they were in the Soviet Union before it. The process is known as staging. Prisoners are typically not allowed to communicate with the outside world for a week or two while they are moved, and lawyers and family members do not know where they are going, learning in which penal colony the sentence will be served only once a prisoner arrives. “As we work through this very difficult phase of not knowing exactly where B.G. is or how she is doing,” Lindsay Kagawa Colas, Ms. Griner’s agent, said in a statement, “we ask for the public’s support in continuing to write letters and express their love and care for her.” The W.N.B.A. players’ union, the Women’s National Basketball Players Association, responded to the penal colony news by saying: “We stand with Brittney Griner and will continue to call on all Americans and the global sports community to do the same with even more vigilance. We are crushed that this scary, seemingly never-ending nightmare continues. The lack of clarity and transparency in the process compounds the pain.” Penal colonies are notorious for abusive treatment of inmates, overcrowding and harsh conditions. Political prisoners like Aleksei A. Navalny and members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot have previously been sent to them to serve sentences. At any given time, there are usually around 350 foreigners from what the Russians call “far abroad,” meaning countries that were not part of the Soviet Union, serving sentences in penal colonies, prison officials have said. Usually, about a third are jailed on drug charges, they said. Asked whether foreigners are treated any differently, a senior official with Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service said some years ago that they were not. The only difference is that they have a right to visits from consular officials from their home country, the official, Sergey Esipov, was quoted as telling the RIA Novosti news agency. “There are no special conditions,” he said. “All foreigners serve their sentences on the grounds and in the manner prescribed by Russian law.” Reporting was contributed by Neil MacFarquhar, Ivan Nechepurenko, Ruth Maclean and Andrew E.

Her case has become part of a geopolitical struggle between Russia and the United States, and the Biden administration has been trying to secure a deal for her release. Ms. Griner’s legal team said in a statement that her destination was unknown and that they expected to be notified through official mail, along with the U.S. Embassy, once she has arrived, a process that can take up to two weeks. Ms. Griner, a 32-year-old star player for the W.N.B.A.’s Phoenix Mercury and two-time Olympic gold medalist, has been detained in Russia since February, when customs officials at an airport near Moscow found two vape cartridges containing a small amount of hashish oil in her luggage as she was traveling to join her Russian professional team. A Russian court convicted her in August of trying to smuggle narcotics, and an appeals court upheld her nine-year prison sentence in October. Ms. Griner, who pleaded guilty, has apologized for what she called an inadvertent mistake, saying that the small amount of hashish oil appeared in her luggage because of negligence. U.S. officials met with her last week, and the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said she was doing “as well as can be expected under the circumstances.” On Wednesday, Ms. Jean-Pierre said in a statement that the president had directed his administration to “prevail on her Russian captors to improve her treatment and the conditions she may be forced to endure in a penal colony.” She added that the U.S. government was “unwavering in its commitment to its work on behalf of Brittney and other Americans detained in Russia,” including Paul Whelan, a former Marine who in 2020 was sentenced to 16 years in a high-security Russian prison on espionage charges. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken echoed those sentiments in a statement and called Ms. Griner’s transfer to a remote penal colony “another injustice layered on her ongoing unjust and wrongful detention.” A drawn-out transfer to a penal colony from a Russian jail, where detainees are kept during their trials and for some time afterward, is a longtime practice in the Soviet and Russian systems, known as staging. Prisoners are typically not allowed to communicate with the outside world for a week or two while they are moved, and lawyers and family members do not know where the inmates are going — learning which penal colony the sentence will be served in only once the prisoner arrives. “As we work through this very difficult phase of not knowing exactly where B.G. is or how she is doing,” Lindsay Kagawa Colas, Ms. Griner’s agent, said in a statement, using her client’s initials, “we ask for the public’s support in continuing to write letters and express their love and care for her.” Ms. Colas said that her team remained in close contact with the U.S. government and the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, an organization run by Bill Richardson, a former New Mexico politician who is known for striking deals with foreign officials to free American prisoners. Russian and American officials have signaled that Ms. Griner’s fate would be decided during high-level negotiations over a potential exchange for Russian inmates held in the United States. And Russian officials have indicated that a prisoner swap process could not begin in earnest until all legal due process had been fulfilled. Ms. Griner’s lost appeal and her transfer to a penal colony mean that all legal procedures have now been completed and that her sentence has officially come into force. Penal colonies are notorious for abusive treatment of inmates, overcrowding and harsh conditions. Political prisoners like Aleksei A. Navalny and members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot have previously been sent to serve sentences in penal colonies. Andrew E. Kramer and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.",7
2022-11-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/world/europe/ukraine-us-election-republicans.html,"In Wake of U.S. Election, Ukrainian Lawmakers Will Reach Out to Washington","KYIV, Ukraine — Throughout the war with Russia, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has complained about the reluctance of the United States to provide the powerful and accurate weapons his country needed. Until recently, he had not had to worry that the flow might be reduced or even cut off. But in the weeks before Election Day in the United States, with a drumbeat of predictions about a Republican sweep of both houses of Congress, those fears grew uncomfortably real as leading Republicans spoke about reviewing the “blank check” policy for Ukraine. Ukrainian officials, schooled in American politics and the need for bipartisan support, remained steadfastly apolitical in the weeks leading up to Tuesday’s vote. On Wednesday, as the predicted red wave seemed to be more of a ripple, officials expressed cautious optimism that the existential threat of an aid cutoff had diminished. Volodymyr Ariev, a lawmaker with the opposition European Solidarity Party, said of particular concern would be the scale of victories for far-left or far-right candidates, Democrat or Republican, who have been critical of Ukraine aid or advocated a quick diplomatic settlement that would be anathema to the Ukrainian government. Mr. Ariev, who is organizing a delegation of Ukrainian lawmakers to visit Washington in December, said, “We understand one thing: The danger we see from the so-called radical wings of both parties, the far-right Republicans and far-left Democrats. They could start a conversation about stopping aid to Ukraine.” Ukraine, he said, should work to retain bipartisan support regardless of the outcome. “We need to maintain our contacts and communication with both parties. We need to extend it, we need to intensify it, and we need to talk to both parties for support.” The United States is by far the largest foreign supplier of weaponry to the Ukrainian Army. But through the course of the war, the Biden administration has carefully calibrated weapons assistance to Ukraine, holding back longer-range and more powerful weapons for fear of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory that might drag NATO into the war. The United States has nevertheless stepped up to ever more powerful and sophisticated artillery and rocket launchers as the war has progressed, and just this week delivered a leading-edge air defense missile system, called NASAM, to defend against strikes by missiles and Iranian-made drones on cities and electrical power plants. Mr. Ariev said the delegation would include about a dozen members of Parliament from the ruling party, Servant of the People, and the principal opposition parties, European Solidarity, Fatherland and Holos. They will attend a security conference and seek meetings with newly elected American lawmakers from the Democratic and Republican parties, he said. Mr. Ariev said he would propose a larger role for the U.S. Congress and government agencies in overseeing American military and financial aid inside Ukraine, to “lift suspicions we heard during the campaign that it is not transparent.” He added: “We should trust our partners as our partners trust us, it should be a mutual thing.” But they are not entirely sure who their partners will be. In a White House news conference about the midterms on Wednesday, President Biden insisted that he believed foreign aid would continue uninterrupted to Ukraine. A majority of Republicans have so far supported assistance for Ukraine over the nearly nine months since the invasion, voting for billions of dollars in military and financial aid. But the more conservative, America First wing of the party has been more threatening. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia told a rally of Trump supporters in Iowa last week that, “under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine.” J.D. Vance, who won his Senate race in Ohio, had said while campaigning that, “We’ve got to stop the money spigot to Ukraine eventually.” And in the event that the Republicans take the House, Representative Kevin McCarthy, who stands to become majority leader, has said that the party will review aid to Ukraine. “I think people are going to be sitting in a recession, and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,” he said last month. The left wing of the Democratic Party, the Progressive Caucus, published a letter in October asking Mr. Biden to pursue direct diplomatic talks with Russia over the war, despite Russian escalations over the fall. But the group quickly retracted the letter, saying it had been prepared in June and released in error. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, visiting Kyiv last week, offered assurances that the Biden administration would work with both parties to assure military aid would continue after the election. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said on Wednesday that he anticipated no softening of American support after the election. “I have repeatedly met with representatives of the Senate and Congress, and each time the delegations were bipartisan,” Mr. Resnikov said at a news conference. “I clearly understand that the support of the United States will remain bipartisan and bicameral, too. I have a personal understanding and feeling that the overwhelming majority of the American people support Ukraine in this unjust war.” Yehor Chernev, a member of Parliament with the ruling Servant of the People party, who will join the Ukrainian delegation, said he would seek to explain Ukraine’s security needs to newly elected members of Congress. “We had long conversations about tanks and jets,” he said of the Ukrainian government’s talks with allies over providing more capable versions of the weapons Ukraine is currently using. “And, still, nothing has been given yet. We could explain why we really need these things now in our counteroffensive, because it will help us move faster.” Mr. Chernev said he would also argue that military aid to Ukraine serves United States security interests. “We are ready to speak with all members of Congress and to deliver our position, and to give more information, and arguments that will change their position on Ukraine,” he said. “The United States cannot allow Russia to win. It will mean authoritarians win their wars. It will open a Pandora’s box in other parts of the world. Why not China next?”",1
2022-11-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/opinion/midterms-election-america-arrow.html,"Opinion | Democracy Survived the Midterm Elections, for Now","You can hold off moving to Canada. You can forgo the call to the New Zealand Embassy on how to become a citizen there. Tuesday’s election really was the most important test since the Civil War of whether the engine of our constitutional system — our ability to peacefully and legitimately transfer power — remains intact. And it looks to have come through — a little dinged up, but OK. I am still not even close to ready to sound the all-clear, to declare that running on a platform of election denialism will never tempt another American politician. But given the unprecedented degree to which election denialism was elevated in this midterm and the way several big-name Trump-imitating knuckleheads who made denialism central to their campaigns got their clocks cleaned —- we may have just dodged one of the biggest arrows ever aimed at the heart of our democracy. To be sure, another arrow could target us at any moment, but the whole U.S. electoral system — in red states and blue — seemed to perform admirably, almost shrugging off the last two years of controversy, diminishing it to what it always was: the shameful fabrication of one man and his most shameless sycophants and imitators. Given the threat posed by Trump denialists to the acceptance and legitimacy of our elections, that is a big deal (and hopefully it will last through the Arizona count). It could not come at a better time as the leaders of both Russia and China have manipulated their systems to entrench themselves in power beyond their previously established terms of office. One of their arguments to their own people in doing so was to point to things like the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection in America and the seeming chaos of our elections to tell their citizens: “That’s what democracy looks like. Is that what you want here?” Indeed, in May, during his commencement address to the U.S. Naval Academy’s graduating class, President Biden recalled when President Xi Jinping of China congratulated him in 2020 on his election: “He said democracies cannot be sustained in the 21st century; autocracies will run the world. Why? Things are changing so rapidly. Democracies require consensus, and it takes time, and you don’t have the time.” For that reason, both Xi and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin — and the supreme leader in Iran now facing an uprising led by Iranian women — lost on Tuesday night, too. Because the more wild and unstable our politics, the less able we become to peacefully transfer power, the easier it is for them to justify never doing so. But while election denialism took a thumping this week as a winning message, none of the things that are still eating away at the foundations of American democracy — and preventing us from actually getting big hard things done — have gone away. I am talking about the way in which our primary system, gerrymandering and social networks have coalesced to steadily poison our national dialogue, steadily polarize our society into political tribes and steadily erode the twin pillars of our democracy: truth and trust. Without being able to agree on what is true, we don’t know which way to go. And without being able to trust one another, we can’t head there together. And everything big and hard needs to be done together. So, our enemies would be wise not to leave us for dead, but we would be even wiser not to conclude that, because we avoided the worst, we’ve locked in the best going forward. Everything is not all right. We are as divided coming out of this election as we were going into it. But to the extent that the red wave did not manifest itself — particularly in swing states like Pennsylvania, where John Fetterman won a Senate seat over the Trump-endorsed Dr. Oz, and in swing districts like one in central Virginia where Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger was re-elected by defeating another Trump-backed candidate — it was because enough independents and moderate Republicans and Democrats showed up to put Fetterman and Spanberger over the top. “There is still a viable group of centrist voters out there, who, when given a valid choice — not everywhere, and not always, but in some key districts — asserted themselves,” Don Baer, who was a communications director in the Clinton White House, told me. “I think there are still a lot of voters saying: ‘We want a viable center, where we can figure out how to make things happen that can really help people, even if it isn’t perfect or all at once. We don’t want every election to be existential.’” The challenge, added Baer, “is, how do you take that sentiment to scale and make it work in Washington on a regular basis?” I don’t know, but, if this election is a sign that we are at least edging back from the brink, it’s because enough Americans still fall into this independent or centrist camp and do not want to keep dwelling on the grievances, lies and fantasies of Donald Trump, which they can see are making the G.O.P. crazy and roiling the whole country. They also don’t want to be shackled by the woke enforcers of the far left, and they are terrified by the spread of the kind of sick political violence that was just visited on Nancy Pelosi’s husband. We owe a huge debt for keeping this center alive to Republican Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and Democratic Representative Elaine Luria. The three of them helped to spearhead the Jan. 6 investigation in Congress and ended up being forced out of office as a result. But the message that committee sent to enough voters — that we must never, ever, ever let something like this happen again — surely also contributed to the absence of a pro-Trump wave in this midterm election. In sum, we did not get a clean bill of health. We got a diagnosis that our political white blood cells did OK in beating back the metastasizing infection that threatened to kill our whole electoral system. But that infection is still here, which is why the doctor advised, “Behave in healthy ways, build back your strength and return in 24 months for another scan.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2022-11-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/world/asia/interpreter-human-rights-commission.html,Can There Be a Rights Reckoning for Nations That Don’t Want to Do It?,"A decade ago, Kate Cronin-Furman, then a Ph.D. student in political science at Columbia University, noticed something odd. The government of Sri Lanka, which the United Nations and international observers had accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians during the final phases of that country’s devastating civil war, had started creating what Cronin-Furman called “strange institutions” that were supposedly tasked with accountability for atrocities during the war. “There was a Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission. There was a so-called Army Court of inquiry. There were a couple of other commissions set up,” said Cronin-Furman, who is now a political science professor at University College London. These proliferating new commissions and courts seemed to accept, for the first time, the possibility that atrocities had taken place, even though the Sri Lankan government was still furiously denying that. But the new institutions seemed to bring few if any results, and accordingly did nothing to stem the torrent of international criticism from survivors’ groups and human rights organizations, or from the countries that had backed calls for an international inquiry. So why create them? Answering that question led Cronin-Furman to a much bigger question: whether, and how, international pressure can convince states to change their behavior, with a specific focus on something they tended to be very, very reluctant to do: provide accountability for mass atrocities. Her answer is the subject of her new book, “Hypocrisy and Human Rights.” To my great surprise, I found it actually gave me some hope about the way power works and can be worked with. Here’s my conversation with Cronin-Furman, edited for length and clarity, about the issue. Amanda Taub: When you went looking for an explanation for these strange institutions, as you called them, what did you discover? Kate Cronin-Furman: The main question that I ended up answering is “How do post-atrocity governments respond to international pressure for accountability when they really, really don’t want to do it?” I mostly focused on the kind of bizarre institutional forms and strategic interactions that emerge when these governments face international pressure from human rights advocates, foreign governments, or the U.N. to do something that is domestically just totally untenable politically: to provide justice and accountability for mass atrocities. These strange institutions are not about convincing anyone who’s demanding justice. Victims are not going to be persuaded by this. Your Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International advocates are not going to be persuaded by this. Foreign policy bureaucracies in global north states that do this kind of work are not going to be persuaded by this. Rather, these institutions are more about providing a fig leaf for those other states that are asked to take a position on accountability. States on the U.N. Human Rights Council, for instance, that would have to be persuaded to vote for a resolution. And basically, it’s about sparing them the embarrassment and the reputational loss of standing up for a human rights abuser. The post-atrocity government itself is saying, “No, no, no, look, we set up this commission! They’re working on reconciliation! Everything’s great. Leave us alone.” And what that does is to offer to these other states the opportunity to say, “Yeah, let’s give them time. They’ve got this institution, and it’s got ‘reconciliation’ right in the name!” And one thing that maybe gets lost sometimes in other conversations about this stuff is that time is really valuable for human-rights-abusing states. I mean, to put it quite starkly, time can give you the opportunity to bulldoze mass graves, to disappear witnesses. For perpetrators to bolster their domestic power centers to protect themselves. Time can give you the ability to get past a domestic election. You know, if a Human Rights Council resolution coming out might imperil your vote share in an upcoming election, just delaying it for three to six months, that’s valuable. Can you give an example of how this has played out in practice? Sri Lanka, while continuing to insist that there had been basically no civilian casualties and definitely no atrocities in the final phases of the war, started to create this series of institutions — all of which had mandates that were sort of adjacent to the question of accountability for human rights violations, but none of which actually took that issue head on. And at first glance, this was really puzzling! Because none of these were compelling to anyone who was actually informed on the human rights issues or engaged on them. But where the reaction was different was in those other countries on the Human Rights Council whose votes would have been needed to impanel a strong international inquiry. In the record of those council meetings, some of which I was actually present for in Geneva, we see these other countries picking up on the language that Sri Lanka used to defend its institutions, picking up on rhetoric about protesting “Western human rights pressure” and, you know, “infringement on Sri Lanka’s sovereignty.” And in the end, it was actually five years before there was an international inquiry empaneled in 2014, and it was much weaker than what anyone wanted in the beginning. And I think that is owed to the fact that Sri Lanka very strategically set up these institutions, exactly at moments of kind of coalescing international pressure and, you know, shopped them quite hard to audiences that might find it persuasive. Obviously this was a loss for the groups that were calling for an immediate, strong international inquiry. But there is a bigger-picture takeaway here that actually struck me as quite optimistic: This suggests that international responses like condemnation and investigation have real weight, because otherwise why go to such lengths to avoid or delay them? If I have a personal motto, it’s that, you know, international institutions and human rights pressure are not doing the thing we want them to be doing, but that doesn’t mean they’re doing nothing. We tend to get into this very all-or-nothing thinking, but it’s really worth looking at what their impacts actually are, and thinking about how we can maximize them and how we can actually use the levers that are there. It seems as if there could be a norm-strengthening effect as well, because when perpetrators do this quasi-compliance, they are in effect publicly stating that these human rights rules should be followed, even if they are denying that they violated them. Which is reassuring to me, in some ways, because it shows a path toward incremental improvements as these norms strengthen over time. That is the hope, right? The fact that these human rights tools exist doesn’t, on its own, do anything. But each time someone picks them up and uses them, at great personal sacrifice and often risk, they make it that much easier and smoother the next time. I think a question a lot of people will have after hearing about this book is what it might mean for accountability for Russian atrocities in Ukraine. I have a much more optimistic read on that situation than what I’m talking about in this book, which are these really hard cases for human rights where you have a repressive, intransigent government and an abused, marginalized population. But the fact that Russia has invaded another country’s territory, and that the people who are suffering under those attacks are the citizens of another state, has made it much less complex for other states to stand up for Ukraine. Usually when we’re talking about serious violations of human rights, the sovereignty concern is like, “Oh, we shouldn’t interfere in this repressive state’s sovereignty here.” But in this case, sovereignty militates in the opposite direction. And because Ukraine is a state, they’ve got their own justice system. They’ve got their own prosecutors, some really good ones. I think the ability of Ukraine to prosecute at least the lower and midlevel folks themselves here is an unalloyed good. Now, I suspect the question people actually want to know the answer to is what the chances are that Putin, or very high up Russian military commanders, will face justice. And that’s one where there’s probably not a particularly optimistic response. They’re not going to land before the International Criminal Court unless a very unexpected series of events occurs. It is probably not out of the question that a different international tribunal could be set up with a mandate to try some of those people. But whether they would actually be able to get custody of them would be quite tricky.",4
2022-11-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/world/europe/banksy-mural-ukraine.html,Banksy Unveils Mural in War-Torn Ukrainian Town,"The British street artist Bansky unveiled his latest creation on Friday: a female gymnast depicted on a war-torn building in Ukraine. In an Instagram post, the anonymous artist posted three photos of the mural with the simple caption, “Borodyanka, Ukraine.” The mural is black and white and features a gymnast, who is dressed in a leotard, doing a handstand on rubble by the building. Borodyanka, a Ukrainian commuter town about 35 miles northwest of Kyiv, was among the first places to be hit by Russian airstrikes after the invasion in February. The town, where at least 200 people were killed in Russian attacks, used to have about 13,000 residents and was described as a simple, modest place to live. In early April, Ukraine recaptured the town. Banksy did not reveal any additional details about his whereabouts, though many suspected the artist had been in the area after murals that align with his style were spotted throughout Ukraine. Many believed another mural near the rubble where the gymnast was displayed was also a Banksy creation. It showed a child throwing a man who many believed resembled Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to the ground during a judo match. (Mr. Putin is a known judo aficionado.) For nearly two decades Banksy has remained anonymous with the help of nondisclosure agreements, trademark law and a team that authenticates his work. His street art, which often has social and political undertones, has been seen around the world from New York City to London, the West Bank and elsewhere. His work has also included stunts, such as in 2018 when a painting self-destructed moments after it was sold for $1.4 million at auction; a rigged frame shredded the canvas. That painting, retitled “Love is in the Bin,” was resold by Sotheby’s in London for $25.4 million, a record for the artist. He goes to great lengths to regulate the resale of his work and prevent fakes.

2022-11-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/opinion/coronavirus-ukraine-climate-inflation.html,Opinion | What Happens When a Cascade of Crises Collide?,"It seems as if the world is encountering a “perfect storm” of simultaneous crises: The coronavirus pandemic is approaching the end of its third year; the war in Ukraine is threatening to go nuclear; extreme climate events are afflicting North America, Europe, Asia and Africa; and inflation is reaching rates unseen in decades and authoritarianism is on the march around the world. But the storm metaphor implies that this simultaneity is an unfortunate and temporary coincidence — that it’s humanity’s bad luck that everything seems to be going haywire all at once. In reality, the likelihood that the current mess is a coincidence is vanishingly small. We’re almost certainly confronting something far more persistent and dangerous. We can see the crises of the moment, but we’re substantially blind to the hidden processes by which those crises worsen one another — and to the true dangers that may be enveloping us all. Today’s mess is better understood as a global polycrisis, a term the historian Adam Tooze at Columbia has recently popularized. The term implies that humanity is dealing with a complex knot of seemingly distinct but actually deeply entangled crises. Precisely because these crises are so entangled, they’re causing worldwide damage much greater than the sum of their individual harms. In the last 10 years, things have gone fundamentally awry. Rates of global hunger, numbers of migrants forced to move within countries and across borders, levels of political authoritarianism, violations of human rights and the occurrence of violent demonstrations and ongoing conflict — these measures of harm are all up, and in some cases by a lot. At the same time, the average human life expectancy dropped to 70.96 years in 2021, from an estimated 72.6 years in 2019, the first decline since the United Nations began tabulating such data in 1950. Taken in isolation, natural and social stresses that can lead to a global crisis are often identified as “systemic risks.” They include climate heating, zoonotic disease outbreaks (disease transmitted from animals to humans), biodiversity decline, worsening economic inequality, financial system instability, ideological extremism, cyberattacks, mounting social and political unrest and geopolitical imbalances. Most of these systemic risks have become more disruptive and hazardous. And in most cases, they’re now worsening faster. In other words, these risks are both amplifying in severity and accelerating in rate. For instance, as the havoc wrought by Covid-19 shows, outbreaks of zoonotic viral disease are becoming more severe. They’re also occurring more frequently. Similarly, climate heating has both amplified and accelerated. We’re seeing, too, a rapid rise in the severity and frequency of extreme events like droughts, floods, storms and heat waves, affecting billions of people and in turn multiplying population displacement, social instability and conflict, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Two factors are powerfully driving risk amplification and acceleration. First, the magnitude of humanity’s resource consumption and pollution output is weakening the resilience of natural systems, worsening the risks of climate heating, biodiversity decline and zoonotic viral outbreaks. Second, vastly greater connectivity among our economic and social systems has sharply raised the volume and velocity of long-distance flows of materials, energy, and information, aggravating such risks as financial system instability, pandemics, economic inequality and ideological extremism. The simultaneity of crises we’re experiencing hints that something else is also happening — risk synchronization. Complex and largely unrecognized causal links among the world’s economic, social and ecological systems may be causing many risks to go critical at nearly the same time. If so, the apparent simultaneity isn’t just a temporary coincidence; it’s likely to persist and could ultimately overwhelm the capacity of society to adapt, and push some places into outright collapse, as we may be witnessing right now in Haiti. But we don’t really know because, generally, experts at evaluating risk have deeply specialized and siloed knowledge — in economics, for example, or epidemiology. This knowledge rarely translates into detailed understandings of other systemic risks at play and how they might affect one another in turn. So, for example, while specialists in climate change’s economic impacts know something about how climate heating aggravates economic inequality within and between societies, they know very little about how it impacts ideological extremism. And they give virtually no attention to the possibility that causation might operate in the reverse direction, too — that inequality and extremism might worsen climate heating. Yet it’s likely all these processes are now operating. Climate heating is harming people’s health and causing weather disasters, affecting infrastructure and food production all over the planet. In poorer countries, these changes are constraining economic growth and widening existing economic inequalities. Lower growth and bigger inequalities, wherever they happen, intensify ideological extremism. And that extremism is likely making it harder to build national and international consensus around cutting greenhouse gas emissions, allowing the heating problem to steadily worsen. These sorts of vicious cycles are what complexity scientists call self-reinforcing “positive feedbacks.” We tend to see bits and pieces of a causal loop, but not the whole thing. For that reason, we urgently need to identify and monitor these feedbacks and ferret out those still unrecognized to establish whether they are synchronizing the world’s systemic risks. Businesses do similar kinds of risk analysis by diagraming causal loops in the dynamic systems affecting them. In this case, the system is the planet itself. It goes back to the ecologist Barry Commoner’s first rule of ecology — everything is connected to everything else — but with a crucial amendment: some kinds of connections matter a lot more than others. We propose a worldwide scientific collaboration to identify the causal mechanisms operating among these risks. This collaboration would consist of a global consortium of nationally funded institutes. It would be dedicated, first, to studying mechanisms that are amplifying, accelerating and synchronizing global systemic risks and, second, to determining practical ways humanity might intervene. It would also look for ways these feedbacks might be harnessed to tip key economic, social, and ecological systems toward better outcomes. This consortium would act as the international scientific complement to the Futures Lab proposed by the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, which is intended to integrate humanity’s “work around forecasting, megatrends and risks.” And it would report regularly to both the participating governments and the global public with the explicit aim of galvanizing action to address the polycrisis. It’s vitally important to get this kind of initiative underway. “Business as usual,” Mr. Guterres has warned, “could result in breakdown of the global order, into a world of perpetual crisis and winner-takes-all.” Thomas Homer-Dixon is the executive director of the Cascade Institute at Royal Roads University in British Columbia.

2022-11-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia-penal-colony.html,"Brittney Griner Transferred to Russian Penal Colony, Lawyers Say","The American basketball star Brittney Griner was transferred to a penal colony outside Moscow on Thursday, her lawyers said, where she will begin to serve a nine-year prison term after a Russian court convicted her on a drug charge. Ms. Griner, 32, had been moved to the IK-2 female penal colony in the small town of Yavas, about 300 miles southeast of Moscow, the lawyers said in a statement. According to the website of the Russian prisons’ service, the colony is capable of holding 820 inmates. “Brittney is doing as well as could be expected and trying to stay strong as she adapts to a new environment,” the lawyers, Maria Blagovolina and Aleksandr Boikov, said in the statement, adding that this is “a very challenging period for her.” Her agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, also released a statement, saying: “Despite the fact she is alone and now nearing her ninth month in detention separated from her loved ones, she is trying to stay strong.” She also expressed gratitude to the Biden administration, which has been under pressure from Ms. Griner’s wife and supporters to work more aggressively to secure her release. A 2017 article by Moskovsky Komsomolets, a Russian newspaper, described widespread torture, harsh beatings and slave labor conditions in the IK-2. Inmates often work from 7 a.m. until midnight or later and are not allowed to use a washroom, the article said, quoting former inmates. Yavas was founded in early Soviet times as a penitentiary center. Apart from the IK-2 there are two other penal colonies in the town. Ms. Griner was arrested on the brink of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February, and her fate became entwined with high-stakes geopolitics and tense Russia-U.S. relations. She pleaded guilty to the drug charge, stemming from hash oil found in her luggage, but insisted she had no intent to break the law. The Russian court hearing her case sentenced Ms. Griner to nine years in prison for drug smuggling. The harshness of the sentence — described by her lawyers as having little precedent — has been denounced by the U.S. government and Ms. Griner’s supporters as evidence that the punishment was politically motivated. Late last month, a Russian court upheld Ms. Griner’s sentence, setting the stage for her transfer to a penal colony, even as American and Russian officials broached the possibility of a prisoner exchange. Little has emerged from those negotiations so far.",7
2022-11-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/world/europe/russia-us-brittney-griner.html,"Russia Raises Hopes for Griner’s Release, but U.S. Says It’s Just Talk","A day after the American basketball star Brittney Griner was sent to a Russian penal colony, a top Russian diplomat said on Friday that the prospect of a prisoner exchange was increasing, and acknowledged that it could involve a Russian arms dealer imprisoned in the United States. But U.S. officials dismissed the suggestion of any new optimism about an agreement, saying that the Kremlin had not been serious about negotiating a deal. Since June, the Biden administration has been proposing trading Viktor Bout, the arms dealer, for Ms. Griner, who has been jailed for nine months and Paul N. Whelan, an American held for almost four years and convicted of espionage, according to U.S. officials and numerous news media reports. Their fates have been caught up in the hardening confrontation between Washington and Moscow over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which American officials say is reflected in the tough treatment of Ms. Griner. She was sentenced to nine years for entering Russia with vape cartridges containing hashish oil, and her lawyers confirmed on Thursday that she had been transferred from a jail to a penal colony, where harsh conditions and mistreatment are commonplace. U.S. officials have not publicly acknowledged that Mr. Bout has been offered in a prisoner swap, but on Friday, the Kremlin did. “So far, we have not come to a common denominator, but it is undeniable that Viktor Bout is among those who are being discussed, and we certainly count on a positive result,” Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, told reporters in Moscow, according to the Interfax news agency. The chance of an exchange “is being strengthened,” he said, adding that “we are working professionally through a special channel designed for this.” But he did not explicitly say for whom Mr. Bout would be traded, according to Interfax. The U.S. State Department quickly threw cold water on his comments. “We have made a substantial offer that the Russian Federation has consistently failed to negotiate in good faith,” a department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said at a news briefing. The U.S. government “has continued to follow up on that proposal and propose alternative potential ways forward.” But, Mr. Patel said, the Kremlin’s “failure to seriously negotiate on these issues in the established channel, or any other channel for that matter, runs counter to its public statements.” The diplomatic back-and-forth came on a day when Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said that nearly half of his country’s energy grid had been damaged by Russian strikes. Russian forces have launched heavy barrages of missiles and exploding drones at Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, hoping to break down the country’s ability to function and its will to fight. Russia’s strategy, Mr. Shmyhal said at a news conference, was “fighting against the civilian population and depriving them of light, water supply, heat and communications during the winter.” The Russians have suffered serious battlefield setbacks in recent weeks, but the fighting is slowing as cold weather sets in and both sides regroup. Also on Friday, Swedish investigators said they had found evidence that explosives were used to sever the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea in September, confirming European officials’ suspicions that it was sabotage. It remains unclear who might have attacked the pipelines, which carried Russian natural gas to Germany until Moscow cut off the flow, or why. Unable so far to win military victory, the government of President Vladimir V. Putin has sought other forms of leverage against the United States and other nations backing Ukraine — manipulating energy supplies and spreading disinformation — and U.S. officials say that includes using imprisoned Westerners as bargaining chips. The Biden administration has been under pressure from Ms. Griner’s wife and supporters to work more aggressively to secure her release. The question is whether Mr. Putin would rather keep that pressure on, ensuring one more headache for President Biden and potentially making him look ineffectual, or would prefer to have Mr. Bout. Ms. Griner, 32, who has won a WNBA championship with the Phoenix Mercury and two Olympic gold medals with U.S. teams, has also played for years in the top Russian women’s league, and was on her way to join her team when she was arrested in February at Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow. Russian prosecutors said she was found with less than 0.3 grams of hashish oil. Other foreigners found with small amounts of cannabis have been quickly fined and expelled from Russia, but Ms. Griner’s case was handled differently. She pleaded guilty in July, but the authorities went ahead with the proceedings, and a court sentenced her in August to nine years in a penal colony, nearly the maximum for her offense, with the sentence upheld last month by an appeals court. Supporters have voiced concern about how she would be treated in a country that is hostile to the United States and to gay people, and where she has little knowledge of the language. Russian officials have insisted that it was premature to discuss a prisoner exchange until the legal process in her case had concluded. Her transfer to a penal colony outside Moscow appeared to mark that milestone. Her lawyers said on Thursday that Ms. Griner had been sent to the IK-2 female penal colony in the small town of Yavas, about 300 miles southeast of Moscow. According to the website of the Russian prison service, the colony can hold 820 inmates. Former inmates say that harsh conditions, overcrowding, political indoctrination and even brutality are common features of Russian penal colonies. In 2012, a member of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot said that there had been no hot water, warm clothes or medicine in the penal colony where she and a bandmate were imprisoned, and that people who got sick could die as a result. Mr. Whelan, 52, the other American whose release has reportedly been sought in a trade for Mr. Bout, has said he has suffered physical abuse and been denied needed medical care while in Russian custody. A former U.S. Marine, he was the director of security and investigations for an American manufacturing company, and had traveled several times to Russia. After his arrest in 2018 in a Moscow hotel room, the authorities said he had a USB drive containing the identities of employees of a Russian security service. Mr. Whelan’s lawyers say he believed the drive contained photos of churches, and was set up. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.

2022-11-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/opinion/russia-putin-opposition.html,Opinion | What Will Russia Without Putin Look Like? Maybe This.,"Russia’s current condition — militarized, isolated, corrupt, dominated by the security services and hemorrhaging talent as hundreds of thousands flee abroad to escape service in a horrific war — is bleak. In hopes of an end to this grim reality, some wait expectantly for Vladimir Putin to leave office. To change the country, however, it is not enough for Mr. Putin to die or step down. Russia’s future leaders must dismantle and transform the structures over which he has presided for more than two decades. The challenge, to say the least, is daunting. But a group of politicians is devising a plan to meet it. Composed of well-known opposition figures as well as younger representatives from local and regional governments, the First Congress of People’s Deputies of Russia met in Poland in early November. The location, Jablonna Palace outside Warsaw, was symbolic: It was the site of early negotiations in the round-table talks that led to the end of Communist rule in Poland. There, over three days of intense debate, participants laid out proposals for rebuilding their country. Taken together, they amount to a serious effort to imagine Russia without Mr. Putin. The first and most pressing priority, of course, is the invasion of Ukraine. Everyone at the congress opposes the war, which they assume will be lost or lead to nuclear disaster. To deal with the consequences and to prevent a repeat tragedy, they propose an “act on peace” that would demobilize the army and end the occupation of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea; create a joint group for the investigation of war crimes; pay reparations for damaged infrastructure and the families of the dead; and reject future “wars of conquest.” In addition to offering a deterrent to future expansionism, this wide-ranging pledge would provide an essential reckoning with Russia’s history of imperialist invasion. The officials responsible for the devastation will need to be rooted out, too — something that never happened after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The congress would bar from working in state and educational institutions those who belonged to “criminal” organizations — such as the Federal Security Services or state television channels — or publicly supported the war, as well as restricting their voting rights. It would also create a “de-Putinization” commission to consider the rehabilitation of certain groups, including those who publicly recant and did not commit especially serious crimes, and open the archives of the security services. Then there’s the structure of Russia itself. The Russian Federation is highly centralized, with a patchwork of over 80 republics and regions that are strongly subordinate to the president, enabling the accumulation of enormous power. The congress, drawing on decentralized visions from around the time of the Soviet collapse, proposes to dissolve the Russian Federation and replace it with a new parliamentary democracy. According to a broadly worded draft provision on “self-determination,” the future Russian state should be “joined on the basis of free choice by the peoples who populate it.” This break with the present could correct the failed promises of the past. From Vladimir Lenin to Boris Yeltsin, modern Russian leaders have a history of offering decentralization to win support and then reneging once they consolidate power. Though all federal subjects are legally equal under Russia’s current Constitution, substantial inequalities persist — a fact that has been highlighted by the disproportionate deployment and death of ethnic minorities from poorer republics like Dagestan and Buryatia in the war in Ukraine. Revisiting the issue of greater sovereignty could allow the breakaway republic of Chechnya, for example, to leave Russia after its brutal subjugation by Mr. Putin, while enabling regions and republics without strong secessionist movements to renegotiate the allocation of resources and balance of power with the center. It would create a fairer country while undermining Russian nationalism. The congress is vaguest on its economic plans. One act promises to “review the results of privatization” carried out during the 1990s (which led to the rise of Russia’s oligarchs), while another aims to cancel Mr. Putin’s highly unpopular pension reform of 2020. Missing, however, is a commitment to a strong social safety net or any discussion of transitioning Russia’s economy away from its dependence on energy exports. This is a major oversight. Since the 1990s, when privatization and free elections were introduced simultaneously, wealth and power have been intertwined. Political and economic reform cannot be viewed in isolation from each other. That’s not the only hitch. The congress’s main organizer and sponsor is Ilya Ponomarev, a leftist tech entrepreneur. The only member of the Russian Parliament to vote against the annexation of Crimea in 2014, he left the country, obtained Ukrainian citizenship and now runs a Russian-language news channel in Kyiv. A controversial figure in opposition circles, in August he endorsed the assassination of Daria Dugina, the daughter of the Eurasianist philosopher Alexander Dugin, and asserted it was the work of a secret partisan army inside Russia. This uncorroborated claim outraged fellow opposition figures. Mr. Ponomarev was subsequently disinvited from an event organized by the longtime Kremlin critics Garry Kasparov and Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Despite their disagreements, Russia’s opposition has a loosely converging vision for the future. Mr. Khodorkovsky and Aleksei Navalny, the country’s most well-known dissident, who is currently languishing in a penal colony, have also issued calls to turn Russia into a parliamentary democracy with more power devolved to the local and regional levels. But associates of Mr. Navalny did not attend the congress, nor did Mr. Kasparov or Mr. Khodorkovsky. Its legitimacy — already challenged by a number of Russian antiwar organizations that said it does not represent them — was also questioned by some participants, several of whom left in protest over what they saw as a lack of equality and transparency in how it was being run. Such feuding doesn’t help the proposals, which can seem far-fetched. Yet history shows that radical developments are often incubated abroad or underground. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, political émigrés in bickering communities around Europe plotted the downfall of the Russian empire. Among them was Vladimir Lenin, who was living in Poland at the outbreak of World War I. For now, with most of Russia’s population forced into quiescence while others lose their jobs or freedom for expressing dissent, the possibility of the country’s transformation appears remote. Change, however, can come when it’s least expected. In early 1917, a pessimistic Lenin lamented that he probably wouldn’t live to see the revolution; a few weeks later, the czar was overthrown.

2022-11-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/opinion/world-cup-poland-serbia-croatia.html,Opinion | Eastern Europe Was the Crucible of Modern Football. Now It’s a Wasteland.,"There is a theory that, other than Uruguay at the inaugural tournament in 1930, every World Cup winner has been in some way influenced by the wave of great Hungarian coaches scattered across the globe in the aftermath of World War I. It’s not entirely tenuous, even if some are skeptical. Nobody, by contrast, truly doubts that gegenpressing, perhaps the dominant mode of the modern game, has its origins in the Soviet Union — and was kindled from a friendly in 1983 between the German side Viktoria Backnang and Dynamo Kyiv, who were managed by the great Ukrainian coach Valery Lobanovsky. Pressing itself, whose introduction in the ’60s can be said to mark the birth of modern football, was developed by Viktor Maslov, a Russian coach who enjoyed great success at Torpedo Moscow and Dynamo Kyiv. These are no isolated instances of influence. For the best part of the 20th century, football looked east for inspiration. In two very different periods, before and after World War II, Eastern Europe was a beacon of modernity and progressive thought in football. Yet at the World Cup in Qatar this year only three of the 32 qualifiers are from the former Communist bloc, while it is 23 years since a club team from the region last reached the semifinal of the Champions League. The region, its highest-profile coaches nowhere near the game’s summit, is now just another producer of talent for the wealthy leagues of Western Europe. From crucible to wasteland, Eastern Europe has a story to tell about the power of politics and economics to define sporting destiny. Even as the brightest thinkers were leaving Hungary in the ’20s and ’30s, the flow of Hungarian talent was maintained by the rivalry between two Budapest giants: MTK, the club of the assimilated Jewish middle class, and Ferencvaros, whose support was largely working class and ethnically German. Yet politics intruded. MTK was shut down by Miklos Horthy’s far-right regime in 1942 and Ferencvaros was deliberately run down by the Communist government that took power in 1947. Although nationalization brought short-term success — most famously lifting Hungary to the final of the 1954 World Cup — the two great wellsprings of Budapest’s football culture, damaged by the mass defections that followed Soviet repression of the 1956 uprising, soon ran dry. The Hungarian game has never recovered. After Hungary’s eclipse, the center of Eastern European football shifted to the Soviet Union itself. Maslov, an avuncular Muscovite, prepared the ground in the ’60s. But it was Lobanovsky, a trained mathematician, who really moved things forward. An advocate of pressing, he also pioneered — in conjunction with the computer scientist Anatoly Zelentsov — the use of computer analysis in match preparation. In the process, he inspired Dynamo Kyiv to two European Cup Winners’ Cups and led the Soviet Union to second at the 1988 European Championship. But this period came to an end with the collapse of Communism. As the region suffered economic ruin, the most gifted players and coaches left — and state funding that maintained the clubs and academies was turned off. The infrastructure of club football was hollowed out, just as the advent of the Champions League increased revenues for the elite. The impact was devastating. At the 1990 World Cup, four of the 24 sides were from the East. Four years earlier, Steaua Bucharest, the club of the Romanian army, had won the European Cup (the forerunner of the Champions League), and reached the final again in 1989. Two years later, as Yugoslavia tipped into civil war, Red Star Belgrade triumphed. Since then, no side from Serbia or Romania has even made it through the group stage of the Champions League, while an arduous ownership dispute means there are currently two different clubs, both claiming continuity from the original Steaua. Steaua represents an extreme example, but corruption, disorganization and diminished resources dog football in the East. Even in the former East Germany there is a stark disparity with the West. When Germany won the World Cup in 2014, its squad included only one player from the East. The Bundesliga, Germany’s top league, features only two clubs from the East, each in their own way isolated from the economic difficulties of the region. For a time, Russia had seemed the great hope. There were successes in the UEFA Cup (European football’s second-most prestigious tournament) for CSKA Moscow in 2005 and Zenit St Petersburg in 2008, while the national team, playing thrilling football, reached the semifinal of the European Championship in 2008. When in 2011 Suleiman Kerimov, an ally of Vladimir Putin, bought Anzhi, a previously unheralded club from the Dagestani capital of Makhachkala, and signed eye-catching stars, the potential reach of Russia’s oligarchs on the game became clear. But UEFA’s Financial Fair Play regulations, introduced that year, restricted just how much could be invested. Some preferred to invest abroad anyway, such as Roman Abramovich at Chelsea or Dmitry Rybolovlev at Monaco. Were they seeking to raise their profile and so secure a degree of protection from machinations in the Kremlin? Were they tying their assets into Western economies, gaining a degree of influence? It remains uncertain. In any case, a collapse in the price of potash forced Mr. Kerimov to slash budgets at Anzhi. Then in 2014 came Russia’s invasion of Crimea and parts of the Donbas. Even the limited sanctions that followed had an effect, particularly on the long-term president of CSKA, who has significant business interests in Ukraine. Sanctions imposed after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February have effectively ended Russian investment in foreign clubs. Within Russia, the consequences have been profound. There has been an exodus of foreigners from the Russian league: The German coaches of Lokomotiv Moscow and Krasnodar, for example, quit almost immediately. The country is cut off, expelled from the World Cup and its clubs suspended from UEFA competitions. Perhaps Gazprom, the state energy company that used to sponsor the Champions League, will instead invest its resources at home. Yet more likely, Russian football will wither in isolation. Which leaves what, exactly? Ukraine, despite the invasion, was one game from qualifying for the World Cup, and the restart of its domestic league in August, albeit with air-raid protocols, was proudly presented as evidence of returning normality. Great individuals can emerge anywhere: One of the brightest prospects in the modern game is Napoli’s 21-year-old Georgian winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. The Balkans and Ukraine continue to produce talent in bulk: A CIES Football Observatory report this year ranked the academies of five Eastern European clubs among the top eight in Europe. But they are essentially producing to sell to the West. Hungary has seen a mini-revival recently, thanks to a series of tax breaks Viktor Orban, a huge football fan, has provided for clubs. With investment, some achievement is possible, at the national level at least. Without it, the result is Bulgaria or Romania, whose national teams lit up the 1994 World Cup but are currently footballing deserts. In this year’s tournament, Poland, Serbia and Croatia — a consistent high achiever, against the odds — will do their best. But their performance mostly underscores how far the region has fallen. Football may be the universal sport, accessible to anybody with a rough ball. But, as the Eastern European experience sadly shows, it can’t escape the vagaries of history.

2022-11-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/23/world/europe/bbc-russia-world-cup-gary-lineker.html,"BBC Could Have Been More Critical of Russia During 2018 World Cup, Its Commentator Says","The BBC should have spoken out more about Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its human rights record when the country hosted the World Cup in 2018, said Gary Lineker, the broadcaster’s prominent soccer commentator. “I do look back four years ago and feel slightly uncomfortable,” Mr. Lineker, a former star soccer player for England, said in a BBC interview that aired on Wednesday. Mr. Lineker, who is the face of the BBC’s coverage of this year’s World Cup in Qatar, said the 2018 programming, of which he was a key member, had been an example of “sportwashing,” because the presenters had not properly reported on Russia’s record outside soccer. The top scorer at the 1986 World Cup, Mr. Lineker declined to host this year’s World Cup draw, a high-profile event that in essence kick-starts the tournament. It was a turnaround from his position ahead of the last World Cup, where he presided over the event in Moscow. His decision this year prompted criticism from some sections of the British news media. Mr. Lineker decided not to headline the 2022 event, saying it would be hypocritical for him to do so given his misgivings over holding the event in Qatar. “We’ve seen what Putin’s done subsequently — but he’d done it before,” Mr. Lineker said in the interview, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and the country’s annexation of Crimea, which was condemned globally and prompted the imposing of international sanctions against Moscow. The annexation led to calls for officials from FIFA, world soccer’s global governing body, to reconsider hosting the tournament in Russia, but the body stood by its decision. British ministers and members of the royal family boycotted the 2018 event after a former Russian spy was poisoned on British soil. The question of whether politics can be removed from global sporting events like the World Cup has been the subject of heated debate. After Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, FIFA suspended Russia and its teams from all competitions, ejecting the country from qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. The BBC’s commentators discussed human rights issues in Qatar in coverage ahead of the tournament’s opening game on Sunday. The decision not to do so with Russia in 2018 was a “mistake,” Mr. Lineker said. “Looking back now in hindsight, I think we should probably have spoken out more,” Mr. Lineker said of Russia’s record beyond sport. It was something, he said, that the BBC and its sports presenters had learned from. The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. American investigators and FIFA itself have said multiple FIFA board members accepted bribes to award Qatar with hosting rights for the World Cup. Russia has also been suspected of buying votes during its bid for the tournament. Thousands of migrant workers have died in the process of building Qatar’s new stadiums and other World Cup infrastructure projects, according to human rights groups. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, prompting L.G.B.T.Q. fans from other countries to stay home.

2022-11-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/opinion/letters/billionaires-wealth-philanthropy.html,"Opinion | Plutocrats, Power and Philanthropy","To the Editor: “It Was a Bad Week for Billionaires With Delusions of Saving the World,” by Anand Giridharadas (Opinion guest essay, Nov. 21), was on the money. Billionaires got to their lofty heights by anything but benevolence. The tax code provides incentives for philanthropy, which also acts as a public relations cover for the exploitation of the people who actually assist in the billionaires’ success. I believe in capitalism and material success, but our current system is so top-heavy that it is counterproductive. Trickle-down was the rationale for tax advantages in order to spread the wealth. I think we saw through that fallacy. Warren Buffett observed that he pays a lower tax rate than his staff. I always wonder how a person’s life changes when their net worth goes from one billion to two billion. Obviously art collections expand, mansions and townhouses multiply, and private jets become fleets. How does that help average Americans? I believe in incentives and rewarding innovation, but the law of diminishing returns still applies. “Sprinkling some fairy dust,” in Mr. Giridharadas’s words, won’t solve our social problems. The capital must be more widespread; otherwise the system will collapse because the pyramid’s foundation will be too weak to support the pinnacle. These emperors are clothed but misguided. Steven A. LudsinEast Hampton, N.Y. To the Editor: Anand Giridharadas’s guest essay is incredibly cynical. He ignores the many good deeds by the very wealthy. How about the Gates Foundation’s work to eliminate malaria; or Paul Tudor Jones’s Robin Hood Foundation; or Ken Langone’s work with N.Y.U.’s medical school, including funding all tuitions; or Warren Buffett’s Giving Pledge, commitments by the extremely wealthy to give the majority of their money to philanthropy, etc.? And to call Jeff Bezos’s contribution to charity as sprinkles of “fairy dust” is the height of cynical sarcasm. Mr. Giridharadas attacks Amazon for a small employee reduction, not mentioning that Amazon hired hundreds of thousands of displaced people during the pandemic at substantially higher wages than its competitors. And, unfortunately, stewards of entities must manage for the long term to avoid more layoffs. His essay reflects a complete lack of balance. Tom McCabeNew York To the Editor: Thanks to Anand Giridharadas, whose cogent insights ably demystify the alluring but ultimately bankrupt pose of opulent plutocrats pretending to be magnanimous social crusaders. Indeed these hypocrites with bulging wallets need to be subject to laws, regulations and a just system of taxation that can properly and equitably use excess wealth in service of our skewed society’s desperate needs. Given the encouraging trends indicated by the recent election, maybe a critical mass of the electorate is beginning to wake up to the scams of the ultra-rich as well as the ultra-right. Joe MartinSeattle To the Editor: As billionaires, by their actions, make their own case against themselves, Anand Giridharadas corrects the genius myths that raise their standing and enhance their power. He insists that they “are not our saviors.” Tevye, in “Fiddler on the Roof,” also gives us insight on this point. Tevye yearns to be rich, belting out the benefits of wealth as he sings “If I Were a Rich Man,” including this exquisite line: “When you’re rich, they think you really know.” They don’t know. Linda StamatoMorristown, N.J. To the Editor: Re “As Country Reopens, Americans Either Fear the Virus or Forget It” (front page, Nov. 15): The pandemic is not over, despite proclamations to the contrary; acting as if it is over does not make it over. With more than 300 deaths per day and projections of more than 100,000 a year for years to come, it is long overdue that we use this time as a teachable moment, beyond adequate masking and up-to-date immunization. In an event like a viral pandemic, public health authorities and health care providers need to address the underlying causes that lead to more severe outcomes. Serious Covid infections are largely preventable or mitigated by attending to largely controllable lifestyle factors including diet, exercise, timely management of pre-existing conditions and harm reduction (cessation or reduction of nicotine and alcohol use). Of course, infants, the immunocompromised and the elderly must be protected, by a population willing to test, quarantine when ill, vaccinate and mask as dictated by local conditions. But it remains within the power of millions to adopt healthier habits as a means of improving the pre-existing conditions that are predictors of Covid hospitalizations, disability and death. We must also address what may be the most significant factor when it comes to explaining the dramatic differences in national infection, hospitalization and death rates, according to an important study published by the British medical journal The Lancet: the inverse relationship of citizens’ trust in government health authorities and each other, and pandemic outcomes. Simply put: Less trust, more Covid. In a world of multiplying variants, let us use this time to encourage healthier living and to rebuild our trust in public health. Eric RadackSanta Fe, N.M. To the Editor: In the newly elected House Republican caucus, the MAGA members hold undue sway because of the small majority the Republicans hold. This will make approving any necessary bills or getting anything substantial accomplished difficult, if not impossible. Are there not 10 or 15 middle-of-the-road Republican House members who have the courage to join the Democratic minority (à la the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus) to get something done for the good of their constituents and our country? If there are not, the next two years will be wasted in partisan wrangling and investigations that will splinter our country further. These times call for courage, selflessness and love of country over ambition and party loyalty. Can it happen? Robert SlifkinHuntington Bay, N.Y. To the Editor: Democratic House leaders should make selected moderate House Republicans aware that they could count on Democratic votes for the speakership. Hopefully a moderate Republican would try to address issues in addition to being forced to pursue partisan objectives. Raymond TillmanNew York To the Editor: If Vladimir Putin wanted the nation of Ukraine to join the Russian sphere of influence, he would be doing things that win over the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people. But what the free world sees from the shocking and tragic photographs and other remarkable journalism is that Mr. Putin cares only for Ukraine’s real estate. He cares not a whit for the Ukrainian people. That is brought into focus with the documentation of war crimes that shows the thousands of murdered Ukrainian men, women and children, and the destruction of whole Ukrainian towns and cities.

2022-11-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/world/europe/russia-paul-whelan-prisoner.html,"Paul Whelan, an American Imprisoned in Russia, Is Hospitalized","Brittney Griner’s release on Thursday put a spotlight on Paul Whelan. The Biden administration is “deeply concerned” about Paul Whelan, an American imprisoned in Russia who has been transferred to a prison hospital, a White House spokesman said on Wednesday. Mr. Whelan’s brother, David, said in emails to supporters this week that his brother was moved on Nov. 17 to a hospital in the prison where he is being held. His family, who have not heard from him in a week, grew particularly alarmed when Mr. Whelan missed a scheduled call home on Thanksgiving Day and further still when he failed to call home on Wednesday, his father’s 85th birthday. “Paul was not complaining of any health conditions that required hospitalization, so has there been an emergency?” David Whelan wrote. He added that his brother “appeared healthy and well” to U.S. Embassy staff who visited him in November. John Kirby, a National Security Council spokesman, told reporters in a telephone briefing on Wednesday that the U.S. government had been trying unsuccessfully to get information on Mr. Whelan’s condition and his whereabouts. “As we speak this morning, regrettably, we do not have an update specifically about where he is or what condition he’s in,” Mr. Kirby said. He added: “We are deeply concerned about the lack of information and the lack of contact from Paul, and we’re working on this really as hard as we can through diplomatic channels.” Speaking on MSNBC during a visit to Bucharest, Romania, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that U.S. officials had visited Mr. Whelan on Nov. 16 and spoken to him by phone at “roughly” the same time but had not had contact with him since. “We are working every day to make sure that we have contact with him, that we understand what the exact situation is,” Mr. Blinken said. David Whelan said in an email on Wednesday: “It could be nothing but, in this case, you always have to consider worst case scenarios.” Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who later worked as a corporate security executive, was arrested at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 and was convicted in June 2020 on espionage charges that the U.S. government says were manufactured. U.S. officials have linked Mr. Whelan’s fate to that of Brittney Griner, the American professional basketball player imprisoned in Russia, and have been trying for months to negotiate their joint release. The United States has offered to release from federal prison a notorious Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout, in exchange for the two Americans. Russia has yet to accept the offer. In a Nov. 9 statement, the White House said that it had “continued to follow up on that offer and propose alternative potential ways forward with the Russians through all available channels” but did not offer further details. Mr. Whelan is being held at a high-security prison called IK-17, about an eight-hour drive from Moscow.",7
2022-12-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/world/paul-whelan-russia-prison.html,"Paul Whelan, American Prisoner in Russia, Contacts Family After Weeks of Silence","Brittney Griner’s release on Thursday put a spotlight on Paul Whelan. Paul Whelan, an American imprisoned in Russia, called his family on Friday morning, breaking a silence that his family called highly unusual and that led the Biden administration to express concern for his well-being. “Paul called our parents today at around 5:30 a.m. Eastern,” Mr. Whelan’s brother, David, wrote in an email to supporters. He said that his brother did not explain why he had been out of contact for more than two weeks and failed to called home as scheduled on Thanksgiving. Nor did Mr. Whelan tell his parents why he had recently been transferred to the hospital of a Russian prison where he is serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges that the United States calls politically motivated. “So the call at least acts as a ‘proof of life,’ even if nothing else has been explained,” David Whelan wrote. Consular officials with the U.S. Embassy in Moscow spoke to Mr. Whelan on Friday, the State Department spokesman, Ned Price, told reporters. Mr. Price said that Mr. Whelan told them that he had been transferred to a prison hospital on Thanksgiving Day, but had been returned on Friday to the penal colony where he is serving his sentence. “Paul stated that he was feeling well,” Mr. Price said, adding that the unexplained transfer was not unprecedented. “We have unfortunately experienced the practice of Russian authorities to move detained American citizens without prenotification of any sort,” he added. Winning the release of Mr. Whelan and Brittney Griner, a professional basketball player who also is being held in a penal colony after she was sentenced to nine years in prison for drug smuggling, “is something that we have been constantly working on through every available channel,” Mr. Price said. Mr. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who became a corporate security executive, was arrested at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 and accused of spying. He was convicted in June 2020 on espionage charges that the U.S. government says were manufactured. The Biden administration considers Mr. Whelan and Ms. Griner tantamount to political hostages. The extreme tensions between Washington and Moscow over the war in Ukraine have complicated efforts to win their release. Biden administration officials have proposed that Russia release the two Americans in exchange for the release of Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer being held in the United States. Mr. Bout was sentenced in 2011 to a 25-year prison term for conspiring to sell weapons to people who said they planned to kill Americans. Russia has not accepted the offer, and U.S. officials say they would continue to discuss options with the Russians through official channels. On Wednesday, John F. Kirby, a National Security Council spokesman, told reporters that the Biden administration was “deeply concerned about the lack of information and the lack of contact from Paul, and we’re working on this really as hard as we can through diplomatic channels.” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told MSNBC that he was troubled by the situation. In his email to supporters on Friday, David Whelan said he believed that the State Department’s “public display of concern also had something to do” with his brother’s call and nodded to the mental toll of tracking his brother’s situation. “It has been a great relief to return to that baseline knowledge of ‘Paul is definitely being held hostage in a Russian labor camp’ and not have to consider worse outcomes,” he wrote.",7
2022-12-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/04/opinion/russia-lgbt-putin.html,Opinion | The Teen Romance Novel That Russia’s Politicians Just Can’t Bear,"In the summer of 1986, Yury, a shy 16-year-old, arrives at a Soviet Young Pioneer camp, dreading the many dull weeks ahead of him. There’s only one thing that cheers him up: his group leader Volodya, a 19-year-old undergraduate. Slowly, the two boys fall in love. Against a backdrop of danger — if their clandestine relationship is found out, they could face a five-year prison sentence — they tentatively discover their sexuality. After the summer, their lives drift apart. They don’t see each other for 20 years until Yury, spurred on by the discovery of a hidden cache of love letters, goes on a search to find Volodya. That’s the plot of “Summer in a Pioneer Tie,” the debut young adult novel by Elena Malisova and Katerina Silvanova. Initially published on a fan-fiction site, the novel was discovered by Popcorn Books, an imprint focusing on queer fiction. (Popcorn is one of two imprints at an independent publisher; one of us, Mr. Sandalov, runs the other, which is editorially separate.) Since its release in late 2021, the book has been a sensation: It sold over 200,000 copies in the first six months and generated exceptional hype. On TikTok, where teenage fans have organized flash mobs and designed all manner of merchandise, novel-related posts have attracted more than 250 million views. The book is more than a breakout hit. It is also the catalyst for the latest legislative assault on L.G.B.T.Q. rights in Russia. Last month, the Russian Parliament endorsed a draconian law banning “L.G.B.T. propaganda” among all adults — criminalizing the promotion of homosexuality in public and online or in books, films and advertising. Behind it, as one author of the bill made clear, was a desire to bridle “Summer in a Pioneer Tie” and books like it. Remarkably, in the midst of a disastrous war, Russia’s legislators are focusing their ire on a lyrical coming-of-age novel. The novel itself is straightforward. Simply, even plainly, written, the book sensitively charts the process of falling in love for the first time. The relationship between Yury and Volodya, blossoming in difficult circumstances, is tenderly described. It is, at heart, a classic story of young love triumphing, however briefly, against the odds. The innocent depiction of first love between young men, however, threatens the Kremlin’s yearslong efforts to vilify everything gay. The result has been panic. Zakhar Prilepin, a militant nationalist writer, suggested that the publishing house’s Moscow office should be burned down. Nikita Mikhalkov, a major film director and actor, lambasted the book as a conspiracy directed by a degenerate West. Vitaly Milonov, a member of Parliament, thought it best to hand over Popcorn’s staff to the Ukrainian Army where, he said, they would be at home among fellow degenerates. Aleksandr Khinshtein, a parliamentary deputy and hard-line member of Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party, took matters into his own hands. Believing portrayals of L.G.B.T.Q. people to be “a weapon of hybrid warfare” and that “Russia’s civilization is a bulwark of traditional values,” Mr. Khinshtein composed a bill to cover all age groups and a wide variety of supposed offenses, such as the depiction of “nontraditional sexual relationships,” the undermining of “traditional family values” and even the inducement of pedophilic urges. His efforts met with great enthusiasm: The bill was passed unanimously, without a single abstention, and is likely to become law in a few days. For the generation now ruling Russia, which grew up in the Soviet Union, it’s personal: Many remember their summer Pioneer camps with warm nostalgia and see the book as an attempt to drag their past through the mud. This crackdown comes in an atmosphere of increased repression, as the Kremlin clamps down on dissent. In July the “foreign agent” bill — passed in 2012 and, since early 2021, systematically used to muzzle independent media and journalists — was amended to include anybody “under foreign influence.” Book publishers have already got a taste of what to expect. In late October, the Kremlin added two names from the publishing world to their list: Alexey Dokuchaev and Andrey Baev, the founders of Popcorn Books. (To continue functioning, Popcorn had to part with them to avoid being declared a foreign agent by association.) Taken together, the bills amount to a wholesale crackdown on the few L.G.B.T.Q. and free speech rights left in the country. Organizations deemed to be in breach of the new rules must cease operations for 90 days, which would force most bookstores and movie theaters out of business, while individual editors — or even whole publishing houses — can be labeled foreign agents. The effect is chilling and, critics say, obliterates one of the last forms of queer visibility in Russia. What’s more, the bills’ sweeping nature and opaque formulations make it unclear precisely what publishers are meant to censor. When publishers asked whether the “anti-gay propaganda” bill’s stipulations would not eliminate about 50 percent of all fiction and nonfiction in circulation, they were assured that nobody would ever touch Russian classics. Even the biographies of the openly gay Tchaikovsky were safe, apparently. Such assurances don’t count for much, and pre-emptive and zealous self-policing is already taking hold. One of Russia’s largest book publishers is redacting potentially risky sentences in new releases, and bookshops have started to remove “Summer in a Pioneer Tie” from their shelves. But even if literary production is forced underground, the Kremlin will have a hard time stamping it out. After all, this is the land of Pasternak and Solzhenitsyn, where censorship has invested literature with authority. The authors of “Summer in a Pioneer Tie,” for their part, are quietly confident. Even if the authorities ban books, Ms. Silvanova said, “the demand isn’t going anywhere.” The bill, Ms. Malisova agreed, might lead to “even greater interest.” Readers will find loopholes and keep reading what they want to read. Who knows? Perhaps the TikTok frenzies of today might turn out to be the beginning of a 21st-century samizdat movement. As for Yury and Volodya, their story continues. A sequel is out, and a third book is in the works. Somehow, surely, they will find their way to the light.

2022-12-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/world/europe/viktor-bout-brittney-griner.html,"Who Is Viktor Bout, Arms Dealer in Swap for Brittney Griner?","To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. Shortly after his conviction in 2011 on charges including conspiring to kill American citizens, the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout relayed a defiant message through his lawyer as he faced the prospect of decades in prison. Mr. Bout, his lawyer said, “believes this is not the end.” More than a decade later, Mr. Bout, 55, has been freed, despite serving less than half of his 25-year prison sentence. He was exchanged on Thursday for the American basketball star Brittney Griner, who had been imprisoned in Russia for 10 months. Russian officials had pressed for Mr. Bout’s return since his conviction by a New York jury on four counts that included conspiring to kill American citizens. Prosecutors said he had agreed to sell antiaircraft weapons to drug enforcement informants who were posing as arms buyers for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The attorney general at the time, Eric Holder, called Mr. Bout (pronounced “Boot”) “one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers.” Mr. Bout became notorious among American intelligence officials, earning the nickname “Merchant of Death” as he evaded capture for years. His exploits helped inspire a 2005 film, “Lord of War,” that starred Nicolas Cage as a character fashioned after Mr. Bout. He was probably the highest-profile Russian in U.S. custody and the prisoner Russia had campaigned the most vociferously to have returned. His return to Russia is likely to reignite the debate over the wisdom of engaging in prisoner exchanges for Americans the United States considers “wrongfully detained” — as was the case with Ms. Griner and is with another American still imprisoned in Russia, Paul Whelan, a former Marine. In interviews with journalists, Mr. Bout has repeatedly denied accusations that he has worked for Russian intelligence agencies. But Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russia’s security services, said there were strong signs — Mr. Bout’s education, his social and professional networks, and his logistical skills — that he is a member, or at least was in close collaboration with, Russia’s military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U. “That is also the opinion of U.S. and other authorities — and it explains the reasons Russia has been so assiduously campaigning to get him back,” Mr. Galeotti, a lecturer on Russia and transnational crime at University College London, said in an interview in July. “All countries try to get their citizens out of rough jurisdictions, but it is clear that it has been a particular priority for the Russians in getting Viktor Bout back.” Mr. Bout grew up in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, until his conscription into the Soviet military at age 18. After a term in the Army, he studied Portuguese at the Military Institute of Foreign Languages in Moscow, a common entree to Russian intelligence services, and eventually became an officer in the Air Force. The Soviet Union broke apart not long after Mr. Bout left the military. As Russia’s economy collapsed and criminal groups thrived, he moved to the United Arab Emirates and started a cargo company that grew to a fleet of 60 planes. With military supplies of former Soviet states leaking onto the black market, his shipping empire delivered guns to rebels, militants and terrorists around the world, prosecutors said. In the new era of privatization in Russia, arms traffickers were able to use old Soviet-era social, military and business networks, and to also develop shell companies to hide transactions. Mr. Bout was accused of selling weapons to Al Qaeda, the Taliban and militants in Rwanda. According to several investigations and his U.S. indictment, he and his associates flouted arms embargoes in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Algeria, where he sold weapons to both the government forces and the rebels fighting them. His ability to avoid being captured added to his notoriety among Western intelligence officials. In 1995, the Taliban forced down one of his planes in Afghanistan and seized the cargo and imprisoned the crew. Mr. Bout and Russian officials somehow managed to get the crew out of the country: In 2003, he told The New York Times Magazine “they were extracted,” and in 2012, The New Yorker reported, he said they simply escaped. U.S. authorities finally caught up with him in Bangkok in 2008. Mr. Bout met with undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agents he believed represented rebels from Colombia’s Revolutionary Armed Forces, or FARC, which the United States considered a terrorist organization until last year. When the prospective buyers told him the weapons could be used to kill American pilots, Mr. Bout responded, “We have the same enemy,” prosecutors said. Thai authorities arrested him on the spot. He was extradited to the United States in 2010 and two years later was sentenced to 25 years. In the years since, Russian authorities have maintained Mr. Bout’s innocence and brought him up as a possible swap for other high-profile American and Ukrainian detainees held by Russia. He has been at the center of a Russian campaign, “we don’t abandon our own,” that has cast his arrest as unfair and politically motivated. Mr. Bout’s exchange has been a priority for Russia “a matter of honor and a matter of ruthless pragmatism,” said Mr. Galeotti, the Russia expert. Russian intelligence agencies “have inherited from the former Soviet K.G.B. a culture that makes it clear to its own agents — ‘we will get you back.’ That kind of loyalty to your own is really important when you are expecting people to put themselves potentially in harm’s way.” It was unclear whether Mr. Bout’s return would further encourage Russia to arrest Westerners who can be traded; Moscow denies allegations that it intentionally arrests people to force an exchange. Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist and expert on the security services who is a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said that while Mr. Bout had been the highest profile Russian prisoner in America, there were many more Russians in U.S. prisons, particularly for hacking. The Russian authorities, Mr. Soldatov said, learned how to “create banks of hostages” in the early 2000s during a brutal war with the breakaway region of Chechnya, right after President Vladimir V Putin came to power. “It was a lesson they never quite forgot,” said Mr. Soldatov. Referring to Russian security agencies, he said, “It makes total sense, from their point of view to do the same with the U.S.” Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.

2022-12-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/us/politics/brittney-griner-russia.html,Brittney Griner Released to US After Russia Swaps Her For Viktor Bout,"WASHINGTON — Brittney Griner, the American basketball star imprisoned in Russia on drug charges, was released on Thursday after nearly 10 months of captivity in a prisoner swap for Viktor Bout, a convicted Russian arms dealer known as the “Merchant of Death.” President Biden announced her release in a brief statement from the Roosevelt Room of the White House, with Cherelle Griner, Ms. Griner’s wife, smiling by his side. Ms. Griner was expected to land overnight in San Antonio and be examined at a U.S. Army hospital there. “I spoke with Brittney Griner,” Mr. Biden said. “She’s safe. She’s on a plane. She’s on her way home after months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held in intolerable circumstances.” He added: “Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones — and she should have been there all along.” The release of Ms. Griner, who turned 32 while in custody, was a rare bright spot in the confrontation between Mr. Biden and Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia, over Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. Ms. Griner, an All-Star center with the W.N.B.A.’s Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, had been serving a nine-year prison sentence that put her at the center of a fraught geopolitical showdown between Washington and Moscow. In February, she was stopped at an airport near Moscow after customs officials found two vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. Ms. Griner’s case became an international cause because she was seen as a hostage held by Mr. Putin’s government as Russia was subjected to international sanctions in response to its invasion of Ukraine a week after her arrest. The Biden administration’s efforts to negotiate a prisoner swap stalled for months as she was sent to a penal colony outside Moscow. Cherelle Griner described her wife’s imprisonment as “the darkest moments” in her life, but thanked Mr. Biden and administration officials for working to secure Ms. Griner’s release. “Today, I’m just standing here, overwhelmed with emotions,” she said. The cheer inside the West Wing on Thursday was tempered by the failure to secure the release of Paul Whelan, another American who remained in Russian custody despite months of efforts by U.S. diplomats to include him as part of the deal with the Russians for the exchange with Mr. Bout. Some Republicans, even as they celebrated Ms. Griner’s release, criticized the president for exchanging her for Mr. Bout, saying the deal will encourage adversaries to take more Americans hostage. Mr. Whelan, a Marine veteran who later worked as a corporate security executive, was arrested at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 and convicted in June 2020 on espionage charges that the U.S. government says were manufactured. In an email to supporters, David Whelan, Mr. Whelan’s brother, said “the Biden administration made the right decision to bring Ms. Griner home, and to make the deal that was possible, rather than waiting for one that wasn’t going to happen.” But he added that “it’s clear the U.S. government needs to be more assertive.” “If bad actors like Russia are going to grab innocent Americans, the U.S. needs a swifter, more direct response, and to be prepared in advance,” David Whelan said. A senior White House official said Thursday that Russians made it clear within the last several weeks that the choice for Mr. Biden would be whether to approve a one-for-one swap — Ms. Griner for Mr. Bout — and that they were unwilling to consider releasing Mr. Whelan. The official, who asked not to be named to discuss the negotiations, said the president made “the difficult decision” to proceed. In his remarks at the White House, Mr. Biden pledged to continue working to free Mr. Whelan. “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s,” he said. “And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.” Later Thursday, the Griner family thanked the president and others in a statement. “We sincerely thank you all for the kind words, thoughts and prayers — including Paul and the Whelan family who have been generous with their support for Brittney and our family during what we know is a heartbreaking time,” they said. “We pray for Paul and for the swift and safe return of all wrongfully detained Americans.” Throughout the summer, American officials were privately angry that Russians refused to discuss the possibility of a swap. In July, Mr. Biden and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken went public with those frustrations, in a move that a senior administration official said Thursday was an attempt to pressure Russia to engage more seriously on a deal. The Russians refused to include Mr. Whelan in the swap because they view him as a spy whose supposed offenses are not equivalent to the others under discussion. But they have not identified anyone else as an appropriate swap for Mr. Whelan, according to Ryan Fayhee, a lawyer representing the Whelan family, which has denied that he was a spy. “The Russians don’t appear to be expressing what it is — either what or who they want,” he said. A former counterespionage official, Mr. Fayhee said he was not aware of a similarly situated Russian in American custody who could be traded. “It’s just really not clear what the resolution is.” That presented the administration with a brutal choice: agree to the deal for Ms. Griner and leave Mr. Whelan in the prison, or hold out for a deal that includes both of them with no guarantee that Russians would ever agree. By Thursday, Dec. 1, when Mr. Biden hosted Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, for a state dinner at the White House, the president had decided to accept the deal, and preparations for the swap began in earnest the next day. That set in motion a set of highly choreographed actions in both Russia and the United States, all done with strict secrecy. Two days ago, Russians moved Ms. Griner from the penal colony to Moscow, in preparation for a possible swap, according to a senior White House official. On Thursday morning, Russians put Ms. Griner on a plane and flew her to an airport in the United Arab Emirates, whose government had agreed to serve as the location for the swap. In a video posted by the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, Ms. Griner is shown boarding a plane in the snow with two duffel bags. Once aboard and in her seat, she is asked by an unidentified person, “What’s your mood?” She replies, “Happy.” Late on Wednesday afternoon, American officials put Mr. Bout on a plane headed to the U.A.E. Another video released by Russia’s state media shows the moment of the swap. Ms. Griner, wearing a red jacket and trousers, walks with three men in suits toward another man and Mr. Bout, who is clutching a brown envelope and holding a coat over one arm. One man shakes Mr. Bout’s hand and embraces him, and then a second man also shakes his hand. Ms. Griner then veers off toward another group of men, including what appears to be an U.A.E. official clad in flowing robes, as they shake her hand. Once American officials confirmed that Ms. Griner was ready to return to the United States, the president signed a conditional grant of clemency to Mr. Bout, who was captured in Bangkok in 2008, extradited to the United States in 2010 and sentenced in 2012 to 25 years in prison. Around the time that Mr. Bout took off, the administration sent an official to Chappaquiddick, Mass., to let Elizabeth Whalen, his sister, know what was about to happen, a step they did not take when the government agreed to a similar swap in April for Trevor Reed, an ailing U.S. Marine veteran held for two years on what his family considered to be bogus charges of assault. Mr. Biden and Mr. Blinken both followed up with calls to Ms. Whelan on Thursday. Officials also invited Cherelle Griner to the White House on Thursday morning, telling her that she would be meeting with Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. Instead, she was led into the Oval Office where she joined a call to her wife with Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. A senior administration official said that considering what she had been through in the last 10 months, Brittney Griner was “in an extremely upbeat mood, all smiles and extremely grateful” to those who helped bring her home. Ms. Griner had been described by one of her lawyers this fall as struggling emotionally and increasingly worried that she would not be freed. She slept on a specially elongated bed to accommodate her 6-foot-9 frame. The trade for Mr. Bout gave Moscow back one of the most notorious arms dealers of modern times, a man who earned the nickname “Merchant of Death” as he evaded capture for years. He was convicted in 2011 by a New York jury on four counts that included conspiring to kill American citizens. The swap may have been an effort by Mr. Putin’s government to divert attention from Russia’s flailing war efforts in Ukraine. Russia has faced a series of setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine and in recent days Ukrainian forces have struck military bases deep inside Russian territory with long-range drones. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said in a statement that the release of Ms. Griner “shouldn’t have come at the cost of releasing one of the world’s worst arms dealers and creating a dangerous precedent for our enemies: detain Americans and Democrats will agree to set your worst killers free.” While administration officials repeatedly committed to continue working for Mr. Whelan’s release, they made no mention until asked of Marc Fogel, an American teacher who previously worked for the United States Embassy in Moscow and was sentenced this year to 14 years in a Russian prison for drug smuggling. His family has said that he had been carrying less than 20 grams of marijuana, which they said had been recommended to him by a doctor to help treat a debilitating spinal condition. The White House said on Thursday that it could not discuss his case. The negotiations for Ms. Griner’s release started and stopped repeatedly over the last few months and several foreign governments intervened on the Americans’ behalf. Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates, raised the matter during a meeting with Mr. Putin in October, according to an official briefed on the session. The U.A.E. has been trying to arrange prisoner swaps between the Russians and Ukrainians. The Saudi government, whose relationship with Mr. Biden has been strained, attempted to take credit on Thursday, issuing a joint statement with the U.A.E. asserting that “mediation efforts led by” Crown Prince Mohammed and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the prime minister of Saudi Arabia, “resulted in the release and exchange.” American officials deemed that a brazen overstatement. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said “there was no mediation involved” and “the only countries that negotiated this deal were the United States and Russia.” Andrew E.

2022-12-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/world/europe/griner-americans-detained.html,More Americans Are Being ‘Wrongfully Detained’ and Held Abroad,"Brittney Griner may have been the highest-profile American whose detention abroad was deemed wrongful by the U.S. State Department, but she was hardly the only one: The number of American citizens unjustly or wrongfully detained by foreign governments has risen sharply in recent decades, researchers have found. The State Department has not released an official tally of how many Americans are being unjustly held by state actors. But researchers working for the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, which advocates on behalf of both hostages and wrongful detainees and their families, have found that the number of Americans being unjustly held by foreign governments has been rising. “Over the last 10 years we’ve seen a 175 percent increase in incidents of Americans being wrongfully detained,” Cynthia T. Loertscher, the director of research, hostage advocacy, and government affairs for the Foley Foundation, said in an interview. A State Department spokesman did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. In July, a senior State Department official said that there were between 40 and 50 Americans being wrongfully detained by foreign governments. The foundation, which was named for named for a James Foley, journalist who was killed in Syria by the Islamic State in 2014, issued a report in September which found that wrongful detentions have been rising. Among its findings: President Biden addressed the subject Thursday morning as he discussed the release of Ms. Griner. “I don’t want any American to sit wrongfully detained one extra day if we can bring that person home,” he said at the White House. “My administration has now brought home dozens of Americans who were wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad, many of whom had been held since before I took office. And today we also remember the other Americans that are being held hostage and wrongfully detained in Russia or anywhere else in the world. Reuniting these Americans with their loved ones remains a priority — a priority for my administration and every person in my administration involved in this.” Diane Foley, the founder and president of the Foley foundation, praised the Biden administration’s efforts to free Ms. Griner. She urged the administration to continue to press Russia for the release of Paul Whelan, an American who is serving a 16-year sentence in Russia on espionage charges that the U.S. government has said were manufactured, saying in a statement that it was “heartbreaking that Paul Whelan is not also on that flight home with Brittney.” At the White House, Mr. Biden said that “we’ve not forgotten about Paul Whelan, who has been unjustly detained in Russia for years.” “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s,” he said. “And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.”",7

The video, which was verified by The New York Times, shows Ms. Griner, in a red jacket and pants, walking with three men in suits toward another man and Mr. Bout, who is clutching a brown envelope and holding a coat over one arm. Ms. Griner’s hair is closely cropped, with no sign of her signature dreadlocks. One man shakes Mr. Bout’s hand and embraces him, and then a second man also shakes his hand. Ms. Griner then veers off toward another group of men, including one clad in flowing robes who appears to be a U.A.E. official, as they shake her hand. As the prisoner exchange takes place, a white jet stands in the background, steps open on the tarmac at Al Bateen Executive Airport in Abu Dhabi. The images, published by Russian news outlets, are from a series of video clips of the various stages of Ms. Griner’s release. It was unclear when all the scenes took place. In footage posted by the Russian state broadcaster RT, an unidentified woman who appears to be a prison warden says in Russian to Ms. Griner: “Will you come visit here? Yes? Great, come visit!” And in video posted to the Telegram message application by the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, Ms. Griner is shown boarding a plane in the snow, carrying a duffel bag. Once aboard and in her seat, she is asked by an unidentified person, “What’s your mood?” She replies, “Happy.” Ms. Griner is asked if she knows where she is going. She says she doesn’t know, and is then told that she is going to the United States. The person says, “Everything will be fine.” Anton Troianovski contributed reporting.",7
2022-12-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/us/politics/brittney-griner-prisoner-swap.html,Inside the Prisoner Swap That Freed Brittney Griner,"WASHINGTON — Month after month, as American diplomats pushed for the release of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan from Russian prisons, they received the same, infuriating answer: If you want both prisoners, we want Vadim Krasikov as part of the deal. Mr. Krasikov is an assassin who murdered a Chechen fighter in a park in Berlin in broad daylight in 2019, a brazen killing that the German authorities say was committed at the behest of Russia’s intelligence services. Convicted and sentenced to life in prison in Germany, Mr. Krasikov was not in U.S. custody to be traded to Russia. It was, the Americans thought, hardly a viable request for a swap that would include Ms. Griner, a W.N.B.A. star, and Mr. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, who were being detained on what Biden administration officials considered trumped-up charges. American officials felt out their German counterparts to see if they might agree and were hardly surprised when Berlin refused to release what they considered a cold killer. Trying to be creative, the Americans even explored some sort of three-way deal that would give the Germans something in return, but that did not go anywhere, either. Privately, some of the administration’s diplomats concluded that the insistence on freeing Mr. Krasikov was a stalling tactic by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who they believed was determined not to deliver any kind of political victory to President Biden before the midterm elections in the United States last month. Others believed the Russians were serious and saw it as a face-saving way for Moscow’s security services to give up Mr. Whelan, whom they convicted of espionage despite flat denials from Washington that he was a spy. Either way, how Mr. Biden came to agree to a swap that freed Ms. Griner but not Mr. Whelan was a tale of feints and intrigue carried out through secret negotiations and public posturing, all against the backdrop of a brutal war in which American-armed Ukrainians were battling Russian invaders. At the end of the day, according to senior U.S. officials directly involved in the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe delicate diplomacy, it left the president with the unpalatable choice of liberating one American while leaving another behind. Ms. Griner arrived in the United States early Friday, landing in San Antonio, where she was to receive medical evaluations at Brooke Army Medical Center and be reunited with family, a relief for Mr. Biden and his team. Mr. Whelan remains in a dismal Russian prison, his long-term fate unknown, as his frustrated family waits and while the president vows to redouble efforts to bring him home. In Moscow on Friday, Mr. Putin said Russia was continuing to communicate with American officials and that “everything is possible” regarding further prisoner exchanges. American officials have delivered a similar message, pledging to continue talks in the hope of bringing Mr. Whelan home as soon as possible. The two imprisoned Americans offered distinct cases that were eventually linked and then unlinked. Ms. Griner, detained on minor drug charges a week before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, was seen as a hostage in the midst of the confrontation with the West over the conflict. Mr. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, had been in prison since 2018 on espionage charges long before the war in Ukraine. The outlines of a possible agreement were on the table as far back as last spring. Interacting through intelligence agencies, the Russians made clear that they were willing to trade Ms. Griner for Viktor Bout, a notorious Russian arms dealer arrested in Thailand in 2008 and serving a 25-year sentence in American prison. But they were not willing to include Mr. Whelan in the package deal. Mr. Bout was important to the Russians because of his ties to the security services. While he is not known to be close to Mr. Putin, U.S. officials said, Mr. Bout has connections in the Russian power structures. And Russia had made a martyr out of Mr. Bout over the past 14 years; freeing him would allow Mr. Putin to boast about finally bringing a patriot home. To the Russians, trading Ms. Griner for Mr. Bout was a swap of two criminals, according to U.S. officials. Mr. Whelan, on the other hand, was supposedly an American agent, in the Russian telling, so only another agent or someone of equivalent importance would merit giving him up. The Americans do not currently have a Russian spy in custody to trade. And that is where Mr. Krasikov came in. Mr. Krasikov, who called himself Vadim A. Sokolov, was arrested after two witnesses saw him throwing his bike and a bag into the Spree River after twice shooting the victim, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a Chechen separatist commander who fought against Russian forces in the early 2000s and was labeled a terrorist by Russian state media. Police divers later found a Glock 26 pistol in the river in the downtown park. Frustrated by the demand for a swap they could not make, American officials broke with years of tradition by telling reporters that they had made a “substantial” offer to the Russians, making clear that Mr. Biden would trade Mr. Bout for Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan. They hoped the public pressure would move the Russians off their insistence for Mr. Krasikov and into a deal. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. It did not — for many months. But just after Election Day in the United States, Russian contacts delivered a new message, raising the possibility of excluding Mr. Whelan from a deal and instead focusing exclusively on Ms. Griner. If that were the case, the Russians said, Moscow might consider Mr. Bout a fair trade. The disparity of their offenses was vast: Mr. Bout was an illegal arms merchant to some of the world’s most violent forces, including some intent on killing Americans; Ms. Griner was detained for traveling with vape cartridges containing hashish oil. But it was the first time that the Russians had made what the American diplomats considered a real counteroffer, if they were serious about following through. At the White House, the possibility prompted a series of high-level meetings and discussions, some of which included Mr. Biden, about whether to test if the Russians were serious about making a one-for-one deal, much like they had months before in a swap that freed Trevor Reed, another imprisoned American. The situation was fluid and uncertain. Even as they discussed their options, the family of Mr. Whelan said publicly that he had missed two calls with them, raising fears for his safety and reports that he had been moved from his prison to a hospital in Russia. Had the Russians done something to Mr. Whelan? That could have made a trade for Ms. Griner impossible, but also would have seemed unlikely given that it was the Russians who now seemed eager to make a deal. For days, work on the potential deal for Ms. Griner stalled as the Americans worked to figure out what had happened. Officials eventually determined that Mr. Whelan had been taken back to prison, and he called his family. At a meeting in the Oval Office early last week, Mr. Biden was ready to sign off. The Justice Department had weighed in against the deal, communicating their objections through Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. But the department makes a policy of opposing prisoner trades across the board, arguing that it undercuts the American justice system. The State Department, on the other hand, recommended the deal, as did other officials who concluded that the deal from the Russians was never going to change and so it was time to take it. The president agreed. The careful negotiations, however, almost unraveled a few days later, as Mr. Biden hosted President Emmanuel Macron of France for a state dinner at the White House. A journalist for CBS News contacted the White House with reporting that the administration was preparing to swap Ms. Griner for Mr. Bout. Premature disclosure, officials feared, was likely to scuttle the deal. They asked the network to hold off. According to CBS, it “agreed to a White House request to hold the reporting because officials expressed grave concern about the fragility of the then-emerging deal.” With that resolved, officials moved forward. Armed with the president’s go-ahead, they pressed their Russian counterparts: Are you serious about this? The answer came back more quickly than the American diplomats expected, and it was more definitive. Yes, they said. The day after the state dinner, Mr. Biden signed an executive grant of clemency for Mr. Bout, but held it back while aides set the transfer in motion. Wary of undercutting the deal, the American diplomats carefully made one last appeal for Mr. Whelan, asking the Russians if there was anyone other than Mr. Krasikov whom they might want in exchange for both Mr. Whelan and Ms. Griner. They got a firm no, but the Russians did not use the effort as an excuse to back out of the developing arrangement for Ms. Griner. Within days, plans were set for two planes to take off — one from Moscow, where Ms. Griner had been transferred, and another from the United States, with Mr. Bout. One question to resolve: Where to make the swap? In the Cold War days and even as recently as a Russian-American spy swap in 2010 under President Barack Obama, prisoners were exchanged in the middle of Europe: the Glienicke Bridge in Potsdam, Germany, as made famous in the Tom Hanks movie “Bridge of Spies,” or in Vienna, as with the 2010 trade. But because of American and European sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in February, Moscow was not willing to send a plane anywhere in Europe for fear that it could be seized. Even long-neutral Switzerland had joined sanctions against Russia while Helsinki, Finland — a prime Russian-American meeting site during the Cold War — was no longer acceptable because the country is joining NATO. The compromise became the United Arab Emirates, a small Gulf state that is friendly with both Washington and Moscow. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of the Emirates, had raised Ms. Griner’s case with Mr. Putin during a meeting in October, and so the Emiratis were happy to facilitate the transfer. The arrangements were made: Both sides would send planes to Abu Dhabi, the capital. Cherelle Griner, Ms. Griner’s wife, was invited to the White House on Thursday morning ostensibly to meet with Mr. Sullivan for an update. When she arrived, however, Mr. Sullivan surprised her by taking her to the Oval Office, where Mr. Biden broke the news that Ms. Griner was coming home. At that point, Ms. Griner was on the ground in Abu Dhabi, while Mr. Bout’s plane was 30 minutes out. Once he landed, his clemency document was finalized and the swap proceeded, captured in grainy video distributed by Russian state media. It showed Ms. Griner and Mr. Bout being walked to the middle of a dusty tarmac, escorted by officials of their countries. After a brief stop, Ms. Griner was led away in one direction, while Mr. Bout left with Russian officials in another. Mr. Biden and Cherelle Griner celebrated before cameras in the Oval Office. But once the journalists were ushered out, the president had another, grimmer task: He had to call Mr. Whelan’s sister to explain why he was not coming home, at least not yet.

2022-12-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/world/europe/viktor-bout-welcome-russia.html,Russia Cheers Viktor Bout’s Release as a Kremlin Victory,"In the West, he is known as a convicted illicit arms trafficker, “the merchant of death” who helped fuel wars around the world. But in Russia, Viktor Bout was welcomed home this week as something of a hero, or at least an innocent victim of American politics. The Russian government, its allies and the relentlessly pro-Kremlin media hailed the release of Mr. Bout, 55, by the United States, in exchange for the American basketball star Brittney Griner, and claimed that it meant that President Vladimir V. Putin had bested President Biden. It was the rare development they could seize on as a victory for Mr. Putin in a war against Ukraine and a showdown with the West that have gone poorly for Russia. And it came after years of Russian news media and officials repeatedly citing Mr. Bout’s case as a monstrous injustice and a major diplomatic irritant. “Everyone will forget Griner tomorrow,” Yevgeny Popov, co-host of a news show on a state media channel and a member of the Russian Parliament, wrote on the app Telegram on Thursday. “Bout’s life is only beginning.” When he stepped off the plane that carried him home after almost 15 years in prison, Mr. Bout was greeted by his wife, his mother and a camera crew from another state channel. He was interviewed by a third state news agency. What none of the reactions quite explained was why Mr. Bout, described by Russia as merely a businessman operating a small air freight company, mattered so much to the Kremlin, for so many years. There has long been speculation that he worked for a Russian spy agency, that his arms deals pursued Kremlin ends, that he had personal ties to high-level government figures, or some combination of such factors — all of which he has consistently denied. Maria Butina, who served more than a year in prison in the United States for being an unregistered agent of Russia, conducted the first interview with him after his release, for the outlet RT. Ms. Butina, now a Russian legislator, called the exchange “a capitulation by America,” and asked about the high-level interest in his case. “I don’t think I’m somehow important for Russian politics,” Mr. Bout replied. He added, “We do not abandon our own, right?” But the Russian foreign ministry said it had been flooded with congratulations for his release, and noted how often the Kremlin had demanded his freedom. The government’s human rights commissioner, Tatyana Moskalkova, said, “I think everyone who followed the ordeal of this wonderful person, who had fallen victim to U.S. insinuations, is now filled with joy,” the Russian news agency Tass reported. In the RT interview, Mr. Bout echoed Mr. Putin in describing Russia as a victim of Western schemes. “The West thinks that they didn’t finish us off in 1990, when the Soviet Union started to collapse,” he said. “They think they can destroy us again and divide Russia into many parts.” But he did not fully parrot the Kremlin script, dodging suggestions that Mr. Biden was weak and Americans were Russophobic. Mr. Bout was once a Soviet military officer and translator, but Western governments and human rights groups say that in the 1990s and 2000s he was one of the world’s leading weapons dealers, defying international sanctions to sell to factions in many conflicts, particularly in Africa. The 2005 film “Lord of War,” starring Nicolas Cage, was based loosely on him. In March 2008, U.S. agents arrested Mr. Bout in a sting operation in Bangkok, posing as Colombian guerrillas who wanted to buy weapons, including antiaircraft missiles that they said would be used to kill American pilots. Over strenuous Russian objections, Thailand ultimately agreed to extradite him to the United States for trial. In 2011, he was convicted in New York of conspiring to kill American citizens, conspiring to provide support to a foreign terrorist organization and conspiring to acquire and export illegal weapons. He was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. At the time, the Russian foreign ministry denounced the court as “clearly carrying out a political order,” aided by “the smear campaign unleashed by the American media.” If not for Mr. Biden’s intervention to secure Ms. Griner’s freedom, Mr. Bout would not have been eligible for release for another seven years.",7
2022-12-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/us/politics/griner-blowback.html,Blowback Over Griner’s Release Exposes Depth of America’s Divisions,"There was a time when the release of American citizens who had been unjustly imprisoned by a foreign adversary was a moment for bipartisan relief and celebration: the 2018 return of three men from North Korea, secured by President Donald J. Trump, or the 1991 freeing of Terry Anderson, an American journalist, after years of captivity in Lebanon. Those moments felt like sepia-toned artifacts on Friday as Brittney Griner, the women’s basketball star, slipped quietly into a military base in Texas for evaluation following her release from Russia, while a Fox News reporter peppered the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, with pointed questions about an exchange that he said had sent the “Merchant of Death” to Russia for a “professional athlete.” Within hours of Ms. Griner’s release, much of the right wing was in full outrage mode, seizing upon both the man Ms. Griner had been exchanged for — Viktor Bout, a notorious Russian arms merchant serving time, in part, for endangering American lives — and the Biden administration’s failure to secure the release as well, or instead, of a former Marine, Paul Whelan, who has languished in a Russian prison since his 2018 arrest on espionage charges. A considerable amount of attention was also paid to who Ms. Griner is: a Black woman, a celebrity, a married lesbian and, though it had gone largely unnoticed until now, an assertive liberal — one who, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, called to stop playing the national anthem at her team’s basketball games. From the early days of the Cold War through the protracted conflict in Afghanistan, hostage releases have carried political risks, especially when they involve prisoner exchanges, said Danielle Gilbert of Dartmouth College, an expert on such deals. The scenes of joy and the human drama of a return to freedom must be tempered by the knowledge that victory was attained through a deal with an adversary — almost always involving a concession that the adversary dearly wanted. And, of course, legitimate questions can be raised about these swaps, including whether they encourage still more hostage-taking or could endanger Americans, like Mr. Whelan, who are left behind. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, who hopes to be speaker in the Republican-controlled House next year, touched on that when he appeared on Fox News to condemn the “trumped-up charge” against Ms. Griner but to say that the exchange with Mr. Bout had “made us weaker.” He added, “It’s made Putin stronger, and it’s made Americans more vulnerable.” But Ms. Griner’s case has gone beyond such calculations, into the fraught arenas of race, gender and sexual orientation, and at a time of make-no-concessions partisanship, when large swaths of the American public are steeped in the grievance politics and adversary demonization of Mr. Trump and his acolytes. The former president’s son Donald Jr. swiped at Ms. Griner’s identity when he wrote that the Biden administration “was apparently worried that their DEI score would go down if they freed an American Marine,” using the corporate-world acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion. His father, the former president, took issue with Ms. Griner’s political views, declaring that she “openly hated our Country.” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia called the prisoner swap “another reason to impeach Biden.” And those were among the more tame comments from the Trump-dominated right. “There’s that underlying sense that this is part of the Democrats’ focusing on someone who is sympathetic to them and leaving a Marine behind,” said David Silbey, a military historian at Cornell University. “It fits nicely in the narrative that a lot of the right is telling America, about who gets the privilege in Biden’s America.” Prisoner exchanges have long been politically difficult, especially for Democratic presidents. Mr. Whelan was taken prisoner when Mr. Trump was in the White House, and his sister, Elizabeth Whelan, pleaded with officials close to the president to try to win his release. In the summer of 2019, Mr. Whelan begged Mr. Trump for his assistance — “Tweet your intentions,” he shouted to reporters from inside a glass cage at the Moscow City Court — to no avail. Yet it is Mr. Trump’s successor who is taking the heat. There are plenty of historical precedents. When Francis Gary Powers’s U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960, Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, and America's sympathies lay with the pilot, seen as an innocent victim in the secret Cold War spy game. But when John F. Kennedy engineered Mr. Powers’s release in exchange for a K.G.B. colonel, sympathies quickly shifted, with some Republicans accusing the administration of releasing a Soviet “spymaster” for a coward who should have swallowed a C.I.A.-issued “suicide pill.” President Barack Obama faced similar blowback in 2014 when his administration engineered the release of Bowe Bergdahl, a soldier held captive by the Taliban, in exchange for five Taliban detainees from the military prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Mr. Bergdahl had wandered off his base, prompting accusations that he had gotten what was coming to him, just as Ms. Griner’s possession of cannabis residue prompted critics to suggest she had brought her punishment upon herself, Ms. Gilbert said. The Bergdahl blowback led the Republican-led House to pass a resolution condemning Mr. Obama for making the deal without notifying Congress ahead of time, claiming that “these actions have burdened unnecessarily the trust and confidence in the commitment and ability of the Obama administration to constructively engage and work with Congress.” But while the Bergdahl exchange at least involved combatants on both sides, historians could think of no parallel for the exchange of an American basketball star for a Russian arms merchant in the 14th year of a 25-year sentence for conspiring to kill Americans. Mr. Bout, immortalized by Hollywood in the film “Lord of War,” was convicted in 2011 of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and officials with his indiscriminate arms sales, which armed both anti-American terrorist organizations and pro-American insurgents like Angola’s UNITA. He fueled the brutal war against civilians in Liberia waged by the warlord Charles Taylor, in which an estimated 300,000 people lost their lives. Mr. Bout would not have been eligible for release until 2029. Many Americans saw the exchange as their government’s freeing a coldblooded killer, with the deaths of thousands on his hands, for a member of the liberal elite. “The Biden administration showed the world what privilege really looks like,” wrote Rick Manning, president of the pro-Trump Americans for Limited Government. Ms. Griner’s politics have indeed come from the left. The liberal-leaning Black publication The Root named her one of the most influential African Americans of 2020 after she told The Arizona Republic at the height of the George Floyd protests, “I honestly feel we should not play the national anthem during our season.” Ms. Gilbert said she had gotten a trickle of emails for months — many of them racist and homophobic — questioning why Ms. Griner should be released at all. On Friday, they became a torrent. Still, Colin Kaepernick Ms. Griner is not. Her politics were unknown to most Americans beyond the fringe right and the ardent left until her release, when prominent voices on the right seized on them. Tucker Carlson led his top-rated Fox News show on Thursday night with a diatribe, accusing Ms. Griner of being unpatriotic and suggesting that Mr. Whelan had been left behind because of his politics. “Whelan is a Trump voter, and he made the mistake of saying so on social media,” Mr. Carlson said in his monologue. “He’s paying the price now. Brittney Griner is not. She has very different politics. Brittney Griner despises the United States.” And Mr. Carlson was explicit about her identity — “which,” he said, “is central to equity.” He continued, “Brittney Griner is not white, and she’s a lesbian.” As much as her fame and prominence made her incarceration intolerable to some Americans, Ms. Griner’s gender may be coloring the exchange in the eyes of some critics, Professor Silbey suggested. In women’s professional basketball, Ms. Griner is a superstar: an Olympic gold medalist, a national champion with the Phoenix Mercury, a six-time all-star and the only true center to lead the W.N.B.A. in scoring. The response to her arrest in Moscow on extremely minor drug charges — and especially to her release — would have been wildly different if they had happened to her male equivalent, he said. “If LeBron James had been grabbed by Russia at an airport and sent to a prison camp,” Professor Silbey said, “imagine the level of hysteria that would have caused.”",7
2022-12-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/us/brittney-griner-release.html,"With Brittney Griner’s Release, Anxiety Turns to Relief","HOUSTON — Brianna Turner was sleeping Thursday morning when her mother burst into her room to say that Brittney Griner, her teammate on the Phoenix Mercury, had been freed in a prisoner swap after nearly a year of captivity in Russia. “I was debating if I was still dreaming or not,” recalled Ms. Turner, who grew up in the Houston area and watched Ms. Griner play in high school there, long before their years together in professional basketball. “I’m just really excited for her to feel safe, feel secure, be with her wife and kind of just, like, recover.” The sudden release brought forth an outpouring of gratitude and relief on Thursday after 294 days of anxiety and anticipation, from the suburbs of Houston to the streets of Phoenix, where Ms. Griner had held court as the biggest star in the W.N.B.A. Because she represented so much to so many, her imprisonment had hit especially hard. Ms. Griner had found support in the L.G.B.T.Q. community, whose leaders feared for her safety as a Black lesbian imprisoned in Russia, and in her native Texas, where pastors and politicians worked to keep her from being left to serve a long, harsh prison term. To some, her initial arrest on drug charges had seemed like a momentary spasm in the tense diplomatic relationship between the United States and Russia, a minor political situation that would quickly be resolved. But as the weeks stretched to months, concern grew — particularly over the summer, “when there was no contact,” said Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, who had helped keep pressure on the Biden administration to negotiate for Ms. Griner’s release, including a rally in June in the city’s downtown. “We had no way of knowing if progress was being made or if we were losing ground,” said Bishop James E. Dixon, the president of the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., who worked with Ms. Jackson Lee. “The uncertainty was a burden to carry.” Ms. Griner was found guilty of trying to smuggle illegal drugs into Russia after the authorities found vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her carry-on luggage on Feb. 17 as she traveled to Russia to play for a high-paying professional team during the W.N.B.A. off-season. Supporters of Ms. Griner watched with dismay as her situation worsened over the course of the year: from arrest, to courtroom appearances, to a sentence of nine years and then a transfer to a penal colony. “Each one of those moments, where you’re hopeful, but then hopes are dashed,” Bishop Dixon said. At a home just outside Houston listed as a former address for Ms. Griner, a basketball hoop lay rim-down in the backyard grass, visible from a neatly tended and quiet cul-de-sac. A sign on the front door suggested the long, arduous and public difficulties faced by her family: “No Media. No Trespassing. Just Pray. Thanks.” Ernest Alfaro, who lives two doors down, said he and his family had been praying for Ms. Griner and for her father, Ray, who he said still lived in the home. In a statement, members of the Griner family thanked President Biden and his administration and requested privacy “as we embark on this road to healing.” Since the time Ms. Griner disappeared into the Russian prison system, said Mr. Alfaro, a pastor at a local church, “We started praying for her family.” Ms. Turner, Ms. Griner’s teammate, said she had corresponded by letter with Ms. Griner during her confinement but had not heard from her since mid-October, when she was moved to the penal colony. “In the beginning, I felt denial, and then I was confused, and then I was like, ‘How is this possible?’” Ms. Turner said. “There’s so many millions of people that live in America, and I happen to know one of the few who are detained in Russia. Even today has felt surreal.” Vince Kozar, the president of the Mercury, had also been exchanging letters with Ms. Griner. The Mercury had tried to keep her plight in the public eye during her imprisonment as a way of reminding the Biden administration how many people wanted her home, Mr. Kozar said. So too did Chris Mosier, a pathbreaking transgender endurance athlete who has competed for the U.S. internationally. A Chicago resident, Mr. Mosier showed up at every Chicago Sky game with signs or T-shirts reminding people about Ms. Griner. He spoke about her whenever given the opportunity: at conferences around the world and across his social media accounts. “As an athlete, I feel really passionately about this, because this could have happened to any of us,” he said. And so on Thursday the tension of her captivity gave way to a kind of national exhalation. Outside the Footprint Center in Phoenix, home to Ms. Griner’s team, Danae McKnight wore a “We Are B.G.” T-shirt and said she had felt she had to come to the stadium after hearing the news. “So I went, got a beer, celebrated a little bit — it just felt right,” she said. The imprisonment felt to Ms. McKnight and her wife as though “our friend or our loved one was locked up,” she said. Ms. Jackson Lee said that while Ms. Griner was initially stopping at a military base in San Antonio on Friday, it was not clear where she would go after that. “We’re just ecstatic for her wife, for her mother and father,” she said. Ms. Turner, her teammate on the Mercury, said that she did not know when she would speak to or see Ms. Griner — “I don’t even know if she has the same phone number,” she said — but that when they reunited, she would ask where she felt like eating. They bond over food, she said, and when playing on the road, they often visit the cookie chain Crumbl. “Right now, she should prioritize her recovery and adjusting to being back home,” Ms. Turner said. Kendra Venzant, the coach of the Lady Cougars basketball team at Chester W. Nimitz High School, where Ms. Griner once played, learned of her release with a constant pinging and ringing on her cellphone as friends and relatives called and texted on Thursday. The two women had been teammates at the high school outside Houston — Ms. Venzant the senior point guard, Ms. Griner the towering freshman — and Ms. Griner had returned to the school as recently as last year to talk to the next generation of young players. “I immediately just thanked God, because you never know the time or the hour,” Ms. Venzant said, standing in her office before practice on Thursday. “That situation definitely touched my heart and the players, because I speak of Brittney Griner a lot.” The news of her release provided a burst of inspiration to the young players who had watched Ms. Griner put their school on the girls’ basketball map. “To know that she’s safe at home was definitely a blessing,” she said. “Nothing was going to steal my joy today.” Edgar Sandoval contributed reporting.",7
2022-12-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/world/australia/griner-iran-prisoner.html,Former Prisoner in Iran Welcomes Brittney Griner to a ‘Bizarre Club’,"Kylie Moore-Gilbert, an Islamic studies scholar who was detained in Iran for more than two years, is still figuring out how to move on with her life two years after returning home to Australia. Her experience offers a glimpse of what Brittney Griner and others who have been through similar ordeals could encounter in their transition to post-detention life. Ms. Griner, who returned to the United States on Friday after being detained in Russia for 10 months, is now part of the “bizarre club” of people all over the world who have gone home from detention abroad, many of whom support one another, Dr. Moore-Gilbert said on Saturday. After going home, Dr. Moore-Gilbert was unable to simply pick up where she left off. She quit her job at the University of Melbourne and a few months after her release began writing about her experience in prison, finding it healing, she said. She spent most of this year traveling and going to events to promote the resulting book, “The Uncaged Sky.” With that winding down, “I’m having to reassess my life and try and figure out what I’m doing with myself,” she said. Dr. Moore-Gilbert was arrested at the Tehran airport in 2018 as she tried to leave Iran after attending a seminar on Shia Islam. After being tried in secret, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison on espionage charges and held for most of her time in detention in Evin Prison. She was released in November 2020 in exchange for three Iranian men who were imprisoned in Thailand. She has maintained her innocence. Iran has a record of detaining foreign and dual citizens on false espionage charges, swapping them for Iranians jailed abroad. For Dr. Moore-Gilbert, coping with the ordeal has changed over time and become more difficult than in the first months after her release. She described going through the early days in a state of shock and paralysis at suddenly having endless options, like what shampoo to buy and which friends to hang out with, after having everything decided for her in prison. Only after the shock wore off, which took months, did her detention become real to her. By that point, the flurry of people around her asking if she needed support had disappeared. People shied away from bringing up her imprisonment or mentioning Iran, she said: “That was frustrating because I wanted to talk about it. I didn’t want to just dig a hole and bury it.” Her time in prison wasn’t the unrelenting suffering that people often assume it was; it included moments of hilarity and fun with her cellmates. She learned things about her character and how she reacts to difficult situations. To move forward and keep her imprisonment from defining her life, she has gotten involved in advocacy for “other victims of arbitrary detention and hostage diplomacy,” she said.",7
2022-12-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/world/europe/brittney-griner-russia-athletes.html,Brittney Griner Swap Puts Spotlight on Americans in Russia,"MOSCOW — After almost 10 months of war, sanctions, nuclear threats and the constant monitoring of the Russian security state, some American and European citizens continue to live and work in Russia, drawn in many cases by professional opportunities and higher salaries. Some Western athletes, businesspeople and artists chose to stay even as the Russian authorities arrested and jailed the American basketball player Brittney Griner in February on a minor drug charge. On Thursday, she was freed and sent back to the United States in a prisoner exchange for a notorious Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout, in a move that some Republican politicians and analysts have said puts other Americans at risk of being wrongfully detained for political gain. Ms. Griner’s detention has injected a complex new factor into the calculation of whether to travel to, or work in, Russia, an already fraught decision with the war in Ukraine as a backdrop. More than 1,000 multinational companies have curtailed their operations in Russia since the invasion, with foreign managers often being the first to go. Most Western universities have halted student exchange programs with Russian peers. And most major European and American cultural institutions have ended collaborations with Russian theaters and museums, including the Bolshoi in Moscow and the Mariinsky in St. Petersburg, two of the world’s most storied houses for opera and ballet. But in other areas the numbers of Westerners have held steady or even grown since Ms. Griner’s arrest. Most choose to come or stay to advance careers, but there are also examples of Americans who made Russia their home for political reasons. Most famously, they include the actor Steven Seagal and the former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, who just this month took an oath of Russian citizenship. Athletes have long provided one of the biggest streams of prominent Westerners to Russia. Players “whose careers were declining went there to maintain the same level of income that they were accustomed to,” said Bill Neff, an agent with clients across the world. After the outbreak of the war, the Russian teams in the Continental Hockey League, which includes Russia and its neighbors, lost nearly half of its foreign players. Finns and Swedes led the exodus, largely abiding by their countries’ hard-line stance toward Russia’s aggression. But after the initial outflow, some of the European vacancies are being filled by American and Canadian players. They include Scott Wilson, a Canadian who won N.H.L. championships with the Pittsburgh Penguins, and an American, Alexander Chmelevski, both of whom joined Russian teams this fall. There are now an estimated 42 Americans playing or planning to play in Russia’s premier men’s basketball league, up from 30 a few months ago, according to tallies by American sports agents. An analysis of team rosters shows that there are an additional 29 American and Canadian hockey players who are signed to premier Russian teams this season, with some joining after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There is even an American playing for the Russian woman’s basketball team that Ms. Griner represented before her arrest. These athletes have stayed despite warnings from the State Department, which is advising all Americans to leave Russia immediately, weighing the risks of playing in Russia against professional and financial opportunities in a major sports market. Many agents representing American athletes did not respond to queries about Ms. Griner’s detention in Russia. Those who did said the prisoner swap that brought her home had no effect on their work or their clients. “Griner’s case has to do with things that have nothing to do with basketball,” said David Carro, a Spanish sports agent representing four male American basketball players in Russia. “We never had any problems when Brittney Griner was there, and now, even less so.” “Our Americans get paid promptly and are living very well in Russia,” he added. Many American basketball players come to Russia to make money in the off-season or to prolong their careers. Because Russia covets top-level “name” players, they often pay high salaries. Athletes can take in more than $1 million and often receive free housing and cars. Mr. Neff, who represents about 30 professional basketball players, said Ms. Griner’s freedom did not lessen his caution in sending players to Russia during the conflict with Ukraine. He has discouraged his clients from going there and does not currently have any players in Russia. “I don’t think it changes anything,” Mr. Neff said of her release. “If you send someone to Russia, you know there are risks. Is the increased money worth the risk? That’s the choice you’re making.” The American basketball player K.C. Rivers, 35, came to Russia in August, while Ms. Griner was on trial, to play for the team of Samara, a provincial capital more than 500 miles east of Moscow. “At this point I didn’t really have so many options coming my way,” Mr. Rivers said in an interview in September. “What’s the best thing for me right now, towards — I ain’t going to say the end of my career — but in my career at this point? Financially, what makes sense?” The Russian basketball clubs are playing fewer games this season because of their suspension from Euroleague competition, a penalty that has diminished the quality of players the league has attracted, Mr. Neff said. And Russia’s hockey league voted this month to slash the number of foreigners that will be allowed on each team starting next season, an example of wartime nationalism sweeping the country. There are still a few Americans imprisoned in Russia. One is Paul Whelan, who was detained in December 2018, convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years in a penal colony; the U.S. State Department says he has been wrongfully detained. Marc Fogel, a 60-year-old history teacher, was detained in 2021 for having about half an ounce of medical marijuana. He was sentenced in June to 14 years in a penal colony. During a visit to Kyrgyzstan on Friday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia commented on the possibility of new prisoner exchanges with the United States. “Everything is possible and contacts continue through the special services,” he said at a news conference. George Beebe, a former director of the C.I.A.’s Russia analysis and a Russia adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, said that while there were risks for Americans in Russia, he did not think the Bout-Griner swap had increased the chances of an American’s being arrested on trumped-up pretexts. “For American citizens that are living and working in Russia, I wouldn’t say that there is no danger,” Mr. Beebe, the program director at the Quincy Institute think tank, said in a telephone interview. “Certainly there is. The Russian government is not likely to be at all lenient in dealing with Americans. They’re not going to give any Americans the benefit of the doubt.” However, he said, “I don’t think it increases the likelihood that the Russian government is going to arrest Americans.” Andrei A. Soldatov, a Russian journalist who specializes in the security services, said it was hard to make predictions when the rules of the game are constantly changing. During the Cold War era, he said, the rules were defined and predictable. But with the war in Ukraine continuing to escalate, diplomacy is entering uncharted territory. “We all have this temptation always to compare this to the Cold War, but this is nothing like that,” he said in a telephone interview. “The Cold War was a period when nobody wanted or was actually interested in a hot war. And now we have a really big war which might get bigger,” he said. “Nobody can actually rationalize or predict and develop a strategy accordingly — that’s a problem.” Valerie Hopkins reported from Moscow, Anatoly Kurmanaev from Berlin and Jonathan Abrams from Charlotte, N.C.

He described how Ms. Griner, who had spent the last few weeks in one of Russia’s most notorious penal colonies, was “full of energy” after being released. She was active and conversational on the plane ride home, he said, asking every crew member on the flight for their name as she expressed her gratitude. “On an 18-hour flight, she probably spent 12 just talking,” Mr. Carstens said. “We talked about everything under the sun.” Mr. Carstens added that there was an “ongoing, open dialogue with the Russians” for the release of Mr. Whelan but declined to provide specific details on what the U.S. would offer Moscow in exchange. “We usually have to keep our cards close to our chest,” Mr. Carstens said, adding that he was able to speak to Mr. Whelan on Friday and told him to “keep the faith. We’re coming to get you.” Democratic and Republican lawmakers have criticized the exchange of Ms. Griner for Viktor Bout, a convicted Russian arms dealer known as the “Merchant of Death” who was serving a 25-year prison sentence for charges that included conspiring to kill American citizens. Critics have argued that trading Americans detained abroad for other prisoners incentivizes countries and terror groups to take U.S. citizens hostage as bargaining chips. Mr. Carstens pushed back against that criticism, saying that Americans will always be at risk for wrongful detention and that, ultimately, the higher priority was bringing detained Americans home. “It’s horrific to leave an American wrongfully detained in a foreign jail cell,” Mr. Carstens said. A number of Americans, and particularly athletes, have continued to travel to and work in Russia, even as Ms. Griner began serving her nine year sentence after being convicted on a drug charge. Warnings from the State Department have for months advised all Americans to leave Russia immediately.",7
2022-12-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/world/europe/banksy-ukraine-kyiv.html,Removal of Banksy Work in Ukraine Sparks Debate Around the Future Of His Murals,"KYIV, Ukraine — Many Ukrainians saw messages of defiance and resilience in the seven artworks painted last month by Banksy, the British street artist, on war-ravaged buildings in and around Kyiv. At least one activist saw another kind of benefit: He removed one of the works, saying he intended to auction it and donate the proceeds to the Ukrainian Army. The activist, Serhiy Dovhyi, says he is now under criminal investigation for removing the work from a wall in the Kyiv suburb of Hostomel. The depiction, of a woman in a bathrobe wearing a gas mask and holding a fire extinguisher, suggests the war’s intrusion on home life. A Ukrainian art dealer has estimated that the work is worth up to $1 million. Under wartime authorities, the Ukrainian military appoints local leaders. The military-appointed head of Hostomel told local media that the art should go into a future memorial to war or remain on the site, to become part of a future building. It isn’t the first time ownership of one of Banksy’s works has been in dispute. In 2014, a Banksy painting appeared on a piece of plywood secured to the Broad Plain Boys Club in Bristol, England. The club’s owner, Dennis Stinchcombe, planned to auction the painting to raise money for the club, but the city stepped in and claimed it owned the depiction of a couple embracing and staring at their cellphones. In a rare public move, Banksy wrote a letter saying the art should be used to help the club. In the Ukraine dispute, Mr. Dovhyi said in an interview that the artwork had to be saved because the wall on which it was painted was scheduled to be demolished soon. He described the act of removing the graffiti, which he documented in videos, as an additional act of performance art that might add to its value. Mr. Dovhyi cut the graffiti from the wall in Hostomel on Dec. 2 by removing a layer of insulation on the ruined building’s exterior. . “Street art, in contrast to a piece of art in the Louvre, doesn’t belong to anyone,” he said. The action did, in any case, succeed in stirring discussion in Ukraine about the future of Banksy’s local works. The art appeared in the suburban towns Hostomel, Irpin and Borodyanka, where hundreds of civilians died early in the war in air and artillery strikes and summary executions. For nearly two decades, Banksy has maintained his anonymity, while creating art, often with social and political undertones, in New York City, London, the West Bank and many other places. Banksy’s work has also included stunts. In 2018, his painting “Girl With Balloon” self-destructed in a remote-controlled shredder moments after Sotheby’s in London auctioned it for $1.4 million. The apparent commentary on the excesses of the art market only enhanced the work’s value: Retitled “Love Is in the Bin,” Sotheby’s resold it last year for $25.4 million. But Banksy also goes to great lengths to regulate the resale of his graffiti and prevent fakes, working with a team that authenticates his work. Reputable dealers and auction houses sell Banksy works only with certification. Banksy has already sold art to benefit Ukraine. In March, he donated proceeds from the sale of a painting to the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv. Mr. Dovhyi argued that the army’s needs during wartime justified the attempt to sell the painting of the woman in the bathrobe. “I wanted to capitalize as much as possible,” he said, “and all the money would go to humanitarian and military purposes.” But the police turned up soon after he had cut the art from the wall, confiscating the slab of insulation and questioning Mr. Dovhyi and others in his group. Mr. Dovhyi said police told him the investigation is under an article of the criminal code that deals with property damage less severe than vandalism. He has not been charged.

2022-12-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/opinion/world-cup-qatar-sportswashing.html,Opinion | The Qatar World Cup Is Peak ‘Sportswashing.’ But Will It Work?,"This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Wednesdays. When France faces off against Argentina in the final match of the World Cup on Sunday, it will almost certainly be the most watched event in the world, culminating with celebrations in the streets of Paris or Buenos Aires, lubricated by good feeling and less good alcohol. And soon enough the world’s attention will turn away from the tournament’s host country, Qatar, a repressive monarchy where, according to the nonprofit Freedom House, “the vast majority of the population consists of noncitizens with no political rights.” Like the last World Cup, which was hosted by Russia in 2018, this year’s tournament has been overshadowed by accusations of “sportswashing,” or the propagandistic use of athletics by a government to launder its tarnished reputation. When the cameras shut off and the journalists leave, will Qatar really emerge in a stronger geopolitical position, its image cleansed and its soft power fortified by spectacle? Here’s what people are saying. The 2022 World Cup has been mired in controversy ever since FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, awarded Qatar hosting rights in 2010. The choice made little sense to many in the soccer world: Although the tiny gulf nation is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, thanks to its vast reserves of natural gas, it didn’t have proper soccer stadiums, the infrastructure for mass tourism or a climate suitable for playing soccer safely in the summer, when the World Cup is normally held. The strangeness of the choice, announced on the same day that FIFA awarded hosting rights for the 2018 World Cup to Russia, aroused suspicions of bribery that were borne out by investigations. Within a few years, “almost every one of the 22 members of the committee who had participated in the vote had been accused of or charged with corruption,” Tariq Panja and Rory Smith reported for The Times last month. To prepare for its hosting duties, Qatar embarked on a $220 billion construction spree, erecting not just stadiums but also a metro system, an airport expansion, roads, bridges, artificial islands and luxury hotels. “Doha tripled in size during the 2010s,” Sam Knight wrote in The New Yorker. “The Qatari Investment Authority, which manages an estimated $450 billion, didn’t build a stage for a soccer tournament; it built a city to encompass the stage.” This construction work was performed by migrants, who account for almost 90 percent of the country’s population of three million, under exploitative and dangerous conditions: Thousands are thought to have died since construction began, in many cases without detailed explanation or family compensation. “The reality is that Qatar operates what a former United Nations special rapporteur on racism, E. Tendayi Achiume, described in 2019 as a de facto caste system based on national origin,” wrote Rothna Begum, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Qatar’s labor minister claims ‘every death is a tragedy,’ but Qatar does not treat all lives equally.” Qatar has also come under fire for its treatment of women, who are required to get permission from a male guardian to exercise basic freedoms, and its attitude toward homosexuality, which is criminalized and punishable by up to three years in prison. In the tournament’s first week, FIFA blocked several European teams from wearing armbands promoting gay rights by threatening to penalize them. Qatari officials have objected to the criticism as hypocritical and racist in its selectivity, pointing to America’s and Europe’s own treatment of migrants and dependence on Qatari gas. They have also highlighted labor reforms that the government has undertaken in recent years, including the establishment of a minimum wage ($275 per month) and the abolition of kafala, a labor system with roots in the British colonial era that allowed employers to hold their workers’ passports. “I think we are justified in our outrage against the racist and Orientalist undertones that characterize the criticism emanating from the West against Qatar lately,” Mira Al Hussein, an Emirati sociologist at Oxford University, told The Times. “But we cannot fault the fact,” she added, that Qatar and other Gulf States have drawn attention for their “lamentable human rights record.” For all the financial and P.R. trouble, what is Qatar hoping to get in return? “Sportswashing” itself may be a new term, but governments have employed the strategy going back to the original Olympics, according to Paul Christesen, a professor of ancient Greek history at Dartmouth. “People take sports super seriously,” Christesen told Sports Illustrated in April. “And as soon as people do that, you can leverage it for geopolitical purposes.” Hitler, for example, used the 1936 Olympics in Berlin to project a vision of Aryan supremacy while concealing the brutality of the Nazi regime from the rest of the world, to considerable success: A New York Times reporter wrote at the time that the games had put Germany “back in the fold of nations who have ‘arrived.’” For Qatar, the desire to burnish its reputation may owe to its regional vulnerability. In 2017, Qatar’s neighbors — Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates — and Egypt severed diplomatic ties and mounted a blockade against the country, accusing its government of supporting terrorism and becoming too friendly with Iran. The blockade ended only last year. Qatar is “so small and so vulnerable, they can’t afford to antagonize anyone,” said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at Skema Business School in Paris. “One of the reasons they wanted to host the World Cup is to be seen as legitimate and trusted members of the international community.” The spotlight on Qatar has had something of a unifying effect, as neighboring countries seek to benefit from spillover tourism and cheer on one another’s teams. “While Western media has complained about the event, Arab-language influencers, public relations managers, social media pages and media outlets have heaped praise on Qatar in a variety of ways,” writes Aziz Abu Sarah. “According to a popular narrative in the region, in these few weeks Qatar has transformed itself from a tiny Arab country to a regional power broker, and one willing to stand up to the West.” But Qatar’s sportswashing benefits Western countries too, argued David Wearing, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Sussex. The Qatari people are no more or less desirous of civil liberties than the rest of humanity, he wrote, but the spectacle of the World Cup enables Qatari leaders to recast their authoritarian political system as the natural product of a backward culture that they are struggling valiantly to reform. Western teams and businesses can in turn feel better about participating in the World Cup — and about profiting from it. “Playing into Orientalist notions of ‘tradition’ versus ‘modernization,’ the tournament is designed to showcase a Qatari regime heading in the right direction and deserving of the world’s embrace,” Wearing wrote in The Guardian. “The real goal is to provide Qatar’s western allies with an alibi for continuing the support that has been so crucial to the regime’s longevity.” During the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, which at that time was ruled by a military dictatorship that tortured and killed thousands of people it deemed leftist subversives, human rights organizations like Amnesty International used the opportunity to draw the world’s attention to the government’s abuses. The strategy arguably worked, wrote Simon Kuper of The Financial Times: “Some countries had begun taking in more Argentinian refugees. Engagement had achieved something, partly because the anti-communist Argentinian regime cared what its western allies thought.” China offers a more recent example of how sportswashing can have the opposite of its intended effect. When the Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai disappeared for weeks last year after accusing a retired government official of sexual assault, the Women’s Tennis Association, which enjoyed a highly profitable relationship with China, suspended tournaments it had scheduled in the country. “The more attuned the rest of us are to the cynical nature of these transactions and the underlying horrors they seek to obscure, the more likely these propaganda attempts will backfire,” wrote Andrés Martinez, a research scholar at Arizona State University’s Global Sport Institute, in January. Some argue that the negative press engendered by the World Cup has already prompted Qatar’s government to change for the better, citing its recent labor reforms. “That’s nowhere near saying, ‘Qatar has got better because of the World Cup’, which is FIFA’s line,” said Tim Noonan of the International Trade Union Confederation. “It happened because you had scrutiny from NGOs and trade unions and journalists and some reformers in Qatar.” The imperative question now is whether at least some measure of that momentum will endure. “The reality is that if the World Cup is to be truly global — and it should be — there are very few countries whose values are universally acceptable,” the Financial Times editorial board wrote last month. “The hope must be that the legacy of the tournament remains positive even when the world has moved on.” Do you have a point of view we missed?

2022-12-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/world/africa/viktor-bout-arms-liberia.html,"In Liberia and Across Africa, Viktor Bout’s Bloody Legacy Is Still Felt","DAKAR, Senegal — He trafficked weapons to rebels in Angola. He ran a criminal group that smuggled cobalt out of Congo. He delivered missiles, machine guns and military helicopters to Liberia, when it was in the middle of a civil war. But the convicted Russian arms smuggler Viktor Bout, released by the United States last week in exchange for the American basketball star Brittney Griner, was never held to account for any of the acts that have been documented over the years by experts at the United Nations. Instead, he was arrested in a sting operation in Bangkok in 2008 by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration informants posing as Colombian revolutionaries, and then convicted of conspiring to kill Americans. While he was greeted on his arrival back in Russia last week as a “wonderful person,” many of the African victims of the conflicts he supplied with weapons are still enduring the trauma and awaiting any kind of justice. “This guy’s responsible for the murder, indirectly, of thousands of persons,” said Hassan Bility, director of the Global Justice and Research Project, an organization that documents wartime atrocities in his country, Liberia. Mr. Bout had a network of more than 50 planes that were constantly involved in “arms shipments from Eastern Europe into African war zones,” according to the United Nations. Mr. Bout has not responded yet to an interview request. But speaking to The New York Times in 2003, Mr. Bout first said that he didn’t know that what he was delivering were arms. And then he changed tack. “Illegal weapons?” he said. “What does that mean? If rebels control an airport and a city, and they give you clearance to land, what’s illegal about that?” One of the war zones where the United Nations flagged arms shipments was Liberia. Mr. Bout supplied weapons to Charles Taylor, a former president of Liberia, said Stephen J. Rapp, who as prosecutor of the United Nations-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone led the prosecution of Mr. Taylor, which ultimately ended in his war crimes conviction for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone. Among them was 1992’s Operation Octopus, in which child and teenage soldiers laid siege to the Liberian capital and thousands of people were killed within a month. “The way Taylor fought his wars was not by going out and shooting combatants on the other side,” said Mr. Rapp. “It was through these violent acts against civilian populations. And so, if you were supplying arms to Taylor, you had a fair sense that they were going to be used in this ‘make them fearful’ — as he would say — kind of fighting.” For Joshua Kulah, who was 9 when Liberia’s second civil war ended in 2003, that fear is seared in his memory. Mr. Kulah, now a 28-year-old lawyer, said that he had friends who were forced to become child soldiers by soldiers and rebels, and cousins and friends who died on the front line. He remembered his parents hiding him every time armed men came to the neighborhood, in case he were abducted and forced to fight, too. One day in 2003, he remembered, he was playing outside. His mother was at work, but hearing that rebels were preparing to attack, she rushed home to try to protect her family. But the rebels arrived before she did. “As we were playing we just heard an explosion,” Mr. Kulah said. “Within minutes, we saw rockets falling everywhere. I saw it falling on houses and killing everyone in the house. I remember running home from the field and rockets were dropping. I saw dead bodies.” Mr. Kulah said he was “indifferent” to Mr. Bout’s release because he blamed the people who used the guns, not those who sold them. But Mr. Bility said his organization would begin building a complete dossier on the arms dealer’s activities in Liberia that could be used in a case against him, “and then just wait” for him to leave Russia so he could be extradited or charged elsewhere. Almost everyone in Liberia suffered one way or another. One woman, now 44, remembered the war Mr. Bout supplied weapons to as “just hardship.” Her family had no food, she said, and had to walk for hours to find something to eat. The woman’s family was already traumatized by the events of the first civil war (1989-’97), in which her uncle was killed by rebel forces fighting for Prince Johnson, another warlord. Mr. Johnson is best known for ordering the murder of President Samuel Doe in 1990 and drinking beer while watching as he was tortured. But today Mr. Johnson is a powerful senator who has such an important political following that he repeatedly plays kingmaker in Liberian presidential elections. The woman whose uncle was killed wanted to remain anonymous, 32 years later, for fear of repercussions. Mr. Johnson’s political power and the fear he still inspires are part of the reason that thousands of victims of the Liberian civil wars have never seen any kind of justice, Mr. Bility said. He said that the release of Mr. Bout was “difficult,” but that he would not criticize the United States for it when that country had repeatedly tried to hold to account the Liberian rebels who fled there, while hundreds of war criminals back in Liberia walk free. “The United States — when it comes to justice — has done more” than Liberia, he said. “Way, way, way more.” For years, Liberian survivors of the wars, human rights advocates and some politicians have pushed for the creation of a war crimes court — something that was recommended by the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission. But successive governments have resisted it. Among the commission’s recommendations: investigate Mr. Bout. Initially, George Weah, the former international soccer star who today is president of the West African country, endorsed the creation of the court. But, recently, he has gone silent on the subject. With African leaders convening this week in Washington for a high-level summit, Mr. Bility called on President Biden to speak with President Weah about establishing such a court. Mr. Bout’s client list was long, according to Douglas Farah and Stephen Braun, who wrote a book about him, “Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible.” He simultaneously supplied weapons to Ahmad Shah Massoud, leader of Afghanistan’s Northern Alliance, they wrote, and to Mr. Massoud’s enemies, the Taliban. Mr. Bout mixed his smuggling activities with legitimate — and lucrative — business, such as buying gladioli for $2 each in South Africa and flying tons of the flowers to Dubai, where he sold them for $100 a stem. He flew U.N. peacekeepers to Somalia and East Timor, and French troops into Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, he told a New York Times reporter in 2003. Mr. Rapp, the prosecutor, said that Mr. Bout’s conviction had been a little like that of Al Capone, the Chicago mobster who was eventually jailed for tax evasion — not murder or bootlegging or racketeering. “I’d prefer that somebody other than Viktor Bout was traded,” Mr. Rapp said. “But the fact that he’s done almost 15 years of his 25-year sentence is some solace. Al Capone only did eight.” Ruth Maclean reported from Dakar, Senegal, and Dounard Bondo from Freetown, Sierra Leone.",7
2022-12-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/us/politics/paul-whelan-russia.html,Russia’s ‘Sham’ Charge of Spying Makes Whelan’s Case the Hardest,"WASHINGTON — Over the past eight months, Paul Whelan has watched helplessly as two other Americans detained in Russia, both imprisoned after him, were released in prisoner exchanges while he was left stranded behind the barbed wire of IK-17, a penal colony nearly eight hours from Moscow. Russia insists that Mr. Whelan, 52, is a spy who was caught red-handed, one whose 16-year sentence for espionage is richly deserved. In the Kremlin’s harsh game of human bartering, that makes the asking price for his release higher than it was for the basketball star Brittney Griner, who was convicted on drug smuggling charges but freed last week, and for Trevor Reed, who was sentenced for assaulting two Moscow police officers but released in April. As a result, supporters of Mr. Whelan and analysts say, there is no clear path for his release. Two men held by the United States and whose freedom Russian officials have sought for years, the arms dealer Viktor Bout and the drug-smuggling pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, were released in the deals for Ms. Griner and Mr. Reed. Russia refused repeated U.S. efforts to include Mr. Whelan — who rejects his charges, saying he was set up — in the swap for Mr. Bout. “Unfortunately, Russia has continued to see Paul’s case through the lens of sham espionage charges,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken recently said, “and they are treating him differently than they treated Brittney Griner.” On Monday, Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, said U.S. officials would have “an engagement” with Russia about Mr. Whelan’s case this week. Mr. Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth, said in an interview that a new approach is necessary. “I’ve had some wild and crazy ideas that I’ve been sharing with the government,” she said. Ms. Whelan spoke to Mr. Biden last week and to White House officials on Monday. Some analysts believe that the price for Mr. Whelan’s freedom might include relaxing an aspect of U.S. sanctions on Russia, or even the serendipitous capture of a Russian agent somewhere in the world who could then be traded. Ms. Whelan conceded that confusion persisted about whether her brother might be guilty of the espionage that Russian prosecutors say he was committing when he visited Russia in December 2018. While at Moscow’s upscale Metropol hotel, Mr. Whelan greeted a Russian acquaintance who handed him a USB stick. Minutes later, he was arrested by Russian agents, who said the device contained a classified list of Russian Federal Security Service agents. “You have a lot of people out there talking very ignorantly, thinking he’s James Bond or something,” Ms. Whelan said. The suggestion, at least, has been made in some prominent places. “Was he a spy?” the Fox News host Tucker Carlson asked on his nightly show last week, even as he angrily denounced President Biden’s failure to win Mr. Whelan’s release. “We can’t know for sure.” Some members of Congress expressed similar doubts after his arrest, people familiar with his case say. Mr. Whelan is a former Marine, one who took a keen interest in Russia, traveling there often and making friends with people who have police and military backgrounds. He also happens to hold passports from Canada, Ireland and Britain as well as the United States. But Mr. Whelan, his relatives and current and former U.S. officials firmly reject the idea that he maintained a secret identity. “He’s definitely not a spy. But he looks like one,” said John Sipher, a former official in the CIA’s clandestine service who ran the agency’s covert operations in Russia. American intelligence agencies have a strict policy of never confirming, or denying, that any individual worked for the U.S. government as a spy or informant. But Biden administration officials insist that the charges against him are fabricated and have classified him, as they did Ms. Griner, as “wrongfully detained,” tantamount to a political prisoner. And in private, American officials flatly state that Mr. Whelan was not an intelligence informant. He is, they said, what he appears to be: a slightly eccentric Russophile who was entrapped by an ambitious intelligence agent he had befriended years before, apparently not realizing the man’s full background. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Mr. Whelan was an avid traveler, his family says, who first visited Russia while on leave from an administrative military posting in Iraq. In keeping with his longtime habit of making friends in foreign countries, he got to know several Russians and even had an account on the Russian social media network VK. A police officer in Michigan for more than a decade before he joined the Marines, Mr. Whelan was working as head of global security for the Michigan-based auto parts maker BorgWarner at the time of his arrest. “When he goes to a new country to visit, he stops in at the local police station or whatever,” his sister said, adding that he enjoyed exchanging law enforcement patches with other officers. “So when the Russians say he was asking about the police — of course! That’s Paul.” As for those passports: Mr. Whelan was born in Ottawa to British parents and moved to the United States. The government of Ireland often issues passports to people with Irish heritage. Mr. Whelan’s family says he was in Moscow to attend the wedding of a fellow Marine to a Russian woman; the family has declined to name the couple on privacy grounds. Mr. Whelan summarized his defense in memorable fashion at one court appearance in Moscow in 2019. “Russia says it caught James Bond on a spy mission,” Mr. Whelan declared in a courtroom statement. “In reality, they abducted Mr. Bean on holiday,” he said, referring to a hapless 1990s British sitcom character. Russia’s Kommersant newspaper has reported that Mr. Whelan’s phones had been under surveillance for many years and that he was recorded telling friends in the country he was interested in classified information. An actual spy, former officials said, would not have left such an electronic trail, sought out the kinds of friendships with ordinary Russians he valued or engaged in a meeting as risky as the one that led to his arrest. Experts say Russia is known for planting evidence of espionage. The former journalist Nicholas Daniloff has recounted how, while serving as a Moscow bureau chief in the mid-1980s, a Russian friend handed him maps of Soviet military deployments that he had not requested. Mr. Daniloff was promptly arrested and eventually traded for a spy previously imprisoned by the United States. And Russia today is far too dangerous for American intelligence operatives to work without the kind of diplomatic cover that ensures that the worst that happens to them is that they are expelled, rather than imprisoned, Mr. Sipher said. Mr. Whelan also received a “bad conduct discharge” from the Marines in 2008 for reasons the military said included “attempted larceny” and the use of another person’s Social Security number — which people familiar with intelligence said would have marked him as too unreliable for a sensitive espionage mission. He is unmarried; family members say he is deeply attached to his dog, Flora. Mr. Sipher added that it was conceivable that Mr. Whelan had tried to freelance as an undercover agent, perhaps by contacting someone he had served with in the Marines and offering to help, but he assigned “the tiniest of chances” to that scenario. It continues to puzzle American officials why Russia values Mr. Whelan so highly. One White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, said it was unclear whether the Russians sincerely believed Mr. Whelan was a spy, but that the question was immaterial because they are treating him as one. Mr. Whelan was apprehended five months after the arrest in Washington of Maria Butina, who was charged with acting as an unregistered foreign agent of Russia and accused of having been part of the Kremlin’s 2016 election interference efforts. Some U.S. officials thought Mr. Whelan might have been arrested to facilitate an exchange for Ms. Butina, or that he might be released when she finished her sentence. Neither happened. Ms. Butina was released from prison and deported to Russia in 2019. A recent Russian demand that the United States secure the release of Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin serving a life sentence for murder in Germany, was deemed a non-starter. To some of Mr. Whelan’s supporters, it feels as though the cards most likely to win his freedom have been played. “I’m pretty up to speed with Russians in U.S. jails, and I don’t think there are any accused of any espionage-type of crime” that the Kremlin would consider equivalent to trade for Mr. Whelan, said his lawyer, Ryan Fayhee, a former national security official with the Justice Department. “We need to arrest a Russian that matters to” President Vladimir V. Putin, Mr. Sipher said. As it happens, the Justice Department announced the indictment of five Russian nationals on Tuesday on charges of money laundering and procuring electronics and ammunition for Moscow’s war machine despite sanctions. The Justice Department said in a statement that one them, Vadim Konoshchenok, is a suspected member of the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B. He was arrested in Estonia, a close U.S. ally, and will be extradited to the United States, the department said. The other four remain at large. Neither name has publicly surfaced in connection with Mr. Whelan’s case. It may be that Mr. Whelan could be freed by means other than a prisoner exchange. U.S. officials have ruled out relaxing sanctions imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine. But the United States also enacted many other Russian sanctions in the years before the invasion, and the White House official would not say whether those were off the table. While Mr. Whelan’s family members and supporters do not begrudge the freedom of Ms Griner or Mr. Reed — whose release became an urgent priority for the White House amid concerns about his health — they find the difficulty in freeing Mr. Whelan to be maddening. “Out of the group, he was the first one arrested,” said Rep. Haley Stevens, Democrat of Michigan, who represents Mr. Whelan’s district. “And he’s been the longest detained.” Julian E. Barnes contributed reporting.",7
2022-12-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/world/europe/olympics-2024-russia-belarus-athletes.html,Zelensky Urges Barring Russian and Belarusian Athletes From 2024 Olympics,"The Olympic Games in Paris are still two years away, but already there is a question of whether Russian and Belarusian athletes will be allowed to compete under their nations’ flags. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine weighed in on Wednesday, urging the International Olympic Committee to prohibit those athletes’ participation regardless of what flag they carry, days after the committee’s top official expressed a new tone of openness about easing restrictions. In a phone call with the committee’s president, Thomas Bach, Mr. Zelensky said that allowing the athletes to compete under a neutral flag would not be enough to punish Russia. “Since February, 184 Ukrainian athletes have died as a result of Russia’s actions,” Mr. Zelensky said on the call, according to a readout from the Ukrainian president’s office. “One cannot try to be neutral when the foundations of peaceful life are being destroyed and universal human values are being ignored.” In February, the I.O.C. recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be barred from competitions, breaking from the organization’s typical stance that athletes should not be punished for their government’s actions. In a statement, the organization cited “the integrity of global sports competitions” and “the safety of all the participants” as two factors in the decision, which was issued “with a heavy heart.” There are some situations in which the athletes could be allowed to compete as neutral athletes, the statement said. But in recent days I.O.C. officials have been unclear about whether Russian and Belarusian athletes will be allowed to compete in the 2024 Summer Olympics. Although the organization has not changed its formal guidance from February, there are signs that it is looking to ease its restrictions. “We need to explore ways to overcome this dilemma with regard to athletes’ participation and come back to sporting merits and not political interference,” Mr. Bach said in a news conference last week, according to Reuters. Mr. Bach emphasized that the I.O.C.’s original guidance was for athletes’ safety. “What we never did and did not want to do was prohibit athletes from competing in competitions only due to their passports,” he said, adding that the I.O.C. had not yet set a date by which to make a decision. In the past, athletes from countries under Olympic sanctions had been allowed to compete under an Olympic flag rather than their national flag. Russian athletes did so in the Beijing Olympics in February after Russia was found to have been involved in a major doping scandal in the 2014 Olympics. And in 1980, when many nations boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, some athletes from the boycotting countries competed under neutral flags. A top U.S. Olympic official this week endorsed considering “a pathway back” for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under a neutral flag. A group of high-ranking Olympic officials from around the world convened in Lausanne, Switzerland, last week to discuss the issue. “We agreed that there would now be an exploration and a consultation with stakeholders to see whether there could be a pathway for those individual athletes to come back as neutral,” said Susanne Lyons, the chair of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee, according to Reuters.",22
2022-12-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-art-dissent.html,"‘Banksy of Borovsk,’ a Russian Muralist, Wages His Own War","An 84-year-old artist was standing in front of one of the many murals he has painted in his provincial hometown one recent day when a group of young women passed by. They had traveled some 60 miles from Moscow just to see his latest work, and they tittered at the encounter. “This is so cool,” said one. “You are the main attraction of town.” The artist, Vladimir A. Ovchinnikov, has long covered the walls of the town with pastoral scenes, portraits of poets and daily life, in the process earning himself a reputation as the “Banksy of Borovsk.” But it is his political art that is now attracting attention. At a time when dissent is being crushed across Russia, Mr. Ovchinnikov has been painting murals protesting the invasion of Ukraine. It is a comparison he does not appreciate. Unlike the mysterious British-based street artist, Mr. Ovchinnikov works for all to see. And where a politically charged new Banksy offering may be cause for sensation, Mr. Ovchinnikov’s murals are not always welcomed — at least, not by the authorities. “I draw doves, they paint over them,” he said. Mr. Ovchinnikov is a rare dissident in Russia, where public criticism of the war can land people in jail or exile. He said his age and his family history offered a modicum of protection, even though he has been fined, questioned by the authorities and pelted with snowballs. “I am different from the majority of people: I’m almost 85 years old, and I’ve got nothing to lose,” he said. “If you are of working age, you can lose your job, and they will pick you up faster. I, an old man, seem to be treated differently.” He also said his own history — he did not meet his father until age 11 because his father had spent 10 years in a gulag, and his grandfather and uncle were killed by the state — drove him to denounce violence and war. Upon his retirement as an engineer in Moscow, he settled in his father’s house in Borovsk. His father had chosen the town because as a former political prisoner, he was forced to live at least 60 miles away from the capital. For his service as the town’s public conscience, Mr. Ovchinnikov has repeatedly clashed with local officials. Amid the domestic crackdown that has accompanied the war, he has been playing a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities. Many of Mr. Ovchinnikov’s murals are covered over within days or weeks. Across from the town’s voenkomat, or military commissariat, the cream-colored walls on Lenin Street are smeared haphazardly with gobs of white paint. Underneath, Mr. Ovchinnikov said, is his painting of a girl wearing the blue and yellow of Ukraine as three missiles fly overhead. Underneath, in large, bold letters: “Stop this!!!” After painting over the graffiti, the authorities turned their attention to Mr. Ovchinnikov, fining him 35,000 rubles, about $560, and accusing him of “discrediting the Russian armed forces.” “A fine for the fact that I want peace,” Mr. Ovchinnikov said. “I’m discrediting our military. How disgraceful.” His supporters sent donations to help him cover the fine. Nearby, in the town’s small central park, Mr. Ovchinnikov pointed to a statue of Lenin. It is not unlike those standing in practically every Russian town to this day. “That’s our leader,” he said sarcastically. The statue, he noted with a wry smile, is pointing straight at the voenkomat. In 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and fomented separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Ovchinnikov drew a Ukrainian flag on the statue’s pedestal. “I didn’t have time to write ‘Glory to Ukraine,’” he said. “They came and picked me up right away.” Russia under Vladimir V. Putin has sought to airbrush its history. It prefers, for example, to portray Joseph Stalin as the leader who led the Soviet Union to victory in World War II, and minimize the scale of the crimes the state under his rule committed against its own people. Memorial, a human rights organization that won the Nobel Peace Prize this year for its work chronicling political repression, has been dismantled. In Borovsk, where he moved after retiring from his career as an engineer, Mr. Ovchinnikov is fighting a lonely battle to keep the memory alive. Tucked behind Lenin in the park is a vandalized black stone, a monument to those who were repressed during the Stalin era. Mr. Ovchinnikov had campaigned for it — but he is the one who vandalized it. He had wanted the memorial to include the names of all those from Borovsk who had been repressed. “I wrote ‘trampled and forgotten,’ and higher on the rock, ‘return their names,’” he said, referring to the idea that he was restoring dignity to the victims, who are currently a nameless and uncounted mass. That, too, was covered up with paint. Nearby, at the center of the park, stands a memorial to those who defended the Soviet Union during World War II. On its large back wall in 2019, Mr. Ovchinnikov erected his own memorial, one dedicated to the repressed. He painted a huge banner with portraits of people who had been shot. “Executed Future,” he called it. “I wrote down the names of only those shot,” he said. “There are 186 of them. But those who met their end in the camps — I should have added them.” As he walked to the front of the memorial, he paused to examine the list of names of the soldiers who died during the war. “For every 100 people who died on the battlefields, 170 were shot by our authorities,” Mr. Ovchinnikov said. “Yes, they have something to hide. But I think that the only reason they don’t want people to know about the scale is that they don’t want people to know what our government is capable of doing.” Farther down the street, he took a piece of charcoal from his pocket and traced four numbers faintly visible under a fresh coat of paint: 1937, the year that Stalin’s repression peaked. “The fact we’re trying to forget our tragedy, our repression, is one of the reasons for what is happening in Ukraine now,” he said. Many people feel uncomfortable when confronted with the painful history — and present — and do not welcome Mr. Ovchinnikov’s art. In the town’s central market, an older man pulling a cart stopped in front of a mural of his that was commissioned by the local butcher. It showed an artist holding a large goblet in front of a still life with meat. “If I had my wall defaced like this, I would paint over it,” the man told Mr. Ovchinnikov gruffly. Other residents who appreciate his apolitical art but back the war are rankled by his support for Ukraine. “It was not right to draw that,” said Aleksei, 32, pointing to a mural with sunflowers and another one next to it called “Nostalgia,” which featured a Russian woman and a Ukrainian woman holding hands. “Nostalgia” had been vandalized: The Ukrainian woman’s eyes had been gouged out. “Ukraine is not on our side but against us, and we don’t need Ukraine to exist,” said Aleksei, who declined to give his surname. “They started the war. We didn’t start the war.” Last month, Mr. Ovchinnikov was pelted with snowballs when he was updating some antiwar graffiti by the main road. “First I wrote ‘Z: madness,’” he said, referring to the letter that has become a symbol of support for the invasion. “They painted over it. Then I wrote ‘Z: Shame.’ They painted over it. Then I wrote ‘Z: Fiasco.’” That was in November. Soon after, a major from the intelligence services came to his home to question him. “With the inscription, I had the goal of conveying to the population and guests of the city of Borovsk that the special military operation is a failure and that it must be stopped,” he wrote in his official statement, using the Kremlin’s euphemism for the war. “I do not repent for what I have done. I do not feel my guilt. I had to do what I did.”",29
2022-12-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/world/europe/ukraine-eurovision.html,Ukraine Selects Its Entry for Eurovision Song Contest,"A bomb shelter in Kyiv was transformed into the set of a television extravaganza over the weekend as Ukrainian musicians vied for the chance to represent their country at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023 — and potentially take home the top prize for the second straight year. Amid waves of Russian missile and drone strikes, there was little indication that the competition was being filmed in an underground metro station that has served as a shelter since Russia’s invasion. But the professional lighting and intricate graphics behind the performers could not totally distract from the rumbling of trains that at times could be heard between musical numbers. The electronic music duo Tvorchi beat out nine other acts on Saturday with a performance of their song “Heart of Steel,” which they have said was inspired by the courage of Ukrainian defenders in the Azovstal steel plant during the siege of the southern city of Mariupol. Vocalist Jeffery Kenny sang between two backup dancers wearing gas masks as images of nuclear warning signs displayed on screens behind them. “Don’t care what you say, don’t care how you feel, get out of my way, ‘cause I got a heart of steel,” Mr. Kenny sang. The duo — which has said that the song is about dignity, freedom and the unbreakable spirit of Ukrainians — both wore silver and gold “steel” hearts embroidered on the chests of their costumes. They will take the Eurovision stage to perform their winning song in May. Eurovision, the world’s largest live music competition, is known for its elaborate costumes, over-the-top performances and potential to launch new talent to international fame. The annual European showcase promoting cultural unity was first held in 1956 and has ballooned into a huge TV event with participants from nearly 40 countries, including Australia and Israel. Close to 160 million people tuned in to the 2022 competition in May. Ukraine won that contest, which followed Russia’s invasion in February, when folk-rap band Kalush Orchestra secured the popular vote with an energetic performance of “Stefania.” The song was originally written to honor the mother of the group’s frontman, but was recast during the war as a tribute to Ukraine and has since become an anti-war anthem. While the country that wins Eurovision typically hosts the next edition of the competition, the contest’s organizers announced in June that it would not be possible to hold the event in Ukraine, citing security. The event will instead be held in Liverpool, England. Tvorchi, in a statement on their Instagram page, thanked “people with hearts of steel.” “We will do everything to adequately represent Ukraine and our indomitability,” the duo wrote.",29
2022-12-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/20/us/politics/congress-aid-ukraine.html,Congress Proposes More Than $44 Billion for Ukraine,"WASHINGTON — The giant annual spending bill unveiled by Congress on Tuesday contains more than $44 billion in emergency aid for Ukraine, renewing the U.S. commitment to the country’s defense as Russia’s invasion grinds toward a second year. The new wave of aid for Ukraine — billions more than President Biden requested in mid-November — comes amid growing concerns among the country’s backers about the depth of America’s support. Some Republicans have questioned the massive spending, while some progressives have called for peace talks. The aid package consists mostly of military spending, including nearly $20 billion to arm and equip Ukraine’s forces, and to replenish Defense Department stockpiles from which weapons are being sent to Kyiv. Some of that money would also be used to bolster the defenses of America’s NATO allies to protect against further Russian aggression. Another $6.2 billion would support a surge of U.S. forces in Eastern Europe that Mr. Biden ordered after the Russian invasion, including thousands of American troops deployed to Poland and Romania. The “omnibus” budget bill, which includes the new Ukraine aid, funds the federal government into next year to avoid a shutdown. If Congress passes it, U.S. aid to Kyiv since Russia invaded in February will amount to more than $100 billion, allocated over four emergency spending packages. Congressional leaders hope to win approval for the spending this week. In what was perhaps a reflection of the enormousness of the aid package and the speed at which it was assembled, Democratic and Republican appropriators differed in their calculations of the final price tag. Democrats placed the figure at just under $45 billion, and Republicans said the total exceeded $47 billion. U.S. assistance has been essential to Ukraine’s survival and the major blow the country has dealt to Russia’s military, which badly miscalculated how much resistance Ukraine would mount. Mr. Biden has said that the defense of Ukraine was vital to the defense of democracy and the core principle of national sovereignty. The package also includes nonmilitary aid to keep Ukraine’s government and economy running as it withstands Russian bombardments, which have increasingly targeted the nation’s infrastructure. Congress is proposing to spend $12.9 billion to shore up Ukraine’s economy and address dire energy shortages caused by Russian attacks. Another $4 billion would go mainly to assist Ukrainian refugees, whose numbers are expected to grow as Russian attacks leave major cities without heat and electricity this winter. Some of that money would address the needs of migrants in other regions of the world. Some Republicans have called for reducing U.S. aid to Ukraine, or imposing new oversight and conditions on the money. But a fact sheet published by Republicans on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which manages federal spending, boasted that the package rejects “the administration’s request to throttle down support for the Ukrainian war effort” — an apparent reference to the somewhat lower spending level proposed by the White House last month. Mr. Biden has vowed to side with Ukraine against Russian aggression for “as long as it takes.” A poll released earlier this month by the nonpartisan Chicago Council on Global Affairs found that about two-thirds of Americans favor continuing military and economic support for Ukraine, though less than half of Americans back continuing current levels of such support indefinitely, and a growing number — nearly half — favor pressuring Ukraine to settle for peace as soon as possible. U.S. and Ukrainian officials insist that Russia is not prepared to negotiate in good faith. Moscow would exploit any truce or peace agreement for military advantage, they say. The measure does contain several provisions ensuring that aid to Ukraine undergoes closer oversight. Some U.S. officials worry that American arms could be diverted or stolen for resale in a country long known for endemic corruption. The spending bill requires the Defense Department to report to Congress the steps it is taking to ensure that weapons are delivered and used as intended. It also provides $27 million to inspectors general at the State Department, Defense Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development to monitor the aid. In a sign of concern about the West’s ability to continue supplying Ukraine, and maintain its own diminishing stockpiles of arms and ammunition, the package provides $675 million over nearly three years to expand and modernize weapons factories in the United States. Several plants owned by the government and operated by private contractors date back to World War II or earlier, and modernizing them has long been a goal of the defense industry and the Pentagon. Congress has also proposed spending $300 million on food security programs to help mitigate a global food crisis that has been exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of a top exporter of grain and fertilizer. And the measure provides $50 million in additional funds to combat cybersecurity threats from Russia, $105 million to clear land mines and other dangerous remnants of war in Ukraine and $300 million for Ukraine’s police and border guards.

2022-12-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/world/europe/china-russia-putin-xi-ukraine.html,"Putin Ally Meets With China’s Top Leader, Signaling Close Ties","A close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, on Wednesday, a sign of the countries’ alignment amid Russia’s deepening international isolation. Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former Russian president and prime minister, held a previously unannounced meeting with Mr. Xi in Beijing as Chinese and Russian naval ships began weeklong joint exercises in the East China Sea. China has remained a significant, if largely silent, counterweight to the international censure of Mr. Putin. Russia has backed China’s claim over the island democracy of Taiwan, and trade between the two countries has increased as the United States and Europe have imposed sanctions and sought to choke off Russia’s economy. Still, China has appeared reluctant to openly support Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, staying away from supplying arms or actively aiding Moscow’s efforts to skirt Western sanctions. “Russia has tried to portray a better relationship with China than reality affords,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center. “It shows how desperate they are and how China has not been as helpful as they’d like.” Mr. Medvedev is a longtime Putin ally and has emerged as one of the government’s most hawkish voices advocating a hard line against Ukraine and its allies, primarily the United States. He is the deputy chairman of Mr. Putin’s security council and the head of Mr. Putin’s ruling party, United Russia. Mr. Medvedev said in a brief video address after the meeting with Mr. Xi that he had discussed “cooperation between the two ruling parties” as well as “our strategic partnership in all spheres.” For the Kremlin, the meeting served as useful counterprogramming hours before President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was scheduled to meet with President Biden. On Monday, Mr. Putin himself met with President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus to discuss deepening economic and military ties with the close Russian ally. In Beijing, Mr. Xi told Mr. Medvedev that relations between the two countries had “stood the test of international changes” and that their partnership was a “long-term strategic choice made by both sides,” according to the state broadcaster, China Central Television. Mr. Xi emphasized that China actively supported the idea of holding peace talks over Ukraine, and said that China hoped that “relevant parties would exercise rational restraint” in the crisis. The military drills, annual naval exercises held since 2012, cap a year that began with China and Russia pledging a “no limits” partnership on the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, Beijing has kept funds flowing to buy Russian oil as the United States and Europe impose sanctions. Though Mr. Putin referred to “questions and concerns” raised by Mr. Xi when they met in person in September, the countries’ economic and military ties have continued to deepen. The exercises, involving a Russian-guided missile cruiser and Chinese destroyers, will include joint air defense and anti-submarine activities to improve coordination and cooperation between the two navies, according to statements from both countries’ foreign ministries. Military cooperation between the two countries has been scaling up over the past decade even though Russia and China are not formal allies that would come to each other’s defense in war. Both view the United States as their chief security threat and want to establish an alternative to the international order led by Europe and the United States. During a discussion in Moscow in October, Mr. Putin lauded the state of relations with China, saying they had “reached an unprecedented level of openness, mutual trust and effectiveness in recent decades.” Zixu Wang contributed reporting.",22
2022-12-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/us/politics/zelensky-speech-transcript.html,Full Transcript of Zelensky’s Speech Before Congress,"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine spoke before a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday night, delivering in halting but forceful English an impassioned speech that thanked the United States for its support in his nation’s war against Russia and vowed victory as he pleaded for further aid. The following is a transcript of his remarks, as recorded by The New York Times. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for that. Thank you. It’s too much for me. All this for our great people. Thank you so much. Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in our cities, in each and every family, I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart. Madam Vice President, I thank you for your efforts in helping Ukraine. Madam Speaker, you bravely visited Ukraine during the full-fledged war. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you. I am very privileged to be here. Dear members of the Congress, representatives of both parties who also visited Kyiv, esteemed congressmen and senators from both parties who will visit Ukraine, I am sure, in the future; dear representatives of diaspora, present in this chamber, and spread across the country; dear journalists, it’s a great honor for me to be at the U.S. Congress and speak to you and all Americans. Against all odds and doom-and-gloom scenarios, Ukraine didn’t fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking. Thank you. And it gives me good reason to share with you our first, first joint victory: We defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world. We have no fear, nor should anyone in the world have it. Ukrainians gained this victory, and it gives us courage which inspires the entire world. Americans gained this victory, and that’s why you have succeeded in uniting the global community to protect freedom and international law. Europeans gained this victory, and that’s why Europe is now stronger and more independent than ever. The Russian tyranny has lost control over us. And it will never influence our minds again. Yet, we have to do whatever it takes to ensure that countries of the Global South also gain such victory. I know one more, I think very important, thing: The Russians will stand a chance to be free only when they defeat the Kremlin in their minds. Yet, the battle continues, and we have to defeat the Kremlin on the battlefield, yes. This battle is not only for the territory, for this or another part of Europe. The battle is not only for life, freedom and security of Ukrainians or any other nation which Russia attempts to conquer. This struggle will define in what world our children and grandchildren will live, and then their children and grandchildren. It will define whether it will be a democracy of Ukrainians and for Americans — for all. This battle cannot be frozen or postponed. It cannot be ignored, hoping that the ocean or something else will provide a protection. From the United States to China, from Europe to Latin America, and from Africa to Australia, the world is too interconnected and interdependent to allow someone to stay aside and at the same time to feel safe when such a battle continues. Our two nations are allies in this battle. And next year will be a turning point, I know it, the point when Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values. Ladies and gentlemen — ladies and gentlemen, Americans, yesterday before coming here to Washington, D.C., I was at the front line in our Bakhmut. In our stronghold in the east of Ukraine, in the Donbas. The Russian military and mercenaries have been attacking Bakhmut nonstop since May. They have been attacking it day and night, but Bakhmut stands. Last year — last year, 70,000 people lived here in Bakhmut, in this city, and now only few civilians stay. Every inch of that land is soaked in blood; roaring guns sound every hour. Trenches in the Donbas change hands several times a day in fierce combat, and even hand fighting. But the Ukrainian Donbas stands. Russians — Russians use everything, everything they have against Bakhmut and other our beautiful cities. The occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. They have an advantage in ammunition. They have much more missiles and planes than we ever had. It’s true, but our defense forces stand. And — and we all are proud of them. The Russians’ tactic is primitive. They burn down and destroy everything they see. They sent thugs to the front lines. They sent convicts to the war. They threw everything against us, similar to the other tyranny, which is in the Battle of the Bulge. Threw everything it had against the free world, just like the brave American soldiers which held their lines and fought back Hitler’s forces during the Christmas of 1944. Brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing the same to Putin’s forces this Christmas. Ukraine — Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender. So, so, here the front line, the tyranny which has no lack of cruelty against the lives of free people — and your support is crucial, not just to stand in such fight but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield. We have artillery, yes. Thank you. We have it. Is it enough? Honestly, not really. To ensure Bakhmut is not just a stronghold that holds back the Russian Army, but for the Russian Army to completely pull out, more cannons and shells are needed. If so, just like the Battle of Saratoga, the fight for Bakhmut will change the trajectory of our war for independence and for freedom. If your Patriots stop the Russian terror against our cities, it will let Ukrainian patriots work to the full to defend our freedom. When Russia — when Russia cannot reach our cities by its artillery, it tries to destroy them with missile attacks. More than that, Russia found an ally in this — in this genocidal policy: Iran. Iranian deadly drones sent to Russia in hundreds — in hundreds became a threat to our critical infrastructure. That is how one terrorist has found the other. It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now. We must do it. I believe there should be no taboos between us in our alliance. Ukraine never asked the American soldiers to fight on our land instead of us. I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves. Financial assistance is also critically important, and I would like to thank you, thank you very much, thank you for both financial packages you have already provided us with and the ones you may be willing to decide on. Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way. Russia, Russia could stop its aggression, really, if it wanted to, but you can speed up our victory. I know it. And it, it will prove to any potential aggressor that no one can succeed in breaking national borders, no one committing atrocities and reigning over people against their will. It would be naïve to wait for steps towards peace from Russia, which enjoys being a terrorist state. Russians are still poisoned by the Kremlin. The restoration of international legal order is our joint task. We need peace, yes. Ukraine has already offered proposals, which I just discussed with President Biden, our peace formula, 10 points which should and must be implemented for our joint security, guaranteed for decades ahead and the summit which can be held. I’m glad to say that President Biden supported our peace initiative today. Each of you, ladies and gentlemen, can assist in the implementation to ensure that America’s leadership remains solid, bicameral and bipartisan. Thank you. You can strengthen sanctions to make Russia feel how ruinous its aggression truly is. It is in your power, really, to help us bring to justice everyone who started this unprovoked and criminal war. Let’s do it. Let terrorist — let the terrorist state be held responsible for its terror and aggression and compensate all losses done by this war. Let the world see that the United States are here. Ladies and gentlemen — ladies and gentlemen, Americans, in two days we will celebrate Christmas. Maybe candlelit. Not because it’s more romantic, no, but because there will not be, there will be no electricity. Millions won’t have neither heating nor running water. All of these will be the result of Russian missile and drone attacks on our energy infrastructure. But we do not complain. We do not judge and compare whose life is easier. Your well-being is the product of your national security; the result of your struggle for independence and your many victories. We, Ukrainians, will also go through our war of independence and freedom with dignity and success. We’ll celebrate Christmas. Celebrate Christmas and, even if there is no electricity, the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out. If Russian — if Russian missiles attack us, we’ll do our best to protect ourselves. If they attack us with Iranian drones and our people will have to go to bomb shelters on Christmas Eve, Ukrainians will still sit down at the holiday table and cheer up each other. And we don’t, don’t have to know everyone’s wish, as we know that all of us, millions of Ukrainians, wish the same: Victory. Only victory. We already built strong Ukraine, with strong people, strong army, strong institutions together with you. We developed strong security guarantees for our country and for entire Europe and the world, together with you. And also together with you, we’ll put in place everyone who will defy freedom. Put-in. This will be the basis to protect democracy in Europe and the world over. Now, on this special Christmastime, I want to thank you, all of you. I thank every American family which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to other people. I thank President Biden and both parties, at the Senate and the House, for your invaluable assistance. I thank your cities and your citizens who supported Ukraine this year, who hosted our Ukrainians, our people, who waved our national flags, who acted to help us. Thank you all, from everyone who is now at the front line, from everyone who is awaiting victory. Standing here today, I recall the words of the president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which are I think so good for this moment. “The American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.” The Ukrainian people will win, too, absolutely. I know that everything depends on us, on Ukrainian armed forces, yet so much depends on the world. So much in the world depends on you. When I was in Bakhmut yesterday, our heroes gave me the flag, the battle flag, the flag of those who defend Ukraine, Europe and the world at the cost of their lives. They asked me to bring this flag to you, to the U.S. Congress, to members of the House of Representatives and senators whose decisions can save millions of people. So, let these decisions be taken. Let this flag stay with you, ladies and gentlemen. This flag is a symbol of our victory in this war. We stand, we fight and we will win because we are united — Ukraine, America and the entire free world. Just one thing, if I can, the last thing — thank you so much, may God protect our brave troops and citizens, may God forever bless the United States of America. Merry Christmas and a happy, victorious New Year. Slava Ukraini. [Glory to Ukraine.]",1
2022-12-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/22/opinion/letters/zelensky-ukraine-congress.html,Opinion | Zelensky’s Appeal for More U.S. Support,"To the Editor: Re “Aid Isn’t ‘Charity,’ Zelensky Asserts Before Congress” (front page, Dec. 22): Anne Frank once observed that “a single candle can both defy and define the darkness.” It is only fitting that President Volodymyr Zelensky, in all his shining glory, came to visit Washington on the winter solstice. Mr. Zelensky’s speech was the most inspiring address I have heard from Capitol Hill in my 28 years of life as a proud American. With a combination of brilliant timing that only a comedian can muster, the honesty of a world-class statesman and the bravery of a true warrior, Mr. Zelensky spoke of triumph over tyranny and victory in the new year. Mr. Zelensky reminds us that the United States and Ukraine must continue to stand against dictatorship. As Ukraine has shown us, we must not lose our love of life and liberty when the lights go out. We must ramp up our resolve and arm Ukraine. Mr. Zelensky has not lost his energy and resolve in the face of evil, and neither shall America. Henry J. WilsonWashington To the Editor: If only we and Europe had acted more quickly to stop Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine, so many lives could have been saved and other suffering might have been avoided. Alas, we are where we are, and we should do all that we can now to defeat Russia. The Ukrainian people have been nothing short of remarkable in fighting the Russians as they have. But, of course, modern wars require modern weaponry. We should keep that and other aid flowing in more than sufficient amounts to turn back the invasion. And while we may fear the threat of nuclear weapons being introduced by the Russians, wars are never won by being afraid. We have to make the other side more afraid. That the world is still threatened by aggressive dictators is depressing. But we should be grateful that we have the resources and in this case such a strong-willed people on the front lines to fight this one. We should not lose the will to do so. Bruce NeumanWater Mill, N.Y. To the Editor: The possible diminution of support for Ukraine is unsettling. The current situation is as if the democracies of the world were willing to have Ukraine fight World War III by itself. Suppose Russia were attacking Britain in a similar fashion, disregarding for this example the NATO agreements. Would there only be, as we see now, a measured, gradual increase in armament trying to offset Russian atrocities amounting to war crimes? Or would there be an all-in military commitment of arms and forces? Vladimir Putin is a threat to Europe’s democracies not seen since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and he should be squashed. Russian citizens may not have a true view of the war, but they clearly are not zealots in favor of it. Ukraine should not be bearing the burden of saving democracy in Europe and beyond alone. Kent RhodesCharlotte, N.C. To the Editor: Re “We Can Edit a Person’s DNA. So Why Don’t We?,” by Fyodor Urnov (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 11): Dr. Urnov weaves a beautiful story about the power of gene-editing technology. And he details the terrible conundrum we scientists face, knowing that we have the ability — right now — to improve the lives of the patients who walk in our hospital’s hallways hoping for lifesaving support, but we cannot deliver because the regulatory process simply can’t keep up. While essential, clinical trial planning and regulatory approval take months that patients don’t have. As Dr. Urnov describes, so many of us should be further down the pike in this race. My lab is one example, working hard to advance a lung cancer trial with CRISPR, the technology used to edit genes, since our animal studies tell us we’re on the right track. If we were able to safely and effectively approve a Covid vaccine in a year, we must do the same by pooling public and private funds and seeking ways to speed up science. Why can’t we support the most promising solutions to some of the longest running and most intractable of cancers or rare diseases? Eric KmiecNewark, Del.The writer is the executive director and chief scientific officer of the ChristianaCare Gene Editing Institute. To the Editor: There is an ethical and moral problem to the issue of gene editing that Fyodor Urnov fails to address: the possibility for abuse, which is ever-present regardless of imposed regulations. While the gene-editing process might help people with heart disease, chronic pain and Alzheimer’s disease, it could also alter a person’s physical makeup. Should human beings have such ability to alter natural development? Dr. Urnov sees the glass as half full, and notes only the legal, financial and organizational impediments facing this technology. Yet it is the moral and ethical potential problems that are most worrisome. He rightly states that the “biomedical community needs to start with regulation,” since the temptation to transgress will be great. Altering the genetic makeup of human beings is a road fraught with danger. The idea of human beings produced with physical and mental advantages is a nightmare of Frankenstein proportions! Larry HoffnerNew York To the Editor: I found Thomas L. Friedman’s column on the dilemma facing Israel (“What in the World Is Happening in Israel?,” Dec. 18) an informative, compelling and difficult read. Informative because, once again, Mr. Friedman writes concisely and convincingly about complex issues affecting Israel’s domestic politics. Difficult because the assembled evidence fully supports his prediction about Israel’s unsettled future as a multiethnic, religiously diverse and democratic state. My parents, second-generation Americans, taught me well the central place that Israel occupies in the psyche of American Jews. The nation never wanders far from my thoughts. In my view, Israelis have a responsibility — some would say a sacred responsibility — to oversee their nation’s survival, yet over the past few years I have too often observed strength rather than savvy employed to fulfill that responsibility. The results too often leave observers, whether Jewish or not, unnerved. Mr. Friedman reminds us with references to simple demographics that preferring force to shrewdness and practicality turns survival into a chancy bet. Even as we acknowledge the extraordinary circumstances that Israelis find themselves living in, we can ask whether they are squandering a sacred responsibility. Jeffrey J. CymrotNewton, Mass. To the Editor: “Quiz: What’s the Best Way to Shrink Your Carbon Footprint?,” by Santer van der Linden (Opinion, nytimes.com, Dec. 15), identifies the errors that we all make in trying to lessen our carbon footprint. But in doing so, he falls into the trap that the fossil fuel industry has laid: focusing on individual actions rather than systemic change. The climatologist Michael Mann identifies this as the industry’s new strategy: getting us to focus on driving an electric vehicle or eating less meat. But the only way to save the planet is to push for changes in laws, policies and regulations — which the industry dreads. So drive an E.V., but get out in the streets, too.

2022-12-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/22/opinion/biden-zelensky-speech.html,Opinion | Biden’s America Finds Its Voice,"The cameras mostly focused on Volodymyr Zelensky during his address to Congress on Wednesday night, but I focused my attention as much as I could on the audience in the room. There was fervor, admiration, yelling and whooping. In a divided nation, we don’t often get to see the Congress rise up, virtually as one, with ovations, applause, many in blue dresses and yellow ties. Sure, there were dissenters in the room, but they were not what mattered. Words surged into my consciousness that I haven’t considered for a while — compatriots, comrades, co-believers in a common creed. Zelensky and his fellow Ukrainians have reminded Americans of the values and causes we used to admire in ourselves — the ardent hunger for freedom, the deep-rooted respect for equality and human dignity, the willingness to fight against brutal authoritarians who would crush the human face under the heel of their muddy boots. It is as if Ukraine and Zelensky have rekindled a forgotten song, and suddenly everybody has remembered how to sing it. Zelensky was not subtle about making this point. He said that what Ukraine is fighting for today has echoes in what so many Americans fought for over centuries. I thought of John Adams, Frederick Douglass, Theodore Roosevelt, George Marshall, Fannie Lou Hamer, the many unsung heroes of the Cold War. His words reminded us that America supports Ukraine not only out of national interest — to preserve a stable liberal world order — but also to live out a faith that is essential to this country’s being and identity. The thing that really holds America together is this fervent idea. This liberal ideal has been tarnished over the last six decades. Sometimes America has opposed authoritarianism with rash imprudence — the Bay of Pigs, Vietnam, Iraq. Other times, America has withdrawn behind its ocean barriers and done little while horror unfolded — the genocide in Rwanda, the civil war in Syria, the failure during the Obama and Trump administrations to support Ukraine sufficiently as Putin tested the waters and upped the pressure. American policy has oscillated between a hubristic interventionism and a callous non-interventionism. “We overdo our foreign crusades, and then we overdo our retrenchments, never pausing in between, where an ordinary country would try to reach a fine balance,” George Packer wrote in The Atlantic recently. The result has been a crisis of national self-doubt: Can the world trust America to do what’s right? Can we believe in ourselves? Finding the balance between passionate ideals and mundane practicalities has been a persistent American problem. The movie “Lincoln” with Daniel Day-Lewis was about that. Lincoln is zigging and zagging through the swamps of reality, trying to keep his eye on true north, while some tell him he’s going too fast and others scream he’s going too slow. Joe Biden has struck this balance as well as any president in recent times, perhaps having learned a costly lesson from the heartless way America exited from Afghanistan. He has swung the Western alliance fervently behind Ukraine. But he has done it with prudence and calibration. Ukraine will get this weapons system, but not that one. It can dream of total victory, but it also has to think seriously about negotiations. Biden has shown that America can responsibly lead. He has shown you can have moral clarity without being blinded by it. Both Zelensky and Biden have been underestimated. Zelensky had been a comedian and so people thought he was a lightweight. He dresses like a regular guy and eschews the trappings of power that obsess people like Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. For his part, Biden doesn’t fit the romantic “West Wing” fantasy that many progressives have in their heads. A progressive president should be delivering soaring, off-the cuff speeches that make you feel good about yourself! But the truth is that both men have delivered again and again. The military struggle in Ukraine might turn grim in the coming months, but both men are partly responsible for a historic shift in the global struggle against brutality and authoritarianism. A few years ago, democracies seemed to be teetering and authoritarians seemed to be on the march. But since, we’ve had heroic resistance from Kyiv and steady leadership in the White House. As I look at the polls and the midterm results, I see Americans building an anti-Trump majority, which at least right now seems to make it far less likely Trump will ever be president again. Meanwhile events have shown — yet again — that you can’t run a successful society if you centralize power, censor knowledge and treat your people like slaves. The Times’s awe-inspiring reporting on the Russian war effort shows how pervasive the rot there is. China’s shambolic Covid policies are just one example of the truth that authoritarians can seem impressive for a season, but eventually error, rigidity and failures of human judgment accumulate. On his first foreign trip since the war began, Zelensky came to America. It’s a reminder that for all the talk of American decline, the world still needs American leadership. It’s a reminder that the liberal alliance is still strong. It’s a reminder that while liberal democracies blunder, they have the capacity to learn and adapt. Finally, Zelensky reminded us that while the authoritarians of the world have shown they can amass power, there is something vital they lack: a vision of a society that preserves human dignity, which inspires people to fight and binds people to one another.

2022-12-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/30/world/asia/xi-putin-china-russia.html,"Xi and Putin Meet Again, Two Strongmen in a Weak Moment","When China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia declared a “no limits” partnership 10 months ago, the pair projected an aura of strength in a direct challenge to the United States and the West. As the two leaders met again on Friday via video, they found themselves in positions of weakness, encumbered by geopolitical and economic threats to their informal authoritarian alliance. Both now have little room to maneuver, making the relationship all the more important, albeit also a lot more complicated. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in February, Mr. Putin has been isolated and highly dependent on China to maintain a semblance of diplomatic and financial stability. His needs have intensified in recent months as the Kremlin has suffered setbacks on the battlefield in a grinding war that has killed thousands of civilians and left Russia’s economy vulnerable. This month, Mr. Xi has seen his much-touted coronavirus pandemic strategy unravel and Covid cases explode, marring the image he wants to present to the world as the leader of a superior political system. With the current crisis, he can neither fully throw his weight behind Mr. Putin and risk sanctions, nor abandon him and risk losing a key geopolitical ally to counter the West. They betrayed little shakiness in their situations on Friday, pointing in public statements to beefier bilateral trade and growing military cooperation. In a seeming nod to the strains, Mr. Xi acknowledged the “complicated and consistently changing international situation,” but said China was ready to improve “strategic collaboration” with Russia, according to a transcript of Mr. Xi’s remarks published by state media. “As long as the two have the U.S. as their shared common threat, the convergence of their interests will outweigh the divergence,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based research institute. Mr. Putin used the call on Friday to reaffirm Russia’s ties with China, calling them “a model of cooperation between major powers in the 21st century,” according to a readout by the Kremlin. He invited Mr. Xi to visit Moscow in the spring and suggested the two countries could overcome the “unfavorable external situation” together. “We share the same views on the causes, course and logic of the ongoing transformation of the global geopolitical landscape, in the face of unprecedented pressure and provocations from the West,” Mr. Putin said. Russia sees China as its most important partner in its existential showdown with the West. Every word of support from Mr. Xi is amplified as evidence that Mr. Putin is far from alone in taking on Europe and the United States. A column published by Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency on Thursday showed how the Kremlin was lauding the partnership while trying to reduce expectations for how much support China would provide. Without providing proof, the article claimed that China was working to help Russia get around sanctions. This was happening “not as quickly or simply as Russia would like,” the article said, “but what matters is the process itself.” In a sign of Moscow’s growing reliance, China accounted for more than a quarter of Russia’s total imports in the first nine months of this year, compared with less than 15 percent in the first nine months of last year, according to Elina Ribakova, a deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance in Washington. Of the new car brands still sold on the Russian market, the only foreign ones — 11 of them — are Chinese, Russian state media reported this month. With Europe scrambling to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, China has become a critical customer. Three times this month, the Russian energy giant Gazprom announced breaking its record for single-day gas deliveries to China. On Friday, the two leaders vowed to deepen their ties. Mr. Xi called for China and Russia to “provide each other with support for issues involving core interests,” while Mr. Putin aimed to “strengthen cooperation between Russian and Chinese forces.” “Military and military-technical cooperation occupies a special place in our relations, in our ties,” Mr. Putin said. “It facilitates the security of our countries and supports stability in key regions.” Because China is loath to violate sanctions, Western officials say that Russia has turned to two other friendly countries — Iran and North Korea — for emergency deals to try to address its shortfall of arms and ammunition. But China’s partnership is important for the broader symbolism of Moscow helping to lead an anti-Western front — a key propaganda trope for Mr. Putin, who often rails against a Western “golden billion” purportedly trying to dominate and exploit the rest of the world’s population. “The West is trying to pressure with all its strength Beijing and the head of the People’s Republic of China personally, demanding they turn away from Moscow and Putin,” the marquee weekly news show on Russian state television, “Vesti Nedeli,” declared last Sunday. “But Beijing’s position is unchanged.” Their propaganda on Ukraine often aligns, deriding the United States for pushing Russia into war and taking aim at the more muscular posture of NATO. “The U.S. is making all efforts to cheer Ukraine on so it can continue its conflict with Russia,” China’s state-owned Global Times wrote in a recent commentary. “Washington hopes to use the war to completely crush Moscow, including making the latter lose its moral position within the international community.” Chinese scholars also emphasize that the majority of countries in the world have not agreed to join sanctions against Russia, and challenge the notion that Moscow is isolated beyond the West and its allies. “The United States and the European Union do not represent the world,” said Xu Poling, a Russia expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. China’s backing comes despite the complications the invasion has created for Mr. Xi. Beijing had been building on its economic ties with Western allies, but the war has moved Europe more in line with U.S. efforts to undercut China. The invasion has also drawn more attention to China’s threats to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan. And the disruption to Europe’s economy from soaring energy prices has roiled one of China’s biggest export markets. There are hints that Mr. Xi’s unease over the war is growing. During a meeting in Beijing last week, he expressed hope to Dmitri A. Medvedev, the close Putin ally and former Russian president, that “all parties concerned will exercise rational restraint.” Mr. Putin also alluded to Mr. Xi’s discomfort when he acknowledged the Chinese leader’s “questions” and “concerns” at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Uzbekistan in September, when the two leaders last met. Western leaders have urged Mr. Xi to do more to persuade Mr. Putin to stop the war. But the Chinese leader has told European officials that they overestimate the role he can play as a mediator, according to two officials with knowledge of the discussions. The officials added that the Chinese and Russian leaders shared a strong personal relationship, with Mr. Xi saying he trusted Mr. Putin. True as that may be, Mr. Xi can ill afford to abandon Mr. Putin or watch the Russian leader’s ambitions collapse in Ukraine, analysts say. Doing so would critically weaken a key geopolitical ally and leave China to compete with the United States on its own at a time when the Chinese leader faces mounting foreign and domestic challenges. Chief among them is the spiraling Covid outbreak that is threatening chaos in a nation where many people have already been pushed to their limits by years of lockdowns, quarantines and economic stagnation. The crisis — unfolding every day in hospitals and funeral homes across the country — has undermined the way the ruling Chinese Communist Party has portrayed Mr. Xi’s expert handling of the pandemic, particularly in the way it boasted low death tolls compared to the West. Mr. Xi is also being stung by rising pressure from the United States. Few things have been of greater consequence than the sweeping restrictions introduced in early October on semiconductor technology exports to China, which could set back the country’s high-tech industries by years. “Xi remains deeply wedded to Putin’s war, because China has much to gain geopolitically from a Russian victory and potentially even more to lose from a Russian defeat,” said Craig Singleton, a senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “In other words, Xi and Putin’s marriage of convenience will endure, not despite Russia’s battlefield setbacks, but because of them.” Mr. Xi may also be emboldened because he has yet to pay a prohibitive cost for his measured support of Russia. Far from being diplomatically isolated, Mr. Xi has spent the past three months re-engaging with world leaders, many of whom have longed to meet face-to-face with the leader of the world’s second-largest economy. China has seen relations stabilize with the United States to a degree after Mr. Xi met with President Biden at the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. The Chinese leader has also had productive meetings with European leaders, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France. And in a move on Friday that could signal Beijing’s growing focus on its relationship with Washington, China’s ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, was appointed the country’s new foreign minister. “A renewed demonstration of Sino-Russian solidarity may force Western countries to begrudgingly reassess their willingness to collectively pressure China to rein in its support for Russia,” Mr. Singleton said.

2022-12-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/30/opinion/letters/met-operas.html,Opinion | The Met’s Efforts to Increase Ticket Sales for Operas,"To the Editor: Re “Met Will Tap Into Endowment in a Bid to Woo Back Opera Fans” (front page, Dec. 27): The Metropolitan Opera’s decision to stage more contemporary operas is indeed a remarkable turnabout for “the premier opera company in the United States.” While the Met recently commissioned new works by Jeanine Tesori and Missy Mazzoli, they are the first two commissions given to female composers since its founding in 1883. I hope that in addition to those male composers mentioned in your fascinating and timely report, the stable of new composers to whom the Met will be giving a national stage and audience will include female composers and librettists. There are many who are talented and deserving and who would doubtless bring vital new perspectives but, historically, have been grossly underrepresented in the traditional canon. Their voices surely need to be heard. Robert A. SchumerGermantown, N.Y. To the Editor: One reason for the decline in Met attendance is the fact that the younger generation typically goes through elementary and secondary school without ever being exposed to opera. There are numerous kids who would love opera if schools incorporated it into the academic curriculum. I have taught in numerous New York City public high schools over 48 years and have found that almost all of the kids have never heard of Puccini, Wagner or Verdi. Opera is a crucial part of any liberal arts education. Moreover, opera does much more than provide students with an understanding and appreciation of vocal art. Studying the operatic repertoire enhances and enriches one’s knowledge of foreign languages, literature, drama, history and the humanities. Robert GrandtNew York To the Editor: While I applaud the Met’s recent efforts to present and commission new works, opera companies in Philadelphia, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco have been in the forefront of commissioning and presenting new works for over three decades, including works by Black, Latino and women composers. I hope the Met will stage Anthony Davis’s powerful “The Central Park Five” not far from the scene of this miscarriage of justice. Anne S. ArensteinCincinnati To the Editor: David Brooks’s recent column “Biden’s America Finds Its Voice” (Dec. 23) was right on target. President Volodymyr Zelensky’s speech to Congress reminded Americans of our fundamental values and heritage. The past six years have underscored our profound loss of trust in basic values and institutions. Faith in democracy, our government, freedom of speech and the media, science, education, the medical and legal professions, a better future, and, most of all, in each other, has plummeted. Cynicism is rampant. Both Mr. Zelensky and President Biden have reminded us that we all have much in common. But it is essential to cooperate and work together to nurture and protect a democratic, just and prosperous world. Freedom is not free and isolationism is not an option. What happens abroad will come to our shores. Members of Congress, at least for one evening, rose together to applaud our shared values with the courageous people of Ukraine. We were reminded of the many sacrifices our forefathers made in Saratoga and elsewhere. Ironically, it was a European who reminded Americans of what had made America a beacon of freedom and democracy to the world. Mr. Zelensky reminded us of who we are and what we stand for. John A. LindburgWashingtonThe writer served as the assistant general counsel to the United States Information Agency. To the Editor: Re “A Plea to the Liberals on the Supreme Court,” by Ryan D. Doerfler and Samuel Moyn (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 25): The authors suggest that the task of the Supreme Court “ought to be about who should enjoy the power to decide the content of the law in a democracy.” I’d put it differently. Our constitutional system is based on two principles: democracy and liberty. They are not the same. Democracy is the principle that the majority gets to decide. Liberty is the principle that the majority doesn’t get to decide everything. Just because there are more white than Black people, or more Christians than Jews and Muslims, or more Democrats and Republicans than socialists doesn’t mean that white people can deny the right of Black people to vote, that Christians by majority vote can impose their religious beliefs on Jews and Muslims, or that Democrats and Republicans can restrain the opinions of socialists. The Bill of Rights protects the rights of minorities of all kinds by placing legal limits on the power of majorities to violate such rights. The most important task of the Supreme Court is to decide how those limits apply in a particular situation, in order to protect the rights of people who are outvoted. In our system, by design, rights are protected by putting legal limits on democratic power. For much of our history, the Supreme Court has not done so. But at its best, protecting rights against the majority is precisely what it has done. Ira GlasserNew YorkThe writer was executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union from 1978 to 2001. To the Editor: Re “U.S. Work Force Is Feeling Strain of Retiree Surge” (front page, Dec. 27): I would love to go back to work, and I had never planned on “retiring” by the time I reached the age of 67. Although I have been practicing law for over 40 years, and still carry a small caseload, I miss working for many reasons. However, the main reason I have significantly reduced my participation in the work force is the way work is still being done. While it was necessary and understandable to switch as much work as possible to a remote platform at the beginning of the pandemic, it is no longer necessary and I simply do not wish to work remotely from home. So much of the work I do is now alienating and tedious, and I miss interacting with people in real life. Sitting alone at home in front of a computer and holding hearings by listening to disembodied voices do not provide the same satisfaction as working in person. I continue to maintain a minimal practice and retain my certification in the hope that I will be able to work in person again before I reach the conclusion that I really am too old to work! Debra Siedman DeWanBrooklyn To the Editor: Re “When Dick Cavett Met Groucho Marx” (Arts & Leisure, Dec. 25): Mr. Cavett’s reminiscence of his friendship with Groucho Marx reminded me of an appreciation I edited at The Baltimore Sun in 1977 shortly after Groucho’s passing. Back then, The Sun practiced the same honorific style that rules The Times’s news pages. On second reference, male adults were referred to as Mr. Surname. In the case of Groucho Marx, however, it struck me as all wrong to refer to him as “Mr. Marx.” Not that he hadn’t earned such respect, but rather that informality best fit his unique identity. The decision went all the way up to the managing editor, who ultimately ruled in our favor. Around the newsroom, it was known for a while as the “Groucho exception” to the stylebook. Groucho was, after all, exceptional. Steve ParksEaston, Md.",29
