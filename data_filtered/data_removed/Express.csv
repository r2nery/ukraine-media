High on Mr Macron's agenda appears to be both China and Russia's influence in space. He announced last night that he would host a meeting on Europe's space strategy next month with EU ministers. He told Le Parisien: ""I will make announcements about our strategy."" It comes three years after the US former US President Donald Trump officially launched the US Space Force. Since then, many other countries – including France, Russia, China and the UK – have launched similar entities. They aim to protect nation's assets in space, conduct military operations and, if necessary, engage in space warfare. Mr Macron's call for an EU-wide strategy on space comes as Beijing and Moscow have ramped up activities in space. They have both recently conducted military drills, including the launching of missiles, which have put the lives of astronauts in danger. More concerning, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping have stuck an anti-NATO agreement to cooperate in space for five years. The pair will sign the new space 'Cooperation Program' next year and it will run from 2023 to 2027. It will reportedly include a plan to create an International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) by 2035. It will also include plans to support the development of the ground segment of the two countries' national satellite systems. This will come through Russia's GLONASS and China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS, the Global Times reported. It will see Russia's Roscosmos and the China National Space Agency (CNSA) work together for years to come. Meanwhile, the US Space Force has installed a new radar system that it says will be able to detect objects the size of baseballs in orbit. The huge system, dubbed the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), has reportedly been installed at the Clear Space Force Base near Fairbanks, Alaska. It will support the US missile defence system and provide precise data on its adversaries. The decision marks a significant milestone for the work of the US Space Command and the developing arms race in space. It comes after Russia' deputy foreign minister compared the tensions on the Ukraine border to the Cuban Missile Crisis – a time where the world came the closest to nuclear war. But it also comes after Russia caught the US off-guard with an anti-satellite (ASAT) test. The Russian military destroyed a defunct satellite on November 15. It was blasted into more than 1,500 pieces and caused astronauts on board the ISS to have to shelter. The test drew widespread condemnation from U.S. officials, which Russian officials responded by calling “hypocritical” given past American military tests in space. To date, four countries – the US, Russia, China, and India – have previously destroyed their own satellites in ASAT tests. The Pentagon has now called for a global halt to ASAT weapon tests.",10
2022-01-06,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1545616/Russia-Rocket-Space-re-entry-Debris-ont,Russian rocket part makes uncontrolled re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere,"Officials have confirmed the part landed in the Pacific Ocean. It was from the third test flight of the Angara-A5 heavy-lift rocket, launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in north western Russia on December 27 However, writing on Twitter astronomer John McDowell said the risk was low. He said:”To be clear, I do NOT regard this object as a significant risk. “Reentries for a object with dry mass of about 4 tonnes may see some debris reach the ground, but not much.” According to Russian media outlet Tass the purpose of the launch was to test a new upper stage rocket, called the Persei booster for the first time. Initially the launch was declared a success according to officials Later on however the booster appeared to suffer from engine failure. This prevented the launcher from reaching a higher than low- Earth orbit. On Wednesday evening the 18th Space Control Squadron confirmed the re-entry had occurred at 4.08pm Eastern Standard Time over the South Pacific. No other details were provided. It’s common for debris from space to burn up in the atmosphere. However large parts can be dangerous depending on where they land. Space debris has become a controversial political issue. In November the US said that debris from a Russian anti-satellite missile test had forced the crew on the International Space Station (ISS) to shelter as a precaution Last May NASA slammed China after debris used to launch that country's new space station landed in the Indian Ocean.",10
2022-01-09,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1546718/china-russia-space-usa-roscosmos-china-national-space-agency,China and Russia tipped to ‘rule the world’ as pair strike terrifying space partnership,"Russian space agency Roscosmos revealed that China and Russia will sign a new space Cooperation Program for 2023-2027 next year. This will include a plan to create an open and inclusive International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) by 2035. The new program will also involve plans to support the development of the ground segment of the two countries' national satellite systems, Russia's GLONASS and China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) to be installed next year. Roscosmos and the China National Space Agency (CNSA) also plan to work on a number of other space programmes over the coming decades. Brandon Weichert, author of Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower warned that this could “knock the Americans back in space and in Eurasia”. He told Express.co.uk: “If China and Russia can remain firmly together in an anti-American alliance where they share money, resources, personnel, and technology...yes, they most certainly could knock the Americans back in space and in Eurasia. “And once that happens, they would rule the world. Few people in Washington appear to comprehend this. I spent years ringing that particular warning bell and no one listened. Now, they are somewhat and it may be too late.” He said the renewed battle for space harks back to the space war that blew up the escalating Cold War tensions of the 1960s. Mr Weichert told Express.co.uk: “A Sino-Russian entente in space will fundamentally shift the balance of power away from the United States, which was the undisputed champion of the first Space Race with the USSR and, following the Cold War, was the hegemon in space.” He said that while China and Russia are getting stronger in the cosmos, the US appears to be getting complacent. Mr Weichert told Express.co.uk: “Washington took its position for granted; it stopped innovating and pushing itself farther, especially in the manned spaceflight domain--we never left low-Earth orbit after we mothballed the Apollo program for God's sake. “What the Americans have always had at their disposal was an innovative private sector. ""Yet, until very recently, the big defence contractor-types dominated that area and they were neither innovative nor cheap. “Where is the all-of-society effort from the United States? Such an effort, by the way, exists in China. “ But despite the alleged lack of effort from the US, right now America does still hold the top position, according to Mr Weichert. He said: “China recognises that it still has a steep learning curve when competing against truly dynamic American companies in space. “So, now, they turn to Moscow. Russia is the second-most-powerful spacefaring nation next to America, but its space agency is out of money. “With its money and technology, paired with China's massive money resources and national will, the two powers can use their state capitalist model to easily best the sporadic Americans in space and knock the United States down from its dominant perch in orbit (and beyond). ""And that is precisely what Beijing and Moscow plan to do--especially now that US policy has driven Russia into the waiting arms of China.” China and Russia are now working on a draft of a legally binding intergovernmental agreement on a lunar mission, which is due to be signed in 2022. Roscosmos told Global Times that this will involve “an Earth-to-Lunar flight system, a lunar surface travel and operations system and automatic facilities with complexes of scientific instruments”. Mr Weichert said: “The moon missions are a priority for a few reasons. The first reason is that it puts their personnel on the best real estate on the moon before anyone else. “The second, is that they would be able to place strategic weapons on the moon which could be used to hold the world hostage according to their whims, specifically, the United States. “This was a concept that the Americans flirted with during the Eisenhower Administration, codenamed ""New Horizons. “It never got off the ground because Eisenhower did not think it was technically feasible and he worried about initiating a whole new arms race with the Soviets that would be fruitless and waste much taxpayer dollars. Sadly, he was wrong in this. “It was a missed opportunity for the United States to run the tables on the rest of the world.” He said that now that China and Russia have the opportunity to take advantage of what the US never did. Mr Weichert said: “Now, China and Russia are re-treading that old theoretical American ground and they intend on actually doing what the Americans refuse refused to do. Mr Weichert also said that there is huge economic opportunity for the new terrifying alliance to take advantage of. He said: “The moon will be home to a new industrial revolution that will produce trillions of dollars in the last half of the 21st century. “With China and Russia building on the best real estate on the moon, they will not only de facto prevent the Americans or anyone else from being there, but they will have the almighty first-mover advantage in whatever money is to be made from the moon and the subsequent space-based economy that will grow from there.”",10
2022-01-14,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1549646/russia-news-us-space-race-iran-north-korea-rocket-threat-bbc-spt,Why US partnered with Russia after space race to ‘stop Iran or North Korea’ rocket threat,"For decades, America and the Soviet Union were locked in a bitter battle to rule the skies above Earth. As Cold War tensions between the two powers rumbled on, the space race dominated the second half of the Twentieth Century. The Soviets were lightyears ahead of the US in the early days of their fiercely competitive, propaganda-driven relationship. In 1957, they launched Sputnik 1, the first manmade satellite to orbit Earth, following up their success four years later as Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space. However, the Americans hit back, most notably with the Moon landing in 1969 as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the lunar surface. Through the moon landing, the US took a major lead in the space race, with the Soviets failing several times to match the historic achievement. After the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, the Soviet Space Program became the Russian Space Program. However, amid the turmoil, the US struck a landmark agreement with Russia to fund its faltering space programme. Details of the agreement were laid bare in the 2014 BBC Four documentary, ‘Cosmonauts: How Russia Won the Space Race’. The feature-length film, voiced by the actor Paul McGann, explains how the US was worried about the potential threats posed by North Korea and Iran as the Russian Space Program ran out of cash. The narrator said: “It was so short of funding that its very existence was threatened. “It was a prospect that terrified the Americans. “Their worst fear was that it would leave an army of rocket engineers jobless, and they would go to work for Iran or North Korea. “So instead, the American government offered to go into partnership with the Russians.” Under the arrangement, the US stood to benefit from Russia’s experience with long-term spaceflight. Meanwhile, the Russians’ own space endeavours would be boosted by American financial help. One of the first stages of the new partnership was that astronauts from NASA would live and work aboard Mir, the space station launched by the Soviet Union. The documentary features British-born astronaut Michael Foale (top picture), one of those chosen to take part in the Mir mission alongside the Russians. Mr Foale, who retired from NASA in 2013, claimed some of his colleagues were opposed to the Russia-US partnership. He said: “To be really honest, I don’t think the Americans were really keen to be involved in Mir. “They were told to be involved by the White House. “I look back on it and it was a very positive thing, but I had to be told. “The general feeling amongst American engineers was, ‘Why is the money going to Russia? It should come to our company so that we can build the space station on our own. We don’t need the Russians.’”",10
2022-01-19,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1552259/russia-international-space-station-spacewalk-cosmonauts-technology-spt,Russia’s ‘50-year-old’ technology key to International Space Station success,"The International Space Station (ISS) will be centre stage today as two Russian cosmonauts conduct a spacewalk. Commander Anton Shkaplerov (below) and Flight Engineer Pyotr Dubrov of Expedition 66 will leave the ISS for seven hours. They will exit the Poisk module’s airlock where they will collect their spacewalking gear. Donning their Russian Orlan spacesuits, the pair will then kit out the station’s new Prichal module. They will install handrails, rendezvous antennas, a television camera, and docking targets, according to NASA. Prichal docked to the Nauka multipurpose laboratory module on the ISS in November last year. Footage of the spacewalk will be broadcast live on NASA TV, the NASA app and the agency’s website. Amid the latest Russian spacewalk, a throwback documentary reveals just how much the country has contributed to the ISS due to the Russian space advancements throughout history. The 2014 documentary ‘Cosmonauts: How Russia Won the Space Race’ charts the Soviet Union’s infamous so-called “space race” with the US in the Twentieth Century. The feature-length film, voiced by the actor Paul McGann, examines how many Soviet technological breakthroughs are still used in space exploration today. He said: “In reality, the ISS is the greatest testament to the achievements of the mighty Soviet space programme. “Its very existence depends on technology and expertise built up by the Soviets and Russians over 50 years of space exploration.” Some of the technologies used in the ISS have their origin in the Soviet Union’s Salyut 7 space station, which orbited Earth until 1991. The ISS is also partly inspired by its predecessor, the Soviets’ Mir station, which was in use until 2001. Mr McGann added: “The station’s crucial life support systems are based on those developed on Salyut 7 and Mir. “The spacesuits they use are Russian-made, descendants of the suit [Alexei] Leonov wore on the first spacewalk and those designed to walk on the moon. “And, since 2011, the only way to get to the station has been in a Soyuz capsule mounted on the top of an R-7 rocket – updated versions of the originals designed by Sergei Korolev half a century ago. “The Soviets may have lost the race to the Moon, but our continued presence in orbit owes everything to the Russians’ determination to conquer space.” Today’s mission is the first spacewalk of 2022 and comes ahead of the first scheduled docking to Prichal in March. The docking will see a Soyuz spacecraft carrying three cosmonauts join the ISS as they become part of the Expedition 67 crew. The spacewalk will be the third in Shkaplerov’s career and the fourth for Dubrov. It is also the 246th spacewalk carried out at the space station in total. Further spacewalks are planned for later this year, including to fit a European robotic arm on the Nauka laboratory and to activate the module’s airlock.

It is on course to head to the Red Planet in September after being assembled in Stevenage. Part of the ExoMars mission, the rover is a joint project of the European Space Agency (ESA) and Russia's Roscosmos Experts have been putting the probe through its paces as it has passed months of successful maintenance and functional tests. It has now been given the ""go for flight"" confirmation. It is currently in an ultra-clean room at the Thales Alenia Space premises in Turin, Italy, alongside launch partner, the Russian Kazachok landing platform. The rover will have a final review in April, before it will travel to Baikonur, Kazakhstan, for launch. Previously known as the ExoMars Rover, the Rosalind Franklin was originally due to launch for the Red Planet in the summer of 2020. But it was delayed due to the pandemic. It is now scheduled to launch this September, arriving on Mars in June 2023. Pietro Baglioni, ESA's ExoMars rover team leader, said: ""The rover is ready, and together with the recent drop test success for the parachutes, we are positive to be in time for the September launch date."" Once the rover gets to the Red Planet, it will undergo a ""nerve-wracking"" descent to the surface, after which Rosalind Franklin will leave the landing platform and drive around the surface. If all goes to plan, ESA will become the fourth agency to operate a vehicle on another world - following the Soviet Union, NASA and China. The ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars 2022 mission will launch on a Proton-M rocket with a Breeze-M upper stage from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, in the 20 September – 1 October 2022 launch window. A carrier module will transport the descent module with the Rosalind Franklin rover and Kazachok surface science platform inside, to Mars.

She said: ""The Rosalind Franklin rover showcases some of the best of the UK’s space sector and its search for signs of life on Mars will inspire future generations of scientists and engineers. ""It’s very exciting to see this flagship mission pass the latest tests and see the fruition of many years’ hard work as we look forward to the launch later this year.""",10
2022-01-21,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1553010/doomsday-clock-2022-news-midnight-annihilation-europe-war-spt,Doomsday Clock stays 'closest to apocalypse' it has ever been as threat of war looms,"Today, the Doomsday Clock was unveiled for the 75th time on Thursday. It stayed at 100 seconds to midnight for the third year in a row, as the world remains the ""closest to apocalypse"" it has ever been. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Science and Security Board, the clock's keepers, said things COVID-19, climate change, disruptive technologies and threats posed by nuclear weapons were all exacerbated by ""a corrupted information ecosphere that undermines rational decision making"". They said the decision to keep the time the same as last year ""does not, by any means, suggest that the international security situation has stabilised"". In its history, the clock has been moved backwards and forwards 24 times, the farthest being 17 minutes to midnight in 1991, the nearest being today's 100 seconds. With Russia poised to attack Ukraine, many, like Julian Borger, a Washington-based journalist, had noted before the announcement that it was “hard to imagine the clock being set back ‒ and that means that the experts assess we are in greater danger now than ever.” The clock was birthed in 1947 and can be traced back to a group of international researchers called the Chicago Atomic Scientists, who took part in the Manhattan Project, which produced the world's first nuclear weapons. They began publishing a mimeographed newsletter which later became the magazine, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which depicted the Clock on every cover. Eugene Rabinowitch, a co-founder of the Bulletin, summed up what the clock meant at the time: ""The Bulletin's Clock is not a gauge to register the ups and downs of the international power struggle; it is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age."" The closest the clock came at the height of the Cold War was two minutes to midnight in 1953 after the first detonation of a thermonuclear warhead, a hydrogen bomb. It would remain extremely close to midnight throughout the Cold War period, with American nuclear chemist, Harrison Brown, in 1962 — the climax of the Cuban missile crisis — setting out what would be an apocalypse-predicting guest editorial in the Bulletin: ""I am writing on a plane en route from Los Angeles to Washington and for all I know this editorial … may never be published. ""Never in history have people and nations been so close to death and destruction on such a vast scale. Midnight is upon us."" But shortly after his words went to print, the Bulletin decided against moving the hands any closer to midnight, at this point being seven minutes to. This was because the shock of near catastrophe had given the US and Soviet Russia the incentive towards risk reduction and controlling arms. The farthest the clock has ever been from midnight was 17 minutes, right at the end of the Cold War period, in 1991. It has slipped back towards extinction ever since, however. This, experts say, is for a number of reasons: increasing volatility of geopolitics, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased threat of climate change, which only made it into the clock's calculation in 2007. At first, the Clock was not going to be a clock at all; rather, the scientists had floated the idea of basing it on a U for Uranium, but soon dismissed the idea for something more urgent. Martyl Langsdorf, an artist whose husband Alexander was a physicist, took the imagery of countdowns and rocket launches and put them into a clock, something everyone could relate to. Rachel Bronson, the Bulletin's current president, told The Guardian that the original time on the clock of seven minutes to midnight ""conveyed urgency, but also hope, a sense that there’s something we can do about it"". She added: ""We can set it back. And all of that in an image that is not language-dependent."" The Clock certainly cut through and left the dense nature of science behind it, since breaking into mainstream culture and featuring in Cold War novels, Doctor Who, music by The Who and Iron Maiden. Prime Minister Boris Johnson even referred to it in his speech during the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, though wrongly said it was at a minute to midnight.

The Clock certainly cut through and left the dense nature of science behind it, since breaking into mainstream culture and featuring in Cold War novels, Doctor Who, music by The Who and Iron Maiden. It is important to note that the Clock is not asserting that the apocalypse is definitely near. Neither is it saying that global thermonuclear war is definitely imminent, or that climate change will kill us very soon. It is instead a warning from scientists that those things could happen if things do not change soon. You can watch the 2022 Doomsday Clock announcement live on Thursday at 3pm here.",10
2022-01-29,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1557615/china-news-moon-base-russia-vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-space-alliance,Xi and Putin join forces: Superpowers plot moon base in major rival to NASA plans,"This base is set to rival NASA's Lunar Gateway, a planned space station in the moon’s orbit serving as a vital hub for communication and research. Officials from the China National Space Administration (CNSA), the country's national space agency, confirmed plans to build the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) on Friday. Working with Russia, the countries plan to finish building basic infrastructure construction for ILRS by 2035, according to Wu Yanhua, CNSA deputy director. He said that this also includes systems for energy, communication and life support. While NASA’s lunar Gateway will only orbit the Moon, this new space station will have both an orbiter and a base on the lunar surface, along with multiple exploration rovers. The two countries have also agreed to cooperate on the launch of a robotic lunar mission, Chang’e 7, around 2025, according to Liu Jizhong, director of the administration’s China Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center. This announcement comes as China and Russia grow increasingly closer in military and space capabilities, with the two countries holding naval exercises in the Arabian sea earlier this week. Western officials have speculated China would support Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, while visiting Australia, no one should rule out Beijing aggression in the Pacific if Russia sends troops into Ukraine. She added: “Russia is working more closely with China than it ever has. ""Aggressors are working in concert and I think it’s incumbent on countries like ours to work together.” This announcement of this alliance has sparked rumours of a new space race between the US and the two countries The US has scheduled a major test of the Artemis program next month, which aims to bring back manned missions to the moon later this decade. The chief designer of China’s first lunar probe, Ye Peijian, told state media the country may be able to send astronauts to the moon for the first time by 2030. However, according to Mr Liu, Beijing wants to keep sending robotic missions to explore the presence and distribution of water as well as the poles of the moon. Most recently, China launched Chang’e 5, in 2020. It returned back to Earth last year with lunar samples. In April last year, China successfully launched Tianhe, the 22-tonne core module of Tiangong, beginning the construction of the country’s first long-term space station. According to officials in the joint program, the collaboration will also be open to global scientists. Mr Wu said: “We welcome the extensive participation of international colleagues.""",10

UK to 'deepen' relationship with US through Five Eyes space defence deal,"It comes as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced the Government's Defence Space Strategy. Produced by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the paper warns that space has ""brought unprecedented advantages and new threats"". It signals directly to the likes of Russia and China who have conducted dangerous missions in the cosmos recently. Mr Wallace noted: ""As in other domains, it is vital that we continue to work within key alliances, including international partners, industry and academia, to achieve success and make the most of opportunities. ""We will deepen our close work with the US and will seek to collaborate further with Five Eyes partners, the Combined Space Operations (CSpO) partner nations, NATO and other like-minded powers, as we develop our defence space capabilities."" Yesterday, the Government committed £1.4billion extra funds to ""bolster our national interests in space"". According to a statement, £968 million of the billion-pound investment will be committed to delivering a multi-satellite system. Dubbed the ISTARI Programme, the system is planned to support greater global surveillance and intelligence for military operations. Another £61 million is earmarked to explore “cutting-edge” laser communications technology to deliver data from space to Earth at a speed equivalent to superfast broadband. The new investment is on top of the existing £5billion already upgrading the UK’s Skynet satellite communications capability. The statement continues to state that an additional £127million invested over the next four years will develop a network of satellites designed to integrate space with land, air, sea and cyber. The new programme, “MINERVA”, will “present the UK’s ability to autonomously collect, process and disseminate data from the UK and allied space assets to support frontline military decision-making”. Mr Wallace noted: ""It’s crucial we continue to push the frontiers of our defence space ambitions, enhancing our military resilience and strengthening our nation’s security. ""This significant investment will help to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of space innovation and one step ahead of our competitors."" It comes after the UK was kicked out of the EU's Galileo project following Brexit. The system, which goes live in 2026, features a Public Regulated Service (PRS) that can be used by government agencies, armed forces and emergency services. The bloc decided this ""crucial feature"" would only be accessible for EU members, despite the UK developing its ""brains and heart"". The UK identified space as a priority for the first time in the earlier Integrated Defence Review. Britain has been operating in space continuously since 1988 and boasts a world-leading sovereign satellite communications capability. The UK Space Command, established in July 2021, will lead the defence space approach.",10
2022-02-04,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1560919/solar-storm-russia-radio-blackout-coronal-mass-ejection-met-office-prediction,Solar storm havoc: Russia suffers 'long-lasting' radio BLACKOUTS as particles batter Earth,"A coronal mass ejection (CME) blasted out the Sun’s outer layer on January 29, sending with it fast solar winds and a geomagnetic storm that catapulted into the Earth’s atmosphere on February 3. These storms bring billions of tonnes of fast-moving solar particles as well as the magnetic field that binds them. When these crash into the Earth’s atmosphere, it can cause chaos down below, including the chance of radio blackouts. These can cause problems in an “intrusive and long-lasting way”. It now appears that the “ongoing” solar storm has caused this issue for Russia. Space weather physicist Tamitha Skov wrote on Twitter” Here's: “Here's what aurora from the ongoing solar storm is doing to VHF radio in Russia now. “This is why solar storms often impact amateur radio in an intrusive and long-lasting way. Ms Skov shared an audio clip of a Russian radio in which the solar winds could be heard interfering with the broadcast. But this comes at a time when there are reports that 100,000 Russian troops are piled up at the border with Ukraine and look poised to invade. US Space Weather Center (SWPC) ranks solar storms on a scale of ""G1 Minor"", the least intense, all the way up to ""G5 Extreme"". But even the weaker solar storms are able to interrupt radio communications with the high-energy radiation that they can bring. This radiation is said to cover the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Elements like the ultra-violet and X-rays will cause changes in the Earth’s ionosphere (the upper part of the Earth’s atmosphere), resulting in these radio communication issues. The Met Office’s space weather forecast said of the CME launched on January 29: “Early indications showed that minor geomagnetic storm levels were reached, but subsequent data from the British Geological Society showed that in fact moderate geomagnetic storm levels where reached with unsettled to active conditions following for the rest of the day.” When solar storms are stronger, they can cause even more disruption. According to the the SWPC, when strong CMEs collide with Earth’s magnetosphere “all of that extra radiation can damage the satellites we use for communications and navigation, it can disrupt power grids that provide our electricity”. This can lead to power outages that could even last days if solar storms are at their strongest. But even the weakest of storms threaten ""power-grid fluctuations"" and have a ""minor impact on satellite operations"", and of course, radio blackouts. And the Met Office warned that the storm is not over. Its website says: ”Solar winds will probably remain elevated for much of today, with a chance of briefly becoming strong. “Tomorrow (5th) the solar wind may temporarily decrease to slightly elevated levels, before returning to elevated levels.” It also warned that “there is also a chance (30 percent) of a Minor Storm interval today and also day 3 (20 percent), but especially tomorrow (50 percent).",10
2022-02-14,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1565717/russia-news-space-station-threat-iss-astronauts-vladimir-putin-ukraine,Putin could DISABLE ISS and send it 'back to Earth orbit' – astronauts on high alert,"Geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine could result in Russian cosmonauts being asked to pull out of the ISS, dealing a major blow to the multinational collaborative project, of which Russia was a key member. Throughout the history of space exploration and the tensions between the US and Russia, the ISS has largely remained unaffected by conflicts on the ground. Even through key flashpoint events like the Russian annexation of Crimea, and the Kremlin’s meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections, the astronauts and cosmonauts cooperated onboard the ISS. Scott Hubbard, former director of the US space agency NASA's Ames Research Center noted: ""When you work with the Russians, and you develop a bond of trust and they've had a few vodkas together – that bond stays there, regardless of high-level politics.” ""The scientists and engineers just carry on with what they are dedicated to."" Despite this spirit of friendly cooperation, it is not the astronauts, nor the scientists that decide whether to work together or not, but rather the parent governments, like Russia and the US. Roger Launius, an adviser to the space industry as part of Launius Historical Services said: ""Neither the decision-makers at NASA or at the Russian space agency nor at the other partners of the space station want the cooperation to end."" However, Mr Launius warned that increasing geopolitical tensions could determine the fate of the space station. He said: ""If NATO mobilises in response to the Russians' behaviour in Ukraine, the cards will be reshuffled. ""Then we will probably no longer experience cooperation in space travel."" John Logsdon from the Space Policy Institute shared similar concerns. He said; ""Could invading Ukraine break down the invisible wall around the 'ISS' if the US imposes sanctions that anger Russia enough to threaten to withdraw from the station - yes, that could very well happen."" One thing Russian Mr Putin could do is to withdraw their two permanent cosmonauts on the ISS and return to earth. Mr Logsdon said: ""The most drastic scenario, however, would be the decoupling of the Russian modules from the rest of the station.” The first two components of the ISS come from the Russian modules ""Zarya"" and ""Zvezda"", which use their engines to raise the orbit of the ISS from time to time when the upper layers of the atmosphere begin slowing down the station. Mr Logsdon warned that such a scenario could be meant that ""the ISS could survive for a short time"". But, he added: ""After a few months, the space station's orbit would be so unstable that it would enter Earth's atmosphere."" The decoupling of the modules would be a self-destructive act on Moscow’s side, as these modules cannot survive independently without being attached to a space station.

2022-02-18,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1567550/nuclear-missile-russia-news-ukraine-crisis-raf-early-warning-systems-smart-meters,Nuclear missile warning: RAF fears UK early warning systems thwarted during Russia crisis,"The RAF is concerned over the rollout of new smart meters, that work on similar frequencies as the early warning system for missiles and are run the risk of interference. This comes as an expert warned that Russia is developing a ""superweapon"" in the form of a nuclear-powered cruise missile. As a result of these concerns, energy bosses have been forced to halt installations across parts of Yorkshire. People who live near RAF Fylingdales have been refused an upgrade to a smart meter because their signals may clash with its ballistic missiles radar equipment, according to the Telegraph. These are radar bases that form a part of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). As part of intelligence-sharing arrangements between the US and the UK, the RAF Fylingdales will share the data it collects with the US. This data gives the Governments of both countries a vital warning of an impending ballistic missile attack. This base also has a few other vital functions, like being part of the US Space Surveillance Network and keeping track of spy satellites from other countries. The reason these smart meters pose such a threat is that the frequencies they use to send data to suppliers are very similar to ones used by Fylingdales. As a result of this, ministers have stopped the rollout of smart meters to some homes within the North York Moors National Park. The energy firms will now need to install a new type of smart meter that would operate on the 454MHz frequency instead of the standard 422-424MHz band used by most smart meters. According to the Telegraph, a letter from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, was sent to some households late last year. It read: “Some premises within the vicinity of RAF Fylingdales will require new technology that industry has been developing – a special type of communications hub – for smart meters at those properties to connect to the national smart metering network.” The early warning systems are crucial to the UK’s defence, as Russia policy expert Clint Ehrlich has claimed Putin's military is running a secret programme of ""superweapons"" capable of taking on the US - in the event of talks over Ukraine breaking down. Mr Ehrlich's warning comes as the Kremlin continue to mass troops near Ukraine, provoking Western fears of an invasion. Mr Ehrlich told Express.co.uk: ""There are additional super weapons that they've been developing, including a nuclear-powered cruise missile. ""This was actually something that the US looked at during the Cold War and it was viewed to be too dangerous. ""Because the fear is that if the nuclear reactor on the bottom of the missile malfunctions, you can just have this thing that starts going around the earth over and over and over again spewing nuclear waste everywhere. ""Russia has been developing that as a potential weapon.""",10
2022-02-19,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1568340/space-news-uk-russia-china-space-junk-debris-iridium-satellites,UK to lead mission to stop 'catastrophic' space crash as Russia and China threaten assets,"Antonio Weiss, a digital transformation specialist, has been working with The UK Space Agency to develop a digital programme that can detect and track the vast quantity of material currently orbiting Earth. And he warned the problem was “the very definition of a global issue”, with a small number of collisions having the potential to “render the majority of near-Earth space unusable”. Meanwhile, Jacob Geer, Head of Space Surveillance and Tracking at the UK Space Agency stressed while removing space junk orbiting the planet was difficult it was “not impossible” - and floated the idea of launching special anti-debris satellites from UK spaceports in the future. Mr Weiss told Express.co.uk: “A collision between a satellite and another object can be catastrophic, even the smallest pieces of debris can cause huge damage when it’s flying at a satellite at several kilometres a second.” Citing the 2009 Iridium crash, involving a collision between US and Russian satellites, as an example, he added: “When a crash occurs it creates a cloud of thousands of debris fragments that spread out across the environment, creating chaos for other satellites and reducing the area of clean orbits for new satellites.” With satellites already extremely expensive to build, launch and operate, keeping them clear of random pieces of junk was similarly difficult and expensive, taking up valuable time and energy which the international community would prefer to put into something more productive, Mr Weiss stressed. He said: “It’s this knock-on effect, of clouds of debris and endangering other functioning objects in orbit, which make this the very definition of a global issue. “Not only this, but it would only take a few more incidents like the 2009 Iridium crash to render the majority of near-Earth space unusable.” Overall, according to the European Space Agency (ESA), there are currently more than 9,000 tonnes of space debris orbiting the Earth, including a Chinese rocket due to crash into the Moon’s surface next month. As for the UK’s role, Mr Weiss said: “Up until now the American’s have been leading the way with programmes like these, with the US Space Force promising to be the most proactive due to the security issues space debris can hold from other countries like Russia. “But, in terms of pioneering the nuts and bolts of the technology, the UK is by far the most proactive.” He explained: “Within the clean-up operation headed by the International Space Station, it’s a British made satellite (made by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited) that is equipped with a harpoon and net, which will test a system for capturing large pieces of space junk. “At the end of its mission, it will unfurl a drag sail to slow its speed, bringing itself and the captured debris out of orbit, where it will burn up as it enters the atmosphere.” The UK also has two of its own large programmes to further develop this kind of research with Astroscale and Clearspace launched this year to keep satellite orbit paths clear and run reconnaissance and recovery on large pieces of space debris which could potentially be recycled or reused. Referring to his own project, Mr Weiss said: “The software developed by The PSC team uses data from orbital analytics to calculate the likelihood of collisions in space, and notifies satellite operators with any threats in real-time. “This means operators are able to adjust their satellite’s course accordingly to avoid any potential crashes – such as China did recently when they pulled a defunct navigation satellite out of the path of other satellites. ""This is all aimed at making the space sector a safer place within which to operate.” There were significant logistical challenges, he acknowledged, especially because nobody territorially “owns” space, meaning it could be difficult to convince organisations to clean up after themselves. Mr Weiss said: “Our programme plays a crucial role by mapping and predicting where space junk will be at any given time, enabling the international community to swing into action.” Mr Geer told Express.co.uk: “Removing debris from orbit is difficult but not impossible, which is why we are seeing several companies and space agencies developing ways of doing this. “The UK has, with the RemoveDebris mission, already demonstrated various ways of capturing debris in orbit, such as using nets or even harpoons. The challenge now is to make the service work commercially and target more dangerous debris.” He stressed the UK was at the “leading edge”, with the first missions likely to reach space by the middle of the decade. Mr Geer said: “Last year, UK Space Agency awarded funding to prepare the initial phases of a UK-led mission to clean up orbit by removing multiple old satellites. This mission supports the government’s ambitions to be a leading nation in space sustainability.” The UKSA was exploring a number of options including the launch of new satellites, Mr Geer explained. He added: “One key thing we can do now is better track and avoid debris, which requires analysis and data from here on earth. “Missions like this could be launched from UK spaceports in the years to come. UK spaceports typically aim to reach parts of low earth orbit, a region of space where there is already a major problem with space debris.”",10

Part of the “harsh” US sanctions slapped down on Russia were intended to ""degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program"". This has sparked fury in Russia as tensions in a renewed space-race appear to be soaring. Dmitry Rogozin, Roscosmos Director-General wrote on Twitter: “Do you want to destroy our cooperation on the ISS? ""If you block cooperation with us, then who is going to save the ISS from an uncontrolled descent from orbit and then falling onto the territory of the United States or Europe? ""There is also a scenario where the 500-ton structure falls on India or China. Do you want to threaten them with this prospect? The ISS doesn't fly over Russia, so all the risks are yours."" Mr Rogozin also begged the US to waive what he dubbed ""Alzheimer's sanctions"". This comes after the US’ top space officials said that Russia’s invasion was likely to extend into space. National Reconnaissance Office Director Chris Scolese wanred that Russia could target satellites and jam GPS systems. This could have devastating down on Earth. Mr Scolese warned: ““Russia places a high priority on integrating electronic warfare into military operations and has been investing heavily in modernizing this capability. “Russia has a multitude of systems that can jam GPS receivers within a local area, potentially interfering with the guidance systems of unmanned aerial vehicles, guided missiles and precision guided munitions, but has no known capability to interfere with GPS satellites themselves using radio frequency interference.” NASA also did not seem bothered about Mr Rogozin’s outburst. The agency responded: “""The new export control measures will continue to allow U.S.-Russia civil space operation. ""No changes are planned to the agency's support for ongoing in-orbit and ground-station operations."" Tensions between the US and Russia in space have been soaring in recent months after a Russian missile test sent debris flying towards the ISS. Astronauts had to flee to their spacecrafts for cover after the direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) drill, which led to NASA lashing out at Russia over the “reckless” move. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement following the incident: ““Like Secretary Blinken, I’m outraged by this irresponsible and destabilizing action. “With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts. “Their actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station and the taikonauts on board.” But this also comes as China and Russia appear to striking a terrifying space partnership to rival the US’ dominance in space in what may be a renewed space-race. Beijing has confirmed that it will be building a research station on the moon, the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), to rival the US’ Lunar Gateway. Lunar Gateway is also a planned space station in the moon’s orbit which could serve as a vital hub for communication and research. Russia and China have also agreed to cooperate on the launch of a robotic lunar mission, Chang’e 7, around 2025, according to Liu Jizhong, director of the administration’s China Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center.",10
2022-03-01,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1573362/UK-nuclear-weapons-Map-evg,Where are UK nuclear weapons? Map shows UK nuclear capabilities,"The Russian premier's thinly veiled threat drew immediate condemnation, with leaders deeming it a rekindling of Cold War tensions from which Europe has barely recovered. On Monday, the Putin regime doubled down following a raft of new sanctions and named UK foreign secretary Liz Truss in its reasoning for the threat. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov branded the recent stance against Russia ""absolutely unacceptable"" and called out the ""British foreign minister"" despite saying he would not announce ""the authors of these statements by name"". There are only a handful of countries officially recognised as nuclear-capable, with the UK among the best equipped. Only Russia and the US have awarded stockpiles in the four-figure range, with 6,257 and 5,550 each respectively, meaning they hold 90 percent of the world's total supply between them. The UK is one of five nations with three-figure stockpiles, with 225 warheads at its disposal. These are peppered across static and mobile locations, defining the country's varied tactical approach. Any nuclear weapons not deployed for potential use will spend their time in vaults or engineering facilities. The two vaults used for nuclear weapons are in Scotland at the Royal Naval Armaments Depot (RNAD) in Coulport, and Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) in Clyde. The Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) handles missiles needing repair at one of its four sites. AWE, which is also responsible for manufacturing, has two ""main"" locations at Aldermaston and Burghfield. From there, staffers carry out construction and research work, supported by two other locations at Blacknest and Coulport. The AWE is not responsible for launching the missiles it manufactures or repairs. That responsibility falls to the UK's sole nuclear deterrent system, Trident. The Trident programme first came to be in 1980 and is a mobile delivery system composed of four Vanguard-class submarines. Operated by the Royal Navy, they carry approximately eight UGM-133 Trident II missiles each. They also have a steady supply of warheads, around 40 each. While the missiles come from US manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the warheads are British, made at the AWE. These Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) launch from the ship's body into the atmosphere. After launch, they use multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs) to zero in on their intended destinations with an ""unlimited"" total range. Trident submarines supply a continuous presence at sea, with at least one operational at a time. When not patrolling, the submarines stay put at the Clyde Naval Base in Scotland.",10

It supported 45 staff on two levels, with the main control room spanning both floors. Initially built on a tightly-packed Government estate, the facility got the nickname ""the UK's Kremlin"" and remained ready to help defend the nation up until the early 1990s. The building was since decontaminated and is now ready to be redeveloped by Homes England, a non-departmental public body that helps fund affordable housing. Chartered surveyors Thomas Lister, which is marketing the sale on behalf of Homes England, managed the recent sale of the building and its 2.1 hectares of developable land. ""The formal tender process for the sale of the building has completed and we are currently in negotiation with a purchaser,"" Rachel Lister, of the firm, said today. The Grade II Listed building was put on the market last year, Nottinghamshire Live understands. But it comes as fears grow the Russian rhetoric ""mimics that of the Cold War"". Kira Rudik, Ukrainian Party leader of Voice, said: ""Russia are basically prepared to invade any country if they need to, and it is dangerous to have this neighbour on the European continent."" Each region had a command hub, like the War Rooms, to help defend its population during the Cold War. Regional Commissioners held absolute power and governed the surviving citizens from the relative safety of the concrete fortresses. And Nottingham War Rooms was one of the largest fortresses with BBC studio engineers and associated broadcast equipment even housed on the top floor during the conflict. The building also possesses a Lamson 'Tube Exchange' mechanism - an exchange system where posted documents are ferried about the complex. Speaking ahead of the sale, a spokesperson for Thomas Lister said: ""The soft market testing that we have carried out has demonstrated that the extensive accommodation could provide for a number of commercial uses including space for TV, music and film, for which there is a reported shortfall in space in the UK and growing demand for facilities outside of London. “Initial interest has already been shown by creative industries and education and research facilities which, in collaboration with employers, could also be potential occupiers within this flexible and secure space. ""Vertical farming is also increasing in demand and popularity and could also work within a space like the War Rooms, given the ability to facilitate a controlled environment from a lighting and climate perspective. ""Ideas incorporating renewable energy creation for net zero carbon development are also sectors with a potential interest in the asset, as are immersive leisure uses such as escape room or virtual reality experiences. ""Whilst repurposing a Grade II listing building brings with it some challenges, our soft market testing undertaken has also demonstrated that there will be many uses that this historic building could potentially lend itself to.""",10

However, so far there are no indications that Moscow is going to withdraw cooperation. The US supplies power and life support on the ISS while Russia is responsible for propulsion and keeping the station afloat. This is done through the use of a progress spacecraft giving the station a boost to maintain its altitude of around 250 miles. Kathy Lueders, who heads the human space program at NASA, said that US aerospace and defence company Northrop Grumman had offered to help with reboost capacity. She said: “And, you know, our SpaceX folks are looking at can we have additional capability. “We always look for how do we get more operational flexibility, and our cargo providers are looking at how do we add different capabilities.” A Northrop Grumman cargo vessel arrived at the ISS on 21 February and “reboosted” the station without Russian help for the first time. Rogozin has asked the rhetorical question about who would save the ISS from an uncontrollable de-orbit in the case of a Russian withdrawal from the project. Writing on Twitter in response, SpaceX boss Elon Musk tweeted his own company’s logo. At present Launders has made it clear that such plans are being drawn up on a contingency basis and it would be difficult for the US to run the ISS without Russian assistance. She said: “It would be very difficult for us to be operating on our own. “ISS is an international partnership that was created … with joint dependencies. “As a team, we are looking at where we may have operational flexibilities “But … it would be a sad day for international operations if we can’t continue to peacefully operate in space.”",10

Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, said Britain must sell its shares in the company or promise not to use the satellites for military operations. The head of the agency, Dmitry Rogozin, even threatened to remove the Soyuz rocket from the launch pad and send the satellites “to the assembly and test building"". But it appears the UK has refused to cave. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng wrote on Twitter: “There's no negotiation on OneWeb: the UK government is not selling its share.” The UK’s OneWeb network is a constellation of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that beam signals in 3G, 5G, LTE and Wi-Fi for high-speed internet access to all corners of the globe. The Government bought a share in the company after it was kicked out of the EU’s Galileo programme after Brexit, getting its hands on a £400m stake in 2020. While OneWeb does not carry out the same functions as Galileo, it has been tipped to one day rival the project. The UK government came under pressure pull out of the Kazakhstahn launch over the escalating conflict in Ukraine. But it said it was continuing to discuss the situation with its partners on the OneWeb board. While Russia appears to be blocking the UK from launching these satellites, Britain may have other options. That is because there are a number of domestic rocket companies and spaceports are gearing up for the first ever rocket launch from UK soil. And ministers are said to be keen for OneWeb to use UK launch capacity when it becomes available. Spaceport Cornwall is one possible spaceport that has been tipped for the first ever rocket launch from British soil as early as this summer. Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne rockets could blast small satellites into orbit in horizontal launches from the Cornwall location. Spaceport Cornwall CEO Melissa Thorpe told Express.co.uk: “They (OneWeb) are a UK company, and our ambitions would be to work with any UK-based satellite manufacturing company. “That is the whole point of creating a spaceport in the UK, to service our existing satellite base here. “At the minute they (satellites) are all being shipped overseas to launch and we want to capture that marketplace here in the UK - we are open to working with any of the UK manufacturers, including OneWeb."" Lockheed Martin’s Shetland spaceport and UK company Orbex, which operates out of Space Hub Sutherland, are also in competition with Spaceport Cornwall. Both companies are also hoping they can provide launch for small satellites, which may include OneWeb’s network. Orbex CEO Chris Lamour told Express.co.uk: “We can apply for launch licenses that almost no other country in the EU can do right now. “The UK is actually quite a big player in the generic space sector in terms of satellites and downstream services where we analyse the data in the satellites.”",10
2022-03-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1575307/Russia-news-Vladimir-putin-soviet-era-bio-weapons-laboratory-smallpox,Putin's sinister Soviet-era lab where Russia may store devastating cache of bio-weapons,"The State Centre for Research on Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo – known as “Vector” – is currently one of two sites in the world to hold stock of smallpox, a disease eradicated by humans. The laboratory was previously used under the orders of Mikhail Gorbachev to develop biological weaponry, according to the account of a former scientist. They said it worked on diseases that could liquefy human organs once exposed. Despite being a signatory of the Biological Weapons Convention, there are fears Russia continues to hold stocks of deadly viruses it could unleash on the population. Last year, a US State Department report claimed that Russia “maintains an offensive biological weapons program”. It comes at a particularly worrying time, as Vladimir Putin’s invading force in Ukraine appears to show no concern for civilian life. Vector has clearance to handle some of the world’s deadliest viruses, and has conducted research into avian flu, measles and rabies, according to the International Science and Technology Centre. It says it now focuses on research into virology, genetic engineering and biotechnology. The laboratory aims to develop “effective means and methods for the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of infectious diseases” and “the production of agents to counteract infectious pathogens”. However, the site has a much murkier past, as a hub for biological warfare research at the height of the Cold War. Established in 1974 by Biopreparat, the Soviet Union’s biological warfare agency, the centre was designated to conduct viral research. According to Ken Alibek, a microbiologist who worked there, Vector had stagnated while Russian efforts focussed on bacterial weaponry. However, in 1987, it was given a new lease of life by Gorbachev, he said, who gave a billion dollars to the research. Mr Alibek was tasked to go to the centre as the Soviet’s “military leaders had decided to concentrate on one of the toughest challenges of bioweaponeering – the transformation of viruses into weapons of war”, he wrote in his 1999 account. He said that during his time there, Vector had structures for experiments with contagious viruses including smallpox, Lassa fever and Machupo. There were also “explosive test chambers”, he claimed. Mr Alibek said that in December of 1990, “we tested a new smallpox weapon in aerosol form inside Vector's explosive chambers. It performed well. “We calculated that the production line in the newly constructed Building 15 at Koltsovo was capable of manufacturing between eighty and one hundred tons of smallpox a year. “Parallel to this, a group of arrogant young scientists at Vector were developing genetically altered strains of smallpox, which we soon hoped to include in this production process.” The former Soviet scientist recounted an incident in which a researcher accidentally injected Marburg into his thumb. Mr Alibek said the virus “appeared to liquefy body organs” and sent one man “mad after the organism chewed away his brain cells”. He noted: “Marburg quickly proved to have great potential.”",10

The first two components of the ISS come from the Russian modules ""Zarya"" and ""Zvezda"", which use their engines to raise the orbit of the ISS from time to time when the upper layers of the atmosphere begin slowing down the station. If Putin decided to decouple these two modules, experts warn that the ISS would only survive for a short period of time before it enters Earth’s atmosphere. In a series of tweets, Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos, threatened to allow the station to crash into Europe or the US. Raging against the sanctions imposed by the US, he said: “Do you want to destroy our cooperation on the ISS? “This is how you already do it by limiting exchanges between our cosmonaut and astronaut training centres. “Or do you want to manage the ISS yourself? “Maybe President Biden is off topic, so explain to him that the correction of the station's orbit, its avoidance of dangerous rendezvous with space garbage, with which your talented businessmen have polluted the near-Earth orbit, is produced exclusively by the engines of the Russian Progress MS cargo ships.” Space experts have long feared that the Russian conflict in Ukraine could break down the normal functioning of space research and that Putin could disable the International Space Station (ISS). There are also fears that Putin could withdraw Russia’s two permanent cosmonauts on the ISS and order them to return to earth. Mr Rogozin continued with his threats, adding: “If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the United States or Europe? “There is also the option of dropping the 500-ton structure to India and China. “Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? “The ISS does not fly over Russia, so all the risks are yours. Are you ready for them?” In a speech, he also took aim at the UK’s OneWeb project, warning that Roscosmos would not launch the satellites, which are part-owned by the British government. He demanded guarantees the satellite network will not be used for military purposes, or if the Government gives up its shares of the project. Roscosmos was scheduled to launch a batch of 36 OneWeb satellites on Friday 4 March on a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. He said: ""If by 21:30 on March 4 we do not receive confirmation, the rocket will be removed from the launchpad and the satellites will be sent to the assembly and test building.” According to Russian news agency TASS, Mr Rogozin added that the OneWeb contract had already been paid in full and Russia would refuse to return those funds.",10

This marks the company’s 10th such launch in as many week, as the two stage Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Florida, USA at 1545 GMT. The first stage of the rocket returned to Earth shortly after, allowing it be reused. Shortly before the Falcon 9 launch, SpaceX’s launch director issued a thinly veiled jab at Putin and Roscosmos, the Russian space agency. He said: ""Time to let the American broomstick fly and hear the sounds of freedom.” This remark is believed to be a response to Russian space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin, who promised to block the US from using Russian rocket engines after the US hit Moscow with tough sanctions. Speaking to state television, Mr Rogozin said: “In a situation like this we can’t supply the United States with our world’s best rocket engines. “Let them fly on something else, their broomsticks, I don’t know what.” As a response to this, SpaceX boss Elon Musk taunted Mr Rogozin’s announcement by posting a video of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket launching another 47 Starlink satellite into orbit. He also tweeted out the phrase “American broomsticks”. Since Putin invaded Ukraine two weeks ago, Mr Musk has found himself at loggerheads with the Russian administration. Responding to a call to aid from Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, Mr Musk activated his Starlink satellites over Ukraine. Starlink is a constellation of satellites created by SpaceX, with the aim of launching satellite internet coverage which will one day span the entire globe. SpaceX has permission from US authorities to send up 12,000 satellites in total, and as of the most recent update in February 2022, the beta internet service is available in 29 countries. Now, Mr Musk has activated the network in Ukraine, and pledged ""more terminals en route"". Tweeting Mr Musk, Mr Fedorov said: ""While you try to colonize Mars — Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space — Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people! ""We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand."" In addition to this, Mr Musk also announced on Thursday that SpaceX had updated its Starlink software “to reduce peak power consumption, so Starlink can be powered from car cigarette lighter”. He said: “Mobile roaming enabled, so phased array antenna can maintain signal while on moving vehicle.” In the past, Russia has provided US Space agencies with rocket engines that have been used for missions across the solar system. However, since Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the US has been gradually weaning itself off the Russian made RD-180 engines.",10

It's fitted with an ""earth bonding system"" to guard against electro-magnetic pulse from nuclear explosions. More than 1,500 bunkers like this were built in the UK during the 1960s. Each of the bunkers built measured and monitored radiation levels if a nuclear attack were to happen. Now one of the strutures, in a Norfolk feild, is on sale for £25,000, Mirror Online says. The structure, which has room for three people, hasn't been vandalised or experienced any flooding, the seller says. It is made of a solid piece of steel-reinforced concrete and reaches five metres beneath the ground.

2022-03-10,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1578351/uk-boris-johnson-shipbuilding-ont,Britain to inject £4billion into shipbuilding to ‘galvanise’ 150 naval and civil vessels,"The investment will “galvanise” shipyards and suppliers across the country, Downing Street said. Mr Johnson will make the announcement on Thursday while visiting the Merseyside dockyard, even though the fund for the new vessels was first announced in the 2020 Spending review and then the 2021 Autumn Budget. During his visit, Mr Johnson will meet apprentices and shipbuilding experts to understand how the UK Government investment is creating jobs and levelling up communities across the country. The UK’s historic shipbuilding industry currently supports 42,600 jobs across the UK, from Cornwall to Belfast and Govan, and contributes more than £2.8 billion to the economy. The Downing Street said that the multi-billion pound investment will galvanise and support shipyards and suppliers across the UK, delivering a pipeline of more than 150 new naval and civil vessels for the UK Government and Devolved Administrations over the next 30 years. Mr Johnson said: “Shipbuilding has been in our blood for centuries and I want to ensure it remains at the heart of British industry of generations to come. “The National Shipbuilding Strategy will transform this important and crucial industry, creating jobs, driving technology development and upskilling the shipbuilders of tomorrow, ensuring we are levelling up across every dock, port and shipyard in the UK. “This will ensure the UK is rightly seen as a shipbuilding power across the world.” The funding comes as the Ministry of Defence prepares to publish its refreshed National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSbS) on Thursday, which will outline how the Government will support UK shipyards across the nation to upskill workers, create high-quality jobs, drive technology development and ensure UK shipbuilding delivers on next-generation challenges. The strategy also builds on the UK’s increased support for European defence capability in the face of rising Russian aggression, with UK defence giant Babcock successfully being chosen as Poland’s preferred partner to deliver three new warships based on the UK’s Type 31 design. The Department for Transport, as part of the strategy, will invest £206 million in the UK Shipping Office for Reducing Emissions (UK-Shore). This investment will be used to “match fund research and development in zero-emission vessels and infrastructure and ensure our place as the global leader in green technology”, No 10 said. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “As shipbuilding tsar, I am proud to be announcing our new strategy, this is an exciting time to be involved in the sector. “With significant government investment, we will be levelling up across our shipbuilding, workforce, from shipyard to supplier, from procurement to designer, creating tens of thousands of new employment opportunities, boosting living standards and pay. “Our refreshed strategy will see the sector galvanised at a crucial time for our economy and see a vital part of British industry expand and flourish.”",10

Mr Vande Hei was set to return to Earth aboard a Russian spacecraft in three weeks' time. Mr Rogozin posted a threatening video on social media casting doubt over the astronaut's safety. He also warned that without the help from Russia to move the ISS away from space junk, the station would crash into the US. Former US astronaut Scott Kelly has reacted furiously to the threat. He told ABC News: ""I never thought I would hear anything so outrageous."" But Mr Kelly was not convinced about Russia's threat to the safety of Americans. He said: ""I think it is just a crazy threat. It is not really based on reality. ""We do have the ability to control the orbit of the space station independent of the Russian space agency, so I don't really see that happening."" The ISS is currently split into two sections. There is the Russian Orbital Segment controlled by Russia, and the United States Orbital Segment operated by the U.S. He said: ""I think it is just a crazy threat. It is not really based on reality. ""We do have the ability to control the orbit of the space station independent of the Russian space agency, so I don't really see that happening."" The ISS is currently split into two sections. There is the Russian Orbital Segment controlled by Russia, and the United States Orbital Segment operated by the U.S. But the recent feud just marks the latest in an ongoing back-and-forth between the two space collaborators, whose relations have soured over the crippling US sanctions slapped on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Last week, tensions soared between Mr Rogozin and Mr Kelly when the pair had a public spat on social media. Mr Rogozin shared a video showing Russian astronauts covering up British and American flags on Russia's Soyuz rocket. Mr Kelly responded to the post: ""Without those flags and the foreign exchange they bring in, your space program won't be worth a damn. Maybe you can find a job at McDonald's if McDonald's still exists in Russia."" His comment comes after McDonald's closed all its restaurants in Russia in response to its attack on Ukraine. : Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, has also announced that it will stop rocket engines to US companies. And last week, Russia refused to send OneWeb satellites into space despite a scheduled launch last week. The company, which is partly British owned as the Government holds a share, was relying on Russia as a launch partner to help complete its 648 satellite constellation.",10
2022-03-11,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1578189/nasa-news-astronaut-russia-us-space-race-moscow-ukraine-spt,NASA astronaut exposed anger over US-Russia space deals: ‘We don’t need them!’,"Russia is currently fighting a bloody conflict in Ukraine after it invaded its former Soviet neighbour last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion after claiming Russia was threatened by Ukraine and its bid to join the NATO military alliance. Now in its second week, the war has been condemned around the world and a string of countries, including the US and UK, have hit Russia with crippling economic sanctions. In one of the latest developments in the conflict, Russia has destroyed a children’s hospital in Mariupol. The southern Ukrainian city has been under a barrage of Russian attacks and faces shortages of food, water, electricity and gas. Prior to the invasion, Putin controversially described Ukrainians and Russians as “one people” last year as he sought to create a pretext to justify Russia’s unprovoked military intervention. The countries’ shared ancestry is not as simple as Putin made out, although the nations were both part of the Soviet Union, which was dissolved in 1991. For decades, the Soviet Union was engaged in the Cold War with its adversary, the US and its western allies. A key part of the geopolitical tension between the Soviets and the Americans was the space race, which lasted for years until Russia and the US struck major deals to work together in their space missions in the early Nineties. However, the two nations’ agreements were attacked by British-born astronaut, Michael Foale, who said in a throwback documentary: “We don’t need the Russians.” Mr Foale, who retired from NASA in 2013, spoke for the 2014 BBC film, ‘Cosmonauts: How Russia Won the Space Race’. The programme looked at a mission to fly a US space shuttle to Mir, the space station launched by the Soviet Union. Mr Foale said: “To be really honest I don’t think the Americans were really keen to be involved in Mir. “They were told to be involved by the White House. “I look back on it and it was a very positive thing, but I had to be told. “The general feeling amongst American engineers was, ‘Why is the money going to Russia? “‘It should come to our company so that we can build the space station on our own. We don’t need the Russians.” The Soviet Union’s space programme became the Russian space programme after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Following its dissolution, the nation could no longer afford to fund its space programme and its very existence was threatened. Russia needed money from the US to fund its space endeavours and ended up going into partnership with the Americans. The US had its own motives for making deals with the Russians, including its fears that unemployed Russian rocket engineers would go to work for countries such as Iran. Michael Foale was among those chosen to take part in a six-month mission alongside two Russian cosmonauts on Mir. He said: “I had already had three flights. I had done a spacewalk and was very excited about those flights. “But going to this fairly unknown can in space, cluttered, crowded with 13 years of equipment with two guys onboard I didn't know well, I was very apprehensive. “I thought of this as worse than boarding school.” Clips from ‘Cosmonauts: How Russia Won the Space Race’ are available on the BBC Four website.",10
2022-03-13,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1579110/elon-musk-spacex-jeff-bezos-oneweb-satellites-launch-putin-ban-russia,Musk tipped to launch Galileo replacement as Putin BANS UK and withholds funds,"Last week, Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, blocked the launch of a batch of OneWeb satellites in retaliation to the harsh sanctions imposed by the UK over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Roscosmos was scheduled to launch a batch of 36 OneWeb satellites on Friday, March 4, on a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, impounded the satellites and warned that OneWeb had two days to provide ""comprehensive legally binding"" guarantees that the satellites would not be used for military purposes. Speaking to Express.co.uk, David Morris, Conservative MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, warned that those probes will likely have to be scrapped. He said: “There's an assumption that the kits being held in Russia have been written off, we can't be using that now. “We've got to get some more built and send them up a different way. “The batteries are live now and they're draining out. “There's nothing we can do about it, so we're looking for new carriers now, so we can build some more and send them up.” According to Russian news agency TASS, Mr Rogozin added that the OneWeb contract had already been paid in full and Russia would not return those funds. He said: ""We received all the money for it for the manufacture of launch vehicles, upper-stages and for the necessary launch services. ""This money, due to force majeure circumstances that have arisen as a result of the aggressive policy of the West and the sanctions that are applied against Russia, this money will remain in Russia.” The UK’s OneWeb network, while currently carrying out different functions to Galileo, has been tipped to one day rival the EU’s network. It is a constellation of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that beam signals in 3G, 5G, LTE and Wi-Fi for high-speed Internet access to all corners of the globe. Mr Morris, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Space Committee, added that OneWeb is currently looking for new partners who can launch their satellites. He said: “OneWeb is looking at American carriers now, for obvious reasons.” Mr Morris hinted that the company is also considering space agencies in Japan and ESA in Europe. However, he added, those two options may prove difficult due to longer construction times and higher costs. Mr Morris continued: “One would assume OneWeb has been talking to all the American operators, whether that be NASA, Musk or even Bezos.” “That's what I've been told- they're trying to get operations up and running as quick as possible.” “It's just unfortunate what's going on.” Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezo’s Blue Origins are both rapidly expanding their space capabilities and the former already has a rival project to OneWeb in the form of Starlink. However, Mr Musk has already shown he is willing to help in the Ukraine crisis, bolstering the country's connectivity in the face of the Russian invasion. Earlier this week, SpaceX successfully launched the latest batch of Starlink internet satellites, carrying another 48 satellites to join the massive constellation that provides internet access around the world. Mr Musk may offer his services to further help the Ukrainian people stay connected.",10
2022-03-14,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1580351/nasa-emergency-russia-map-iss-crash-location-space-roscosmos,NASA emergency: Russia shares horrifying map of ISS crash zone: 'Price of sanctions',"The head of Rosocosmos, Russia's space agency, has warned that the station, which is also home to NASA astronauts, could be sent tumbling back to Earth after sanctions were placed on his country. NASA has scheduled the ISS to be decommissioned in 2031, but experts fear that its end may come sooner if the Kremlin decides to cut ties. The first two components of the ISS come from the Russian modules ""Zarya"" and ""Zvezda"", which use their engines to raise the orbit of the ISS from time to time when the upper layers of the atmosphere begin slowing down the station. If Vladimir Putin decided to decouple these two modules, some experts have warned that the ISS would only survive for a short period of time before it enters Earth’s atmosphere. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos stoked these fears on Twitter, sharing a horrifying map of where Russia could let the ISS crash. Describing the sanctions imposed by the West on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine as “illegal”, he said that the restrictions could disrupt the operations of Russian vessels servicing the ISS. In Telegram posts, Mr Rogozin listed the Russian segments' utilities, warning that it “provides duplication of the life support systems of the American segment”. These utilities include obtaining oxygen, removing carbon dioxide, and removing harmful impurities from the atmosphere. He added: “Also, Russian means provide backup of voice and telemetry communications of the American segment of the station with ground control points."" In one post he shared a map, saying it was “created by American astronomers arguing with me” but “just shows that Russia would be least endangered by the destruction of the ISS”. The map shows that the ISS could crash nearly anywhere on Earth, with only Russia, part of Northern Europe and Northern Canada being relatively safe. Mr Rogozin warned that western countries, “including those led by the dogs of war"" should reconsider “the price of the sanctions they initiated against Roscosmos”. He added: “The price of international space cooperation maniacally destroyed by the West. Crazy.” Mr Rogozin has previously threatened to crash the ISS before, even warning that US and Europe would be in peril. Raging against the sanctions imposed by the US, he said: “Do you want to destroy our cooperation on the ISS? “This is how you already do it by limiting exchanges between our cosmonaut and astronaut training centres. “If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the US or Europe? “There is also the option of dropping the 500-tonne structure to India and China. “Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? “The ISS does not fly over Russia, so all the risks are yours. Are you ready for them?” But former US astronaut Scott Kelly previously rubbished these claims. He told ABC News: ""I never thought I would hear anything so outrageous. ""I think it is just a crazy threat. It is not really based on reality. ""We do have the ability to control the orbit of the space station independent of the Russian space agency, so I don't really see that happening.""",10
2022-03-15,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1580884/putin-news-pandemic-more-lethal-covid-biological-weapon-ebola,Putin could create pandemic 'more lethal than Covid' with horror 'Ebola splice' bioweapon,"These concerns follow the repeated and seemingly unsubstantiated assertions of the Russian Foreign Ministry that the US is itself developing biological and chemical materials in Ukraine that could be used as the basis for a weapon. For some analysts — such as former army captain and MP Tobias Ellwood — the allegations represent a “despicable pretext” for Russia to justify its own biological or chemical attack, perhaps by claiming a “stray Ukrainian missile” compromised a US-run research facility. Meanwhile, chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon told the Scottish Sun that he fears Russia could seize one of the labs and use it as a base to unleash a bioweapon. According to Colonel de Bretton-Gordon, there is the risk that Russian leader Vladimir Putin could look to release a bioweapon “more lethal than Covid”. He said: ""If you splice Covid with something like Ebola, then you have a massive problem. ""The Russians could use a Ukrainian lab to release a bioweapon. ""It would be ideal — they could blame the US and Ukraine for the release of the pathogen. ""The chance to go into a lab would be gold dust for the Russians.” For internal medicine specialist and Fox News correspondent Dr Marc Siegel, two potential agents of concern when it comes to biological weapons are Variola major and Variola minor, the viruses that cause smallpox. The initial symptoms of smallpox include fever and vomiting, followed by mouth ulcers and a skin rash that progresses into fluid-filled blisters that leave scars after they heal. Thanks to the administration of vaccines, the virus is believed to have been eliminated out in the wild, with the last naturally-occurring case having been diagnosed in 1977 and the World Health Organization having declared smallpox eradicated in 1980. Prior to this, however, an estimated 15 million cases occurred each year — with around 30 percent proving fatal and mortality rates being the highest among babies. According to Dr Siegel, smallpox makes an ideal biological weapon agent because it is contagious, easy to spread in an aerosolized form and the immunity once afforded by the smallpox vaccine has long faded. In the event of a manufactured smallpox outbreak, renewal of the vaccination program would be required, along with isolation of infected individuals. In an opinion piece for The Hill, Dr Siegal wrote: “Smallpox was first infamously used as a biological weapon back in 1763, when British troops allegedly gave contaminated blankets to Native American Indians in order to cause an epidemic. “More than half of affected tribes were killed as a result, according to some historical accounts. “These days, the only remaining smallpox exists at the CDC in Atlanta and at the Russian State Center for Research on Virology and Biotechnology.” However, Dr Seigel explained, a greater risk likely comes not from naturally occurring bacteria or viruses but from the fruits of bioengineering. He said: “There are two areas of greatest worry, the first being that small sequences of DNA are available for purchase and could be fashioned into novel viruses or bacteria working from scratch in a laboratory. “Perhaps even more potentially problematic is the emergence and perfection of genetic editing tools, especially CRISPR Cas-9.” CRISPR Cas9 is a tool that enables biologists to make precision cuts on DNA, allowing for genes to be inserted, removed or replaced at a desired point to edit a genome. According to Dr Seigel, CRISPR Cas-9 has the potential to be used to edit existing viruses — such as, for example, influenza — in order to create new strains capable of resisting antiviral treatment or escaping current vaccines Such, he explained, “could rifle through a population lacking immunity and kill millions"". Even if Russia’s recent accusations are not part of a wider military-political gambit, the possibility also exists for a Ukrainian laboratory to be accidentally hit during the ongoing war. Ukraine is reported to have thousands of research facilities — and while none are believed to handle the world’s most deadly pathogens, two do handle high-risk agents and hundreds conduct research on moderate–risk bacteria and viruses. Last week, the World Health Organization recommended that Ukrainian biological research labs destroy any pathogens they had in containment to eliminate the risk of “any potential spills"" into the local population. There is a precedent for Russian military actions damaging scientific research infrastructure, with reports of shells having been fired at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, a radioactive waste facility near Kyiv, and the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, which housed both nuclear material and an experimental reactor. In fact, the last week has seen contact with the Chernobyl complex lost twice as a result of damage inflicted on the main power lines that supply the nuclear facility.",10

A spokesperson said: “As an intergovernmental organisation mandated to develop and implement space programmes in full respect with European values, we deeply deplore the human casualties and tragic consequences of the aggression towards Ukraine. “While recognising the impact on scientific exploration of space, ESA is fully aligned with the sanctions imposed on Russia by its Member States. ExoMars is a multi-mission programme whose goals beyond searching for traces of microbial life include investigating variations in the Martian geochemical and hydrological environment, studying trace gases and their sources, and demonstrating technologies that could one day be used in a mission to return samples from Mars back to Earth. The programme previously launched a mission in 2016, placing the atmosphere-studying Trace Gas Orbiter into Mars orbit and deploying the Schiaparelli Entry, Descent, and Landing Demonstrator Module (EDM). This craft was built to test technologies for future soft landings on Mars but crashed following a malfunction in its inertial measurement unit, which caused it to deploy its parachute and braking thrusters at the wrong time. The ESA is now considering how to move forward with a delayed implementation of the next mission in the ExoMars programme. ExoMars is not, however, the only ESA operation to have been impacted by Russia's actions in recent weeks. At the end of last month, Roscosmos announced that it would be suspending cooperation on space launches with Europe from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. In a post on Telegram, Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin wrote: ""In response to EU sanctions against our companies, Roscosmos is suspending cooperation with European partners on space launches from Kourou, and is withdrawing its technical staff [... from French Guiana.” Today, the ESA said that all missions presently scheduled for launch from the Guiana Space Centre by Russian Soyuz craft have been “put on hold”. Four international missions have been affected by this situation, including two for the EU’s “Galileo” global navigation satellite system. Another mission impacted was to deploy the Euclid space telescope next year, to map the geometry of the universe, while the fourth mission would have launched EarthCARE. The latter, due to blast off in March 2023, is a joint enterprise between the ESA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) that aims to observe and characterise aerosols and cloud formations in the Earth’s atmosphere as well the emission of infrared radiation and reflected solar radiation from our planet. The European Union previously played down the impact of Russia’s withdrawal, suggesting that the development would not impact the quality of the service provided by either Galileo or its Earth observation programme Copernicus. It is understood that the ESA Director General has also commenced an investigation assessing potential alternative launch services for both these missions, and the first uses of the ESA’s Ariane 6 single-use launch system. The ESA said: A robust launch manifest for ESA missions’ launch needs, including for spacecraft originally planned for launch by Soyuz from Kourou, will be submitted to Member States.” Similar sentiments were expressed by EU Commissioner Thierry Breton at the time of Russia’s withdrawal from the Guiana Space Centre. He said: ""We will take all necessary decisions in time to work on the development of the second generation of these two sovereign spacial infrastructures. ""We are also prepared to act determinedly together with the member states to protect these critical infrastructures in case of an attack, and to continue the development of Ariane 6 and VegaC to guarantee the strategic autonomy with regard to carrier rockets."" The ESA today also stressed that the International Space Station programme is continuing “to operate nominally” and efforts are being made to ensure the ongoing safety of both the ongoing missions and the crew.",10

Speaking on Sputnik radio on Monday, Dmitry Rogozin, director general of Russia's Roscosmos space agency, announced the country's planned Russian Orbital Service Station (ROSS) would be “an applied-military station”. Mr Rogozin, who is an outspoken supporter of Putin's regime and of Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, stated this announcement was a retaliation to a “hostile world”, Russian news agency TASS stated. The General Director also added only Russian astronauts would be allowed on the station, which differs from the International Space Station which is a collaboration with several countries, including Russia. Under Mr Rogozin’s leadership, Roscosmos has shifted towards Russian independence in space, experts state. However, news of such an independent Russian space station amid the heavy economic sanctions has caused Western experts to doubt the plausibility. Greg Autry, professor of space leadership at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, Arizona State University stated Russia does not have the financial capabilities for such an endeavour. He told Newsweek: “Russia simply cannot afford a human space program, even before the economic collapse the recent sanctions have induced. “They were already clearly in decay and part of their bad attitude is based on the US no longer funding their program for them.” Meanwhile, Julie Patarin-Jossec, a politics lecturer at Saint Petersburg State University and expert in Russian and Soviet space politics, echoed this statement. She told Newsweek: “In practice, I would say we have some time before starting to worry, considering how fast Russian space station modules are getting built. “For instance, the latest Russian ISS module, Nauka, experienced a decade delay due to the various issues the Russian space industry has been struggling with since the dismantlement of the USSR: interruption of part of the production line, corruption, lack of funding, and loss of expertise and qualification in high technology. “Rogozin mentioned that the first module of a new, fully Russian station could be launched in 2026. “Considering that Roscosmos only commissioned a feasibility study to Energia, its main constructor, in late 2021 for this new space station, and considering the time and resources this requires, this timeline doesn't seem plausible.” She continued: “Most of his decisions are not supported either by some of his executive directors, cosmonauts who have been trained with international astronauts and in ISS partners' training facilities for the past 20 years, nor by a large portion of engineers involved at various scales of the Russian space program.”",10
2022-03-18,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1582625/China-military-aid-Russian-artificial-intelligence-Ukraine-war-news,China could supply Russia with 'microchips and semiconductors' in Ukraine conflict,"Fears over Beijing’s possible involvement have come after reports Russia had asked for military equipment, including drones, to make up for unexpected heavy losses. AI has changed the face of warfare by making missiles so technologically advanced they can target specific objects without any human involvement. With the use of AI, weapons of war can be fully autonomous and use facial recognition and data collection to specifically target certain people and areas. China is a world leader in the field and seeks to leverage AI technology to become a leading military. Vladimir Putin was previously reported saying whoever becomes the leader in AI will be the ruler of the world. The Russian leader also predicted that future wars would be fought by countries using drones. According to the Associated Press, he said: “When one party's drones are destroyed by drones of another, it will have no other choice but to surrender"". It comes amid Putin's apparent request for military aid from China. US officials recently claimed Moscow had asked for equipment and other assistance from Beijing but it's not known specifically what was requested. Samuel Bendett, an expert on Russia's AI and military, told Express.co.uk that China's ""initial assistance may come in the form of microchips and semiconductors"". ""This technology can be used in different types of military systems and weapons, from missiles, to warheads, to computers and automated control systems, to different types of sensors that identify and classify targets"". Elon Musk, along with 116 other technology leaders previously sent a petition to the United Nations calling for new regulations on how AI weapons are developed. The group feared the introduction of autonomous technology would create a “third revolution in warfare”, following the development of gunpowder and nuclear weapons. Mr Bendett added: ""Chinese civilian AI investments in Russia were growing prior to the war, and may continue to grow, but the true extent of Chinese military high-tech assistance is hard to estimate at this point, considering how opaque Russian Ministry of Defence was about actual details about their military weapons"". The AI expert also said we could see more evidence of deepfakes being used by Russia similar to the recent fake video of President Zelensky appearing to tell Ukrainians to put down their weapons and surrender. In the report he co-authored, Mr Bendett established there were more than 150 Russian AI-enabled military systems, including autonomous weapons that operate in the air, underwater and on land. One example is the Poseidon, developed by Russia, which is an autonomous vehicle resembling a torpedo that is designed to deliver a retaliatory nuclear strike. The country also has KUB-BLA drones, known as 'suicide drones', that can hit targets by following a pre-programmed set of coordinates and self destruct when it hits its target. However, the expert said that in this war, AI has primarily been used for data collection and analysis so far and has also been used by Ukrainians. Clearview AI recently offered its services to Ukraine which helps by using facial recognition to help the Ukrainians uncover Russian infiltrators, fight misinformation and identify the dead.",10

Footage showed the three men wearing bright yellow suits when they reached the space station. The suits had bright blue features, with the outfits sporting the colours of the Ukrainian flag. Earlier footage of the astronauts taken as their capsule prepared to dock showed them wearing blue flight suits, the Daily Mail reported. It has raised speculation over whether their change of uniform was intended to send a message about the conflict in Ukraine. Oleg Artmyev, the mission commander, was asked about the suits when the three astronauts were able to speak to their families from the space station. He said that every crew chooses its own flight suits, meaning they are not the same. He said the choice of yellow was because the team had a lot of yellow material they had to use. Mr Artmyev said: “It became our turn to pick a colour. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that's why we had to wear yellow.” He did not indicate whether the outfits were intended to send a message about the conflict in Ukraine, now in its fourth week. Many people have worn the colours of the Ukrainian flag since Russia invaded its neighbour on February 24 to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The team were the first new arrivals at the ISS since the Russian invasion of Ukraine over three weeks ago. Mr Artmyev led the mission alongside Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov. The crew blasted off from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan at 8.55pm on Friday. They joined two other Russians, four Americans and a German at the station. The war in Ukraine has also sparked tension in space, with many spacecraft launches cancelled and contracts between countries cancelled since the invasion. Dmitry Rogozin, head of Russia's space energy Roscosmos, warned last week that the US would have to use “broomsticks” to fly into space after Russia said it would stop supplying rocket engines to companies in the US. There are fears that Russia is prepared to jeopardise space exploration over the mounting geopolitical tensions. Nasa administrator Bill Nelson played down Mr Rogozin’s comments. He said: “That’s just Dmitry Rogozin. He spouts off every now and then. But at the end of the day, he’s worked with us. “The other people that work in the Russian civilian space program, they’re professional. They don’t miss a beat with us, American astronauts and American mission control. Despite all of that, up in space, we can have a cooperation with our Russian friends, our colleagues.” US astronaut Mark Vande Hei is due to leave the space station along with two of the Russian cosmonauts on March 30. Another three Nasa astronauts are set to blast off for the station in April, along with another Italian astronaut.",10

They docked at the ISS after flying on a rocket for three-hour, having blasted off from a Russian spaceport in Kazakhstan. The new additions joined two other Russians, four Americans and a German on the space station. Video footage live-streamed by NASA and Russian space agency Roscosmos shows the cosmonauts entering the ISS sporting bright yellow jumpsuits with blue patches. But Russia rejects that this has any connection to the Ukrainian flag, despite those being the colours that it consists of. Roscosmos said that ""sometimes, yellow is just yellow"". The usual Russian space outfit is marked by a plain blue. Mr Artemyev was asked about the choice of colour in a live-streamed press conference, who appeared to downplay the dress choice as a matter of convenience rather than a political statement. He responded: ""It became our turn to pick a colour. ""We had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. ""That's why we had to wear yellow."" Since Putin first launch the invasion, the Ukrainian flag and its colours have become synonymous with a sign of solidarity with the country. Some Russians are now starting to openly discredit Putin's war. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One television, stormed onto the set of the Vremya evening news last Monday, shouting: ""Stop the war. No to war. “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” This also comes after Russia's partnership with the West in space has come under the microscope as tensions soared down below. Earlier this month, Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin said the 500-tone ISS could ""fall"" or ""land"" as a result of Western sanctions. He claimed that the sanctions could disrupt the operation of Russian vessels servicing the ISS, which could cause the Russian segment of the orbiting station to ""fall down into the sea or onto land"". And tensions also skyrocketed when Russia blocked the launch of 36 British satellites, owned by company OneWeb, again in response to Western sanctions. Mr Rogozin impounded the satellites and told Britain it would not launch them unless the sanctions were lifted. He tweeted a video, with the caption which appeared to show Russian workers covering up the flags of a number of countries that were displayed on the rocket. Mr Rogozin wrote in the tweet: “The launchers at Baikonur decided that without the flags of some countries, our rocket would look more beautiful.” But now, OneWeb has banned all future Russian launches and has instead teamed up with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which will complete the first OneWeb launch in 2022.",10

The consortium is a group of over 250 leading companies and Trade Unions from across the nuclear supply chain. Sizewell C is the proposed nuclear project poised to be the UK's next major plant. Sheffield Forgemasters is set to provide a variety of crucial components to the project, including nuclear grade steel castings and forgings. The agreement also signals the potential longer-term opportunities for collaboration on future European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) projects in Britain. it builds on the back of three former agreements signed by the Sizewell C Consortium with Wales, the North of England and East of England. It is set to bring a £7.2billion boost to the supply chain and create 70,000 job opportunities throughout the construction of Sizewell C. David Bond, CEO of Sheffield Forgemasters, commented: “Joining the Sizewell C Consortium marks a positive step forward for our business and unites two strategically significant industries at the forefront of driving clean energy growth opportunities for Britain. ""We will be manufacturing qualification components in order to join the supply chain for Sizewell C, with the eventual aim, to supply components into the build. ""If we can secure supply into the UK’s nuclear fleet, we can continue to invest in our workforce, provide local high-skilled job opportunities, and re-shore nuclear manufacturing for the UK fleet.” Cameron Gilmour, Spokesperson for the Sizewell C Consortium, commented: “We are delighted to welcome Sheffield Forgemasters into the Sizewell C Consortium. ""With a long history of supporting British infrastructure builds, their knowledge and expertise will be valuable in driving forward our ability to deliver new large-scale nuclear, with Sizewell C as the next project in line. "" This comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the UK will receive up to 25 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, as it looks to slash ties with foreign importers like Russia. On Monday, Mr Johnson met executives from major nuclear utilities and technology companies including Rolls-Royce, France’s EDF, and the Westinghouse and Bechtel from the US, to discuss how Britain can accelerate the rollout of the energy source. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said: “Accelerating nuclear projects is absolutely essential to keep energy costs down, cut expensive gas imports and strengthen our energy security as we move towards net zero. “That means urgently investing in a fleet of large and small nuclear stations, alongside renewable investment, to deliver the clean, sovereign power we need.” This announcement will also come as a lifeline as the UK's existing nuclear fleet has been declining. Hunterston B in Scotland shut down earlier this year, while Hinkley Point B in Somerset is scheduled to be closer later this year.",10
2022-03-28,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1587611/ukraine-researchers-britain-putin-war-fellowship-programme,UK to rescue! Ukrainian researchers receive £3m to come and study in Britain,"Russia’s war in Ukraine has sparked a refugee crisis, with around 3.9 million people thought to have fled their homeland so far, according to some estimates. For Ukrainians who had been involved in academic research, it may have appeared as though their projects were in tatters. But now, the Government has handed them a £3million lifeline by setting up an exciting new fund. The support package, forming the Researchers at Risk Fellowship Programme, was announced on Sunday, March 27. And not only will it support Ukrainian researchers who have escaped the conflict, but also those who are in the UK and cannot go back home. Science Minister George Freeman wrote on Twitter: “Science is a force for good in the world. “That’s why as well as our Russia sanctions, I’m announcing £3million support for Ukrainian researchers fleeing the conflict (as well as those already in the UK but unable to return home).” The UK’s national academies and the Council for At-Risk Academics will deliver the funding along with the Nuffield Foundation, which is contributing £500,000. As well as providing a salary and accounting for research, the Fellowships will also cover the researchers’ living costs for up to two years. The funds can be accessed across all disciplines for postdoctoral researchers. The Fellowship can also be accessed by those with equivalent experience to help support Ukraine’s research landscape. Mr Freeman added: “The UK has a proud history of world class science, underpinned by a commitment to freedom and sanctuary for those fleeing tyranny. “Today we are taking a stand for science as a force for good and supporting Ukrainian researchers to come to the UK. “We will always support science where it is working to further international knowledge and discovery and to find solutions with global benefit, but it is only right that we take a stand against the Kremlin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and the deplorable Putin regime.” The Government has also stressed that it will not provide funding to any new collaborative projects with Russia. This is yet another strategy to cripple the Russian state, and individuals and organisations linked to the Kremlin. It also made clear that this measure is not aimed at individual Russian researchers and students, many of whom oppose the invasion of Ukraine. Now, universities across the country have started to welcome Ukrainian students and are hoping to partner with institutions to provide remote learning opportunities. Minister for Higher and Further Education Michelle Donelan said: “Our world-leading universities have always been underpinned by the core values of freedom and liberty, which is why I know they will support us now in taking action against the Russian regime and their illegal invasion of Ukraine. “We are asking universities that have not yet done so to review any financial or academic research ties with Russia given the horrors the Kremlin is inflicting on the Ukrainian people.” The UK Government is not alone in its efforts to help rescue Ukraine’s science community. ScienceForUkraine is a community group of volunteer students and research scientists from institutions in Europe and around the world. The group consists of a number of universities that have been providing free accommodation to students and has been offering full-time and part-time positions to researchers.",10
2022-03-30,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1588368/soyuz-rocket-russia-vladimir-putin-spy-satellite-ukraine-news-spt,Russia's top secret spy mission aboard Soyuz rocket laid bare,"Record-breaking NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is due to return to Earth from the International Space Station on Wednesday aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket with two Russian astronauts. Mr Vande Hei’s return has been an ongoing source of disagreement in recent weeks, as relations between Russia and the US sour after the invasion of Ukraine. Mr Vande Hei’s stay on the ISS was extended in September to accommodate a select few visiting tourists and Russian film crews sent into space at the end of last year. Things took a turn earlier this month when RIA Novosti, a Russian state broadcaster, shared a satirical video depicting Mr Vande Hei’s Russian colleagues leaving him behind on the ISS. After RIA Novosti described the video as a joke, Russia formally denied the speculation, saying all three will return as scheduled on March 30. Mr Vande Hei and his crewmates boarded the Soyuz at around 5am on Wednesday morning, with departure due around 8:20am. As of last year, the Soyuz is the most frequently used launch vehicle in the world, with over 1,900 flights since its debut in 1966. The Soyuz was designed for the Soviet space program in the Sixties, and served as the only means to ferry crew to or from the ISS between 2011 and 2020. Earlier this year, Russia launched a top secret spy mission aboard a Soyuz rocket. Lift-off of the Soyuz-2.1a rocket occurred at 7am on February 5 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Plesetsk, located about 500 miles (800 kilometres) north of Moscow, has been used as a launch site for multiple rocket types since the dawn of the space race. US military tracking data confirmed the successful launch of the Soyuz, indicating that it had reached an unusual orbit more than 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometres) above Earth, an altitude that allows it to circle the planet every 127 minutes. Russian officials officially named the satellite Kosmos 2553, in line with Moscow’s naming scheme for military spacecraft. The Kremlin said Kosmos 2553 is “equipped with newly developed on-board instruments”. Beyond this, however, very little is known. Due to the classified nature of the mission, Everyday Astronaut reports it “cannot be specified” exactly where the satellite went, and nothing is known about the characteristics of the satellite besides the limited information provided by Russia’s defence ministry. According to Spaceflight Now, analysts believe Kosmos 2553 could be an imaging satellite for the Russian military — particularly pertinent given that Putin invaded Ukraine less than three weeks after the rocket launched. It had been speculated that it was the first in a new series of radar reconnaissance satellites called Neitron. Radar satellites are capable of collecting all-weather satellite images during both the day and night. Neitron had initially been due to launch in late 2018, but this was delayed, reportedly due to technical issues. Russian forces have launched a number of new satellites in recent years, including Pion-NKS and Lotos satellites — capable of intercepting radio transmissions and helping Russian intelligence locate foreign shipping traffic, including naval forces. US officials also believe Russian military spacecraft have tested anti-satellite capabilities in orbit. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has proved a hammer blow to the country’s space ambitions, however. Moscow’s space chief Dmitry Rogozin admitted earlier this month that his country will “lose several years” in its bid to put a rover on Mars after the European Space Agency suspended work with Russia on its upcoming ExoMars mission. Concerns also remain about the ongoing safety of the ISS, given that Russia controls some crucial aspects of the space station’s propulsion control systems, which prevent it from being pulled into the Earth’s atmosphere and slowly burning up. Despite ongoing concerns, however, ISS crew showed their unity this week ahead of the Soyuz’s scheduled return on Wednesday. They conducted a change of command ceremony, with former commander Anton Shkaperlov handing over the ropes to NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn. Mr Shkaperlov hinted at the geopolitical tensions on Earth during the ceremony, saying: “I [am] proud I was the commander of this excellent crew. “People have problems on Earth. On orbit... we are one crew.”",10

This comes as Russian naval activity has reportedly reached ""Cold War levels"" in the North Atlantic. The P-8 Maritime Patrol planes, deployed as part of the UK's new Arctic Strategy, are designed to ""hunt"" submarines. The planes use specialist surveillance technology to locate submarines, including radar and an acoustic sensor system, before alerting NATO warships. They are also armed with torpedoes for engaging sub-surface targets. The Arctic Strategy, which sets out the country's military operations in the region for the next decade, was published during Defence Secretary Ben Wallace's trip to Norway. Mr Wallace visited the country to observe Exercise Cold Response, a military exercise involving 30,000 NATO troops - the biggest cold-weather exercise in three decades. The strategy points to new threats and challenges triggered by melting Arctic ice, which has caused Russia to feel ""sensitive to the risks associated with reduced sea ice cover on its northern flank"". It added that Russia views the Arctic as being ""strategically important"". The report notes that the country now conducts as many submarine patrols as the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Since 2016, Russia has also reopened two Arctic naval bases, Franz Josef Land and Kotelny Island. The strategy said: ""While this activity is not in and of itself a breach of international law, it presents challenges which impact upon the interests of the UK, our Allies and partners, and the inhabitants of the Arctic, and to which we must be vigilant and prepared to respond"". A defence source told the Telegraph that the militarization of the Arctic was led by Russia, claiming that the UK and NATO intervened to maintain international law. Russia launched its own Arctic Strategy in 2008. The last of the P-8 planes were delivered to RAF Lossiemouth in January, replacing the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft which was decommissioned in 2010. The Arctic Strategy also outlined plans for ""cold weather warfare training"" in countries such as Norway and the United States. It said: ""In addition to cold weather warfare training in Norway, the UK will seek to take advantage of further invitations and conduct cold-weather training in Canada, Finland and the United States on a regular basis. ""In support of these capabilities, UK Defence will examine options to bolster its cold-weather capability to ensure that Arctic-appropriate equipment, activity, environmental support and infrastructure are all developed and maintained."" In a statement, Ben Wallace also noted the increasing military capabilities of China in the Arctic. He said: ""Melting sea ice in the Arctic brings both opportunities and threats, with Russia taking an increasingly militarized approach to the region and China supporting its proposed Polar Silk Road with a range of infrastructure and capabilities with dual-use potential. ""As the region becomes increasingly accessible, threats from elsewhere around the globe could spill over into the Arctic.""",10

2022-04-06,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1591937/joe-biden-soaring-tensions-russia-china-hypersonic-missile-test-darpa-air-force,Biden risks soaring tensions with Russia and China after secret hypersonic missile test,"Hypersonic objects are those that travel in excess of five times the speed of sound, or 3,806mph. While the ability to travel and manoeuvre at these speeds presents a significant engineering challenge — as the physical properties of the airflow around the object in question change significantly while the heat generated from friction and air resistance rises — such potentially allows missiles to evade present-day air defences and anti-ballistic missile systems. The sheer speed of such hypersonic missiles also makes them both better able to penetrate heavily shielded targets and capable of destroying targets with their kinetic energy alone, without even factoring in a payload of high explosives. America’s most recent hypersonic missile test was conducted by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the US Air Force — and utilised a design developed by the aerospace firm Lockheed Martin. During the test, the so-called Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) was released from a B-52 bomber before being boosted to above the speed of sound in order to ignite its Aerojet Rocketdyne scramjet engine. A scramjet, short for “supersonic-combustion ramjet”, is a type of jet engine with no major moving parts in which the craft’s forward motion draws in air into an intake at speeds greater than the speed of sound, compresses it, and then injects and combusts fuel to provide thrust. Having fired its scramjet, DARPA said, the HAWC missile rapidly accelerated to hypersonic speeds — that is, greater than five times the speed of sound — and travelled for more than 345 miles, reaching altitudes of greater than 65,000 feet above sea level. According to DARPA, this is the second successful test flight in their HAWC programme, with a different design from another contractor having also achieved hypersonic flight last September. According to CNN, the latest test took place in mid-March. DARPA HAWC programme manager Andrew Knoedler said that hypersonic weapons “offer the potential for military operations from longer ranges with shorter response times and enhanced effectiveness compared to current military systems. “Such systems could provide a significant payoff for future US offensive strike operations, particularly as adversaries’ capabilities advance. “This Lockheed Martin HAWC flight test successfully demonstrated a second design that will allow our warfighters to competitively select the right capabilities to dominate the battlefield. “These achievements increase the level of technical maturity for transitioning HAWC to a service programme of record.” “We are still analysing flight test data, but are confident that we will provide the US Air Force and Navy with excellent options to diversify the technology available for their future missions.” The announcement comes less than three weeks after Russia used its own hypersonic “Kinzhal” missiles — the name translates to “dagger” — outside of its own borders for the first time. The advanced weapons were used to destroy an underground weapons depot in the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, alongside a fuel depot in the city of Mykolaiv. First publicly unveiled by Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 1, 2018, the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched hypersonic missile system — which he called “the ideal weapon” — is said to have a maximum operating range of 1,800 miles. Prior to the missile’s release, its carrying aircraft accelerates to its maximum possible speed, which in the case of the MiG-31K fighter jet is 1,864 miles per hour. After disconnecting from the aircraft, the missile fires up its solid-propellant-driven engine and accelerates to some 10–12 times the speed of sound — around 7,670–9,200mph. It is believed that the Kinzhal was developed by building on the aero-ballistic missile of Russia’s ground-based Iskander-M tactical missile system, which has an operational range of around 311 miles. Each Kh-47M2 customarily carries a payload of around 1,000 pounds of a high-explosive warhead — however, they can also be armed with a similarly-sized nuclear weapon that explodes with the force of 100,000–500,000 tonnes’ worth of trinitrotoluene (TNT). According to TASS, Kinzhal missiles have been in deployment as part of “experimental combat duty” since at least the December of 2017. Some commentators have expressed concern over the timing of the US’s hypersonic test announcement, suggesting that it risks escalating global tensions. In fact, early last month, the US delayed and then cancelled a ballistic missile test on very similar grounds — although Pentagon press secretary John Kirby noted that this decision was motivated by a desire to demonstrate that America is “a responsible nuclear power”. According to CNN, the decision to delay the announcement of the successful test by a couple of weeks was made based on the fact that US President Joe Biden was about to make a trip to Europe. Vox foreign policy writer Jonathan Guyer tweeted: “All the world's most important arms-control treaties are falling apart, while the US, Russia, and China are launching hypersonic missiles. “Where is the effort to regulate super-fast weapons?” Others, in contrast, saw the development as having the potential to address the ongoing situation around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Former Bulgarian foreign minister Dr Solomon Passy said: “The US tested a hypersonic missile in mid-March but kept it quiet to avoid escalating tensions with Russia. “Tensions with Russia will be calmed down only by a much stronger NATO presence in the Black Sea.”",10

The three cosmonauts, Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov, appeared to be protesting against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine less than a month before. However, these cosmonauts were actually all graduates of Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which has yellow and blue in its emblem, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei confirmed. Mr Vande Hei is an American astronaut who spent a record-breaking 355 days in space and returned to eath with two cosmonauts on board a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. In a press conference, he said that the cosmonauts were surprised by the controversy and were caught off guard. He said: ""All three of them happened to be associated with the same university, and I think they were kind of blindsided by it.” Mr Vande Hei also added that he would discuss the war in Ukraine with his fellow Russian crewmates. He said: ""They weren't very long discussions, but I did ask them how they were feeling and sometimes asked pointed questions, but our focus was on our mission together."" When the controversy first broke out, Russia was scrambling to give explanations as to why the cosmonauts were wearing outfits resembling Ukraine. But Russia rejects that this has any connection to the Ukrainian flag, despite those being the colours that it consists of. Roscosmos said that ""sometimes, yellow is just yellow"".

This comes as Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, the Russian Space Agency threatened to leave the ISS. In a furious Twitter thread, he announced that Russia would no longer cooperate with Western countries on board the ISS until the sanctions are lifted. Mr Rogozin claimed that the sanctions were intended to “kill the Russian economy and plunge our people into despair and hunger, to get our country on its knees”. He also added that the Western sanctions “won’t succeed in it, but the intentions are clear”. He continued: “That’s why I believe that the restoration of normal relations between the partners at the International Space Station (ISS) and other projects is possible only with full and unconditional removal of illegal sanctions.” Roscosmos ending its cooperation onboard the ISS sounds alarm bells for space experts, as Russian made modules constitute a critical part of the 400-tonne space station, without which the ISS could crash down to Earth in an uncontrolled manner.",10

The plan was last night being reviewed by ministers, with Defence Secretary BenWallace understood to be very supportive of the concept. Around 50 to 70 Ukrainian soldiers are being transported by train to military hospitals every day. Most are believed to be suffering from blast injuries, including serious head injuries and lost limbs. Though major hospitals, such as the ones in Dnipro, Mariupol, and Kyiv, have facilities for complex surgeries, providing cutting-edge prosthetics is much more challenging. Stanford Hall, Leicestershire, is an award-winning centre used in the rehabilitation and therapy of soldiers for a wide range of conditions, including brain and spinal injuries, neurological disorders and amputations. Its cutting-edge technology means it offers one of only five Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environments (Caren) in the world and the only one in Europe. The 360-acre estate is four times the size of Headley Court, which it replaced in 2019. It was gifted to the nation by the Duke of Westminster, who spent 40 years as an Army reservist. It would be technically possible to evacuate Ukrainian soldiers to Britain today, by sending them by train to Poland from where they could be airlifted by RAF C-17 transport planes. But sources have said any invitation would likely be delayed until the tempo of operations is ""more favourable"". Last night a senior military source said: ""Stanford Hall is a centre of medical excellence and would be able to provide critical care and rehabilitation to Ukrainian soldiers who need support. This sort of care will help them adjust to their future lives and has been highly successful in the UK. ""A plan is in place, which needs to be signed off by the Defence Secretary, but from what I am told he is supportive.""",10

""This recognises our place in the future and our continued developments. ""This means we will reach all of our aims, I have no doubt we will do this.

""All the achievements are very inspirational and our ancestors inspire us to move forward despite all the difficulties. ""We will continue to develop transport planes and we will continue our Moon programme. ""We must respond successfully to all the challenges in space."" The Russian leader was referring to the Venera programme that was developed by the Soviet Union between 1961 and 1984 to gather information about the planet. 10 probes successfully landed on the surface of the planet, including the two Vega program and Venera-Halley probes, while thirteen probes successfully entered the Venusian atmosphere.

For missiles — such as those recently deployed by Russia against Ukraine or those being tested by the US — achieving such velocities can allow them to evade present-day air defences and anti-ballistic missile systems. It also makes them better able to penetrate heavily shielded structures and capable of destroying targets by means of kinetic energy alone, without even factoring in a payload of high explosives. However, the ability to travel and manoeuvre at hypersonic speeds presents significant and varied engineering challenges. When a missile or aircraft breaks through the sound barrier, it starts generating a shock wave that is hotter, denser and higher in pressure than the surrounding air. And in the hypersonic regime, air friction reaches such magnitudes that it would begin to melt parts of a conventional commercial aircraft. On top of all this, aerospace engineers must consider not only how air flows around the craft or weapon in question, but also how it behaves as it moves through the engines and interacts with fuel. Conventional, “air-breathing” jet engines like those seen in large passenger aircraft, actively draw in and compress oxygen to allow them to burn fuel as they fly — for example, through rotating fan blades. Above three times the speed of sound, however, this becomes unnecessary, as the passage of the jet or weapon through the air achieves this by itself. So-called ramjet and scramjet engines that take advantage of this principle can achieve levels of fuel efficiency that, for comparison, rockets can not. However, fluid dynamics models needed to develop such engines by predicting how they will respond to the fluid forces around and within them are inherently thorny. Mechanical engineer Dr Sibendu Som of the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory’s Center for Advanced Propulsion and Power Research, said: “The chemistry and turbulence interactions are so complex in these engines. “Scientists have needed to develop advanced combustion models and computational fluid dynamics codes to accurately and efficiently describe the combustion physics.” NASA, for example, has developed a hypersonic computational fluid dynamics code dubbed VULCAN-CFD, named after the Roman god of fire, that simulates how combustion behaves in turbulent airflows of engines at sub-, super- and hypersonic speeds. The software works by representing burning fuel in massive, multidimensional tables, where each entry stores a single, one-dimensional snapshot of flame dubbed a “flamelets”. The challenge with the approach, however, is that the sheer size of these datasets means that they require an enormous amount of computer memory to process. To address this issue, Dr Som and his colleagues at Argonne have teamed up with NASA to apply machine learning techniques to help reduce the computational requirements. Artificial neural networks can derive insights from data in much the same way that human brains can. Accordingly, by training it on a flamelet table, the neural network was able to glean shortcuts to the “answers” about how combustion behaves within super- and hypersonic engines. The team had previously used the same approach in studies looking instead at subsonic applications. Argonne team member Dr Sinan Demir said: “Working with NASA gave us the opportunity to integrate our novel developments in a state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics code.” This, he added, will help “further improve the developments for more efficient design and optimization of hypersonic jets.” Dr Demir added: “The partnership between Argonne and NASA is valuable because our models and software can be applied effectively to theirs.” ​“It’s a way to do high-speed propulsion computational fluid dynamics simulations differently.” The full findings of the study were presented at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’ SciTech Forum and Exposition earlier this year.",10

Ukrainian troops shot down the Sukhoi Su-35S using short-range missiles two weeks ago. Specialists with the Ukrainian Air Force were able to retrieve vital and hitherto classified elements from its burnt-out remains and informed British intelligence. The systems were transported to the Government’s Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down, in Wiltshire, where boffins, joined by two experts from the US Air Force, have spent ten days examining them. The initial assessment was deemed so promising that the systems have now been flown to Nevada, USA, for more forensic examination. Dubbed “Flanker” by Nato, the fighter jet was conducting a so-called Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) operation when it was unexpectedly shot down near Izium, some 75 miles from Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine on April 3. Its pilot was captured after safely ejecting. The Flanker is Russia’s equivalent to the F-35 fifth generation multirole fighter which is currently used by the RAF and 14 other Nato nations - though it does not possess stealth technology. And the prospect of Nato powers examining its sophisticated inner workings will cause consternation among air force chiefs in Russia, which operates 47 of them. It has also sent shockwaves in China which, as Russia’s biggest defence partner, now boasts the world’s second largest fleet having signed a $2bn deal for 24 of the fighters in 2015. Though the aircraft was heavily-damaged, sources say enough remained of the targeting system for detailed analysis. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode or visit InYourArea This will be made easier by the discovery that the system - which, on paper, boasts the capability of spotting Nato's stealth aircraft 350 miles away - has many similarities to the F-35s, making it more easy to fully explore. The capture of tech is proving to be a spectacular own-goal for premier Vladimir Putin following the disastrous performance of Russian forces in the seven-week war. Not only can it leave systems vulnerable to Nato counter-measures, but so too could it jeopardise future arms sales to supplicant countries - a vital revenue stream for cash-starved Russia. Scientists at the DSTL are also examining remains of a T-90 - Russia’s most advanced battle tank, which fitted with an explosive reactive armour and a unique defensive Shtora-1 aids system- a Buk missile system, used to down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in 2014, and a Tor surface to air missile system. India operates 2,000 T-90s of different variants as well as the Buk, while Iran used a Tor to shoot down Ukrainian flight 752 in January 2020. But it is the £50m fighter jet which was the cause of most excitement. Justin Bronk, air power and technology expert at the RUSI think tank, said: “ Any potential opportunity to examine the radar components or electronic warfare pods on the downed SU-35 would be valuable as, even damaged, such components can confirm or undermine existing intelligence assessments about how they work.” Prof Alessio Patalano of the Department of War Studies at King’s College, London, said:""While this war has been predominantly a land campaign which has focussed on the least advanced and modernised elements of Russia’s military, we need to remember that Russia still has capabilities that contain the technological edge of great interest to the West. “The SU-35S isn’t a simple drone - it is a sophisticated and very advanced piece of machinery which took decades to develop. Once its tech is stolen, it isn’t easily fixable and you can be sure that, depending on what the UK and US discover, Russia will be worried."" And that concern will be felt beyond Moscow, he said “Examining this system won’t just allow Nato to understand Russian capabilities. China has been worried since the beginning of operations in Ukraine precisely because this could happen,' he added. “Because China reverse engineers everything Russian sells it, it is likely to have included elements from the SU-35 in its other, indigenous, J-Class fighters such as its superior Chengdu J-20. “The West doesn’t have much insight into Chinese technology so, in terms of command and control and long range capabilities, this is a unique opportunity which could, potentially, make a huge difference. “If you know the frequency a system operates on, for instance, you can disrupt it.”",10
2022-04-23,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1599491/putin-news-uk-hypersonic-weapons-project-aukus-russia-ukraine-war,Britain's top brains developing new hypersonic weapons to send ‘real signal’ to Putin,"AUKUS, the defence alliance between Britain, Australia and the US, announced that the countries will work together to develop deadly high-speed missiles. Originally a pact for nuclear submarines to control the growing threat of China, AUKUS’ role has expanded to counter recent threats. A joint statement unveiled that there is now a “new trilateral cooperation on hypersonics and counter-hypersonic” weapons in response to Putin’s actions in Ukraine. And Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a weapons expert from Cambridge University, has told Express.co.uk that Britain has a key role to play in helping AUKUS develop these high-speed killing machines. He said: “The Americans are by far the most important developers of these types of weapons. “What Britain adds is some highly technical expertise and certainly some of our scientists and people working on this are of great use to the Americans. “Australia also have a key role down to play in the Pacific as that role is key. “All three working together is a real signal to the Chinese and the Russians that we are not going to stand still and we are going to go forward. “Even more impetus will be behind it now with what is going on in Ukraine.” Mr de Bretton-Gordon also suggested that the pact will be developing other weapons too that are likely to terrify Putin. He said: “I think it (AUKUS) is developing other weaponry that is coming into the common lexicon – the Switchblade, the attack drones. “This an area that ourselves and the Australians are getting more and more into and as we are seeing these are incredibly effective weapons, very sophisticated and perhaps an area where we have a march of the Russians and the Chinese. “To be able to maintain the balance in our favour we have got to work together to develop these types of weapons in the future.” Hypersonic missiles fly five to 10 times as fast as the speed of sound, at a pace referred to as Mach 5 to Mach 10. The weapons are capable of carrying nuclear or conventional warheads and are designed to be manoeuvrable. This, in theory, evades conventional missile defences. Russia claims it fired a hypersonic missile into an underground arms and munition depot in a village 100 kilometres from Ukraine's border with Romania. It has used its newest hypersonic missile, known as the Kinzhal (Dagger), twice in Ukraine. Putin has described Kinzhal, which can be launched from a MiG fighter jet, as “an ideal weapon”. Now, the US and the rest of AUKUS could be posied to test out their own. And the Pentagon has in fact taken one for a test drive. Last month, the US secretly tested its own hypersonic missile without letting Russia know for at least two weeks.",10
2022-04-27,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1601333/best-missiles-in-world-ukraine-war-russia-putin-trident-spt,Best missiles in world: Top weapons ranked as Ukraine fights off Putin’s troops,"Russia plans to deploy its newest ‘Satan II’ missile by autumn, the head of the country's space programme warned this weekend. The Sarmat missile, dubbed ‘Satan II’, is reported to be the most dangerous weapon in the world, and has a range of some 11,200 miles (18,024 km), meaning it could hit any major city in the world. Travelling at five times the speed of sound, the missile can carry ten or more nuclear warheads at once, and analysts believe it could wipe out several major cities in one blast. Putin hailed the development of the weapon, which was successfully test fired last week, warning that ‘there is nothing like this anywhere in the world, and won't be for a long time’. Western analysts have, however, claimed that the autumn target is an ambitious one — adding much more work would be required before the missile can be deployed. Long before Russia invaded Ukraine, a top ten list of the world’s best inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) was published by Military Today. A variety of aspects of the missiles were analysed, including range and payload of the missiles, type of basing, and the capability to overcome enemy air defence systems. The list added that each and every missile on the list can be extremely devastating and capable of destroying entire countries. At numbers ten and nine on are the Russian Baluva and Chinese JL-2 missiles. The Baluva is launched from submarines, but had a number of test failures. As of 2017, when the list was published, 12 of the 27 tests had been unsuccessful. The JL-2, meanwhile, is also submarine-launched. With a range of 7,400-8,000km, the missiles are capable of reaching almost all major cities. However, Military Today reported that China has always lagged behind its Western rivals in submarine technology, saying they are as noisy as Russian submarines developed almost 50 years ago. At number eight is the Chinese DF-31AG, images of which first appeared in 2013. The missile has a range of 11,200km, meaning it can reach most of Europe and the US, and carries decoys to evade missile defence systems. Another Chinese missile, the DF-41, placed at seven. It is described as the “most powerful ICBM” in the world, and can reach the US within 20-25 minutes of launch. Next on the list is the French M51, which was first deployed in 2010. The submarine-based missiles can operate undetected in the Atlantic Ocean once placed on high alert, but used astro-inertial guidance — so may not be as accurate as other missiles with a satellite navigation system. At number five is the R-29RMU2.1 Layner, another Russian ICBM. They are particularly versatile, capable of carrying multiple warheads with different yields. But Military Today notes that they are not as stealthy as the American or British ICBMs. At number four is the American Minuteman III, based out of underground launch facilities. They are believed to be the only US land-based ICBM in service, and boasts the longest range of all ICBMs on the list — 13,000km. In third place is the Russian RS-24 Yars, otherwise known in the West as SS-29. It is MIRV-equipped, meaning warheads can be sent to different targets after the main propulsion stages of the missile launch. The Yars reportedly has a 60 to 65 percent chance of evading missile defence systems, and mobile launchers can operate “undetected in an area equivalent to a small European country”. Second on the list is yet another Russian weapon, the R-36M2 Voyevoda, known in the West as Satan. First deployed in 1988, a single missile is reportedly capable of destroying three US states in one blast. Once Putin deploys the Satan II, the R-36 range of ICBMs will be phased out. The highest ranked missile is the Trident D5, or Trident II, deployed by both the US and the UK. The submarine-launched ballistic missiles do not have the biggest range of some on the list, with a full-load range of 7,800km and reduced load range of 12,000km. They are extremely accurate, with a circular error of probability of just 90metres. One of the main advantages the Trident missile has is the control the US has of much of the world’s waters — allowing the submarines to remain undetected on patrols. The UK will be upgrading its current Vanguard fleet of submarines in the next decade, replacing them with the Dreadnought class, which is expected to enter service in the early 2030s. The Integrated Review, published in March 2021, reversed a planned reduction in British nuclear warheads. A new cap would be lifted to 260 from 180, with David Williams, the most senior civil servant at the Ministry of Defence (MoD), warning that a further increase cannot be ruled out.",10
2022-04-27,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1602210/putin-news-six-deadly-weapons-ukraine-war-satan-2-nuclear-poseidon,SIX deadly weapons Putin could use to end war with Ukraine 'in days',"More than two months into the invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces have made little progress as Ukrainian troops push back. Putin has already declared that Russia will win the war ahead of “Victory Day” on May 9, which is when Russia celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War 2. Given the slow progress of the war, Putin could unleash a number of superweapons that could end Ukraine’s resistance. Most recently, he showcased his terrifying arsenal, with the intention of giving his rivals “food for thought”. Earlier this month, the Russian Defence Ministry announced it successfully tested the new RS-28 Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. Nicknamed “The Satan”, the gargantuan 115-foot nuclear warhead can fly 11,000 miles, and carry 15 missiles with a potential capacity to destroy an area the size of France. According to reports, the missile travelled almost the entire length of Russia, almost 3,600 miles - in about 15 minutes. This terrifying killer is a nuclear-armed cruise missile that can be launched from land or sea with a near “unlimited” range. First unveiled in 2018, Putin claims that the missile can evade any air defence systems and can fly at low altitudes, making it difficult to detect. This missile is specifically designed to find flaws in the US’s defence systems and target critical military sites that most other missiles can’t reach. Poseidon is Putin’s nuclear-armed submarine drone that can zip through the waters at a speed of 125mph and decimate entire cities after getting dropped onto the seabed . While this drone is slower than other intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), it is reportedly fast enough to make it uncatchable to existing torpedoes. First unveiled in 2015, the “doomsday machine” can generate tsunamis of up to 300 feet upon detonating, plunging entire cities underwater and destroying naval bases. Regarded as one of Russia’s most adaptable systems, the Supra light laser cannon can obliterate satellites, planes, drones and missiles. Also known as the Peresvet, the cannon works by neutralising electronics on missiles and aircrafts from miles away. Very little is known about this system, leading the US to categorise it as a ""disturbing"" threat. Yu-74 Avangard The dreaded Avangard weapon travels at Mach 27 and is designed to take out US ballistic missile defences ahead of a wider nuclear attack. Putin unveiled the weapon in March 2018, saying it could travel at up to 20 times the speed of sound and strike its target ""like a meteorite, like a fireball,"" It is also powered by a nuclear reactor, worryingly giving the weapon a practically unlimited range that can strike anywhere. The Kh-47M2 Kinzhal is a Russian air-launched ballistic missile that has an impressive range of around 2000 kilometres. Nicknamed the “Dagger”, this missile can be equipped with a nuclear warhead, leading to the Kremlin describing it as an “ideal weapon”. This deadly weapon can travel at 12 times the speed of sound and is designed to disrupt multi-domain operations by enemy forces.",10
2022-04-29,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1602809/russia-news-space-threatens-abandon-nasa-iss-china-space-mission-moon-base,Russia threatens to abandon NASA on ISS and join China's space mission,"Since being slapped with economic sanctions by the West, Russia has repeatedly made threats to end its association with NASA onboard the ISS, even threatening to let the 400- tonne space station fall to Earth in an uncontrolled crash. Now, Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, has expressed interest in cooperating with China in manned space missions. In a statement, Roscosmos said: ""Considering the strategic nature of partnership relations between Russia and China, we will, undoubtedly, develop cooperation with Chinese partners in the field of manned cosmonautics. ""Co-operation with the Chinese side in this sphere has been organized within the framework of the joint Russian-Chinese commission for cooperation in manned cosmonautic.” He also expressed interest in co-operating in sectors of satellite surveillance and communications constellations. Speaking at the Sfera international navigational forum, he said: ""Co-operation between Glonass and Beidou [China’s satellite navigational system] can quite spread to communications and surveillance clusters.” Over the past few months, Mr Rogozin had several outbursts on Twitter, announcing that Russia would no longer cooperate with Western countries on board the International Space Station (ISS) until the sanctions are lifted. China has previously hinted that it is open to working with foreign astronauts, and launching them to its space station which is currently under construction. Zhou Jianping, the chief designer of China's manned space programme said in March: ""We would actively promote foreign astronauts' participation in the work in China's space station, which is an important part of international cooperation. “You look forward to it, I look forward to it too."" With the ISS set to be decommissioned by the end of 2031, China has already announced its goal to complete the construction of its Space Station by the end of this year. The China National Space Administration has already planned out six launches to their Tiangong space station to install two science modules to the in-orbit Tianhe core module. These launches will also include two cargo spacecraft and two crewed missions. The two countries have previously confirmed their alliance to build a research station on the moon, set to rival NASA's upcoming Lunar Gateway. Working with Russia, the countries plan to finish building basic infrastructure construction for International Lunar Research Station by 2035, according to Wu Yanhua, CNSA deputy director. He said that this also includes systems for energy, communication and life support. While NASA’s lunar Gateway will only orbit the Moon, this new space station will have both an orbiter and a base on the lunar surface, along with multiple exploration rovers.",10
2022-04-30,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1602681/putin-russia-ukraine-nasa-hypersonic-missile,Putin's panic as NASA makes killer AI for hypersonic missiles capable of wiping out armies,"The latest hypersonic missiles are reportedly so complex they require a computer to build them, and NASA has created an AI to do just that. Hypersonic missiles travel at over Mach 5 (3,836mph), meaning they can strike anywhere on the planet within an hour of being launched. These devastating weapons can carry nukes and avoid almost all missile defence systems as they cannot react fast enough, all while operating with a high level of precision. But due to the large amount of power and fuel required to reach these high speeds, their application has so far been limited by relying on using rockets. However, writes tech writer Will Lockett, an alternative option is a “scramjet”. Scramjet stands for supersonic combustion ramjet, and works exactly the same as a jet on a plane, but with no moving parts. Mr Lockett explains: “In a typical jet a turbine compresses the incoming air, fuel is then injected and ignited, which then forces the air out of the jet, creating thrust. But a scramjet does away with the turbine. “Instead, it uses the craft’s speed to ram air into the combustion chamber with sufficient pressure to get optimal combustion. “This makes them far more efficient and powerful than an average jet.” These use highly efficient thrust mechanisms to achieve much higher speeds, and can be built much smaller, lighter, and with greater range than ordinary rockets. In order to create these missiles, NASA has created an AI to design them, to account for the immense complexity required in doing so. Mr Lockett adds that the AI “could design a hypersonic missile that is far faster and with greater range than any other in the world, sending the US to the forefront of this military arms race.” These missiles are launched into space from a jet, before orbiting the Earth and striking in precision spots within minutes. The UK recently announced it will join forces with the US and Australia to build the missiles and stay ahead of China and Russia. However, Russia has also claimed to have developed their own hypersonic missiles. In March the Kremlin said it launched a hypersonic missile called “the Sizzler” at Ukraine to destroy an underground ammunition depot. The Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile is allegedly capable of reaching Mach 10 speeds (7672 mph) and distances up to 1,700 miles. It can also theoretically carry a nuclear warhead. Russia’s Defence Ministry also said that Kalibr cruise missiles, capable of travelling at up to five times the speed of sound, have been launched from ships in the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea at Ukrainian military infrastructure. Russian MoD Spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: “Workshops at the Nizhyn repair plant used for the repair of Ukrainian armoured vehicles damaged in combat operations were destroyed with sea-based Kalibr cruise missiles launched from the waters of the Black Sea.” Speaking at an energy forum in Moscow last year, Putin also said that his “intercontinental” weapons can travel five times faster than those being developed in America. He bragged: “This is not just a hypersonic, this is an intercontinental missile.”",10
2022-05-05,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1605374/putin-news-robot-army-ukraine-invasion-deadlock,Putin's terrifying ‘robot army’ could be unleashed to break Ukraine deadlock,"Russian military expert Viktor Murakhovsky warned in state media “there is a myth abroad that Russia lags behind in robotics.” In reality, he claimed, no other army in the world possesses such a diverse range of unmanned vehicles and drones as the Russian Federation. Given recent investments by Putin’s forces in the arena of robotics, this is a situation that appears unlikely to change any time soon. Mr Murakhovsky said: “Today’s Russian army is the successor of the Red Army, which created remote-controlled tanks back in the 1930s.” These so-called teletanks, which fought in World War 2, were controlled by operators at a distance of 0.3–0.9 miles by radio waves and were equipped with machine guns, flamethrowers and smoke canisters. Mr Murakhovsky told Russia Beyond: “After the war, pilotless planes were developed in the USSR, and I was personally involved in the work on remote-control systems for modern tanks. “Tremendous progress is being made in these areas - and [while] Russia is lagging somewhat in drone technology, in terms of land and sea robots it has the most extensive program in the world. “The Russian military sees robots being deployed to protect the army’s flanks, guard the rear and perform other tasks, such as storming enemy positions. “It will be a kind of independent forward echelon that carries out tasks autonomously without human participation, for example, in an urban environment, where battles could result in high losses of personnel.” Back in September last year, Russia and its close ally Belarus held the latest iteration of its quadrennial joint strategic exercise — titled Zapad-2021 — focused on what Russian General Staff call the “Western strategic direction”. Zapad typically serves a dual role, combining training exercises with a prominent display of military capabilities for the benefit of the international audience. This year’s event saw the first drills in which ground robots were deployed in the same formation as soldiers — with machines both firing missiles at various targets and laying down covering fire for human manoeuvres. Among the automatons involved in these trials was the Uran-9, Russia’s largest robot. This 12 tonne behemoth is equipped with a 30-millimetre automatic cannon, Ataka anti-tank guided missile launchers and Shmel flamethrowers. Zapad-2021 also saw the Russian military field test its newest B-19 infantry fighting vehicle, equipped with its unmanned “Epokha” combat module, which sports a 57-millimetre automatic cannon and Kornet anti-tank guided missiles. Other demonstrations included three different types of military drone, including the deadly “Lastochka” (literally: “swallow”), Forpost and Inokhodets flying craft. So-called Platform-M combat robots which feature machine guns and grenade launchers mounted on a caterpillar-track-driven chassis were also put through their paces. According to Russian pilotless aviation expert Denis Fedutinov, Zapad-2021 was notable not only for its extensive use of unmanned and robotic systems, but also for how such did not even represent the full extent of Putin’s autonomous weaponry. For example, Mr Fedutinov noted, the drills featured neither the heavy high-altitude Altius drone and the heavy stealth Okhotnik drone, which were developed to supplement the Forpost and Inokhodets craft. He said: “The drive to catch up in this area, which led to the creation of a wide basic line of UAV systems, entailed significant financial and time costs, which was a lesson for the Russian, so now it gives high priority to uncrewed developments.” At the same time, Mr Murakhovsky said, Russia has a comprehensive array of ground-based military robots — covering functions from combat to reconnaissance and support functions. He added: “In terms of range, Russia has everything from miniature sphere-shaped robots that can be launched by hand on the ground, to heavy complexes like Sturm on a tank-based platform. “And in terms of payload variety, Russian robots, whether combat or reconnaissance, are in the vanguard.”",10
2022-05-06,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1606450/elon-musk-nasa-astronauts-back-earth-russia-threat-ISS-safety,Musk ferries NASA astronauts back to Earth after Russia threatens ISS safety,"The four passengers splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico after hitching a ride on Mr Musk's SpaceX Endurance spacecraft. NASA astronauts Thomas Marshburn, Kayla Barron and Raja Chari and Matthias Maurer of the European Space Agency had spent six months on board the ISS. Their departure comes after Russia threatened the safety of the floating space station. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos threatened to crash the 400-tonne floating research lab into the Earth. Furious at the sanctions placed by Western countries as a response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Space Agency chief implied that Russia could let the station crash into the Earth. The first two components of the ISS come from the Russian modules ""Zarya"" and ""Zvezda"", which use their engines to raise the orbit of the ISS from time to time when the upper layers of the atmosphere begin slowing down the station. If Vladimir Putin decided to decouple these two modules, some experts have warned that the ISS would only survive for a short period of time before it enters Earth’s atmosphere. And Rogozin stoked these fears. Describing the sanctions imposed by the West on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine as “illegal”, he said that the restrictions could disrupt the operations of Russian vessels servicing the ISS. In a Twitter rant, he said: “Do you want to destroy our cooperation on the ISS? “This is how you already do it by limiting exchanges between our cosmonaut and astronaut training centres. “If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the US or Europe? But under the terms disclosed by the ISS IGA, Russia cannot remove its section of the station without at least one year's written notice. And Rogozin appears to have backtracked on his earlier threats, insisting that Roscosmos would give NASA a year's notice before pulling out. It appeared to be enough to give NASA and ESA the confidence to continue. Three more Americans and an Italian astronaut replaced the departing spacefarers in another SpaceX launch last week. NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in late April that he expects Russia to continue participating in the ISS regardless of the sanctions beyond 2024. The international operating agreement covering the ISS - which Russia has signed - lasts until 2024 and NASA plans to continue operating the station until 2031.",10
2022-05-09,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1607676/royal-navy-new-dreadnought-nuclear-submarine-putin-russia-rolls-royce,Royal Navy unveils new £2bn nuclear submarine plan to deter ‘extreme threats’ like Putin,"Defence Procurement Minister Jeremy Quin said: “The Dreadnought-class will be crucial to maintaining and safeguarding our national security, with the nuclear deterrent protecting every UK citizen from the most extreme threats every minute of every day. Designed in the UK, built in the UK and supporting tens of thousands of jobs in the UK, the Dreadnought programme is a leading example of our commitment to defence manufacturing.” The submarines, he added, “will continue to boost British industry for decades to come”. The Dreadnought is the largest class of submarine ever constructed for the Royal Navy, with each being the length of three Olympic swimming pools. In fact, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said that the craft will be “one of the most complex machines ever built” and they will operate in “one of the most hostile environments on the planet”. Each vessel will contain 26.4 miles of pipework and more than 20,000 cables spanning a whopping 215 miles in total, enough to stretch all the way from London to Cardiff. From design to build, the Dreadnought programme will support some 30,000 jobs across the UK — including, last year alone, 13,500 jobs in the Northwest of England and a further 16,300 across the rest of the UK. The latest series of defence contracts — which have been awarded to BAE Systems and Rolls Royce — will see the submarine programme enter its third major phase. The current funding will see the HMS Dreadnought — the first of four submarines of its class — exit the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard to begin sea trials. However, the £2billion is merely the initial investment, with a total of £10billion planned to cover the whole project. Ultimately, the vessels will pick up the mantle of “Operation Relentless”, the UK’s Continuous at Sea Deterrence programme which has been operating non-stop since 1969. Presently delivered by a fleet of Vanguard-class submarines, Operation Relentless carries the UK’s Trident nuclear missile system on patrol throughout the world’s oceans. The mission, the Ministry of Defence added, will be “responsible for safeguarding our national security and way of life, as long as the international security situation makes it necessary.” Rolls-Royce Submarines president Steve Carlier said: “Since 1969, Rolls-Royce has proudly provided the nuclear power and expertise that keeps the UK’s continuous nuclear deterrent at sea. “This latest contract is a welcome sign of the UK’s ongoing commitment to the Submarines Enterprise and all the jobs around the UK that support it.” First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Ben Key, added: “We welcome the faith shown in the Royal Navy and our people that submarines remain the optimum means of securely deploying the independent nuclear deterrent. “This investment will enable the transition from the Vanguard to Dreadnought-class submarines — an enormous challenge, and one we in the Royal Navy willingly accept. “We have provided over fifty years of unbroken Continuous At Sea Deterrence and we will ensure that the Royal Navy provides the ultimate guarantee of security for the United Kingdom for the next five decades and beyond. A contract worth £160million has also been awarded to the defence firm Raytheon UK for the training of the crew of HMS Dreadnought at HM Naval Base Clyde. Raytheon UK chief executive Jeff Lewis said: “This contract is for a truly transformative submarine training solution and builds on the success that we have had to date in transforming the Royal Navy’s training and learning solutions. “Our collaborative working culture and experience in managing large and complex training programmes will help equip the Royal Navy with a training capability that underpins the cornerstone of the UK’s strategic defence capability.” HMS Dreadnought is expected to enter service in the early 2030s.",10

It comes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February led to extremely tense relations between Moscow and the West. While addressing the Ukrainian Parliament today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted the West was too slow to act over Russian aggression. He said the West had been ""too slow to grasp what was really happening"" and ""failed"" to collectively impose sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Johnson also announced £300million of extra military aid for Ukraine as the weapons of Western nations continue to be used by Ukrainians to combat the Russian advance. The US and Russia have invested heavily in their military power in recent years, including on deadly submarines. In October 2020, undersea authority H.I. Sutton at Covert Shores ranked the the most lethal submarines operated by the world’s navies. The top 10 is dominated by Russian and US vessels – but the UK also has two ships among them. At number 10 is UK's Trafalgar Class submarines – only one of these boats remains active and in commission (as of 2022) with six retired from the seven originally in service, The class makes up part of the Royal Navy's nuclear-powered 'hunter-killer' submarine force. At nine on the list of lethal submarines is the Improved Los-Angeles Class – nuclear-powered fast attack submarines in service with the US Navy. The Virginia Class (Block IV) submarine ranks at number eight, while the UK appears again on the list in seventh with the Astute Class. Russian ships – the Sierra Class and Akula Class – were ranked sixth and fifth. Washington's Seawolf class – nuclear-powered fast attack submarines – was placed fourth. Moscow's ships took third place and second place. The Oscar II, deemed to be the third most powerful submarine in the world, comes from a series of nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines designed in the Soviet Union for the Soviet Navy. They remain in service now with the Russian Navy. Another Russian submarine made up the top three, with the Severodvinsk II ranked the second most deadly vessel of its kind in the world. The nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine is active within the Russian Navy, and the lead vessel of the class. The submarine is named after the city of Severodvinsk and is deployed with the Russian Northern Fleet. On February 5 2021, it successfully hit a coastal target in Chiza training ground, Arkhangelsk Oblast with a Kalibr missile. In October 2021, the submarine was reported to have carried out a successful launch of the hypersonic Tsirkon missile from the White Sea at a target in the Barents Sea. The USS Ohio (SSGN-726) was hailed by H.I. Sutton at Covert Shores as the most powerful submarine in the world. It is the lead boat of its class of nuclear-powered fleet ballistic missile submarines, and the fourth vessel of the US Navy to be named after the state of Ohio. The vessel was commissioned with the hull designation of SSBN-726, and with her conversion to a guided missile submarine she was re-designated SSGN-726. General Dynamics, the company which built the ship, said: ""Designed and built by Electric Boat, these submarines are without question the most powerful ships ever put to sea.

This nuclear-equipped weapon could also outmanoeuvre and evade NATO’s air defences by flying at low altitudes of 150 to 300-feet. Furthermore, reports have suggested that the missile is specifically designed to bypass US defence systems. While Moscow doesn’t have the greatest track record for testing the safety of nuclear weapons, Putin remains undeterred, experts say. According to defence expert Brent Eastwood, Russia tested the cruise missile several times at an Arctic facility near Pankovo on Novaya Zemlya in the Barents Sea. Last year, satellite pictures exposed a testing site, showing a launchpad for the Burevestnik, along with shelters from fallout, and shipping containers. Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies Center for Nonproliferation Studies said: ""Using a nuclear reactor would, in principle, give the cruise missile unlimited range to fly under and around US missile defence radars and interceptors."" However, he added that there are ""substantial questions about whether the system can be made to work successfully, to say nothing of the threat that testing this system may pose to the environment and human health."" Despite the failed tests, the Burevestnik has enviable characteristics that are not seen in any other cruise missiles before it. Most nuclear-tipped cruise missiles fly at medium altitudes to conserve fuel, which results in the weapon having a finite range. However, flying at medium heights allows the defence system to track the missiles and use surface to air interceptors to destroy them. However, the ‘Flying Chernobyl’s’ nuclear propulsion technology could give the weapon hypersonic speed, evasive low altitude, and range that could threaten military and civilian targets from a near limitless range. After Russia tested the weapons in 2020, Marshall Billingslea, a defence expert appointed by then President Trump’s for a top arms control post, said he’s been “very clear with my Russian counterpart that these are enormous wastes of funds”. He also added that Moscow should “cease and desist and abandon these kinds of destabilising ideas. “We frankly don’t think these weapons should exist at all. “Why on earth would you have a nuclear-powered, nuclear-tipped cruise missile? That is nothing more than a flying Chernobyl. “Just think about the radioactive plume that it would generate as it circles. “There’s no good argument [and] logic for having these kinds of doomsday systems.” The failed test in Nenoksa on the White Sea in 2019 resulted in the deadly weapon being submerged for over a year. The test ended with deadly consequences after five workers were killed, and another three were injured on a barge after they tried to recover the missile when it suddenly exploded.",10

While speaking on Russia’s Channel 1, they insinuated a possible connection between monkeypox outbreak and the fact that the countries who are now reporting cases are those supplying weapons to Ukraine. “Maybe it’s not a coincidence”, Skabeeva said after highlighting that Russia “have no cases of monkeypox” in the attempt to support her theory. The Russian host said: “You won’t believe it. “Such a coincidence. “Or maybe it’s not a coincidence. “But most of the counties, whose people got monkeypox, are supplying weapons to the Kyiv regime. “Stuff happens, right? “We have no cases of monkeypox. “Not even one. The hosts also seem to make what appear to be homophobic remarks after claiming that the virus “is spread through the homosexual population” and stressing that those who caught the virus “are men of non-traditional sexual orientation”. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention official Dr John Brooks confirmed that anyone can contract monkeypox through personal content, regardless of sexual orientation. The Russian hosts said: “Monkeypox! “Almost all who got sick with it are men of non-traditional sexual orientation. “From the perspective of public health, it’s important to note that the disease is spread throughout the homosexual population"". United Nations’ Aids agency said “a significant proportion” of recent monkeypox cases have been identified among LGBTI community. UNAIDS, however, confirmed that the transmission was most likely via close physical contact with a monkeypox sufferer and the virus could affect anyone. In light of some reporting on the virus being described by UN as “homophobic and racist”, UNAIDS deputy executive director Matthew Kavanagh highlighted: “Stigma and blame undermine trust and capacity to respond effectively during outbreaks like this one”. Seven new cases were identified today in England, bringing up the total number to 78, reports from UK Health Security Agency confirmed.",10
2022-05-28,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1617135/energy-crisis-lifeline-space-energy-initiative-china-russia-elon-musk,Energy crisis lifeline: Power station in SPACE to put UK ‘ahead’ of China and Russia,"As the energy crisis continues to send shocks through the nation, with millions facing fuel poverty, a stunning new initiative could provide a crucial lifeline later down the line. The Space Energy Initiative (SEI) is an exciting new project that could see Britain set up the first power station in space by 2035. It will be made up of satellites with lightweight solar panels and a system of mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto the panels, generating around 3.4 GW of electricity on the satellite. By the mid-2040s, the power generated from the space station could reach 30GW, accounting for up to 30 percent of the UK’s electricity demand. It comes as the country scrambles to find alternatives to gas as the spiralling global price of the fuel continues to send bills in Britain skyrocketing. While other countries are plotting similar initiatives, such as Japan and Canada, there is one aspect of the project that is putting the UK “ahead of the game”, according to Conservative MP Mark Garnier. Mr Garnier, who is also the Chair of the advisory board of the SEI, told Express.co.uk: “Where we’re ahead of the game is that what we are proposing is something which is much more commercially orientated. “China and Russia’s (space programmes) tend to be run by the Government. “What we are proposing is basically commercial space. So, this is what someone like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos and those sorts of people (have done).” Mr Musk, the SpaceX CEO, has been hailed for changing the face of the US’ space industry. Since its launch in 2002, the company now regularly launches and landing rockets carrying huge payloads for a wide range of customers in the space business, including NASA and the United States Space Force. Mr Garnier is now hoping to follow Mr Musk’s example. And the world's richest man may even have a role to play in the project. Mr Garnier said: “They (the satellites) are going to be in the magnitude of tens of launches in order to get these things into orbit, and you have got to get the assembly unit up there as well. “This is where SpaceX comes in, with its really big launch capacity. You want big launches that could heavy payloads up into low-Earth orbit. When asked if he thought Mr Musk would consider helping to launch the system, Mr Garnier responded: ""Yes, definitely. It will use big rockets."" Billionaire Mr Musk’s SpaceX is known for its huge rockets, with technologies such as the Falcon Heavy in its arsenal. And according to Sanjeev Gordhan, a general partner of US-based Venture Capital Fund Type One, the UK’s booming space sector is certainly something Mr Musk has taken an interest in. The UK’s space sector is growing rapidly, valued at around £14.8billion a year. Sector income soared in nominal terms last year, from £16.4billion to £16.5billion, with exports counting for around a third 32 percent of this total, according to the UK Space Agency. When asked by Express.co.uk whether Mr Musk and Mr Bezos would get involved, Mr Gordhan responded: “It is already on their radar. “We know it is already on their radar because there are a couple of opportunities indirectly that we are putting out to those types of individuals.”",10

The “Progress 81” cargo mission is scheduled to lift off at 2:32pm local time (10:32am BST). It will carry some supplies up to the International Space Station (ISS). According to Vesti, the Russian state-owned news source, the rocket “will be dedicated to the republics of Donbas"". “On the head fairing are the flags of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). “The inscription 'Donbas' is applied on the second stage.” A rocket’s head fairing is the nose-cone used to protect its spacecraft payload during passage out of the atmosphere. The second stage on a Soyuz rocket comprises the main body of the rocket, and is fired at blast-off with the four first-stage booster rockets. In an announcement issued yesterday, NASA said: “NASA will provide live coverage of the launch and docking of a Russian cargo spacecraft carrying about three tons of food, fuel, and supplies for the Expedition 67 crew.” Coverage of the launch, they said, would begin at 5:15am EDT (10:15am BST) on NASA television, the space agency’s website and the NASA app. NASA added: “The Progress spacecraft will be placed into a fast-track, two-orbit journey to link up to the aft port of the station’s Zvezda service module at 9:02 a.m. Friday, June 3. “NASA coverage of rendezvous and docking will begin at 8:15 am [1:15pm]” It is not known whether NASA will show the name Donbass or the flags in their coverage. On social media, reaction to the announcement has been mixed. Twitter user Emanu (@sandia_oreo) posted: “Russian cargo ships should not be allowed to Dock in the ISS. “Given their military behaviour I'd [not] be surprised if Russia tries to take control of the station for some bs liberation of science.” The ISS is owned by several nations: the US, Russia, Japan, Canada and the “European Partner”, which treats all the EU states as a single entity. Other commenters were more relaxed about the news. Nico Nobili (@SirNickNite) tweeted: “At least in space (and for space missions) we do not boycott Russia and Russian brilliant minds (like Russian sportsmen). “The fault lies solely with their government and some autocratic politicians if Russia invaded Ukraine in February. “Long live missions and space research.”",10
2022-06-01,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1618911/russia-monkeypox-bioweapons-scientist-ussr-cold-war-spt,Russia plan to use monkeypox as bioweapon explained in chilling detail by ex-Soviet doctor,"Another 71 cases of monkeypox have been identified in England over the weekend, bringing the UK's total to 190, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Anyone with the virus — which spreads through ""direct contact with a confirmed case, droplets or contaminated surfaces and objects"" — is being advised to abstain from sex while they have symptoms, and to use condoms for eight weeks after infection as a precaution. While the risk to the general population is low, the UKHSA says people should be alert to new rashes or lesions. Monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research, hence the name. It originates from around 12 countries in the West African and Central African region. While it has kept a relatively low profile in recent decades, with its resurgence, chilling archive reports of an interview with Dr Ken Alibek, a former Soviet scientist, have resurfaced. In 1998, he claimed that the country had actually begun investigating using monkeypox as a bioweapon earlier on that decade. The former deputy chief of the USSR's biological weapons program until its collapse in 1991 — and who stayed on in its Russian Federation successor until the following year — claims he oversaw 32,000 employees at more than 40 facilities. After leaving Russia for the US, Dr Alibek said the Soviets had focused on a variety of infectious diseases for use in warfare, honing in on smallpox until it was successfully eradicated through a global vaccination program. Instead, he said, the USSR turned its attention to monkeypox, claiming in the interview with staff at the American Chemical and Biological Weapons Nonproliferation Project (CBWNP), that smallpox was ruled out as an accidental leak among the population would be ""difficult to explain to the international community"". He said: ""So we developed a special program to determine what ‘model’ viruses could be used instead of human smallpox. ""We tested vaccinia virus, mousepox virus, rabbitpox virus, and monkeypox virus as models for smallpox. ""The idea was that all research and development work would be conducted using these model viruses. ""Once we obtained a set of positive results, it would take just two weeks to conduct the same manipulations with smallpox virus and to stockpile the warfare agent. ""We would have in our arsenal a genetically altered smallpox virus that could replace the previous one."" Dr Alibek said Russia's Ministry of Defence decided to continue working with monkeypox to ""create future biological weapons"" even after the dissolution of the USSR. He was brought before a US Congress hearing in 1998 where he said he was ""convinced that Russia’s biological weapons program has not been completely dismantled"". Jonathan Tucker, a former United Nations (UN) weapons inspector, appeared to back his claims after he told United Press international in 2002 that there was still a ""real fear"" that monkeypox could be engineered as a bioweapon. According to Mr Tucker, who left the UN Special Commission to work at the Monterey Institute think tank in Washington, vaccination from smallpox would be able to repel infection, but many countries have insufficient stockpiles since the virus was eradicated. The report also quoted another UN weapons inspector who chose not to be named as saying: ""There’s no confirmation that (monkeypox) leaked out, but the potential exists."" Dr Alibek was interviewed again for the same report, and said that although he was unaware of any leaks, ""it was not a problem to get any of the orthopoxviruses (smallpox, camelpox and monkeypox)."" When the report was published it was not known that monkeypox could be transmitted between humans, but we now know that it can in fact spread through face-to-face contact. While it is unclear to what extent Soviet Russia and the subsequent Russian Federation kept monkeypox on their bioweapons program, the USSR's covert bioweapons program is one of history's best-known secrets. Beginning in the 1920s and lasting until 1992, it is one of the longest, biggest and most sophisticated programs ever seen, and as a result, violated Soviet Russia's commitment to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. During World War 2, Joseph Stalin, then Soviet leader, was forced to move his biological warfare operations from the path of the advancing German army, and has since been accused of using tularemia — one of the most infectious pathogenic bacteria known — against German troops in 1942 near Stalingrad. Over the course of its history, the Soviet Union is known to have carried out research and investigations with the following bio-agents: Considerable resources were funnelled into the programs which were conducted at dozens of top-secret sites across the USSR. In the Nineties, after years of secrecy and whispers, Boris Yeltsin, who served as the first President of Russia, admitted to an offensive biological weapons program. He also revealed the true extent of the Sverdlovsk biological weapons accident of 1979, which resulted in the deaths of at least 64 people.",10
2022-06-16,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1626288/UK-nuclear-bunker-secret-Kelvedon-evg,Inside the UK's secret nuclear bunker,"The spectre of nuclear war is looming large over Europe thanks to Russia, which is now nearly four months into its invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has the country's deterrent on ""high alert"", and his supporters in the media have helped fan the flames, at one point suggesting Russia could annihilate the country with a 1,600-foot nuclear tsunami. While most Britons caught in this situation would meet an untimely end, those living near Kelvedon have a safe haven in the village's little-known nuclear bunker. Kelvedon is a small, tranquil village of 3,587 tucked into the Essex countryside. But under the village's many local shops and pleasant greenery sits a hangover from the Cold War - a secret nuclear bunker. Kelvedon Hatch was constructed during the 1950s when the UK sought to overhaul its air defence network against possible Soviet attack. The effort gained life via ROTOR, a radar system with a base at Kelvedon protected by an extensive underground network. From 1952 to 1992, the site functioned as Regional Government Headquarters (RGHQ), designed to protect the population and maintain UK operations. The bunker lies roughly 38 metres under a seemingly ordinary bungalow split over three layers which people can enter via a nearly 100-metre tunnel to the lowest. Those working or sheltering inside had a wealth of facilities available, with both heating and air conditioning capabilities, a dedicated water supply and generators. The generators - which would have protected the site from a potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack - powered military and communications systems inside. They interacted with the above world via the top two floors, a ""hill"" and a radio mast. Officials outfitted the bunker with CONRAD, a vital Cold War system used to maintain Government communication in the event of a nuclear strike. The bunker has a capacity in the hundreds and was originally reserved for military and civilian personnel working on-site. Those living within could survive for months, with canned food included with the heat and water supplies. When the USSR collapsed in the early 1990s, Kelvedon was decommissioned as an official military base and fell back into private ownership. The Parish family, who owned the bunker in its pre-military days, took over management. They turned the bunker with its many Cold War adornments into a local tourist attraction. As a museum, it serves as an educative tool and has featured in a clutch of television programmes. Kelvedon is not the UK's sole nuclear bunker, but it is the largest. According to Subterranean Britannica, 258 exist scattered across the country. The vast majority - approximately 214 - are in England, with three in Northern Ireland, 30 in Scotland and 11 in Wales.",10
2022-06-20,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1628162/nasa-emergency-russia-anti-satellite-test-rocket-iss-space-station-cosmos,NASA takes emergency measures as debris from missile launch threatens to wipe out ISS,"While the Russian anti-satellite weapon test (ASAT) was conducted in November 2021, the ISS manoeuvred the fragment of orbital debris that was heading in its direction on Thursday. Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, used an uncrewed Progress 81 cargo ship docked at the ISS to help the orbiting lab dodge the fragment of the destroyed Russian satellite Cosmos 1408. The Russian cargo spaceship blasted its thrusters for four and a half minutes to raise the ISS’ orbit slightly and shift it away from the space debris. Head of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin wrote on Telegram: ""I confirm that at 22:03 Moscow time, the engines of the Russian Progress MS-20 transport cargo ship carried out an unscheduled manoeuvre to avoid a dangerous approach of the International Space Station with a fragment of the Kosmos-1408 spacecraft.” But NASA has said that no crew member was ever put in danger by the space junk, with the space debris predicted to miss the ISS anyway. NASA officials wrote in an update: ""The crew was never in any danger and the manoeuvre had no impact on station operations. ""Without the manoeuvre, it was predicted that the fragment could have passed within around a half-mile from the station."" But back in November, when the ASAT test first took place, this was a different story. The Russian destruction of the Soviet-era satellite sent as many as 1500 pieces of space debris hurtling past the ISS. This forced four NASA astronauts to duck for cover in their spaceships. The test enraged the US at the time. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement following the incident: “Due to the debris generated by the destructive Russian Anti-Satellite (ASAT) test, ISS astronauts and cosmonauts undertook emergency procedures for safety. “Like Secretary Blinken, I’m outraged by this irresponsible and destabilising action.” US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken had earlier called the move ""dangerous and irresponsible"". The test also bizarrely forced two of Russia’s own cosmonauts to flee to their spaceships to avert the danger. Mr Nelson added: “With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS but also their own cosmonauts.” The test also posed a risk to a Chinese space mission. Mr Nelson said: ""Their actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station and the taikonauts on board.“All nations have a responsibility to prevent the purposeful creation of space debris from ASATs and to foster a safe, sustainable space environment.” US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price said: ""Dangerous and irresponsible behaviour jeopardises the long-term sustainability of outer space and clearly demonstrates that Russia's claims of opposing the weapons and weaponization of space are disingenuous and hypocritical.” According to a NASA report, the Cosmos 1408 was launched in 1982 from Russia's Plesetsk Cosmodrome.",10

Rolls-Royce nuclear reactors can power whole country,"Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, European countries, including the UK, have looked to sever their energy ties with Russia and become more energy independent. Aside from rapidly scaling up renewable energy, the UK has also invested heavily in nuclear power, and specifically backing Rolls-Royce's small nuclear reactor technology, which is expected to be built much faster and cheaper than conventional nuclear reactors. Rolls-Royce has submitted the design for its reactor for approval from the Government, but they are stuck in the Treasury. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth East, tweeted: “How can we help tackle the cost of living crisis and become energy secure? “Generate more of our own power here in the UK through the rollout of small modular nuclear reactors. “It’s a new concept and Rolls-Royce has a design that we should support.” In the Prime Minister’s energy security strategy that was unveiled earlier this year, the Government announced that it is investing £210million to help develop the innovative new technology, which is said to be much cheaper and easier to deploy than traditional nuclear power stations. “And one of the biggest ways in which we can reduce energy prices and become more energy self-sufficient is stuck in this building, the Treasury. “A single Modular Nuclear Reactor could power a city the size of Leeds, sixty reactors could power the entire country. “Rolls Royce, who have been building these kinds of reactors for our nuclear power submarines for decades have submitted a state-of-the-art design, waiting for approval.” Once the design is approved and the factory for the Rolls Royce reactors is up and running, the company expects to produce a reactor every six months, creating 40,000 jobs and over £50billion worth of investment. Mr Ellwood continued: “This would offer huge export opportunities as nations seek to reduce their carbon emissions. “It’s a simple but major part of the jigsaw as we seek the right energy mix to keep the lights on and make Britain more energy independent.” These SMRs, which are approximately the size of two football pitches, can reportedly power around half a million homes, putting its estimated energy output at roughly a quarter of the larger traditional nuclear reactors like the upcoming Hinkley Point C. Rolls-Royce is looking to develop a reactor that can be easily mass-produced in factories, which will make the technology dramatically cheaper and more flexible. In the Government’s Energy Security Strategy, the UK has pushed hard for nuclear energy, with a goal of generating 24 Gigawatts by 2050, which would account for 25 percent of the projected electricity demand.",10

According to Ms Garver, Mr Musk was so angry after the Russian engineer's alleged act that his best response was to set up a rocket company of his own. She wrote: ""This act so completely offended Elon that he decided on the flight home that he would start his own rocket company to compete with them. ""If Helen of Troy had a face that launched a thousand ships, this was the spit that launched a thousand spaceships."" Jim Cantrell, who co-founded SpaceX with Mr Musk, has also supported this claim. It reportedly happened when the pair headed to Moscow to negotiate a deal to buy rockets for a future Mars mission. The plan was to purchase refurbished Dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that blast envisioned payloads into space. They met with several Russian companies, but according to Mr Cantrell, Mr Musk did not impress and it soon got very heated. In a documentary that aired in May, Mr Cantrell revealed: “The chief designer was getting very agitated as Elon spoke. ""He got tired of listening to him and he spits on our shoes."" Mr Cantrell suspected it was the way that Mr Musk dressed that insulted the Russian engineer to such an extent that he spat on him. He said the engineer likely saw it as a “sign of disrespect”. Ms Garver held a similar view, writing that it was Mr Musk’s ""disrupter mentality and lack of deference toward the traditional industry"" that often irritated those in the business. Despite coming back from Russia empty-handed, Mr Musk, who is now the world’s richest man, went on to set up SpaceX in 2002. The billionaire realised that instead of forking out millions to pay for rockets deemed as too expensive, he could build affordable rockets he needed instead. And one of Mr Musk’s main goals when launching SpaceX was to make accessing space more affordable and reliable. Now, the company is considered to have revolutionised the space industry, being the first to reach a number of key milestones. These include being the only private company capable of returning a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, as well as sending the first private spacecraft to the International Space Station. Now, even Russia is impressed, despite earlier tensions. Head of Roscosomos, Russia’s space agency, Dmitry Rogozin said: ""Mr Elon Musk realises many of the ideas and thoughts that we wanted to realise, but did not get to because, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, our space program halted for some time. ""We respect him as an organizer of the space industry and as an investor, who is not afraid to take risks."" Now, Mr Musk wants to take SpaceX to the next level and take people to Mars, an idea he likes to poke fun at on Twitter. Mr Musk is quoted saying on the SpaceX website: “You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.”",10

However, researchers have now found this gradual degradation of ice is set to have the unintended consequence of weakening Russia’s control over popular shipping routes. As ice-covered regions of the Arctic melt away, a new study found that within decades, new sea routes could open up, which could circumvent the Russian-controlled Northern Sea Route, The researchers also noted another unintended consequence of the degradation of ice was the new routes opening up would be more “eco friendly” offering ships a faster, more direct route. Danil Bochkov, a Russia-China-Europe expert shared a map from the study, tweeting: “Rapidly melting sea ice is opening shipping routes outside Russia's exclusive economic zone closer to North Pole. “By 2065, Arctic's navigability will increase so greatly that Russia's control over trade will weaken, according to study from Brown University in the U.S.” Much of the Northern Sea route, one end of which lies in the North Sea connecting the UK and Norway, lies in Russia’s exclusive economic zone. Amanda Lynch, the study’s lead author and a professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Brown said: “There’s no scenario in which melting ice in the Arctic is good news. “But the unfortunate reality is that the ice is already retreating, these routes are opening up, and we need to start thinking critically about the legal, environmental and geopolitical implications.” According to Charles Norchi, co-author of the study and the director of the Center for Oceans and Coastal Law at Maine Law, these changes to the shipping routes could have huge implications for world trade and global politics. Since 1982, countries bordering the Arctic seas have been granted enhanced authority of primary shipping routes, according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Article 234 of the convention states that in the name of “the prevention, reduction and control of marine pollution from vessels,” countries whose coastlines are near-Arctic shipping routes have the ability to regulate the route’s maritime traffic, so long as the area remains ice-covered for the majority of the year. According to Prof Nori, Russia has been exploiting Article 234 for its own economic and political gain for decades. For instance, one Russian law states that all vessels passing through the Northern Sea Route must be piloted by Russians. Passing vessels are also required to pay tolls and give prior notice in advance if they plan to use the route. Because of this, major shipping companies often opt for alternative routes like Suez and Panama canals, which are longer but are usually the cheaper option. But because of the Arctic ice melt, Russia could see its grip on Arctic routes decline. “Not only that, but with melting ice, shipping will move out of Russian territorial waters and into international waters. “If that happens, Russia can’t do much, because the outcome is driven by climate change and shipping economics.” The new study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",10
2022-07-03,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1634022/russia-asat-test-space-debris-inmarsat-iss-george-freeman,Russia slammed for causing 'huge problem' in space – and now the UK has to sort it,"Late last year, Russia used an anti-satellite missile to blow up one of its own satellites in an event known as an ASAT test. This caused thousands of pieces of space debris to fly towards the international space station, forcing astronauts to duck for cover in their spacecraft over fears the space junk would smash into them. While catastrophe was avoided, Inmarsat CEO Rajeev Suri told Express.co.uk said that debris in space creates problems lasting for decades. Mr Suri, whose company is a British satellite telecommunications provider, said: “Any country that does anti-satellite testing creates a risk of space debris…The problem with space debris is that they last for years and decades and that is the problem. “It is an additional problem that these direct ASAT tests by a small number of major space powers over the past several decades have created debris. “In April 2022, the US announced a moratorium on these tests in space and the hope is that as many countries as possible will adhere to this in the near future. That is what we need to do as space should be respected.” He added: “Russia has done it, China has done in it, the US, India and other countries as well”. But ASAT tests are not the only cause of space debris. Mr Suri warned: “There are three risks, one is space debris itself and that is to do with ASAT testing but also to do with the fact that we used to have 1,400 in the year 2014. Now there are about 5,200 satellites. “The low-earth orbit, in particular, has a plan for a number of mega-constellations and the projects talk about 100,000 satellites by 2030. That means that the risk of collision grows even more. To add to that there is the risk of ASAT testing.” “The third risk is orbital exclusion that companies or countries can occupy a particular orbit whereby there is no place for anybody else. So the economic risk of monopoly formation and that also adds to the physical collision avoidance risk.” “What we are calling for is regulation to be able to manage this better.” In fact, Inmarsat’s Space Sustainability Report has revealed that there are almost 10,000 tonnes of satellite and rocket objects currently in Earth’s orbit. This includes an estimated 130 million pieces of space debris. Commenting on the report, Mr Suri said: “The time has come to address sustainability in space with a coherent plan to address the growing problem of debris, satellite congestion and the absence of agreed international standards in our industry. “We need a new mindset and a new approach to environmentalism in space, which will become increasingly important amid industry plans for a massive increase in satellite launches into Low Earth Orbit that will increase the risk of collisions and potential atmospheric contamination.” Inmarsat is not the only one calling for better regulation in space. Now, the Government will undertake a regulatory review to incentivise sustainable practices, investment and growth into technologies that can clean up that debris for Active Debris Removal (ADR). Speaking at the Space Sustainability Summit this month, Science Minister George Freeman said: “To harness space for sustainability, we need an agreed framework of standards for measuring and managing debris, improving satellite repair and retrieval and kite-marking genuinely sustainable supply chains. “As it was with shipping in the 17th century and cars in the 20th, the key will be regulation which enforces good industry standards and reduces the cost of insurance and finance for a satellite launch which can show it is compliant. “With London as a global capital of insurance and venture financing, we have an opportunity to use our historic role in space science to now harness responsible finance for sustainable space. That is why today I am announcing our Plan for Space Sustainability, a package of announcements which demonstrates the UK’s commitment to using our regulatory leadership. ""This plan will ensure a safe and sustainable commercial space sector which rewards responsible satellite programs by lowering the costs of launch licenses and insurance for sustainable satellites and space missions.”",10
2022-07-06,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1636367/rolls-royce-hypersonic-missile-strike-russia-putin-china-north-korea-defence-news,Rolls-Royce developing hypersonic missile capable of reaching Russia in MINUTES,"The news comes as major world powers focus military attention on developing the super-quick projectiles in order to pose yet another layer of worry on global security. Russia, China, North Korea and the United States have all started research and development into such weapons – setting a precedent for future warfare and deterrence. Britain already has a track record in developing high-speed weaponry such as MBDA’s Meteor missile, which can fly at about Mach 4 (four times the speed of sound). The country has also awarded a contract to Rolls-Royce and its industrial partners in 2019 with the aim of developing hypersonic aircraft propulsion technologies. Hypersonic missiles are missiles which can travel faster than Mach 5. Mach 5 missiles can travel at a staggering 3,836mph – more than six times the speed of a standard passenger jet. A British Mach 5 missile could travel from the UK to Moscow, roughly 1,500 miles away, in less than half an hour. As Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier noted at the time, the plan was to enter into a two-year agreement with the industry to conduct design research, development, and experimentation of propulsion systems. Likewise, the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ben Key recently stated that the Royal Navy aspires to be a “global leader in hypersonic weapons"". The greatest current threat comes from continuous rhetoric emanating from Russian state television suggesting hypersonic nuclear missiles could be used to turn Britain into a nuclear desert in just 180 seconds. Chilling footage on Russian television has often shown mock-up models of the SARMAT missile – also known as the SATAN 2 – being used to hit targets around the globe, capable of carrying up to 14 warheads, and able to travel over 11,200 miles. The US has recently awarded three significant contracts to major defence companies to build a hypersonic missile defence system, aimed at intercepting such weapons in mid-air. In spite of efforts to develop its own hypersonic missile, recent tests by US military forces have resulted in failures. Further afield, China has been more successful in its attempts to build such weapons. According to a report in 2021, China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in August of the same year that circled the globe before speeding towards its target, demonstrating an advanced space capability that caught US intelligence by surprise. The Financial Times stated: “The remarkable thing about the test is that the warhead was launched into orbit, orbited Earth and re-entered the atmosphere, approaching its target at hypersonic speed.” The US has established defences against intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in Alaska, but the method used to attack the target by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) missile would be capable of evading fixed US defences by avoiding the expected polar ballistic trajectory that the US defences are designed to intercept. In January of this year, North Korea also took steps to test its own hypersonic missile programme. State media said the missile fired on Tuesday had successfully made a turn before hitting its target in the sea some 1,000km (621 miles) away. It marks North Korea's third reported test of a hypersonic missile, which can avoid detection for longer than ballistic missiles. The presence of Leader Kim Jong-un at the launch suggests the technology has reached the final stages of being operationally ready. Hypersonic glide missiles are dangerous for several reasons. Unlike ballistic missiles, which travel in a largely predictable parabola, making them vulnerable to interception, hypersonic weapons can traverse laterally, close to the earth's surface and hit a target in a much shorter flight time. In addition, hypersonic weapons can also achieve more than five times the speed of sound - or about 6,200km/h (3,850mph). All these features make them harder to track and intercept. With the added notion of being able to carry nuclear warheads, the race for hypersonic weapons lives up to the very name of the equipment itself as major nations race at hypersonic speeds to be one step ahead in adding such technology to national arsenals. Rolls-Royce has been contacted for further comment.",10

It comes as new research shows nuclear war would release smoke into the upper atmosphere and spread globally - plunging the world into a new Ice Age. In the post, Medvedev wrote: ""The idea of ​​punishing the country that has the largest nuclear potential is absurd in itself, and potentially threatens the existence of mankind."" Nuclear war between the superpowers risks triggering a ""Little Ice Age"" lasting thousands of years, according to researchers. Dr Cheryl Harrison, of Louisiana State University, confirmed that firestorms would release soot and smoke into the upper atmosphere, blocking out the Sun. This could result in crop failure around the world. In the first month following explosions, average global temperatures would plunge by around 13 degrees Fahrenheit which is more than during the most recent Ice Age.",10
2022-07-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1637162/world-war-3-warning-russia-plunge-planet-ice-age-horror-nuclear-weapons,World War 3 warning: Russia could plunge planet into ICE AGE with horror nuclear weapons,"In their study, earth scientist Professor Cheryl Harrison of the Louisiana State University and her colleagues ran various models of the impact of nuclear warfare on the Earth’s system. They considered the effects on both a regional and larger scale — and factored in the current nuclear warfare capabilities of the world’s nations. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, nine nations currently control more than 13,00 nuclear weapons. The researchers simulated the impacts of both nuclear conflict between Russia and the US, using 4,400 100-kiloton bombs, and India and Pakistan, involving 500 100-kiloton bombs. In all of their computer simulations, the team found that nuclear firestorms would release soot and smoke into the upper atmosphere, blocking out the sun and leading to crop failures all around the world. In the US–Russia scenario, more than 330 billion pounds of sunlight-blocking black carbon would be placed into the upper atmosphere, while an India–Pakistan conflict would produce 11–103 billion pounds of smoke and soot. Furthermore, the first month following the nuclear detonations would see average global temperatures plunge by around 13F — a greater shift that was seen in the last Ice Age. Prof Harrison said: “It doesn’t matter who is bombing whom. It can be India and Pakistan or NATO and Russia. “Once the smoke is released into the upper atmosphere, it spreads globally and affects everyone.” According to the researchers, the wake of nuclear war would see ocean temperatures fall rapidly — and this would not return to its pre-conflict state even after the smoke cleared. As the planet cooled, sea ice would expand by more than six million square miles, reaching thickness of six feet in some basins while blocking major ports - including Copenhagen, St Petersburg and Beijing's Port of Tianjin. In the worst case scenarios, these changes could last thousands of years. The combination of darkness and falling ocean temperatures would kill algae — especially in the Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. As algae are the foundation of the marine food web, this loss would cause a famine within the ocean, bringing aquaculture and fishing to a halt. Oceans take longer to recover than land, the researchers noted. In the worst-case US–Russia scenario, they added, surface ocean recovery would be likely to take decades, while the deep ocean would need hundreds of years. Paper author and climatologist Professor Alan Robock of Rutgers University said: “Nuclear warfare results in dire consequences for everyone. “World leaders have used our studies previously as an impetus to end the nuclear arms race in the 1980s — and five years ago to pass a treaty in the United Nations to ban nuclear weapons. “We hope that this new study will encourage more nations to ratify the ban treaty.” The team said their findings highlight the interconnected nature of Earth’s systems. Prof Harrison said: “The current war in Ukraine with Russia and how it has affected gas prices, really show us how fragile our global economy and our supply chains are to what may seem like regional conflicts and perturbations.” She added: “We can and must […] do everything we can to avoid nuclear war. “The effects are too likely to be globally catastrophic.” The full findings of the study were published in the journal AGU Advances.",10
2022-07-08,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1637493/nato-news-world-war-3-russian-navy-admiral-gorshkov-intercepted-norway,NATO alert: Russian warship intercepted off Norway as World War 3 fears erupt,"The incident comes just days after NATO heads met in Madrid to discuss the war in Ukraine, amid increasing tensions with Russia. At the summit, Western leaders pledged to increase the number of high readiness forces from currently around 40,000 to well over 300,000. The Allies also agreed on long-term support for Ukraine, as Kyiv's forces continue to try and repel Putin's invading army. The Admiral Gorshkov was followed by both Norwegian and NATO allied ships as it passed through waters off the coast of Western Norway on Tuesday. The Russian frigate had test-fired a Zircon hypersonic missile in the Barents Sea on May 28, before conducting training with other Northern Fleet warships from Severomorsk in June. A spokesperson for Norway's Joint Headquarters confirmed that a Norwegian vessel was currently shadowing the Russian warship. Major Elisabeth Eikeland told the Barents Observer: ""It is KV Bergen that follows Admiral Gorshkov now."" Due to ""operational"" reasons, the Major declined to give any more specific details about the incident. It is believed the frigate could be heading to Saint Petersburg to take part in the annual Navy Parade that will take place at the end of July. Russia has been developing and testing the Zircon missile for many years now. One of its main features is its speed, which gives the weapon its strategic value. The Zircon is able to travel at eight times the speed of sound (Mach 8) and carry a payload of around 300kg. The missile also produces a plasma cloud, that makes it effectively invisible to radars. The plasma cloud envelops the missile and absorbs any rays of radio frequencies, allowing it to avoid detection. It has an estimated range of 500 km at low levels and up to 750 km at a semi-ballistic trajectory. However, the latest test in May confirmed a range of about 1,000 km, according to the Northern Fleet. The Admiral Gorshkov was commissioned in 2018 and was designed to perform multiple roles. The frigate can perform long-range attacks against surface targets and ships, conduct anti-submarine warfare, as well as carry out escort missions. The Russian Naval Command is building more frigates of the same class, with the aim of having 20-30 such ships as part of its fleet. In an ironic twist, the first two frigates to be built had Ukrainian gas turbine engines. Following Russia's initial invasion of the Donbas in 2014, Kyiv stopped supplying Russia with any military technology. The Russian Navy is made up of four fleets - Pacific Fleet, Northern Fleet, Baltic Fleet and Black Sea Fleet. Before hostilities broke out in Ukraine, it had around 130,000 personnel and roughly 32 major surface vessels. Russian naval commanders suffered a major blow to their reputations, when Ukraine managed to sink the Black Sea fleet's flagship the Moskva in April.",10
2022-07-10,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1638192/Vladimir-Putin-news-nato-Belgorod-submarine-launch-Poseidon-drone-russia-latest,Putin unleashes new terrifying weapon as he turns the screws on NATO - WW3 fears erupt,"The Russian leader has been implacably opposed to the western military alliance throughout his presidency. He sees the organisation as an existential threat to his regime and has even blamed it for the war in Ukraine Over the years the Russian tyrant has spent billions of rubles on developing new weapons systems to counter the military might of his Western nemesis. These have included the development of deadly hypersonic missiles, such as the Avangard and Zircon. Now, the Kremlin has made another addition to its arsenal of lethal weapons designed to give it the edge over NATO. On Friday, the Russian Navy commissioned the ""Belgorod"" K-239 submarine at an official ceremony held at the Sevmash shipyards in the north of the country. The 600-foot sub is the longest in the world and weighs 24,000 tonnes. The Russians describe it as a ""research"" vessel that will enable them to carry out diverse scientific experiments in remote areas of the world's oceans. However, the Belgorod's design allows it to carry one of the most lethal atomic weapons in the world - the Poseidon ""doomsday"" drone. The Poseidon is a nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed intercontinental torpedo that can travel up to 5,000 nautical miles at a speed of 50-100 knots. The forward compartment of the submarine's conning tower can accommodate half a dozen of these deadly torpedoes. In a speech at the ceremony, Russia's Commander-in-Chief of the Navy hailed Russian scientists and engineers for their technological accomplishments. Nikolai Evmenov said: “Today is a significant day for us - the signing of the acceptance certificate for the Belgorod research submarine and its transfer to the fleet. ""When creating the ship, advanced achievements of science and the latest construction technologies were applied using the existing technical reserve."" He added: ""The submarine ""Belgorod"" opens up new opportunities for Russia in conducting various studies, allows conducting diverse scientific expeditions and rescue operations in the most remote areas of the World Ocean."" The Poseidon is roughly 20 metres long, can go 1,000 metres deep and has a range of at least 10,000km. Its ability to operate deep under the sea and its speed makes it very difficult to intercept. Moscow began developing the torpedo, as it sought to acquire a range of weapons that could evade the US missile defence system. The torpedo is referred to as a drone because it can navigate autonomously and could even have the ability to be remotely controlled. Analysts believe it has a titanium hull, which allows it to withstand pressure at extreme depths and could potentially be used as a seabed weapon. That is, the idea would be to pre-position the torpedo on the seabed and activate it from there rather than launching it from submarines. The yield of its warhead could be as high as 2 megatons, which is 100 times the force packed by the Hiroshima bomb and more than 10 times that of the latest version of the B61 nuclear bomb developed by the US. David Hambling, a technology journalist, told the website Euronews: ""Atomic torpedoes have existed way, way back, certainly since about the 1950s. ""And your normal torpedo is about half a metre in diameter and weighs a few tons ""This thing is at least 1.5 m in diameter and weighs tens of tons, so it's carrying a very big warhead.""",10
2022-07-13,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1640073/us-hypersonic-missile-test-chilling-warning-putin-Lockheed-Martin,US sends chilling warning to Putin as Lockheed Martin successfully test hypersonic missile,"Sources familiar with the situation said today (Wednesday), the US Air Force successfully tested the Lockheed Martin hypersonic missile this week, days after a similar attempt failed. The test comes against a backdrop of growing concerns Russia and China have had more success developing their own hypersonic missiles. Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 3,853 miles (6,200 km) per hour. The US Air Force successfully tested its Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) booster on Tuesday off the California coast, according to the sources. The ARRW is carried aloft under the wing of plane before it is launched toward its target. In previous tests, the weapon did not detach from the plane. In a separate successful hypersonic weapon test recently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) demonstrated its Operational Fires program, two people familiar with the matter said. The successful tests show progress among the myriad US hypersonic weapons development efforts, which have in cases been beleaguered by failed tests, growing questions about cost and increasing concerns the United States is falling behind in what has become a superpower arms race. Operational Fires is a ground-launched system that will ""rapidly and precisely engage critical, time-sensitive targets while penetrating modern enemy air defenses"". DARPA has requested and received $45 million for OpFires in fiscal year 2022. One of Lockheed Martin's concepts for the DARPA weapon is to use an exiting High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher, like those sent to Ukraine, to launch the weapon. Defence contractors hope to capitalise on the shift to hypersonic weapons not only by building them, but also by developing new detection and defeat mechanisms. Arms makers like Lockheed, Northrop Grumman Corp and Raytheon Technologies Corp have all touted their hypersonic weapons programs to investors as the world's focus shifted to the new arms race for an emerging class of weapon. On June 29, the US Department of Defense confirmed a flight test of a different hypersonic missile system in Hawaii had ended in failure as a result of a problem which took place after ignition. The test, undertaken at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii, was meant to launch the Common Hypersonic Glide Body atop a two-stage missile booster. The booster is specifically designed to launch the system and bring it to speeds exceeding of Mach 5. At that point the glide body detaches and uses its speed to reach the target. Putin has make frequent boasts about his country's advanced hypersonic technology, bragging that Russia has missiles which ""no other country has"". In March, Russia's defence ministry claimed its Khinzal hypersonic ballistic missile had destroyed a big underground arms depot in western Ukraine. If accurate, it marked the first use in the Kinzhal, which translates to Dagger in English, with the missile probably launched from the air via a MiG-31 warplane. At the time, James Acton, nuclear policy specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: ""I don't view it as that significant. ""I don't know how much of an advantage Russia is getting from using hypersonic missiles."" Back in 2019,Putin said the aim of such weapons was “to reliably protect Russia and our fellow citizens from external and domestic threats, to clearly anticipate potential risks and challenges and to improve their performance gradually and consistently”. In a speech at the Grand Kremlin Palace he said workers accomplishing the production of the weapons were “critical to the state”. He added: “Our army and navy have proved their high readiness, yet we intend to build up our defence capability and to deploy hypersonic, laser and other cutting-edge weapons which no other country has. “However, this is not a reason for threatening anyone. On the contrary, we are ready to do our best to promote the disarmament process with the help of these novel weapons, which have been created exclusively to guarantee our security in the face of growing threats to our country.” Earlier this week, Russia claimed new tests of its deadly hypersonic Satan-2 missile were imminent, with the weapon almost ready to into ""serial production"". Putin, who ordered his invasion of Ukraine on February 24, has nevertheless raised eyebrows in recent days with his increasingly belligerent language, not least his challenge to the West to send its soldiers to meet those of Russia on the battlefield. China, led by President Xi Jinping, has also invested in hypersonic technology. DF-ZF, which is designated by Pentagon as the WU-14, is a hypersonic missile delivery vehicle which has been flight-tested by China a total of seven times.",10
2022-07-16,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1641351/vladimir-putin-hypsersonic-missile-star-wars-space-race-defence-news,Putin’s missiles an ‘arsenal of accidents’ as new ‘Star Wars’ space threat emerges,"The news comes as Russian state television continues to produce material mocking Western nations and suggesting nuclear missiles could turn London and New York into a wasteland. With tension rising following the invasion of Ukraine, Putin has boosted his hypersonic, multiple-warhead carrying SATAN 2 missile will be ready for deployment by the end of the year. Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, one academic has evaluated where Putin’s missile programme stands, and how defences can be built to combat the risk. Greg Autry is a Clinical Professor of Space Leadership, Policy, and Business, and currently a Visiting Professor, Security Science and Technology Institute, Imperial College London. Discussing the ongoing Russian media frenzy over the use of such weapons, Dr Autry, a former NASA official, said: “It was frightening to see Putin do his brag show on WMDs. “Not just because of the technology but the entire megalomaniacal presentation was right out of a James Bond villain’s monologue. “The idea of automated Russian hypersonic and torpedoes carrying nukes is doubly scary because frankly, their equipment has performed so badly in space recently, where Progress, Soyuz and ISS modules have suffered alarming failure rates. “It's an arsenal of accidents waiting to happen and as much of a threat to the Russian people as to their supposed ‘enemies’. “Obviously the US, UK and other Western nations must be accelerating their defensive programmes in response to this.” With the missiles sporting ballistic and hypersonic capability, Professor Autry discussed the notion of reintroducing a Cold War-era “Star Wars” defence programme against both Russian and other types of missiles. He also discussed how technology has moved on from the Regan-era Star Wars Programme. Dr Autry stated: “I do believe the US should and will revive some concepts very similar to “Brilliant Pebbles” to protect our people, assets and allies from Russian and Chinese aggression. “In the 1980s the physics of the programme made sense but the supporting technology and space launch capabilities weren’t there to support it. “In particular, the computing power and software were not up to the task. “40 years later we have the processing power and AI software required for the task and we have a plethora of new launch systems and massive launch capacity. “We could deploy the system that Ronald Reagan’s team envisioned and once again dissuade Russian aggression. “More importantly it would send a clear message to Xi Jinping, whose regime presents a more credible threat to Western Democracy than Russia’s dying Oligarchy.” The esteemed academic went on to discuss the history of space defence. He said: “Firstly it is important to note that from day one of the space age, when Germany launched a V2 rocket out of the atmosphere on 3 October 1942, we were in a ‘space defence race’. “Since that time, the US, Russia, China other space powers have used space as a military domain for communications, observation and PNT systems. “US, Russia, China and India have all demonstrated their ability to field ASAT systems against these capabilities as well. “The Russians even put a cannon on an early human space station and test fired it. “They designed but did not deploy interceptor missiles for their later stations.” Speaking of the legal obligations, Professor Autry ended: “The primary legal limitation of any space system is that Article IV of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which the US, Russia, China and most nations have signed prohibits them from orbiting ‘nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction. “This is obviously a good thing IF the participants are inclined to follow treaties. “It is concerning in this case that China’s history with the HK treaty, WTO agreement, US Phase One Trade Agreement and many others show that Xi Jinping generally regards treaties and signed agreements as one-way products that only apply to the other signatory and do not bind China. “Russia has blatantly violated the INF as well. “It is also likely that Russia and China will portray Western defensive systems as 'WMDs' and claim they violate article IV.” Britain has also spoken of the importance of space defence. Referring to Britain’s launch of Prometheus Satellites, British Defence Minister Jeremy Quin had said: “Space technology is crucial for developing defence capabilities, and the launch of Prometheus-2 represents another important step forward for our homegrown space programme.” Cooperation between Russia and the West in space technology has fallen into stagnation since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia has vowed to end its cooperation with the International Space Station, and the Roscosmos boss in February asked “who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall onto the United States… or Europe.” His anger came following tough economic sanctions posed on Moscow following the invasion. The US continues to work on conventional anti-hypersonic missile defences, with Lockheed Martin secured a recent contract to build the technology.",10

Building on the pioneering high-speed propulsion technologies and extensive research and development capabilities of the partners, the HVX will set out to establish the UK as a leader in reusable hypersonic air systems. The HVX Programme will also undertake design work on experimental hypersonic vehicle concepts. A single engine hypersonic concept vehicle – Concept V - is being unveiled at Farnborough, one of a number of concept designs in active development. The intent is to expand HVX to include other leading aerospace companies in order to ensure additional expertise is deployed to support the delivery of such breakthrough technology. HVX will also aim to ensure the technologies developed can be put to use in other high Mach/hypersonic applications, although there was no specific mention of missile development. Mark Thomas, Chief Executive of Reaction Engines, said: “Reaction Engines is excited to be leading this ambitious, future-focused, programme with the Rapid Capabilities Office and Strategic Partners, bringing together the best of the best in technology, talent and innovation, to provide the UK with a unique capability in reusable hypersonic systems” John Wardell, Director Future Programmes, of Rolls-Royce, added: “This collaboration will enable Rolls-Royce to work effectively alongside Reaction Engines and our strategic partners to develop innovative and cutting-edge technologies that will provide our customers with the equipment needed to meet their military requirements. “The HVX Programme will bring together a unique opportunity to raise the UK’s profile in our ability to develop both the skills and technology in the fast evolving area.” Steve Simm, Air Systems Programme Manager of Dstl, explained: “Dstl is pleased to be involved in this exciting project, through three main aspects: use of MOD research funding to understand potential air system concepts and their feasibility; exploring potential operational utility of these concepts; maximising exploitation of the wider S&T Portfolio, such as the Hypersonics Weapons Research Programme.” In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Pentagon announced the US had recently successfully tested two Lockheed Martin Corp hypersonic missiles, amid growing concerns Russia and China have had more success developing their own hypersonic weapons. The US Air Force confirmed it successfully tested its Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) booster on Tuesday off the California coast. Reuters reported the ARRW test earlier on Wednesday in which the booster was carried aloft under the wing of a B-52H before it was launched. In previous tests, the weapon did not detach from the plane. A Lockheed spokesman said: “This second successful test demonstrates ARRW's ability to reach and withstand operational hypersonic speeds, collect crucial data for use in further flight tests, and validate safe separation from the aircraft.” Air Force Brigadier General Heath Collins, program executive officer, Armament Directorate, said, ""We have now completed our booster test series and are ready to move forward to all-up-round testing later this year."" In a separate hypersonic weapon test, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) confirmed it successfully performed the first test of its Operational Fires hypersonic weapon.

At the end of a week in which Britain confirmed its intention to develop hypersonic technology capable of flying at speeds in excess of five times the speed of sound - Mach 5 - Dr Kaushal, a Research Fellow in Sea Power at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said the UK’s groundbreaking deal with its two strategic allies, struck last year, left it well-placed. He explained: “It’s accepted that the next step of operation will be for the development of hypersonic capabilities and that makes sense, because you have the scenario where the Australians with their Skyfire programme, have forged on ahead of Britain. “So we have an area where, just as the Australians have benefited significantly from Britain's knowledge in areas like nuclear submarines, hypersonics is perhaps an area where Britain can benefit from the collective knowledge held in the AUKUS network.” On Monday, to coincide with the first day of the Farnborough Air Show, details were announced of a groundbreaking project entitled the Hypersonic Air Vehicle Experimental (HVX) Programme, involving industry heavyweights Reaction Engines, Rolls-Royce, the Royal Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO). Dr Kaushal suggested the Royal Navy would be a good fit for a hypersonic missile which could theoretically be launched a ship or a submarine. AUKUS, incorporating the initials of the three countries involved, is a three-way security deal confirmed on September 15, 2021. Dr Kaushal said: “It may not be just the Royal Navy, maybe an air launch rapid reaction, like the US is going after, being held by the RAF. “The long and the short of it is there's a framework that allows Britain to draw on knowledge held by in the form of AUKUS so I think that's definitely the direction of travel. ""What that looks like, I think it's way too early to say. “If a nation was to do it unilaterally it would be cripplingly expensive unless you were the US or China or Russia. ""But with something Iike AUKUS, you can potentially draw on the fact that some of your partners have already done some of the legwork in the research and development. “So it allows Britain to potentially skip a few steps in the same way that the Australians can with nuclear propulsion, which you know, they probably couldn't do that individually either.” There were significant complexities, Dr Kaushal cautioned, including the fact the Americans in particular have a number of regulations when it comes to the export of their most sensitive secrets. He said: “So there's a lot of details that would need to be worked out but I think AUKUS is definitely the most likely vehicle by which Britain can plough ahead with this sort of aspiration.” Speaking about the US test of is Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) booster on Tuesday off the California coast earlier this month, Dr Kaushal said: “There’s obviously still a way to go before you have an operational capability so we should caveat with that. ""But that being said, their success after the previous failed test is definitely a very positive development. “I don’t know if I’d go so far as to say game changer because it's one of a package of capabilities that allow the US to slowly claw back some of the ground that it has lost. “I think it's definitely significant and it's something the Americans need. “China fields and has fielded for a while working hypersonic weapon, the DF 17, so they're well past the testing phase. “Same thing goes for Russia - they are already integrating their hypersonic cruise missile on their ships and submarines, and they have fielded a hypersonic glide vehicle, the Avangard, since 2018. “The fact that the US is still very much in the testing and adoption phase suggests the US has some ground to cover.” Commenting on the HVX project, Air Vice-Marshal Linc Taylor, Chief of Staff Air Capability, Royal Air Force, said: ""This activity presents a unique opportunity to experiment with pioneering UK technology to inform the art of the possible and challenge traditional views on the cost and time associated with development and fielding of high-Mach platforms. “This partnership benefits from a series of aligned initiatives, integrating world class skills and technologies on a series of near-term experimentations to inform our future capability planning.""",10

Hypersonic missiles could offer a decisive military advantage to China and Russia. Andy Thomis, head of the defence company Cohort, said that his business is working on a project to defeat the weapons. Hypersonic missiles can travel five times faster than the speed of sound and are currently extremely difficult to shoot down. Mr Thomis, whose UK-based company supplies kit for Royal Navy submarines, spoke to The Daily Telegraph and said: “Being able to develop convincing countermeasures against them is a really important step forward. “It's a real challenge. ""There's no doubt about that.” Normal missiles can travel at about Mach 3, while hypersonics travel at Mach 5 or faster. As well as being incredibly fast, they have an unpredictable flight path. Both of these attributes make them difficult to track down. China reportedly fired a hypersonic projectile around the globe in a test last year. In May a Russian warship test-launched a Zircon cruise missile that can travel at nine times the speed of sound. The news comes after the US has successfully tested a Raytheon Technologies Corp air-breathing hypersonic weapon. This US attempt to catch up with Russian efforts is capable of speeds faster than five times the speed of sound. This makes the missile system the third successful test of that class of weapon since 2013. Hypersonic air-breathing missiles use air captured from the atmosphere to achieve sustained propulsion. Different hypersonic propulsion types also work in the vacuum of space. The Pentagon said in a statement on Monday, that the development program for the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) is being run by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.",10

In a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he added that Russia would leave its partnership with NASA onboard the station after fulfilling all of its obligations to its partners. He also noted that the space agency, which rivalled NASA during the space race in the 1960s and 70s, would now divert its attention towards developing a new Russian Orbital Space Station. This news has sparked fears among experts as the ISS needs Russian modules to stay in orbit, without which it could spin out of control and even crash into Earth. She said: “While it remains unclear whether the Russians will follow through with this announcement, it does add significant stress to the operation of the most successful international cooperation in space ever.” Russian-made modules constitute a critical part of the 400-tonne space station, as Roscosmos operates six of the 17 modules of the ISS – including Zvezda, which houses the main engine system. Professor Cobb warned that: “This engine is vital to the station’s ability to remain in orbit and also to how it moves out of the way of dangerous space debris. “Under the ISS agreements, Russia retains full control and legal authority over its modules.” If Putin decided to decouple these two modules, some experts have warned that the ISS would only survive for a short period of time before it enters Earth’s atmosphere. She continued: “Given that the Russian modules are necessary to station operations, it’s uncertain whether the station would be able to operate without them. “It’s also unclear whether it would be possible to separate the Russian modules from the rest of the ISS, as the entire station was designed to be interconnected. “Depending on how and when Russia decides to pull out of the station, partner countries will have to make tough choices about whether to deorbit the ISS altogether or find creative solutions to keep it in the sky.” This announcement is a culmination of months of hostilities between NASA and Roscosmos, with the former space chief Dmitry Rogozin even threatening to crash the ISS into Earth as a response to Western sanctions on Russia. In a series of tweets, he said: “If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the United States or Europe? “There is also the option of dropping the 500-ton structure to India and China. “Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? “The ISS does not fly over Russia, so all the risks are yours. Are you ready for them?”",10

They informed NASA yesterday that Moscow intends to keep its cosmonauts flying in the orbital lab until their own space outpost is built and operational. Based on remarks made by senior Russian space officials yesterday, this suggests that Russia will not leave the ISS before 2028, delaying their exit by four years at least. Earlier this week, Director General of Roscosmos Yuri Borisov noted that Russia would leave its partnership with NASA onboard the ISS after fulfilling all of its obligations to its partners. The new space head, who recently replaced Dmitry Rogozin, said that by 2024, Moscow will have begun to form the Russian Orbital Space Station(ROSS). Shortly after this announcement, Kathy Lueders, NASA's space operations chief, said that Russian officials told the US space agency that Roscosmos wished to remain in the partnership as Russia works to get ROSS up and running. She said: ""We're not getting any indication at any working level that anything's changed,"" adding that NASA's relations with Roscosmos remain ""business as usual."" This comes as yesterday Roscosmos published an interview with Vladimir Solovyov, the flight director for the ISS’s Russian segment. In the interview, he said that Russia must remain on the ISS until the ROSS is operational, which would likely be fully assembled in orbit sometime in 2028. Mr Solovyov said: ""We, of course, need to continue operating the ISS until we create a more or less tangible backlog for ROSS. ""We must take into account that if we stop manned flights for several years, then it will be very difficult to restore what has been achieved."" While NASA and other partners like the ESA have planned to operate the orbital station until 2031, Wendy Whitman Cobb, Professor of Strategy and Security Studies at Air University warned that Russia’s withdrawal from the ISS could mean the “early demise of the orbital lab.” She said: “While it remains unclear whether the Russians will follow through with this announcement, it does add significant stress to the operation of the most successful international cooperation in space ever.” Russian-made modules constitute a critical part of the 400-tonne space station, as Roscosmos operates six of the 17 modules of the ISS – including Zvezda, which houses the main engine system.

2022-07-28,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1647242/space-news-british-mars-rover-project-scrapped-nasa-esa,Britain's Mars project is SCRAPPED by NASA and ESA – despite already costing £23m,"The Sample Fetch Rover had been being worked on by Airbus engineers based in Stevenage for the last four years. It was originally envisaged as a critical part of the Mars Sample Return mission that will bring back rock and soil samples from the red planet in the 2030s — and could even help prove whether microbial life once lived on Mars. During a press conference yesterday, however, NASA and ESA revealed that the development project was being cancelled in favour of repurposing the Perseverance rover that is already collecting rock samples on the surface of Mars. The original plan for the sample return would have seen the Perseverance rover leave the samples it collected — held in special storage tubes — at a predetermined site on the surface of Mars for the Sample Fetch Rover to collect. It would have then transported these back to the Mars Ascent Vehicle to be launched up into orbit for a rendezvous with a spacecraft to transport them back to Earth. Instead, the Perseverance rover will now be retaining most of the samples it collects and transporting them to the Mars Ascent Vehicle itself. And as a backup — should the rover encounter any substantial problems, such as running out of power or being unable to dispense its stored sample tubes — a cache of samples will also be left in the nearby Jezero crater. NASA will be dispatching two more Ingenuity-class helicopters to Mars to recover these samples if circumstances require. NASA’s Mars Sample Return Programme director Jeff Gramling told the Telegraph that the decision to axe the Sample Fetch Rover was made following a recent re-evaluation of the capabilities of the Perseverance rover and the Ingenuity helicopter. He explained: “Based on that updated assessment, we have confidence that the [Perseverance] rover will be available to deliver samples to the sample retrieval lander in 2030. “Recent operations of the Ingenuity helicopter — which has completed 29 flights, 24 more than originally planned — has shown us the usefulness of rotorcraft on Mars. “In recent months, studies have evaluated the possibility of adding Ingenuity-class helicopters to retrieve samples. “We are confident that they could perform the role of backup to Perseverance.” According to the Telegraph, however, the space agencies’ decision may have been driven more by financial concerns, with budgets being slashed following the withdrawal of Roscosmos from various joint missions in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In fact, the Kremlin’s actions have forced a postponement of the planned launch of the European ExoMars’ Rosalind Franklin rover mission — which, originally set to launch this September from the Roscosmos-run Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, will likely not blast off now until 2028. And just this week, in fact, Russia announced that it would be pulling out of involvement with the International Space Station in 2024, six years earlier than was previously planned — before walking back that statement in a somewhat embarrassing U-turn. An Airbus spokesperson told the Telegraph: “We are very disappointed that — after all the hard work on developing the Mars Sample Fetch Rover — the programme has been cancelled. “With the skills and expertise built up on interplanetary rovers over the last 20 years, Airbus is determined to ensure this surface mobility capability that could also be used on the Moon is maintained for the UK space sector.” A spokesperson for the UK Space Agency told the Telegraph that “the decision to move away from using a dedicated Sample Fetch Rover is disappointing for UK industry.” However, they added: “The expertise we have developed in robotics and rover technology over many years can be applied to future missions to Mars and the Moon. “UK scientists are already involved in the science operations of the NASA Perseverance rover. “Mars Sample Return is one of the most important missions in a generation and the UK Space Agency will continue to work closely with ESA and NASA on the endeavour.” The mission, they added, will provide “a significant opportunity for UK scientists to study the first samples returned to Earth.”",10
2022-07-31,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1647924/The-best-warships-in-the-world-COMPARED-how-they-fare-against-Russia,The best warships in the world COMPARED – how they stack up against Russia’s,"A longstanding tradition of the Soviet Union, Russian Navy Day was revived by President Vladimir Putin in 2003. Every year since, on the last weekend of July, celebrations include a two-hour fleet review and the ceremonial raising of the St. Andrew’s flag, the ensign of the Russian Navy. With the war in Ukraine still ongoing, the risk of armed conflict between Russian forces and the West is at its highest in decades, leading many to wonder how tough the Russian Navy would be to beat. When considering what makes one warship dominant over another, displacement, length, speed, weaponry, and technology all play a vital role. The most powerful navies around the world are fronted by an impressive destroyer that symbolises the country’s might, but a few are considerably mightier than the rest. South Korea’s Sejong the Great-class destroyers are potentially the most technologically advanced warships afloat today. Designed to see off virtually any threat from sea, land or air, the South Korean navy operates three of these vessels coming in at 545ft and bearing a combat displacement of 11,000 tonnes. The weapons, sensors, fire controls, propulsion, and other systems are all fully-automated and controlled by the American-made Aegis Combat System, the most advanced in the world. With a top speed of over 30 knots, the ships are loaded with 128 missiles and have two hangars for helicopters. The Royal Navy’s most effective combat ships are Daring-class vessels, headed by the 500ft-long HMS Daring. The first of the class entering service in 2009, the sixth and last was commissioned in 2013. With a displacement of 9,200 tonnes and a top speed in excess of 30 knots, the main role of the class is to provide air defence for the fleet. The ships are packed with the latest radars, sensors and anti-aircraft missiles and their armaments will eventually include famed long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. Requiring a crew of just 190, the ship can onboard a complement of 60 Royal Marine Commandos and a Merlin helicopter on the flight deck. China’s most formidable warships are Luyang III class destroyers, coming in at 515ft long and displacing 7,500 tonnes fully loaded. Since the first of the class entered service in 2014, China has been building the ships at an astonishing pace, with 18 in active service and 25 more planned. With a top speed of 30 knots, the ship’s offensive capabilities are the envy of navies across the globe. The ships can hold and launch a variety of missile types, from surface-to-air to anti-submarine, a defensive close-in weapon system capable of firing 10,000 rounds a minute, a 130mm main gun and a “Chinese Aegis” centralised control system rivalling the American original. The biggest destroyers currently in service in the US Navy are Arleigh Burke-class warships, coming in at 510ft long and with a displacement of 9,500 tonnes. The ships were also the first to feature the highly advanced Aegis Combat System and incorporate stealth shaping in the design to elude enemy radar. First entering service in 1991, the US Navy currently operates 70 of the destroyers, having improved the design over the course of the last 30 years. Their armaments include anti-aircraft missiles, Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, anti-submarine missiles, two defensive close-in weapons systems, a 127mm dual-purpose gun and a hangar housing two helicopters. The pride of the Japanese navy are Atago class destroyers, primarily tasked with providing air defence for the fleet but carrying a versatile range of weaponry. Built between 2004 and 2008, the Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force operates two of these modern destroyers, both 541ft long with a displacement of 10,000 tonnes fully-loaded and operated by a crew of 300. Integrating a mix of Japanese and American-made systems, these vessels also feature the Aegis Combat System, alongside a 127 mm dual-purpose gun in a stealth-shaped mount, a range of anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-ballistic missiles, as well as a helicopter hangar. The crown jewel of the Russian Navy is the Pyotr Velikiy, the largest surface combatant ship in the world with a displacement of 28,000 tonnes fully-loaded. A Kirov-class battlecruiser commissioned in 1998, the 827ft long gunboat serves as the flagship of Russia’s northern fleet. Nuclear-powered, the ship boasts a top speed of 32 knots and the world's largest missile battery, at 352 missiles, as well as torpedoes, 76mm armour plating, three helicopters and a crew of 710. Although the Soviet Union originally commissioned four Kirov-class vessels, only the Petr Velikiy is currently in active service, while one other, the Admiral Nalhimov, is undergoing delayed renovations and is expected to return to service this year or next.",10

A Soyuz-2.1v, the rocket launched from the Ministry of Defence's Plesetsk Cosmodrome today (August 1), TASS said. The outlet, quoting a Kremlin statement, said: ""The Soyuz-2.1v space rocket, which launched at 23:25 [Moscow time] from the Plesetsk state test cosmodrome, was accepted for escort by ground means of the Main Test Space Centre named after G.S. Titov of the Space Forces Air -Space Forces."" It added that an upper section of the rocket with a military satellite separated from the second stage of the Soyuz-2.1v, putting it into orbit. Russia's Ministry of Defence noted in its statement that Soyuz-2 space rocket system flight tests began at Plesetsk in November 2004, replacing the Soyuz-U, which operated from the cosmodrome from 1973 to 2012. A total of 435 Soyuz-U launches took place from Plesetsk with 430 spacecraft put into orbit. It comes after Russian space officials told counterparts in the US Moscow would like to keep flying its cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) until their own orbital outpost is built and operational. The latest indications are Russia is at least six years away from ending an orbital collaboration with the US which dates back more than 20 years. A schism in the ISS program seemed closer at hand last week, when Yuri Borisov - the newly appointed director-general of Russia's space agency Roscosmos - surprised NASA by announcing Moscow intended to withdraw from the space station partnership ""after 2024."" Kathy Lueders, NASA's space operations chief, said in an interview Russian officials later told the US space agency that Roscosmos wanted to remain in the partnership as Russia works to get its planned orbital outpost, named ROSS, up and running. Ms Lueders said: ""We're not getting any indication at any working level that anything's changed."" The space station, a science lab spanning the size of a football field and orbiting some 250 miles above Earth, has been continuously occupied for more than two decades under a US-Russian-led partnership which includes Canada, Japan and 11 European countries. It offers one of the last vestiges of cooperation between the United States and Russia, though its fate has been called into question since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The Ukraine conflict also sparked tensions between Roscosmos and the European Space Agency (ESA). A formal agreement to extend Russia's ISS participation beyond 2024 has not yet been reached. Ms Lueders said NASA, Roscosmos, ESA and the station's other partners planned to discuss the prospect of extending each other's presence on the laboratory to 2030 during a meeting on Friday of the board that oversees the station's management. Vladimir Solovyov, the flight director for the space station's Russian segment, said: ""We, of course, need to continue operating the ISS until we create a more or less tangible backlog for ROSS. ""We must take into account that if we stop manned flights for several years, then it will be very difficult to restore what has been achieved."" Russia's Soyuz-2.1v launch comes after The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) launched a trio of Yaogan 35 military reconnaissance satellites to orbit last Friday. The Chinese space program has launched 27 orbital missions so far this year, with 26 successes and one failure. Only the United States has conducted more orbital launches this year, according to NASA.",10

During a two-week exercise in Lithuania, Royal Navy divers used robots and autonomous vessels to aid with their operations including Remus – a torpedo-shaped submersible which can survey and map possible ordnance. Divers from Delta Diving Unit, from the Diving & Threat Exploitation Group trained alongside Canadian, Lithuanian, US, Dutch and Estonian colleagues in disarming improvised explosive devices. Navy chiefs are dramatically increasing the number of robotic and autonomous minehunters which can be controlled from greater distances to protect Britain’s sailors. Ukrainian Navy personnel have begun learning how to operate Royal Navy Sandown-class minehunters. The Ukrainian Naval Capabilities Enhancement Programme was struck last year and includes selling two surplus RN Sandown class vessels to Ukraine. There are currently approximately 80 Ukrainian trainees and support staff based in the UK. Boris Johnson has since gone on holiday as has Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, despite warnings of inflation further soaring and of the economy entering the longest recession since the financial crisis. With ministers taking a back seat as the Tory party is gripped by the leadership contest, both men were away from Westminster when the Bank of England detailed the brutal outlook. Mr Zahawi insisted he was still working and had a call with Governor Andrew Bailey after interest rates were hiked from 1.25percent to 1.75 percent, the biggest increase for 27 years. During his time as prime minister, Mr Johnson has gained notoriety for appearing in high-vis jackets and even on a raid with police, as well as touring factories. He famously spoke of shaking the hand of a Covid patient during the pandemic, before he later fell gravely ill with the disease.",10

Over the past few months, Russia repeatedly issued similar threats, with former Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin even threatening to crash the 400 tonne orbital lab to Earth. Experts were alarmed by this, as Russian-made modules constitute a critical part of the space station. Roscosmos operates six of the 17 modules of the ISS – including Zvezda, which houses the main engine system, without which the lab may not be able to control itself for long. Given that Moscow has “full control and legal authority over its modules”, fears have been raised that Putin could order those modules to be decoupled from the ISS, causing it to come hurtling back to the atmosphere. However, NASA has a backup has had a contingency plan in case of such a scenario, and will be able to make a controlled reentry to Earth, according to space policy experts. Speaking to Express.co.uk, Wendy Whitman-Cobb, Professor of Strategy and Security Studies at Air University said: “If Russia were to pull out [of the iSS] and NASA and the rest of the partners were unable to find some way to work around that, I imagine they would go ahead with a controlled reentry as has been the plan all along. “The ISS partners have planned a controlled reentry all along. “When the US deorbited its Skylab in the 1970s, debris fell in Australia so they are very cognizant of making sure that debris will fall in unpopulated areas. “I certainly can’t speak to Rogozin’s motivations for making those statements but they absolutely can control its reentry.” In March, Mr Rogozin reacted furiously to western sanctions on Russia, even threatening to crash the space station. In a series of tweets, he said: “If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the United States or Europe? “There is also the option of dropping the 500-ton structure to India and China. “Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? “The ISS does not fly over Russia, so all the risks are yours. Are you ready for them?” He also shared a horrifying map all the locations on Earth that the space station could crash into. Even then, former US astronaut Scott Kelly previously rubbished these claims, telling ABC News: ""I never thought I would hear anything so outrageous. ""I think it is just a crazy threat. It is not really based on reality. ""We do have the ability to control the orbit of the space station independent of the Russian space agency, so I don't really see that happening.""",10

The space agency head Yuri Borisov noted that after 2024, Russia would fulfil all its obligations towards its partners in space, which includes NASA, and proceed to leave the orbital lab. He also noted that moving forward, Roscosmos would divert its attention towards developing a new Russian Orbital Space Station (ROSS). Since the West hit Russia with sanctions, Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos repeatedly threatened to abandon the ISS, evening suggesting that Russia could cause the 400-tonne station to crash to Earth. Russian-made modules constitute a critical part of the ISS, as Roscosmos operates six of the 17 modules of the orbital lab– including Zvezda, which houses the main engine system. Space policy experts previously warned that Moscow has “full control and legal authority” over the modules, without which the station may not function. However, these threats to abandon the ISS may be empty, according to Wendy Whitman-Cobb, Professor of Strategy and Security Studies at Air University. Speaking to Express.co.uk, she said: “It’s actually unclear whether they would be able to decouple. “Russia has been very vague about exactly what pulling out of the ISS would look like or mean. “They might allow the other partners to continue using the Russian modules or they might insist on shutting them down completely. “If that were the case, it’s still unclear whether the ISS would be able to function without them or successfully remove them.” She added that even the actual timeline for Russia leaving the ISS is unclear. After announcing that Roscosmos would pull out sometime after 2024, they walked back on their statement, telling NASA that they would like to stay onboard until the ROSS is built, which would be 2028 at the earliest. Prof Whitman-Cobb dismissed these statements, noting that the delays in building the ROSS could lead to the Russian cosmonauts staying on the ISS for longer. She said: “I have a hard time believing they’ll be able to design, build, and deploy a space station in that time frame only because it’s very difficult and their military industry seems to be focused on other things at the moment. “I do think it’s possible that they stick with the ISS for as long as they don’t have their own viable option.” The ISS is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2031, only three years after Russia’s planned departure. This suggests that in the event of delays surrounding the construction of the Russian space station, Roscosmos could be forced to stay on the ISS for the entirety of its lifespan.",10
2022-08-28,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1661469/raf-jets-uk-airports-russia-ukraine-war,RAF to move in to regional airports in first time since WW2 as Russia tensions mount,"The concept, called Agile Combat Employment (ACE), has been in the works for more than a year and was primarily intended to be used in potential hotspots around the globe, such as the Indo- Pacific, Middle East or even Nato's Eastern flanks in Europe. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine and concerns of a subsequent war involving Nato have now seen ACE accelerated and extended to within the UK, senior sources have confirmed. It will be the first time since Britain declared war on Germany in 1939 that the RAF has drawn up plans to disperse fighter aircraft to different parts of the country. The aim is to ensure elements of the RAF’s Quick Reaction Force will survive direct attacks on their bases. Eurofighter Typhoons based at RAF Lossiemouth in Moray protect the northern sector of the UK, while those at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire look after the southern sector. However other combat jets and larger aircraft will also be re-based in times of ""imminent crisis"". A trial in September will see Typhoons and F-35s based in Norfolk, Lincolnshire and Scotland scattered in small groupings and based discreetly on the outskirts of a select number of regional airports which have runways able to accommodate them. ACE will also be used another way, by ensuring that regional airports are equipped with enough fuel and supplies to allow fighter jets to land there and carry out quick “operational turnarounds” before taking off again. The concept was first made public in December by Air Vice-Marshal Ian Duguid who, as commanding officer of No 1 Group, is responsible for coordinating air assets to defend the UK in times of crisis. “It doesn't necessarily mean overseas. It might be to move aircraft from a main operating base to an airfield that doesn't normally host fast jets, C-l 7s or A400s,” he said. ""Over the past 30 years we have consolidated our main operating bases and reduced the number we have. While concentrating our forces is more efficient, it also provides potential vulnerabilities.” “Under ACE, airfields such as St Mawgan - run by a commercial contractor - or Leuchars, which is retained as a diversionary airfield for Quick Reaction Alert forces, could host F-3Ss. ""We are also working with some of the commercial regional airports to see if, in times of crisis, we could utilise their airfields or use them for refuelling and operational turnarounds.” MOD civil servants have spent the last year visiting a selection of regional airports to ascertain how many aircraft and back-up facilities, plus ground crews, could be accommodated in an emergency. Though battlefield turnarounds were commonly used in Iraq and Afghanistan, where RAF Chinooks or even army tankers would deliver aviation fuel to far-flung corners of the desert, the concept of temporary basing has required more planning to ensure that necessary apparatus will be in place before they are used. According to sources, negotiations have been ""complex"" and have involved financial inducements to private airport operators. “The reality is that precision weapons with the right amount of warhead can successfully target and destroy hardened aircraft shelters. We saw this in the first Gulf War. So effectively, they act as targets,” said former Air Commodore Andrew Lambert. “Just after 9-11 When I was in Norway we examined the idea of deploying F-16s at local airports ""Deploying fast jets and other types of aircraft to regional airports makes sense because it makes the problem of targeting these aircraft more difficult.”",10

Late last year, Russia used an anti-satellite missile to blow up one of its own satellites in an event known as an ASAT test. This caused thousands of pieces of space debris to fly towards the international space station, forcing astronauts to duck for cover in their spacecraft over fears the space junk would smash into them. Meanwhile, according to defence officials, Beijing has tested a new combination of a hypersonic glide vehicle and a fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS). FOBS is a warhead delivery system that uses a low earth orbit towards its target destination. According to DefenseNews, it is an unpredictable capability that can stay in orbit for as long as the user determines and then de-orbit as part of its flight path. The chief of U.S. Strategic Command, Adm. Charles Richard, warned that China successfully tested that capability, which was “never before seen in the world”. Speaking at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium earlier this month, he warned that the military must now look to overhaul its missile defence systems and develop better versions that can tackle threats aimed at the US. He said: “I am not convinced at all we’ve fully thought through the implications of what that weapon system means. “You’re gonna get decreased warning timelines, difficulties in attribution and an increased threat to our traditional space and missile defences and forces.” According to an agenda for the meeting, scheduled for September 6 and 7, reviewed by DefenseNews, is concerned with ""how China and Russia's potential development of fractional orbital bombardment systems and space-to-ground weapons could impact US deterrence and strategic stability, as well as to consider US response options to the potential development of such capabilities by any adversary"". This meeting will be attended by senior US Department of Defence leaders, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks. The meeting will also be attended by the Defense Policy Board, which is an influential advisory group comprised of former national security officials. Aside from the FOBS, Beijing has also tested a wide range of anti-satellite weapons concepts, including spacecraft which could grapple with other satellites and pull them out of orbit, According to the US intelligence community’s 2022 Annual Threat Assessment in March, China “is fielding new destructive and nondestructive ground and space-based antisatellite (ASAT) weapons"". It noted: “Russia continues to train its military space elements and field new antisatellite weapons to disrupt and degrade US and allied space capabilities, and it is developing, testing, and fielding an array of nondestructive and destructive counter-space weapons — including jamming and cyberspace capabilities, directed energy weapons, on-orbit capabilities, and ground-based ASAT capabilities — to target US and allied satellites.""",10

While the threat broadly applies to a number of companies, Elon Musk's SpaceX could be targeted in particular, as Musk has confronted Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at a meeting of the United Nations' open-ended working group (OEWG) on reducing space threats, Konstantin Vorontsov, a member of the Russian Foreign Ministry said space was becoming a ""launching pad for aggression and war."" In a statement, he said: ""We would like to underline an extremely dangerous trend that goes beyond the harmless use of outer space technologies and has become apparent during the events in Ukraine. ""Namely, the use by the United States and its allies of the elements of civilian, including commercial, infrastructure in outer space for military purposes. ""It seems like our colleagues do not realise that such actions in fact constitute indirect involvement in military conflicts. Quasi-civilian infrastructure may become a legitimate target for retaliation. ""Actions of the Western countries needlessly put at risk the sustainability of peaceful space activities, as well as numerous social and economic processes on Earth that affect the well-being of people, in particular in developing countries."" ""At the very least,"" the statement added, ""this provocative use of civilian satellites is questionable under the Outer Space Treaty, which provides for the exclusively peaceful use of outer space, and must be strongly condemned by the international community."" Of all the Western companies aiding Ukraine, Elon Musk and his Starlink satellites are likely to anger Russia over the past year after the SpaceX CEO handed Ukraine more than 10,000 dish antennas since the start of Putin’s invasion. These satellites have been deployed in settings from governmental buildings, hospitals and schools — to helping to control drones used to combat the invading Russian forces. Aside from Starlink, commercial satellite imagery firms such as Planet, Maxar and BlackSky have also played a crucial role in the war effort against Russia, providing intelligence by taking pictures of the conflict from above and sharing them openly. For example, images by Planet Labs in early August showed that a Ukrainian attack on a Russian military base in Crimea caused more damage than Russia had suggested in public reports. The Russian diplomats went on to warn the UN against adopting ""fragmented, non-inclusive rules for regulating space activities, that do not take into account approaches of all UN Member States and seek to ensure space dominance of a small group of states."" Instead, it urged member countries to ""focus on assuming national and international obligations to not place weapons of any kind in outer space (including in orbit around the Earth and on celestial bodies) and prohibit the threat or use of force against or with space objects, as well as introduce a complete and comprehensive ban on strike weapons in outer space for use against space objects."" Russia previously put the West on high alert after it used an anti-satellite missile to blow up one of its own satellites in an event known as an ASAT test late last year. It caused thousands of pieces of space debris to fly towards the international space station, forcing astronauts to duck for cover in their spacecraft over fears the space junk would smash into them.

One official warned that the US is ""nowhere near where we need to be"" when it comes to electromagnetic spectrum capabilities. These concerns were likely sparked by geopolitical events and tests conducted by Russia and China in the past year. Late last year, Russia used an anti-satellite missile to blow up one of its own satellites in an event known as an ASAT test. This caused thousands of pieces of space debris to hurtle toward the International Space Station, forcing astronauts to duck for cover in their spacecraft over fears the space junk would smash into them. Meanwhile, according to defence officials, Beijing has tested a new combination of a hypersonic glide vehicle and a fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS), which is a warhead delivery system that uses a low earth orbit towards its target destination. Speaking at the US Air Force Association's Air, Space & Cyber Conference on Sunday, multiple officials voiced their fears as China advances in space technology and the US has floundered. Lt. Gen. Leah G. Lauderback, the US Air Force's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and cyber effects said ""The answer is no, we’re not ready,"" according to Air & Space Forces Magazine. Meanwhile, Lt. Gen. Kevin B. Kennedy Jr., commander of Air Forces Cyber, highlighted the importance and immediacy of the threat they are facing from Russia and China. He said: ""We’re talking about the PRC, and Russia, and think about the spectrum of conflict. We clearly are in competition with both. ""We’re being targeted. You, personally, are being targeted right now by our adversaries whether it’s via social networks, devices, or the information that you’re using to accomplish your mission."" The officials were particularly concerned about China's rapid rise. In 2015, Beijing launched the People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force, which was tasked with addressing space and cyber operations like information and electromagnetic warfare. Space Force Brig. Gen. Gregory J. Gagnon said: ""As we pivot to China, what gives me concern is how fast they’re moving. We have to tell that story. Because that’s the story that I think people who make resource decisions need to hear."" He warned said Beijing has over 260 satellites watching the Pacific Ocean designed ""to provide warning and to provide strike capability if directed by leadership."" According to DefenseNews, the FOBS, which is being tested by China, is an unpredictable capability that can stay in orbit for as long as the user determines and then de-orbit as part of its flight path. The chief of U.S. Strategic Command, Adm. Charles Richard, warned that China successfully tested that capability, which was “never before seen in the world”.

2022-10-05,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1678835/spacex-news-elon-musk-russia-ukraine-update-vladimir-putin,Elon Musk: Russian cosmonaut hitches lift on SpaceX rocket - despite Ukraine war,"One of Elon Musk’s SpaceX rockets has launched from Florida carrying the next long-term International Space Station crew - including a Russian cosmonaut, despite ongoing international tensions centre over the war in Ukraine. A high-ranking official of the Russian space agency Roscosmos said shortly after the launch that the flight marked ""a new phase of our cooperation"" with the US space agency NASA. The SpaceX launch vehicle, consisting of a Falcon 9 rocket topped with a Crew Dragon capsule dubbed Endurance, lifted off into clear skies at noon EDT (1600 GMT) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. The two-stage, 23-storey-tall Falcon 9 ascended from the launch tower as its nine Merlin engines roared to life in billowing clouds of vapour and a reddish-orange fireball. The mission is notable for the inclusion of Anna Kikina, 38, the lone female cosmonaut on active duty with Roscosmos, making the first spaceflight of a Russian launched from US soil in two decades. As the spacecraft entered Earth orbit, Kikina radioed her thanks to NASA, Roscosmos and their International Space Station (ISS) partners for ""giving us this great opportunity”. She said: ""We're so glad to do it together.” Kikina, who had trained in the United States for the flight since spring 2021, was essentially swapping places with a NASA astronaut who took her seat aboard a Russian Soyuz flight to the ISS last month under a new ride-sharing deal signed by NASA and Roscosmos in July. Also on board were two Americans and a Japanese astronaut. About nine minutes after the launch, the rocket's upper stage delivered the Crew Dragon into a preliminary orbit as it streaked through space at nearly 16,000 miles per hour (27,000 kph). The reusable lower-stage booster flew itself back to Earth and landed safely on a drone recovery vessel at sea. The four-member crew and their autonomously flying capsule were expected to reach the ISS in about 29 hours, on Thursday evening, to begin a 150-day science mission aboard the orbital laboratory some 250 miles (420 km) above Earth. The mission, designated Crew-5, marks the fifth full-fledged ISS crew NASA has flown aboard a SpaceX vehicle since the private rocket venture founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk began sending US astronauts aloft in May 2020. The latest team was led by Nicole Aunapu Mann, 45, a veteran combat pilot making spaceflight history as both the first Native American woman sent to orbit by NASA and the first woman to take the commander's seat of a SpaceX Crew Dragon. Moments after reaching orbit, as mission control wished the crew ""Godspeed,"" Mann radioed back, ""Awesome. Thank you so much to the Falcon team. Whew! That was a smooth ride uphill."" Commander Mann, a US Marine Corps colonel and combat fighter pilot, is also among the first group of 18 astronauts selected for NASA's upcoming Artemis missions, aimed at returning humans to the moon later this decade. The designated pilot for Wednesday's launch was Mann's NASA astronaut classmate and fellow spaceflight rookie Josh Cassada, 49, a US Navy aviator and test pilot with a doctorate in high-energy particle physics. Rounding out the crew from Japan's space agency JAXA was veteran astronaut Koichi Wakata, 59, a robotics expert making his fifth voyage to space. The Crew-5 team will be welcomed by seven existing ISS occupants - the Crew-4 team consisting of three Americans and an Italian astronaut - as well as two Russians and the NASA astronaut who flew with them to orbit on a Soyuz flight. The new arrivals are tasked with conducting more than 200 experiments, many focused on medical research ranging from 3-D ""bio-printing"" of human tissue to the study of bacteria cultured in microgravity. ISS, which is the length of a football field, has been continuously occupied since November 2000, operated by a US-Russian-led consortium that includes Canada, Japan and 11 European countries. It was built in part to improve relations between Washington and Moscow following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of Cold War rivalries that spurred the original US-Soviet space race. NASA-Roscosmos relations have been severely tested since Russia invaded Ukraine in February and the United States imposed sweeping sanctions against Moscow. At a post-launch NASA-SpaceX briefing on Wednesday, Sergei Krikalev, head of human spaceflight for Roscosmos, said he and his boss, agency chief Yuri Borisov, were seeking to ease tensions after Borisov's predecessor, Dmitry Rogozin, raised questions about the future of the ISS partnership. Krikalev cited bilateral teamwork in space dating back to the Apollo-Soyuz era in 1975, saying, ""We started our cooperation many years ago, over 40 years ago, and will continue our cooperation as long as I can imagine."" The deal inked by the two sides in July paved the way for resuming routine joint US-Russian flights to the ISS. Musk himself waded in controversy over Ukraine this week after floating the idea of a negotiated solution which would see the annexed peninsula of Crimea become a part of Russia.",10
2022-10-06,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1678945/russia-news-putin-submarine-poseidon-torpedo-nato-satellite-pictures,Russian sub armed with ‘apocalypse’ Poseidon torpedo spotted in chilling satellite pics,"Chilling satellite images have captured Russia's mega submarine which is said to be fitted with Putin's apocalypse’ Poseidon torpedoes. Expert naval observers have spotted what they believe is the Belgorod K-239 submarine operating in the Barents Sea - a part of the Arctic Ocean - in satellite pictures despite fears it had previously vanished. It comes after NATO feared it had lost track of the mega 604ft, 30,000 tonne, nuclear-powered submarine. But in satellite images released by H I Sutton, the huge boat is spotted in the Barents on September 22. And another satellite photo shows the mega sub operating on September 27 - just a day after the explosions at the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic. Writing for Naval News, H I Sutton said: ""We noted the submarine leaving Severodvinsk in the White Sea a few weeks ago, and she was in the Barents Sea by September 22. She was still there on September 27. ""On both dates, she was observed on the surface. This is not unusual for new submarines like this. ""This could be routine, to test a new weapon system. Or it could principally be political, as a demonstration. Testing nuclear weapons, even without warheads, may be part of Russia’s chosen nuclear escalation ladder."" The sighting of the Belgorod will end speculation the mega sub was involved in the attack at Nord Stream. The Kremlin continues to add to its arsenal of lethal weapons designed to give it the edge over NATO. The 600-foot sub is the longest in the world and weighs 24,000 tonnes. The Russians describe it as a ""research"" vessel that will enable them to carry out diverse scientific experiments in remote areas of the world's oceans. However, the Belgorod's design allows it to carry one of the most lethal atomic weapons in the world - the Poseidon ""doomsday"" drone. The Poseidon is a nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed intercontinental torpedo that can travel up to 5,000 nautical miles at a speed of 50-100 knots. The forward compartment of the submarine's conning tower can accommodate half a dozen of these deadly torpedoes. The Poseidon is roughly 20 metres long, can go 1,000 metres deep and has a range of at least 10,000km. Its ability to operate deep under the sea and its speed makes it very difficult to intercept. Moscow began developing the torpedo, as it sought to acquire a range of weapons that could evade the US missile defence system. The torpedo is referred to as a drone because it can navigate autonomously and could even have the ability to be remotely controlled.",10

Will Whitehorn was speaking after the UK Space Agency (UKSA) said the first horizontal launches from the new Spaceport Cornwall have been pencilled in for next month - in what would be a huge step forward for the British space industry. Asked whether the proposed launch was a good thing, Mr Whitehorn, the chairman of Seraphim Space Investment Trust PLC, said: “No - in my opinion it’s not a good thing, it’s essential. “It’s about the very future of the United Kingdom. If we can't establish the ability to launch our own sovereign space satellites in this country we're not going to have a space industry in 10 years' time. “And it's a really important industry because already exporting billions of pounds’ worth of stuff all over the world.” With a “sovereign launch capability”, company would bypass the UK, despite that fact that a quarter of all small telecommunications satellites are currently built here, Mr Whitehorn warned. He added: “Secondly, from a defence point of view, we need this ability if we're going to defend our interests in space. “Because foreign powers who would want to threaten us with, for instance, shooting down a satellite have got to know that we got the ability to launch lots more at very short notice. “So this type of system is essential for that in my opinion, I think the UK should develop its own 747 Based on the Virgin Orbit system and have our own sovereign capability permanently in the UK.” Everything - from moving goods around the globe, navigation and agriculture - now depended on having access to space, Mr Whitehorn stressed. He said: “So this is not a good idea, it's an essentially brilliant thing that the UK needs to grab with both hands and do all the time. “I’m personally planning to try and persuade the government that we need to develop our own capability of this type.” The ongoing international tensions with both Russia and China meant it has never been more important for Britain to have launch capacity than it currently was, Mr Whitehorn explained. He added: “Look what's already happened - we had a Mars rover being built by Airbus in the UK that can't launch anymore because we can't launch on the Soyuz and therefore, it's going to have to be repurposed. “OneWeb had their satellite launch cancelled in Russia, and the Russians have taken away some of those satellites and keep them because they were already there when the war started. “There's a shortage of launch capacity around the world and satellites are essential for even feeding ourselves. This has moved beyond a nice idea.” Mr Whitehorn resisted the temptation to say the opening of the spaceport, situated at Newquay Airport, near the coast of Cornwall, was overdue. However, he went on to add: “This is a system I originally worked on the first phase of developing and so it's very close to my heart and I proposed to the government that we did something about getting sovereign launch capability back in 2008. “It's great to see it finally happening, but now we need to move with some urgency to giving us a permanent capability. I'm very excited about it. “We should celebrate the fact we're now doing it and then move urgently to be able to do it, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.” A statement issued by the UKSA earlier this week said: “The first launch will take place from Spaceport Cornwall in the south-west of England. It will be what is known as a ‘horizontal launch’. “A specially modified Boeing 747 from Virgin Orbit called Cosmic Girl, with a rocket attached under its wing, will take off from a runway. In flight, the LauncherOne rocket will launch from the wing, taking multiple small satellites into orbit. “The plane will then return to the Spaceport, able to launch more satellites in future.” Express.co.uk understands the plan is for the first launch to take place sometime next month, with the date likely to be confirmed on Monday.",10
2022-10-13,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1682167/putin-news-russia-nuclear-submarine-K-3-Leninsky-Komsomol-ussr,"Putin parades 3,000 tonne Soviet nuclear submarine through streets of Russia","Vladimir Putin has paraded a 3,000-tonne nuclear submarine nicknamed The Whale through the streets of Russia. The gigantic craft, which measures 352ft - roughly the length of a football pitch - made its way through Kronstadt, close to St Petersburg, yesterday. It will now be transformed into a museum as the culmination of an ongoing project at the nearby Nerpa shipyard, where its hull was repaired and the radioactive parts of the reactors were removed. A remarkable video aired of state-run Russia 1 showing its journey through the city. The K-3 Leninsky Komsomol, which was built in Molotovsk in 1957, was the USSR’s first nuclear submarine. The following year, it was commissioned, sailing to Zapadnaya List on the Kola Peninsula in Russia’s remote northwest. In June 1962, the sub initially know simply as the K-3 - broke through the ice in the North Pole, marking a massive milestone for the Soviet Union. Only the world’s third nuclear submarine, the K-3 Leninsky Komsomol was powered by two water-cooled reactors and rapidly become a potent symbol of the USSR’s underwater military capabilities. Skipper Lev Mikhailovich Zhiltsov, was eventually given the title Hero of the Soviet Union - the highest possible honour. In recognition of the North Pole achievement, the sub was given the title Leninsky Komsomol. In 1967, it was also tasked with following an American ballistic missile submarine. But within months disaster struck, with a fire breaking out in the vessel’s hydraulic system as it sailed through the Norwegian Sea. As a result, carbon dioxide-type gas filled two compartments, killing 39 crew members. An investigation eventually blamed a sailor smoking on board for starting the blaze and after extensive repairs, the sub put back to sea. It was eventually decommissioned in 1988, having been in service for three decades, and moved to Nerpa shipyard in 2005. The first visitors are scheduled to be able to set foot inside the vessel, at the Museum of Navy Glory, next year. Originally the plan was to put the K3 alongside Lenin - the USSR’s first nuclear powered icebreaker - in Murmansk. However, the plan shift to Kronstadt, a naval base located on Russia's Kotlin Island.",10
2022-10-23,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1686659/uk-oneweb-india-russia-putin-roscosmos,UK launches 36 satellites after Russia held them hostage in a humiliating blow for Putin,"The 36 OneWeb satellites held hostage by Russia back in March have been launched by an Indian rocket in a humiliating event for Moscow. Back in March, Russia's space agency Roscomos threatened to block the launch of OneWeb's satellites, warning that the company only had two days to provide ""comprehensive legally binding"" guarantees that they would not be used for military purposes. In what was likely a retaliation for the harsh Western sanctions slapped down on Moscow for Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, Moscow appeared to be holding the launch hostage and was making demands. But instead of caving to pressure piled on by Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin, OneWeb then decided to call off the scheduled launch from Baikonur, and in the process cut off its ties with the space agency. Now, OneWeb's satellites, which are used to beam signals in 3G, 5G, LTE and Wi-Fi for high-speed internet access to all corners of the globe, have been launched by a GSLV rocket from Sriharikota island in India. This takes the firm, which the UK Government bought a stake in back in 2020 to rescue the company from bankruptcy, closer to completing its goal of having a network of 648 satellites up in space. The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), which is India's biggest and most capable rocket, blasted off from the Satish Dhawan spaceport in the state of Andhra Pradesh at 00:07am on Sunday morning. In total, it took around an hour and a half to get all the satellites unloaded at taken to an altitude of 600km, although it will still take a few weeks before the ion engines on the spacecraft move them to their operational, 1,200km-high, polar orbits. The Sunday launch will bring the total number of OneWeb satellites in orbit above the Earth to 462, over 70 percent of the total OneWeb requires to achieve worldwide coverage with its first-generation constellation. The rollout is expected to be complete by the middle of next year. Sunil Bharti Mittal, Executive Chairman of OneWeb, said: “Today’s launch is a significant milestone for OneWeb. This new phase of our launch programme from India brings us a step closer to not only enhancing our global coverage but also delivering connectivity in India and South Asia, particularly to the communities who need it most. “I am proud to be here in Sriharikota, with our partners, ISRO and NSIL. Today my dream of having an Indian element in the OneWeb constellation has been realized. This launch with ISRO and NSIL opens up the space sector in India with the possibility of billions of dollars flowing into the country. “I would like to laud our Hon’ble Prime Minister for his visionary leadership in opening up the space sector for private participation. I also extend my gratitude to ISRO, NSIL and the Indian authorities for matching the precise schedule for this launch, which has been done in a record time.” While this serves a different function to the EU's Galileo, which Britain left after Brexit, industry figures have said OneWeb satellites could one day be adapted to carry out the same function. Until Sunday's launch, all of OneWeb's systems had been all launched on Russia's Soyuz rocket. While the latest launch was pushed back by Russia, the firm is now getting nearer to its end goal, meaning it could be closer to rivaling Galileo too. The UK bought a £400million share in OneWeb back in July 2020, possibly with the aim of replacing Galileo - the EU's satellite navigation system which is used for position, navigation and timing (PNT) services - further down the line. While OneWeb currently only provides out broadband services, it has been tipped to one day be adapted to carry out similar functions to Galileo. Speaking to the Science and Technology Committee back in February, Kwasi Kwarteng, who was Business Secretary at the time, said: “In terms of positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), which Galileo is all about, that is something that we could do ourselves. “Some people say ‘we can’t do this, there is no way there we could do PNT outside Galileo’. I don’t happen to agree with this.I think through our strategic acquisition of our stake in OneWeb, that does give us a possibility for future capability in PNT.”",10
2022-10-25,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1687767/nasa-news-iss-scrambles-swerve-russian-space-debris-anti-satellite-test,NASA scrambles as ISS forced to swerve to avoid Russian space junk from missile test,"NASA announced that the International Space Station (ISS) was forced to dodge debris from a satellite blown by Russia during a missile test. According to a statement by the space agency, the research space lab took evasive manoeuvres at 1:25 AM UK time yesterday, adding that the move had no impact on station operations. They calculate that without intervention, a fragment from the destroyed satellite could have passed within about three miles of the station. To avoid this fragment, the ISS team had to fire the thrusters on Progress 81, a Russian cargo ship that was attached to the station, for a total of five minutes and five seconds. This move, known as a ""Pre-Determined Debris Avoidance Maneuver"" (PDAM), was carried out in an effort to ""provide the complex an extra measure of distance away from the predicted track"" of the debris fragment, agency officials said. They wrote: ""The PDAM increased the station’s altitude by 2/10 of a mile at apogee and 8/10 of a mile at perigee and left the station in an orbit of 264.3 x 255.4 statute miles."" This debris was created by Russia late last year when it used an anti-satellite missile to blow up one of its own satellites in an event known as an (anti-satellite) ASAT test. The ASAT missile was launched from the ground in November and obliterated a defunct Soviet satellite known as Cosmos 1408, which had been out of commission since the 1980s. In a press conference at the time, US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price slammed Russia for being reckless, adding that it could endanger astronauts in space. He said: ""The test has so far generated over 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris and hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris that now threaten the interests of all nations. ""This test will significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, as well as to other human spaceflight activities."" Astrophysicist and satellite tracker Jonathan McDowell, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, told Space.com at the time: ""There's really no reason they should have used such a big target. They could have used a smaller target and generated less debris."" The ISS has previously had to avoid the debris left from the Russian ASAT test in June this year, where it performed a similar manoeuvre to avoid framnets from Cosmos 1408. Then Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin wrote on Telegram: ""I confirm that at 22.03 Moscow time, the engines of the Russian Progress MS-20 transport cargo ship carried out an unscheduled manoeuvre to avoid a dangerous approach of the International Space Station with a fragment of the Kosmos-1408 spacecraft."" Inmarsat CEO Rajeev Suri previously told Express.co.uk said that debris in space creates problems lasting for decades. Mr Suri, whose company is a British satellite telecommunications provider, said: ""Any country that does anti-satellite testing creates a risk of space debris…The problem with space debris is that they last for years and decades and that is the problem. ""It is an additional problem that these direct ASAT tests by a small number of major space powers over the past several decades have created debris. ""In April 2022, the US announced a moratorium on these tests in space and the hope is that as many countries as possible will adhere to this in the near future. That is what we need to do as space should be respected. Russia has done it, China has done in it, the US, India and other countries as well."" But ASAT tests are not the only cause of space debris. Mr Suri warned: ""There are three risks, one is space debris itself and that is to do with ASAT testing but also to do with the fact that we used to have 1,400 in the year 2014. Now there are about 5,200 satellites. ""The low-earth orbit, in particular, has a plan for a number of mega-constellations and the projects talk about 100,000 satellites by 2030. That means that the risk of collision grows even more. To add to that there is the risk of ASAT testing. ""The third risk is orbital exclusion that companies or countries can occupy a particular orbit whereby there is no place for anybody else. So the economic risk of monopoly formation and that also adds to the physical collision avoidance risk. What we are calling for is regulation to be able to manage this better.""",10

Over the past year, Mr Musk's Starlink satellite network has played a critical role in Kyiv's defence by granting them internet access. This prompted fury from the Kremlin, as a senior official now warns that such commercial space systems could risk becoming legitimate military targets if they continue to work with Ukraine. Senior foreign ministry official Konstantin Vorontsov warned the United Nations against a ""worrying trend"" developing in space. Speaking at a meeting of the UN's committee on disarmament and international security, Mr Vorontsov said: ""We would like to specifically stress an extremely dangerous trend that goes beyond the harmless use of outer space technologies and has become apparent during the latest developments in Ukraine. ""Namely, the use by the United States and its allies of civilian, including commercial, infrastructure elements in outer space for military purposes. ""Apparently, these States do not realise that such actions in fact constitute indirect participation in military conflicts. Quasi-civilian infrastructure may be a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike. ""Western actions needlessly put at risk the sustainability of peaceful space activities, as well as numerous social and economic processes on Earth that affect the well-being of people, first of all in developing countries. ""At the very least, this provocative use of civilian satellites is questionable under the Outer Space Treaty, which only provides for the peaceful use of outer space, and must be strongly condemned by the international community."" Of all the Western companies aiding Ukraine, Mr Musk and his Starlink satellites are likely to anger Russia the most, as over the past year the SpaceX CEO handed Ukraine more than 10,000 dish antennas since the start of Putin’s invasion. These satellites have been deployed in settings from governmental buildings, hospitals and schools — to helping to control drones used to combat the invading Russian forces. Such if Putin were to attack SpaceX satellites, it would signal a sharp escalation of tension between Russia and the US, as no country has ever carried out a missile strike against an enemy satellite. Michelle Hanlon, co-director of the University of Mississippi School of Law's Air and Space Law program said: ""This threat has brought us to a brink that we've never been to before. There’s always been a sense that this could happen, but never has somebody actually said that they might do that out loud."" Aside from Starlink, commercial satellite imagery firms such as Planet, Maxar and BlackSky have also played a crucial role in the war effort against Russia, providing intelligence by taking pictures of the conflict from above and sharing them openly. For example, images by Planet Labs in early August showed that a Ukrainian attack on a Russian military base in Crimea caused more damage than Russia had suggested in public reports. Iridium chief executive Matt Desch said: ""It's really irresponsible to talk about shooting anything down in space for any reason. Space has gotten to be quite messy. If somebody starts shooting satellites in space, I'd imagine it would quickly make space unusable."" Ms Hanlon warned that under the laws of armed conflict if Russia were to strike a private US company's satellite, it could be regarded as an act of war that could justify a US response. On Thursday, White House spokesman John Kirby said that any attack on US infrastructure would be met with a response, however, he gave no details on that remark. Brian Weeden, a space policy analyst at the Secure World Foundation: ""The legal aspects of all this are really murky at the moment. We don’t have any examples of wartime uses of force against satellites - there’s really nothing to go off of."" Russia previously put the West on high alert after it used an anti-satellite missile to blow up one of its own satellites in an event known as an ASAT test late last year. It caused thousands of pieces of space debris to fly towards the international space station, forcing astronauts to duck for cover in their spacecraft over fears the space junk would smash into them.",10

HMS Victorious was somewhere in the North Atlantic when disaster struck about six weeks ago.An electrical component on board the £3million Vanguard-class sub caught fire and the commanding officer took precautionary measures. Breaching the surface risked revealing its location to Russia, which constantly plays cat-and-mouse with Western submarines.The cause of the blaze was a fault in a self-contained electrical module that converts AC power to DC.Its crew helped battle the fire, but luckily the module also has four built-in carbon dioxide injectors to use in such emergencies. They release a quantity of gas into the electrical component, helping to extinguish the fire.Naval sources told the Sun the fire was rapidly contained.After assessing the damage, the captain ordered the sub to return to base at HMNB Clyde, in Faslane. HMS Victorious is one of four Trident submarines that carry out nuclear patrols, known as Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD). A Royal Navy Spokesperson told The Telegraph the boat was not in the role of CASD at the time of the incident.Instead, it came as the boat was preparing to take part in an undisclosed exercise with the US.A Royal Navy spokesperson said: “The Continuous At Sea Deterrent is unaffected, but we do not comment on the details of submarine operations.""The 30-year-old vessel is overdue a major refit that will see it, and its sister subs, replaced by an equal number of Dreadnought-class boats from the 2030s.The move will cost around £31billion and will see the new vessels also armed with Trident 2 missiles.The weapons are capable of creating 100-kiloton blasts and have a range of 4,000 nautical miles (7,400km).",10
2022-11-12,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1695764/putin-news-russia-zircon-hypersonic-missiles-tsirkon-weapon-mach-9-ukraine-war,"Putin orders dozens of terrifying hypersonic 6,700mph nuclear-capable Zircon missiles","Vladimir Putin has ordered dozens of terrifying hypersonic Zircon nuclear-capable missiles that can travel at eye-watering speeds of 6,700mph, it has been claimed. The Mach 9 weapon, known as 'Tsirkon' in Russia, could reportedly come into service before the end of this year. Putin is continuing to spend huge sums on the development of new nuclear-capable missiles, which he claims are ""unstoppable"" by Western air defences. The new order of the Zircon nuclear-capable missiles has not been officially announced, but reports of it were carried out by Russian state news agency TASS. A source close to the Russian Defence Ministry said: ""The first contract for the production of a batch of Tsirkons was signed in the summer of 2021. An additional contract was signed this autumn."" The insider added the most recent contract will see the delivery of ""several dozen"" Zircon 6,670mph missiles in 2023. The missile, which has been seen fired from the Admiral Gorshkov warship, has been the subject of several rigorous tests. Earlier this year, a missile fired from the vessel in the Barents Sea hit a target more than 600 miles away in the White Sea. The news will come as a boost to Putin's crumbling war plan in Ukraine, particularly as doubts remain over whether his 15,880mph Satan-2 hypersonic missile - or Sarmat will be deployed in the timescale originally stated. This week, Russia would only say a second test of the horrifying weapon ""may"" come before the end of the year. But this is in contrast to what the Kremlin had been hoping for, which was intending the mammoth missile would be fully deployed with its forces before the start of 2023. Nearly a year ago, Putin announced a ""flawless"" salvo launch involving the Zircon. In January, Deputy Defence Minister Alexey Kryvoruchko said: ""The state tests of the Zircon sea-based hypersonic cruise missile are nearing completion. From 2022, serial deliveries will begin."" The Russian President has boasted ""our newest [Zircon] missiles fired from the sea at sea targets, and land targets"". He added: ""The tests were carried out successfully, flawlessly. This is a big event for our country, a significant step in improving Russia's security, in increasing (our) defence capability."" Putin had also said it was in ""serial production"", calling the weapon ""truly unparalleled … in the world"". The TV Zvezda channel, which is owned by the Russian Defence Ministry, boasted: 'The speed of the Zircon hypersonic missile is so high that it prevents the opponent's air defence system from detecting its impact in time. In fact, its launch will be known only after the target has been hit."" Previously, the captain of the Admiral Gorshkov frigate Igor Krokhmal had said: ""No one will see the missile launch or its flight. They will only see when the missile hits the target. ""A surface target, a coastal target. I don't think there will be anything to counter this in the next few years."" The launch of terrifying new and destructive missiles comes as Putin comes under massive pressure over Russia's continued humiliating collapse during the Ukraine war. Russian troops have suffered numerous devastating losses in the battlefield and have been pushed back out of key regions by heroic Ukrainian counter offensive operations. The latest humiliation has seen some 30,000 Russian troops withdraw from Kherson, leading to jubilant scenes among Ukrainians in the city.",10
2022-11-13,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1695828/russia-South-Atlantic-pipeline-putin,UK foils Putin's plot to sabotage vital South Atlantic pipeline,"The mile-long floating pipeline is crucial for delivering fuel to RAF, US Space agency and navy bases on Ascension Island, a remote British Overseas Territory located 1,047 nautical miles from Guinea, Africa to the east, and 2,030 nautical miles from Brazil to the West. Used as a vital staging post for British troops retaking the Falkland Islands 40 years ago, the 35 square mile island now also hosts a UK-US signals intelligence facility, one of the four ground antennas used for the Global Positioning System (GPS) navigational system, a European Space Agency rocket tracking station and a NASA-operated Autonomous Telescope (MCAT) used for tracking orbital debris which could endanger spacecraft and astronauts. Its fuel is also essential to both Royal Navy and US vessels which operate in the area. The volcanic island’s rocky coastline means that fuel delivered by tanker to its vast oil storage depot must be carried through the pipeline, which “floats” on the water’s surface on Clarence Bay and is easily visible. Concerns were raised last month when British security services gained access to satellite images which indicated that Russia had become markedly interested in the stretch of pipe. The images, which surfaced shortly after attacks on two Nord Stream pipelines, have been examined by technical specialists, sources say. A Whitehall decision was then taken to fly a security team to the small island to guarantee the flow of fuel day and night. Though sources would not reveal what measures were put in place, they are thought to have focused on the possibility of underwater sabotage by Russian divers or small, remotely operated sea drones launched from a submarine. The operation took place during scheduled maintenance by marine specialists employed by the MoD's Defence, Equipment and Support agency. Ascension Island is subject to a constant South Atlantic swell and is surrounded by rough volcanic seabed, which causes the pipeline’s chains and mooring components to wear out quickly. Technicians replaced more than 170 metres of mooring chain, as well as a damaged mooring buoy and two one-tonne clump weights, which secure the buoys to the seabed. While undertaken annually, the maintenance operation was pushed forward by three months to accommodate the other “special security measures'', sources say. The presence of 11-foot Galapagos Sharks in the waters surrounding the island meant that the final inspection of all work had to be carried out remotely, with underwater cameras. Last night a Whitehall source said: “The security measures taken, which are actually long overdue, were prompted by information received which indicated that a certain foreign power had developed an interest in the pipeline."" ""We are now satisfied that these new measures will ensure the safety of this floating pipeline so that full operations continue unhindered.” Russia is suspected to be behind the sabotage of two of its pipelines which deliver natural gas to Germany through the Baltic Sea, and which were partially destroyed by a series of explosions in September. Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 were not operational after protests by the European Union over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. An MOD Spokesperson said: “The protection of our personnel and facilities is of vital importance. We do not disclose the measures we take to provide security but all measures are kept under constant review.”",10
2022-11-20,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1699052/nuclear-war-devastate-worlds-oceans-famine-study-russia-ukraine,"Nuclear war would ‘devastate the world’s oceans’ and cause years-long famine, study finds","Even a limited nuclear war would eject so much smoke into the atmosphere that the resulting cooling would “devastate the world’s oceans” and cause a years-long famine. This is the warning of biogeochemist Dr Tyler Rohr of the University of Tasmania and his colleagues, who modelled the climatic and oceanic impacts of a nuclear conflict. Their work builds on the research of Carl Sagan and his colleagues in the early eighties, which first highlighted the potential for a nuclear winter and subsequent widespread famine following atomic warfare — work cited by both US president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 when they declared that nuclear war could never be won. However, Vladimir Putin’s actions around the Ukraine war have once again raised fears of a nuclear conflict, despite recent agreements that the US and Russia would hold further talks around the “New START Treaty” for nuclear arms reduction. In their new analysis, Dr Rohr and colleagues modelled the scenario of a nuclear war between the US and Russia — specifically, one that resulted in 150 billion tons of soot from burning cities reaching the upper atmosphere. They said: “We found that the low light and rapid cooling would cause large physical changes to the ocean, including a dramatic expansion of Arctic sea ice. Crucially, this ice would grow to block normally ice-free coastal regions essential for fishing, aquaculture and shipping all across Europe.” Three years after the war, the analysis revealed, Arctic sea ice would have expanded by 50 percent, icing up the Baltic sea year-round and closing major seaports like Copenhagen in Denmark and St Petersburg in Russia. According to the team, even when they considered a more limited conflict between the nations of India and Pakistan could still release a horrific 27–47 billion tons of soot into the upper atmosphere. The resulting cooling and sea ice expansion, they said, would “severely compromise” shipping throughout northern Europe. The researchers added: “Worse, the sudden drop in light and ocean temperatures would decimate marine algae, which are the foundation of the marine food web — creating a years-long famine. While the whole ocean would be affected, the worst effects would be concentrated at higher latitudes, including all of Europe — and especially in the Baltic states, where ocean light is already in short supply. “The waters in the Arctic and North Atlantic would bear the brunt, likely triggering the collapse of the entire ecosystem. “Although fisheries are currently a relatively small sector of the European economy, there might be added pressure to look toward the sea for food, should land-based agriculture systems collapse, leaving the continent with few options for food security.” Dr Rohr and his colleagues said that while they were expecting their modelling to show more sea ice and less marine algae in the wake of a nuclear winter, they were taken aback by how long the effects endured. They explained: “Our model ocean remained materially transformed for decades after a war, long after temperature and light conditions returned to their pre-war state. Sea ice would settle into a new expanded state where it would likely remain for hundreds of years.” Global marine productivity, however, was predicted to return to — and even exceed — its original state within ten years of the conflicts. This occurs, the team explained, because of enduring changes to ocean circulation that would push deep nutrients up to the surface, feeding phytoplankton. The team added: “Unfortunately, such ‘good news’ never reaches Europe, as marine productivity remains compromised in the Arctic and North Atlantic relative to the rest of the world. This occurs because the new environmental state favours a different, larger, type of marine algae that can actually strip nutrients from the surface ocean once they die and sink.” The problem with ocean recovery, the researchers explain, is that water both heats and cools very slowly — and the oceans are highly stratified, with different water masses layered on top of each other. This, they explained, gives the ocean a much longer “memory” than the atmosphere. They noted: “Once disturbed, many changes are either not reversible on human timescales or are unlikely to return to their initial state.” The researchers concluded: “Given these stark insights, there is a moral imperative to ask what could and should be done to prevent a nuclear conflict. Recently, a new take on an old philosophy has begun to percolate out of Oxford. “The idea, known as ‘longtermism’, posits that proper accounting for the sheer number of possible future human lives should prioritise nearly any action that even slightly reduces the risk of a human extinction. “This logic comes with all the standard trappings of trying to do maths with morality, but it starts to make a lot more sense when you realise that the risk of an extinction-level event — and thus the chance we could avert it — isn’t actually unimaginably low.” The team concluded: “Even a more limited conflict could push our oceans into a fundamentally new state that lasts much, much longer that we would have expected. Understanding the length, and the weight, of these timescales, should be forefront in our calculus of ongoing diplomacy.”",10

The Admiral Vladimirskiy is ostensibly a scientific research vessel. In reality, however, the 6,600-tonne ship - which includes 20 linguists among its 176-strong crew - has the capacity to conduct covert underwater reconnaissance as part of the Russian Navy’s project 852, and reports directly to both the Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI) and the GRU foreign intelligence agency. Its six-day surveillance mission began on November 10 off the coast of Eastern Scotland, an area where critical underwater energy infrastructure is located and serviced by a fleet of offshore supply vessels. UK intelligence services warned last month of a potential increase in activity by the Kremlin to identify cables as part of a wider ’targeting' exercise - in preparation to strike at Europe’s high-tech infrastructure. And defence secretary Ben Wallace confirmed how serious the threat is when he announced an order for two new navy ships to protect the network, confirming that ""our internet and energy are highly reliant on pipelines and cables”. But the Admiral Vladimirskiy had an even more important mission, sources say: surveillance on Royal Navy vessels. Analysis of tracking data shows that, while remaining outside UK territorial waters, it deliberately moved to a position off the coast of Montrose, where the British research vessel HMS Enterprise was conducting tests on various experimental autonomous craft. These included the Royal Navy’s new autonomous missile launcher. The 41-foot-long Maritime Demonstrator for Operational Experimentation vessel - dubbed ""Madfox"" - can carry US-made Switchblade loitering missiles and be remotely controlled by two sailors. It has been designed by the Royal Navy’s “NavyX Experimental Team” to provide support for Royal Marines during coastal assaults. and last year performed its first successful night-time amphibious operation where, without being detected, it observed a target - providing live imagery using its onboard cameras - before firing a missile. HMS Enterprise was also trialling an array of experimental ecoSUBs, a new type of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) developed by Plant Ocean in partnership with the National Oceanographic Centre in Southampton. The sea drones are less than one metre in length and weigh only 4kg, and are therefore known as ‘micro-AUVs’. Despite their small size, however, they are capable of diving to 500m and have sufficient battery power to stay underwater for several hours. The Admiral Vladimirskiy left UK waters on Wednesday, three days after HMS Enterprise docked in Aberdeen. Royal Navy sources said the Russian mission was curtailed due to countermeasures, which included deploying the supercarrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and its escort, HMS Northumberland, which has the capability of ""intercepting as much from the Vladimirskiy as they were trying to get from us."" Former naval commander and defence expert Tom Sharpe said: ""The Vladimirskiy is an extremely capable and well-run vessel, and Russia is always keen to get whatever intelligence it can get on our latest developments. ""We can quite easily counter any visual spying by simply continuing to move location or introducing other vessels to run interference. ""But what the Vladimirskiy also does is to bring in information from the electronic spectrum from as much as 20 miles away. ""It would, of course, be useful for Russia to get electronic signatures or a thumbprint on the radar that Madfox uses, for instance, and its presence can be quite a pain when trialling new UAVs.""",10
2022-11-28,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1702587/zombie-viruses-ancient-permafrost-thawing-climate-change-public-health-risk,Zombie viruses revived via thawing ancient permafrost demonstrates ‘public health risk’,"Researchers have shown that it is possible to revive “zombie viruses” that have been frozen in the ground in Russia for up to a whopping 48,500 years. In their study, environmental virologist Professor Jean-Michel Claverie of the Aix-Marseille University and his colleagues identified more than a dozen new microbes, although they were careful to only revive ones incapable of infecting humans. However, they cautioned, the findings highlight a potential health risk from climate change — that the thawing of once-frozen ground across parts of the Northern Hemisphere could unleash deadly new viruses that might even trigger a pandemic. The researchers wrote: “One quarter of the Northern hemisphere is underlain by permanently frozen ground, referred to as permafrost. Due to climate warming, irreversibly thawing permafrost is releasing organic matter frozen for up to a million years.” Most of this material, they noted, decomposes into carbon dioxide and methane, further enhancing the greenhouse effect. However, they added, “Part of this organic matter also consists of revived cellular microbes […] as well as viruses that remained dormant since prehistoric times. “While the [scientific] literature abounds on descriptions of the rich and diverse prokaryotic microbiomes found in permafrost, no additional report about ‘live’ viruses have been published since the two original studies describing pithovirus (in 2014) and mollivirus (in 2015).” These reports — also by Prof. Claverie and his team — concerned Mollivirus sibericum and two species of the giant virus of the genus Pithovirus (P. sibericum and P. massiliensis), both of which were recovered from a 30,000-year-old ice core from Siberia. The scarcity of studies on such viruses, the team continued, “wrongly suggests that such occurrences are rare and that ‘zombie viruses’ are not a public health threat.” In their new study, Prof. Claverie and his colleagues studied samples from seven different ancient Siberian permafrost soils, as well as one sample from the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East, and one modern sample from the Lena River in Yakutsk — the coldest city on Earth which is located on continuous permafrost. Samples were taken not only from soils and a melting ice wedge, but also from the stomach contents of a woolly mammoth dating back around 28,600 years and the intestines of a fossil wolf dated back more than 27,000 years. The team report successfully characterised 13 new viruses from five different clades. These included cedratvirus, megavirus, pacmanvirus, pandoravirus and pithovirus. The oldest microbe — a pandoravirus collected from a sample taken 53 feet below a lake at Yukechi Alas, Siberia — is estimated to have been frozen for a whopping 48,500 years. In order to ensure their research would pose no health risk, the team only looked for viruses capable of infecting a microscopic, single-celled organism called acanthamoeba — one of the most common amoeba in soils and freshwater. The team said: “A decisive advantage of our approach was to choose Acanthamoeba spp. as a host, to act as a specific bait to potentially infectious viruses, thus eliminating and risk for crops, animals or humans.” They added: “We are using its billion years of evolutionary distance with humans and other mammals as the best possible protection against an accidental infection of laboratory workers or the spread of a dreadful virus once infecting Pleistocene mammals to their contemporary relatives. “The biohazard associated with reviving prehistoric amoeba-infecting viruses is thus totally negligible, compared to the search for ‘palaeoviruses’ directly from permafrost-preserved remains of mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, or prehistoric horses.” Such “risky projects”, the team note, are presently being undertaken in the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR — often called the “Vector Institute” in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia. Regardless of the wisdom of the Vector Institute’s experiments, long-frozen viruses may still end up presenting a threat as global warming thaws out the world’s permafrost. Dr Claverie and colleagues warned: “We believe our results with Acanthamoeba-infecting viruses can be extrapolated to many other DNA viruses capable of infecting humans or animals. “It is thus likely that ancient permafrost will release these unknown viruses upon thawing. How long these viruses could remain infectious once exposed to outdoor conditions (UV light, oxygen, heat) — and how likely they will be to encounter and infect a suitable host in the interval — is yet impossible to estimate. “But the risk is bound to increase in the context of global warming when permafrost thawing will keep accelerating, and more people will be populating the Arctic in the wake of industrial ventures.” A preprint of the researchers’ article, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, can be read on the bioRxiv repository.",10

The unveiling ceremony on Wednesday saw the 6,000-tonne vessel, which is nearly 500ft long, make its first surface contact at River Clyde, HMS Glasgow was towed into deep water by a barge for transport to another facility to complete construction. Engineers from BAE Systems involved in the float-off of the Type 26 Frigate have been specifically trained using a 3D visualisation suite which gives engineers access to a ""full digital twin"" of the ship. HMS Glasgow will be towed back to the facility of the defence giant in Scotstoun on the River Clyde for its next construction phase. It will also undergo additional trials and commissioning. The giant Frigate, which has been under construction since 2017, is scheduled to be delivered to the Royal Navy in the mid-2020s. The new Type 26 class will partially replace the navy's thirteen Type 23 frigates and will be a multi-mission warship designed to support anti-submarine warfare, air defence and general-purpose operations. HMS Glasgow has a range in excess of 7,000 nautical miles and can hold more than 200 crew. It is armed with 48-cell VLS Sea Ceptor anti-air missiles and has 24-cell Mark 41 VLS for Tomahawk, ASROC and anti-ship missiles. The giant frigate also comes armed with a number of guns - a 5-inch 62-calibre Mk 45 naval gun; two 30 mm DS30M Mk2 guns; two Phalanx CIWS; two miniguns and four general purpose machine guns. It carries the Wildcat aircraft (armed with four anti-ship missiles or two anti-submarine torpedoes) and the AgustaWestland Merlin (armed with four anti-submarine torpedoes. HMS Glasgow can accommodate two helicopters and has a large Chinook-capable flight deck UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: ""HMS Glasgow entering the water for the first time marks a major milestone for the Type 26 programme which supports thousands of highly skilled jobs in Scotland and more across the wider UK supply chain. ""We’re continuing to invest in the British shipbuilding industry to maintain the Royal Navy’s cutting-edge ability to defend our nation, while strengthening our partnership with allies."" UK Naval Regional Commander Brig. Andy Muddiman explained during the event: ""The floating of HMS Glasgow today represents an important milestone in the build of the Royal Navy’s latest anti-submarine warfare frigate. This is the first of eight Type 26 frigates being built by BAE Systems in Glasgow. ""The Royal Navy’s exciting programme of ship building in Scotland, which includes five Type 31 general purpose frigates being built by Babcock International in Rosyth, will generate jobs, skills and economic benefits in Scotland for many years to come."" Several pictures of HMS Glasgow's floating ceremony were tweeted by the Royal Navy on Wednesday, writing alongside this: ""HMS Glasgow spent St Andrew's Day transiting the River Clyde for the first time. ""The first of the Type 26 frigates will ultimately be delivered to Scotstoun after completing the first stage of her construction at Govan shipyard. Today she passed the Titan Crane and Erskine Bridge."" BAE Systems Maritime shared a number of pictures and wrote: ""HMS Glasgow is on the move! She is now heading down river to enter the water for the first time before returning to Glasgow to our Scotstoun yard for further outfitting and test and commissioning. A momentous occasion for this First of Class Type 26."" This huge milestone comes after Rishi Sunak announced last month Britain will spent £4.2billion on five new frigates from BAE Systems to bolster security ""in the face of increased Russian threats"". The Prime Minister said in a Downing Street statement: ""The UK and allies are taking steps to bolster their security in the face of increased Russian threats. “Russia’s actions put all of us at risk. As we give the Ukrainian people the support they need, we are also harnessing the breadth and depth of UK expertise to protect ourselves and our allies. This includes building the next generation of British warships."" The huge spend is the next step in a programme under which three vessels are already under construction, and all eight frigates are expected to be completed by the mid-2030s. Separately, BAE Systems also confirmed the order of five more City Class Type 26 frigates, which the defence giant added would sustain 4,000 jobs across the company and the wider supply chain. BAE chief executive Charles Woodburn said: ""This contract secures a critical UK industry and allows us to build on our long history of shipbuilding as we continue to deliver cutting-edge equipment to the Royal Navy into the next decade.""",10

It will cover 1,000 miles over seven days and will be deployed by the Royal Navy as part of Project Cetus. The submarine is currently being built in Plymouth. UK Defence Secretary Mr Wallace said: “In order to meet the growing threats to our underwater infrastructure, the Royal Navy needs to be ahead of the competition with cutting-edge capabilities.” The submarine will be 12 metres long and will be battery-powered. First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ben Key called the project “a capability step-change in our mission to dominate the underwater battlespace”. UK armed forces chief Admiral Tony Radakin said Russian submarine threats to internet cables would be seen as an ""act of war"". It comes as the first of the Royal Navy's new frigates, HMS Glasgow, sailed down the River Clyde for the first time on Wednesday. She was escorted by Military of Defence Police from Clyde Marine Unit where she will eventually be lowered into the water for the first time. Scottish shipyards have orders to build 13 frigates, with the type 31 vessels being built by Babcock at Rosyth on the east coast and the Type 26 ships being constructed by BAE Systems on the Clyde. When HMS Glasgow touches water for the first time, she will be towed back up the Clyde to BAE Systems' yard at Scotstoun where the work to fit the warship will be completed. Last week, Mr Wallace visited the vessel in Glasgow while it was being rolled on to the barge. He told the PA news agency: ""I think it's a remarkable achievement by the workforce here, who've built basically the world's leading anti-submarine warfare ship."" READ MORE: Ukraine hits Russian troops in Donetsk using British M777 Howitzers Mr Wallace said the first Type 26 ship was coming out of the shipyard late but not ""catastrophically"" so, saying he is confident HMS Glasgow and the other frigates will enter service in time.

The B-21 Raider, which looks set to cost on almost $700million (£570million) per plane, is a dual aircraft that can launch conventional or nuclear weapons and is more advanced than any other intercontinental strategic bomber in the American arsenal. The plane marks the first aircraft to be unveiled in over 30 years. It will replace the B-1 and B-2, both of which have been in use for decades and have been involved in numerous conflicts. An image of the B-21, released on the US Air Force’s Twitter page, has been likened to a flying saucer due to its shape, but a lot of the specific details of the plane are being kept a secret. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin unveiled the Pentagon’s super secret new bomber at Northrop Grumman’s plant on Friday. Northrop Grumman, the firm chosen to design the bomber, had been developing the top-secret programme at Palmdale in California. But while much of the information about the aircraft is classified, it is still understood that its capabilities far surpass the existing bombers in the US fleet. The aircraft is reportedly capable of flying up to 6,000 miles before requiring refuelling, meaning it can hit targets deep behind enemy lines. The B-21 also has a 15-ton payload, while its super stealthy abilities also make it almost impossible for even the most advance air defences to sniff out. According to Northrop Grumman, the B-21 Raider is the “most advanced military aircraft ever built”. Doug Young, vice-president of Northrop Grumman’s strike division, said at an air, space and cyber conference, said at an airspace conference last week: “With the capability to hold targets at risk anywhere in the world, this weapon system is critical to our national security. “ The company has also said: “Developed with the next generation of stealth technology, advanced networking capabilities and an open systems architecture, the B-21 is optimized for the high-end threat environment.” According to the US Air Force, the stealthy plane will be the “backbone” of the fate Air Force bomber force. It said on Twitter: “Unveiled today, the B-21 Raider will be a dual-capable, penetrating-strike stealth bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear munitions. The B-21 will form the backbone of the future Air Force bomber force consisting of B-21s and B-52s.” The aircraft is named after the April 1942 Doolittle Raid led by Lt. Col. James “Jimmy” Doolittle, which demonstrated the US’ was the first American air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. The B-2, the former model, has been used in nearly every conflict that the US has been involved over the last few years, from Kosovo to Iraq and Afghanistan. The older model was also capable of carrying both precision-guided conventional and nuclear bomb payloads, but the B-21 has a number of new capabilities. For instance, the new aircraft reportedly has the potential for unmanned flight, allowing pilots to fly it from American soil remotely. Analysts have also said that other changes would likely include advanced materials used in coatings to make the bomber more difficult to detect. The aircraft is also expected to use new propulsion technologies and new ways to control electronic emissions. Mr Austin, speaking at the craft’s big reveal, said that “50 years of advances in low-observable technology have gone into this aircraft”. He added: “America’s defence will always be rooted in deterring conflict. So, we are again making it plain to any potential foe: the risks and costs of aggression far outweigh any conceivable gains.” This comes after former Air Force secretary Deborah Lee James, who held the position when the Raider contract was announced in 2015, said that a new bomber is needed to counter the potential future threats from Russia and China. She said: ""We needed a new bomber for the 21st Century that would allow us to take on much more complicated threats, like the threats that we fear we would one day face from China, Russia.” While it is not exactly clear when the Air Force will decide to deploy the new plane, military analysts have speculated that the first one could enter operations by 2026 or 2027.",10
2022-12-07,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1706530/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-starshield-military-programme-thwart-putin-russia-invasion,Elon Musk unveils SpaceX' new military 'Starshield' programme to thwart Russia's invasion,"SpaceX, Elon Musk's space company, has unveiled a new satellite project that could be used to thwart Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The company's new Starshield programme will be used in the national security sector and will use the space firm's massive Starlink satellite technology. Starlink is Mr Musk's satellite constellation service, which over the past year, has played a critical role in Kyiv's defence by granting them internet access. These satellites have been deployed in settings from governmental buildings, hospitals and schools — to help to control drones used to combat the invading Russian forces. On their new webpage, SpaceX said: ""Starshield leverages SpaceX's Starlink technology and launch capability to support national security efforts."" They added that while Starlink is designed for consumer and commercial use, Starshield is designed for government use, with an initial focus on three areas. These areas include Earth Observation, where Starshield will launch satellites with sensing payloads and delivers processed data directly to the user. They added that the project will also provide ""assured global communications to government users"" with Starshield user equipment, and will build satellite buses to ""support the most demanding customer payload missions."" According to SpaceX, Starshield will offer a higher level of security than Starlink, which currently gives its users end-to-end user data encryption. They said that the project will feature ""additional high-assurance cryptographic capability to host classified payloads and process data securely, meeting the most demanding government requirements."" Satellites launched as part of Starshied will be capable of integrating a wide variety of payloads, ""offering unique versatility to users"", and will be able to ""meet diverse mission requirements. They noted that Starlink's inter-satellite laser communications terminal, which is the only communications laser operating at scale in orbit today, can be integrated onto partner satellites to enable incorporation into the Starshield network. SpaceX added that with ""the proven ability to iterate rapidly"", their ""unique full-stack approach in developing end-to-end systems, from launch vehicles to user terminals, enables the deployment of capabilities at scale with unprecedented speed."" Like Starlink, Starshield will be working in low Earth orbit, which provides them ""inherent resiliency and constant connectivity to on-orbit assets"". Meanwhile, the company's rapid launch capabilities will offer government agencies ""expedient and economical access to space."" Their website also says: ""SpaceX's ongoing work with the Department of Defense and other partners demonstrates our ability to provide in-space and on-ground capability at scale."" Deployed by the US National Security agencies, and using Starlink's satellite technology, the Starshield programme could play a fresh role in supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion. Elon Musk's support of Ukraine has prompted fury from the Kremlin, with senior foreign ministry official Konstantin Vorontsov warning that such commercial space systems could risk becoming legitimate military targets if they continue to work with Ukraine. Speaking at a meeting of the UN's committee on disarmament and international security, Mr Vorontsov said: ""We would like to specifically stress an extremely dangerous trend that goes beyond the harmless use of outer space technologies and has become apparent during the latest developments in Ukraine. ""Namely, the use by the United States and its allies of civilian, including commercial, infrastructure elements in outer space for military purposes. ""Apparently, these States do not realise that such actions in fact constitute indirect participation in military conflicts. Quasi-civilian infrastructure may be a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike. ""Western actions needlessly put at risk the sustainability of peaceful space activities, as well as numerous social and economic processes on Earth that affect the well-being of people, first of all in developing countries.""",10
2022-12-17,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1710632/Russian-scientists-new-pandemic-fears-virus-coronavirus,Russian scientists' researching prehistoric viruses sparks fears of new pandemic outbreak,"Russian scientists in the heart of Siberia have been working to reawaken ancient viruses to determine how they evolve, sparking fears that a mishap could trigger another pandemic. In light of the widespread suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped from a virus research facility in Wuhan, China, western scientists, who have had little to no communication with their Russian counterparts since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, fear that the Russian lab in question is “not up to date” and handling these viruses negligently. Within the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR, also known as the Vector Institute in central Russia, scientists have been analysing the remains of mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses and other Ice Age animals that were perfectly preserved within a region in Siberia. The scientists are believed to be carrying out the research to identify and revive prehistoric viruses, also known as paleoviruses. They have been conducting the research through the analysis of Ice Age-era animals that had been perfectly preserved in the frozen earth of Yakutia, a vast region in northeast Siberia. The woolly mammoths and rhinoceroses were found in the region where temperatures can plummet as low as -55C. But western scientists have expressed concern about the quality of the care within the research centre, especially given how potentially dangerous the viruses could be. Professor Jean-Michel Claverie, from the National Centre of Scientific Research at the University of Aix-Marseille, said the work being done by the Russian scientists was “very, very risky”. He said: “The Vector research is very, very risky. Our immune systems have never encountered these types of viruses. Some of them could be 200,000 or even 400,000 years old.” He also warned that the viruses at risk of being revived would have killed mammoths and would be able to infect humans. A similar project was undertaken by French scientists, who made headlines last month for announcing that they had revived a “zombie” virus that had been under a lake bed in Yakutia for almost 50,000 years. But the French researchers said their discovery was an amoeba-infecting virus and was of little danger to animals or humans. This is distinct from what is believed about the research by Russia, which could have devastating effects on humans. The Russian scientists have been accused of “gain-of-function” virology, which is aimed at creating a deadlier strain of a pathogen for research purposes. Justification for the practice ranges from a desire to expand scientific knowledge to help tackle future outbreaks to becoming aware of previously unknown viruses before they get released as climate change melts the Arctic and Siberia. Some believe that it is not a risk worth taking, however, and that there is not “enough discussion” about the societal implications. Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert at King’s College London, said: “There isn’t enough discussion around whether we as a society today are willing to take those risks.” The Vector State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology is one of 59 maximum-security biolabs in the world and is a former Soviet biological weapons laboratory. It is also one of only two sites that are allowed to keep samples of the deadly smallpox virus, with the other in the United States. In 2019, a mandatory inspection by the World Health Organisation found no significant concerns but the WHO team was unable to observe the researchers conducting practical work as the facility was closed for “scheduled maintenance”. Mr Clavarie said: “I would not be very confident that everything [at Vector] is up to date.”",10
2022-12-21,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1712284/russia-china-agreement-moon-base-lunar-station-roscosmos-cnsa,Russia and China strike new partnership to build joint base on the Moon by 2035,"Russia and China have signed a formal agreement to jointly explore the Moon and construct a scientific base on the lunar surface by the year 2035. The arrangement was announced today by Yury Borisov, the head of the Russian state space corporation, Roscosmos, on the state-owned news network Russia-24. The news follows the announcement on December 5 this year by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin that the intergovernmental agreement between the two powers had been prepared for signing. Mr Borisov told Russia 24: “After a detailed analysis of the landing area by automatic probes, soil sampling and research into the presence of water, we will switch over to the next phase.” “This will involve building a future lunar base,” he added, “most likely in close contact with our Chinese partners.” The Roscosmos and the China National Space Administration (CNSA) have already unveiled a roadmap for the development of an international scientific lunar station. This was revealed back on June 16 last year at the Global Space Exploration Conference 2021, which was held in St Petersburg, Russia. Under this roadmap, construction of the international lunar station is expected to be completed by the year 2035. Before this time, Russia and China are planning two missions between 2026 and 2030 to test technologies for both landing on the Moon and delivering cargo to its surface, as well as collecting lunar soil samples and transporting them back to Earth. The two nations are also looking to develop infrastructure both in lunar orbit and on the Moon’s surface between 2031 and 2035. These installations will include communications systems, power facilities, research equipment and more. The roadmap also proposes the creation of a number of lunar rovers that will conduct research, explore the Moon’s surface and service the fixed infrastructure. One rover, it is understood, will move not on wheels but via a hopping motion, allowing it to traverse a wider range of lunar terrains. Back in September this year, Mr Borisov had said that “projects of this kind alone, even by such countries as Russia, are difficult to implement from the financial point of view of having all the necessary competencies.” “Such projects require the widest possible international cooperation”, he said at the Russian Society of Knowledge’s Federal Education Marathon. On December 15, 2021, former Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin said that key to the Russo-Chinese project to build a lunar station would be the equality of the two partner nations. He went on to add that it was the absence of such balance that led to Russia’s exit from the American Lunar Gateway space station project. Russian collaboration with other nations in the space arena has been damaged by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year — with the European Space Agency notably having suspended collaboration with Roscosmos on the ExoMars mission. Roscosmos deputy head for international cooperation, Sergei Savelyev, has said that the collaboration between Russia and China would not exclude the participation of private firms in the lunar station project.",10
2022-12-23,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1713295/russia-iss-international-space-station-leak-crew-capsule-ms-22-stranded-rescue,Russia poised to send rescue ship to ISS after cosmonauts stranded with capsule leak,"Russia is assessing the flight-worthiness of the Soyuz crew capsule docked with the International Space Station (ISS) that sprang a coolant leak Wednesday last week. The leak, which was spotted by ground staff on external video footage from the station, caused the temperature in the crew section of the capsule to rise to 86F (30C) and the equipment section as high as 104F (40C). In a press conference yesterday, officials said that it may become necessary to send up a rescue vessel to bring back essentially stranded crew members. There are presently seven astronauts aboard the ISS. If the leaky MS-22 capsule is deemed unfit for crewed flight, it would mean that the orbital laboratory only has one viable “lifeboat” capable of carrying four people in the event an emergency evacuation is needed. Sergei Krikalev — the Russian State Space Corporation (Roscosmos) Executive Director for Human Space Programs — said that the damage to the capsule is being assessed. A thermal analysis of the cabin temperature will determine if MS-22 is safe to carry astronauts back down to the Earth’s surface. If it proves to be unfit for purpose, Roscosmos will likely advance the launch of another Soyuz capsule from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in southern Kazakhstan — but send it up uncrewed to pick up the astronauts that were supposed to return with MS-22. NASA’s ISS programme manager Joel Montalbano said: “They’re looking at late February to send up the next Soyuz vehicle. MS-22 ferried both Russian cosmonauts Dmitry Petelin and Sergey Prokopyev, as well the NASA astronaut Frank Rubia up to the ISS back in September. They were joined by Josh Cassada and Nicole Mann of the USA, Japan’s Koichi Wakata and Anna Kikina of Russia, who arrived on a SpaceX Crew Dragon in October. A spacewalk scheduled for Wednesday last week to upgrade the ISS’s solar arrays was postponed until yesterday in light of the capsule’s leak. If it turns out that MS-22 cannot take its crew back to Earth safely, then the capsule will be sent on its return journey on its own. The hole in the MS-22 capsule that caused the coolant to escape has been estimated to be just 0.03 inches across — too small to have been tracked from the ground. Last week, Mr Krikalev said that the leak may have been caused by a meteorite striking one of the external radiators of the Soyuz capsule. NASA emphasised last week that “none of the crew members aboard the space station was in danger, and all conducted normal operations throughout the day.” The detection of the leak in the MS-22 capsule happened to coincide with the peak of the Geminid meteor shower last week — although experts have ruled this to be a coincidence, as the hull was penetrated from the wrong direction for the Geminids. Mr Montalbano added: “We did look at the meteor showers that were occurring. Both the trajectory team in Houston and the trajectory team in Moscow confirmed it was not from the meteor showers. “We got some work to do with imagery to better understand if it was a meteoroid hit or if there was a hardware issue, and that work is in front of us.” Another possibility is that the hole was punched in the MS-22 capsule by a small but fast moving piece of space junk in low-Earth orbit. Elsewhere in space news, earlier this week Russia and China signed a formal agreement to jointly explore the Moon and construct a scientific base on the lunar surface by 2035.",10
2022-12-26,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1714106/russia-war-in-ukraine-hypersonic-cruise-missiles-vladimir-putin,Russia to arm warplanes with new hypersonic cruise missiles in Ukraine war escalation,"Russia is preparing to equip its air force with hypersonic cruise missiles in its latest efforts to reverse the course of the conflict in Ukraine. After months of having to retreat from Ukrainian counter offensives, Russia is resorting to doubling down on its use of deadly hypersonic cruise missiles, according to reports by a Russian commander. The air-launched hypersonic bombs are considerably more difficult to stop owing to their speed, their proximity to the ground and the fact that their flight path can be altered after launch. The missiles, which use scramjet engines to fly at roughly five times the speed of sound, will likely be used to continue the brutal Russian assault on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. China, the US and Russia are locked in an arms race to develop and deploy these weapons, while other nations, including Iran, North Korea and Japan, are working on smaller-scale programmes. Russian state media outlet Interfax quoted Russian air commander Sergei Kobylash saying their hypersonic missiles were now being supplied to the air forces to be primed for combat. He said: “In the interests of long-range aviation, the development and supply of the entire range of aviation weapons, including new cruise hypersonic missiles, is being carried out.” Having already used the weapons a handful of times in Ukraine, their continued use will afford Russia extra information in the race to further develop and perfect these missiles. In August, Russia deployed hypersonic Kinzhal (Dagger) missiles three times in Ukraine, according to defence minister Sergei Shoigu. Vladimir Putin presented the various hypersonic missiles in 2018, claiming that they could hit almost any point in the world and evade a US-built missile shield. Such a prospect of Russian hypersonic missiles facing off against US air defence systems now looks foreseeable as Ukraine prepares to have US-supplied Patriot missiles operational within six months. Training on how to use the state-of-the-art air defence Patriot missile systems usually takes more than a year. But Russia’s continued assault on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, as well as the prospect of Putin utilising, again, the array of hypersonic missiles at his disposal, prompted the US to heed Ukrainian calls for the Patriot missiles. A day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited US President Joe Biden, in part to discuss the supply of air defence systems, Vladimir Putin pledged to do “whatever it takes” to achieve success in the war. He emphasised that resources will be funnelled into nuclear forces, which he described as “the main guarantee of Russia’s sovereignty”, and that more hypersonic missiles will be primed. A hypersonic missile differs from a conventional missile as it travels much closer to the earth, eliminating the arch into the atmosphere. The latter travels out of the atmosphere before dropping back to earth directly over its target. Hypersonic missiles travel at five times the speed of sound (3,852mph) and are highly manoeuvrable, making them hard to predict, track and destroy. John Hyten, former vice chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and former commander of US Strategic Command General, said they could enable “responsive, long-range, strike options against distant, defended, and/or time-critical threats [such as road-mobile missiles] when other forces are unavailable, denied access, or not preferred.” There are three main types of hypersonic weaponry: aero-ballistic, glide vehicles and cruise missiles. Aero-ballistic systems are dropped from aircraft; hypersonic glide vehicles are launched from a rocket before gliding to a target, and hypersonic cruise missiles are powered by high-speed, air-breathing engines during flight.",10
2022-12-29,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1714786/scientist-virus-russia-mammoth-vector-research-ice-age-latest-world-news-ont,Scientists alarmed over Russia’s ‘risky’ attempt to awaken virus that killed mammoths,"These prehistoric viruses are thought to be up to 400,000 years old and have remained dormant in the frozen remains of woolly mammoths found in Yakutia, Russia, where temperatures can plummet to -55C. This research is being conducted by the Russian Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology. The Russian lab, also known as Vector aims to understand how viruses evolve by studying such diseases. The project is being overseen at a former bioweapons lab in Russia's Novosibirsk region, but Vector hosts 59 maximum security biolabs around the world. Russian researchers hope to identify the ice age viruses, also named paleoviruses, and revive them. However, experts have raised concerns over the research, describing it as “risky” and confessing to a lack of confidence in the research facility. Professor Jean-Michel Claverie, from the National Centre of Scientific Research at the University of Aix-Marseille recently spoke with the Times to express his alarm. He said: “[Vector's research] is terrible. I'm totally against it. “[It] is very, very risky. Our immune systems have never encountered these type of viruses. Some of them could be 200,000 or even 400,000 years old. “But ancient viruses that infected animals or humans could still be infectious.” As for trusting Vector’s biosecurity, the scientist added: ""I would not be very confident that everything is up to date."" The World Health Organization found no significant concern during their most recent inspection of the facility in 2019, but the facility has had incidences in the past. In 2019, a gas explosion caused a fire at a Vector facility, which caused one worker to be left with third-degree burns from the blast. It also caused windows to shatter, but at the time Vector said: ""no work with biological materials was going on"". Another incident at a Vector lab happened in 2014 when a researcher died after accidentally pricking herself with a needle containing the Ebola virus. During the Soviet era in 1979, one of Vector’s military research facilities accidentally released spores of anthrax bacteria in the city of Sverdlovsk (now named Yekaterinburg). The deadly outbreak killed at least 66 people, although Soviet authorities denied for years that such an incident had taken place and blamed the deaths on the consumption of tainted meat. Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert at King’s College London, has warned that even the most secure laboratories can be breached. She said: “Many of us who are analysing and following what they’re doing aren’t convinced that the potential benefits, which are in the far distant future, are necessarily outweighing the very real risks that are in the present. “Even with generally safe practices, accidents can still happen.”",10
